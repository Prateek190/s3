0,2018-01-01,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity markets are likely to open in the red on Monday, tracking Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX Nifty) and global cues. 

 At 7.55 am (IST), Nifty futures on SGX were trading 34 points, or 0.32 per cent, down at 10,524, indicating a weak start for the Nifty50. 

Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session: 


Auto stocks: Shares of auto companies will remain in focus as auto companies will start declaring monthly sales numbers for December 2017. Many auto makers had offered huge year-end discounts during the month, the impact of which is to be seen on sales data later in the day.


Britannia Industries: Biscuit maker Britannia has started selling chocolate wafers, competing with brands such as Nestle’s Kit Kat. The company has extended its Pure Magic biscuit brand to chocolate wafers, in the format of slabs of chocolate on top of biscuits.


IDBI Bank: Public sector IDBI Bank has received capital infusion of Rs 2,729 crore from the government.

Lupin: 
Foreign brokerage UBS said that the near-term headwinds for Lupin will continue. Key US launches likely from FY19-end, it said adding that the pricing environment remains tough. The brokerage has 'buy' recommendation on the stock with a target of Rs 970.


Bajaj Group stocks: The Bajaj Group’s promoters have initiated the process of passing on their wealth to the younger generation as part of succession planning by realigning their ownership through the purchase and sale of stock in various listed group companies among themselves. The trades took place last week among Madhur Bajaj and his wife Kumud; Nirav Bajaj, son of Niraj Bajaj; and Anant Bajaj, son of Bajaj Electricals chairman Shekhar Bajaj. More such swaps are likely.

Bank of Baroda: The lender failed to sell bad loans amounting to Rs 2,300 crore last week due from Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel as the reserve price was above market rates and only overseas investors and private equity funds were allowed to bid, said two senior bank executives.

Coal India: Coal India will auction long-term coal supply contracts to electricity generation plants that do not have power purchase agreements on January 15, a company official said. The offer is for about 15 million tonnes of coal, which will be supplied after the utilities sign power purchase agreementswithelectricity distribution companies.

SAIL: The joint venture agreement between Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and ArcelorMittal will have a non-compete clause to protect the interest of the proposed firm, says the state-run firm’s chairman PK Singh. 


Mphasis: HSBC has maintained hold rating on Mphasis and revised target price to Rs 680 from Rs 555. The brokerage said it has increased target price on MphasiS as it has increased the valuation multiple to 16 times 12-month forward earnings given its confidence in the company’s long term growth outlook driven by strong deal wins and improved HP/DXC business outlook. 


KEC International: Kotak Institutional Equities has retained ‘add’ rating on KEC International and revised target price to Rs 405 from Rs 345. The brokerage said its recent meeting with the management of KEC International highlighted the company’s increasing focus on profitability and return ratios."
1,2018-01-01,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Biscuit maker Britannia has forayed in the chocolate space, extending its Pure Magic biscuit brand to a format of slabs of chocolate on top of biscuits.

“This marks our first time in the real chocolate space and we will retail the product accordingly, with the main focus on modern retail and ecommerce,” Britannia VP marketing Ali Harris Shere said.

The product was launched in Bengaluru and is now being taken to the national level.

“We have started to take risks with innovations. The last very big innovation in biscuits was ITC’s Sunfeast. We believe our new product is the next big disruptor in the category,” Shere said.

Pure Magic is a smaller brand for Britannia than its Good Day and Marie Gold range of biscuits.

“There has been a slackening of biscuit consumption among youth and we believe the new brand under Pure Magic will bring back young adults,” he said. Britannia has a current share of over 30% in the Rs 27,000 crore category, industry officials quoting data from research firm Nielsen said. The company competes with Parle and ITC in biscuits.

 The chocolate category, too, has been facing headwinds, with consumers holding on to discretionary spending on account of slowing sales in rural markets and impulse purchases being impacted by demonetisation, analysts said.
“Confectionery products are largely cash-driven, impulse purchases and the cash-crunch created during demonetisation started in November 2016 partially contributed to the slowdown in confectionary consumption,” Apoorva Nema, consumer markets analyst at digital research firm GlobalData, said in November.

“This is the time to take a leap forward on some strategic initiatives,” Britannia managing director Varun Berry had said at an earnings conference with analysts in November. “One of these is about entering new product categories to become a total foods company.”
He said the other two initiatives would be to make sure the company caters to smaller businesses in a way that they get the required focus and to enter new territories internationally, targeting one new geography every year.

Britannia, which reported an 11.5% increase in net profit to Rs 261 crore for the quarter ended September, has identified driving premium products, stepping up distribution and attaining cost leadership as core focus areas. 

Berry added that while double-digit revenue growth in the quarter was a given for most companies because of the base effect of demonetisation in 2016, he was not confident of sustained double-digit growth yet. “But having said that, everything seems to be moving in the right direction,” he said."

I hold 7,000 shares of Idea Cellular at Rs 111. Please suggest your view on the stock. — ROHIT AGGARWAL
Sell around Rs 125, as peaking out of mobile penetration and intensive competition in this oligopolistic market would continue to pressurise the margins of IDEA in the near future.

I hold 107,150 shares of Shree AshtaVinayak Cine Vision at Rs 3.82. Will you please help me how to recover the loss? — VEERINDER PRATAP
After the dematerialisation of shares became successful, there is no hope for recovering any money by selling physical shares of suspended companies to the waste paper vendor also. Kindly take it as a lesson to invest in quality stocks based on management quality, valuation comfort and balance sheet strength.


I would like to invest in Tata Global, Maruti, IGL and City Union Bank for 5 years. Please suggest if I can go ahead with this or any other stocks in these sectors you suggest? — MUNISH SAHGAL
Maruti and IGL are good to invest for the 5-year period. Instead of Tata Global, consider Britannia Industries, and South Indian Bank in place for City Union Bank for the long-term investments.


I bought 100 shares of Gati at Rs 148, 50 of Hudco at Rs 44, and 100 shares of Kridhan Infra at Rs 80. Kindly advise whether to hold or sell?—RK GUPTAHold GATI with a target price of around Rs 150 and also Hudco with a target price of around Rs 95. However, Kridhan Infra trades at fair valuation of over 22 times FY2018 expected earnings, hence, sell the stock on any further rise.


I hold REC at Rs 167, Mirza International at Rs 162 and Karur Vysya Bank at 120. I am a long-term investor. Please suggest me about that. SURENDERA SINGH RANA
Hold both REC and Karur Vysya Bank as significant correction in their stock prices in the recent time make them quite attractive at current prices. Sell Mirza International around Rs 173, which is a fair price for the stock (17x FY2019 expected earnings).


I hold HCL Tech at Rs 982. Please suggest a suitable position. — MANASVI MANKAD
Hold HCL Tech with a target price of around Rs 1,000, as in this solid bull market this stock is still trading only around 14 PE on current year’s expected earnings.


I have 2,000 shares of IDFC at Rs 62.9. Tell me about its future.— TRIVEDI ANJAN
You may continue to hold IDFC as its investee company IDFC Bank trades at attractive valuation and has the potential to appreciate significantly.


I have 500 shares of LEEL Electricals bought at Rs 273. What is your viewRs — PRIYANKA SUREDDI
You may hold LEEL (new name of Llyod Electric) as it has emerged as almost zerodebt company (net of cash) after selling consumer durable business and remaining two business segments also have some value-unlocking potential.

11,2018-01-12,Britannia,"NEW DELHI:French foods maker Danone is exiting its dairy portfolio in India, seven years after it entered the category dominated by Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)-owned Amul and Mother Dairy, besides Nestle and Britannia. While India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of dairy, Danone’s dairy business could not compete with bigger players and has remained a non-starter.

Danone’s fresh dairy portfolio in India included dahi, mishti dahi and flavoured yoghurts, and the UHT portfolio comprised of UHT Milk, buttermilk, lassi, cold coffee and smoothies. A company spokesperson confirmed the development. “Danone has decided to rationalise its product portfolio in India to allow for accelerated investments and a sharper focus on growing its nutrition portfolio which is more than 90% of the business, and where the company already enjoys leadership position,” the spokesperson said.

Danone had entered the dairy business after breaking up its troubled joint venture with Britannia in 2010. Its factory at Rai near Delhi manufacturing discontinued products will stop production. Danone’s other factory in Punjab, manufacturing infant nutrition products will continue to function, the company said.

Danone will exit products which have been making a minority contribution to its overall business in India which include the UHT and fresh dairy products. “We have great ambitions for our business in India and remain committed to invest and grow in India through well-established brands such as Protinex, Aptamil, Farex, Dexolac and Neocate.”"

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex spurted 75 per cent during this period, with TVS Motor soaring 1,486 per cent to Rs 768 on January 10, 2018 from Rs 48 on the same day in 2013. 

It was followed by non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, which rose 1,223 per cent to Rs 1,800 from Rs 136. Vakrangee advanced over 1,200 per cent in the same period.

Other stocks that advanced over 5 times in last five years included Eicher Motors (up 906 per cent), Britannia Industries (up 842 per cent), Aurobindo Pharma (up 606 per cent), Motherson Sumi (up 539 per cent).

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher are positive on Britannia and Aurobindo Pharma with price targets of Rs 5,226 and Rs 877, respectively.

Market experts believe Britannia is on the cusp of significant profit growth thanks to a gradual recovery in volume growth, strong tailwinds from the decline in sugar prices and SMP even as wheat and palm oil prices remained stable and competitive advantage after higher GST rate prompted Parle to increase prices. Sustained gains from cost efficiency programmes in the coming quarters will also boost bottom lines. The company’s product portfolio remained robust and re-launch of Treat has been received well in the market. 

Brokerage Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Motherson Sumi with a target price of Rs 459. The scrip traded at Rs 379 on January 17.

“Motherson Sumi offers strong earnings visibility along with improving capital efficiencies. We estimate the company’s consolidated revenues, Ebitda and PAT to grow 22 per cent, 30 per cent and 33.5 per cent CAGR, respectively, during FY17-20E,” the brokerage said.

Shares of Maruti Suzuki, HPCL, Bharat Forge, UPL, Bajaj Finserv and MRF jumped between 430 per cent and 500 per cent between January 2013 and January 2018.

Motilal Oswal is also positive on the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 11,026. Nirmal Bang Securities has a ‘sell’ rating on HPCL with a target price of Rs 321.

Most of the largecaps on the list have been reporting a rise in bottomline numbers year after year. For instance, Maruti Suzuki’s profit grew from Rs 2,469 crore in FY13 to Rs 7,511 crore in FY17. It posted profit numbers of Rs 2,852 crore, Rs 3,807 crore and Rs 5,497 crore for FY14, FY15 and FY16, respectively.

Motherson Sumi, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Eicher Motors, Vakrangee, Aurobindo Pharma, TVS Motor and Bajaj Finserv have also reported sustainable PAT growth during this period.

The BSE Smallcap and Midcap indices climbed 163 per cent and 149 per cent, respectively, during this period. With 7,980 per cent and 5,925 per cent returns, Avanti Feeds and Fiberweb (India) stood among the top gainers in the smallcap space.

At present, BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are hovering at levels never seen before. Market experts are bullish about further movement in these stocks. 

“We expect volatility to increase in the Indian stock market in 2018, as corporate earnings growth expectations seem to have built in some optimism. On the contrary, with market valuation at around 17 times FY19E consensus earnings, the downside is expected to be limited. We expect Sensex and Nifty to be closer to 37,500 and 11,500, respectively, in 2018,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Securities."

16,2018-01-18,Britannia,"Former MD of Britannia Industries, Vinita Bali thinks India's population is a bane, not a boon  India’s young population has often been hailed as one of its greatest strengths in the current scenario. However, at a recent event, the former MD of Britannia Industries, Vinita Bali, presented an alternate view.  “We believe that demography is going to be a dividend for us. In fact, I think it’s going to be the biggest liability if we don’t take serious note of the situation that we are faced with, whether it is the health, the nutrition or the water and food of everybody, more so of women and children,” she said. Bali shared numbers during her address to back up her view. Even today, over 235 million people go to sleep on an empty stomach, she said. One in five children born is malnourished.  “We are a society which is still desirous of having a male child. There are many reasons to recognise the accomplishments of not just men or of women, but of men and women. That is the only way in which we will create a society that is equitable, that is fair and just,” she said in conclusion, speaking of an eternal hope to live in an equal world."

20,2018-01-25,Britannia,"Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), India’s largest domestic institutional investor, was busy shopping on Dalal Street all through December quarter and handpicked shares from across the sectors such as banking and financial services, FMCG, upstream and downstream oil and gas, ports as well as IT. 

Among the largecaps, LIC increased its holding in IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to 4.17 per cent as of December 31, 2017 from 4.03 per cent as of September 30, 2017. 

TCS posted 1.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase in net profit at Rs 6,531 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, largely meeting Street estimates. 

LIC also increased holdings in Sun Pharma (from 4.36 per cent to 5.53 per cent) and Punjab National Bank (from 12.20 per cent to 13.94 per cent). 

In the FMCG space, it bought into Britannia and Hindustan Unilever (HUL), raising its holdings in the two firms from 3.53 per cent and 2.08 per cent to 3.79 per cent and 2.55 per cent, respectively.

HUL reported a 27.74 per cent jump in December quarter profit at Rs 1,326 crore on volume growth and margin improvement across categories. The company had posted Rs 1,038 crore profit for the October-December quarter a year ago.

Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, says HUL’s volume growth number was better than Street estimate as there was a pick-up of close to 6 per cent in realisations. The brand extension of Ayush as well as Indulekha can yield results in terms of new brands being created, and the market rewarding it.

“If you look at competition vis-a-vis Patanjali, the intensity is reducing. On the detergents side, one can see margin improvement. So, there has been some kind of price improvement. We would recommend an ‘add’ rating on HUL with a target of close to Rs 1,450,” Sofat said.

Overall, LIC hiked its stake in 40 companies in Q3. From the listed universe, it has investments in more than 200 companies from those listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), data available with corporate database Capitaline showed.




Among the upstream and downstream oil companies, LIC took its stake in BPCL to 3.46 per cent at the end of Q3 from 2.43 per cent in Q2FY18. It also increased holdings in ONGC and Oil India to 9.23 per cent and 11.27 per cent, respectively, from 9.20 per cent and 11.07 per cent in the year-ago period.

On January 20, ONGC announced the acquisition of government’s entire 51.11 per cent stake in refiner HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, paying a premium of over 10 per cent. Shares ONGC surged more than 3 per cent on the bourses on January 22.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes this acquisition will bring synergies in terms of larger balance sheet to take on overseas assets, better funding for HPCL’s projects, lesser volatility in ONGC’s earnings and most to fend off possible competition from private players in marketing of auto fuels if there is any threat to margins. 

“The lower-than-expected premium also does not put any overdue pressure on ONGC’s balance sheet. We continue to recommend ‘Buy’ rating on HPCL with a target of Rs 576. There is no significant change in valuation of ONGC eigher. We reiterate ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 234,” Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Rating agencies ICRA, CARE and Crisil too remained LIC’s favourites. Its stake in ICRA jumped to 7.45 per cent at the end of October-December 2017 from 6.75 per cent in the July-September period. It hiked stake in CARE Ratings and Crisil to 9.85 per cent and 5.45 per cent from 9.78 per cent and 4.68 per cent earlier.

Adani Ports, Asian Ports, Bajaj Finserv, Bharat Forge, Castrol India, Rajesh Exports, Marico, Lupin, Zydus Wellness, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and UltraTech Cement were other companies that managed to attract LIC investment in Q3 FY18.

On the other hand, LIC dumped shares of Bajaj Auto, Bank of Baroda, Balrampur Chini, Cipla, ICICI Bank, MMTC, NBCC, Mastek, Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Copper, Volta, Vijaya Bank, Welspun Enterprises and Videocon Industries."

Atul Nishar Founder and chairman, Hexaware Technologies




 “The India of my dreams will be a country where people are among the happiest. For this to happen, 22 per cent of people living below the poverty line will have to be uplifted and literacy figures will have to move up. No child should go hungry, no sick person should go untreated and the country’s unemployment should reduce considerably. To achieve this, we need disruptive solutions. We can address these issues by the effective use of technology. Technology interventions in education will ensure job readiness. Health care analytics, robotics and telemedicine will make health care accessible to all.”


Priti Rathi Gupta MD, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Ltd




 “In the coming years, I hope to see India at the helm of digitisation and new disruptive technologies. Flexi-working hours and location, paternity leave, collaborative execution, remote working, etc, are some of the modern-era business management trends that will shape a better business environment. I hope India consciously works towards being a pollution-free and clean nation, which prov ide s go o d sanitation and living conditions to all, uses renewable energy, and a place where health care and education is available to every individual. I dream of a country that ranks high on the happiness quotient.”


Harmanpreet Kaur Cricketer




 “PV Sindhu and Sakshi Malik’s Olympic medals are just a start of Indian women becoming equal in sports. Our team efforts and the support we received during the World Cup campaign also is a testimony of how women athletes are finally being taken seriously. I hope that India becomes a sports superpower and more women win and make a name for themselves. There is a lot more that needs to be done to encourage women in sports. I hope for a change in society and the mindset of people.”


Adhil Shetty Co-founder and CEO, BankBazaar.com




 “The India of tomorrow would be a country of technology-based paperless, presence-less processes, built on the promise of greater transparency, reach, and convenience. Online, digital and paperless will be the norm for just about everything, especially personal finance... The future belongs to digital finance, and it is right around the corner.”


Dilip Doshi CEO, Ambiar, and former Test cricketer




 “I think India is the mother of civilisation. It is also a melting pot. India, to me, is what life is all about. Where else can you see a society co-existing the way we do? People from every walk of life live together here. To me, India can be summed as an inspiration to the rest of the world. I look at India as a civilisation that should offer hope to the world. Meaning, we should live in harmony — people have to become more tolerant of each other and should aspire to improve their quality of life. The rest will fall in place.”


Vinita Bali Former MD, Britannia Industries




 “The India I envision is where there is equality of opportunity irrespective of your gender, your accent, your caste, your community, your religion. An India where we give emphasis to values of respect, trust, responsibility and compassion. A place where we celebrate not just scientific pursuits but also our critical heritage, resident in our arts and crafts. The India that I envisage is one that is vibrant and vivacious, not just in its urban cities but also its rural areas. A nation that plays a meaningful and positive role in its contribution to global economy, and the young are ambitious and aspire to do their best. The India we have today has a long way to go to get to the India that I envisage.”"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has delivered the election-year budget many expected.

With national polls looming next year -- and possibly as early as late 2018 -- Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has rolled out a budget designed to help distressed farmers and rural areas while boosting growth, jobs and private investment.

In this budget, India’s farmers and villagers, as well as companies with exposure to agriculture, emerge as the biggest winners. Bond investors might just be the biggest losers.


WINNERS



Farmers
Distressed farmers have been protesting across the country. This budget promises to raise the minimum price offered to farmers for crops, while investing heavily in agricultural markets across India. It also delivers more money for rural areas, including irrigation projects and aquaculture projects, and directs state governments to purchase extra solar power generated by farmers using solar-powered pumps. Agriculture-focused companies such as Shakti Pumps India Ltd., Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd., KSB Pumps Ltd., Kirloskar Brothers Ltd., Avanti Feeds Ltd., Waterbase Ltd., JK Agri Genetics Ltd., PI Industries Ltd. could benefit.


Health Care Providers
The government’s new flagship National Health Protection Scheme, which aims to insure as much as 500 million people for up to 500,000 rupees a year of care, could benefit companies such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd., India’s largest hospital company, as well as Fortis Healthcare Ltd.


Transport Companies
With Jaitley promising record infrastructure spending on roads and railways, construction and engineering firms, as well as train wagon-producers, could benefit. That includes Larsen & Toubro Ltd., Hindustan Construction Co Ltd., NCC Ltd., IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd., Dilip Buildcon Ltd., Titagarh Wagons Ltd., and Cimmco Ltd.


Consumer Companies
With boosted spending on India’s vast hinterland, fast-moving consumer goods companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Britannia Industries Ltd. and Marico Ltd. could benefit as day laborers get jobs and disposable income. Other companies with rural exposure include: Hero MotoCorp Ltd., Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., Larsen & Toubro Ltd.


Jewelers
With 60 percent of gold demand coming from rural India, the budget’s focus on boosting rural and farm incomes could benefit companies such as Titan Co Ltd., Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Ltd., PC Jeweller Ltd.


Airports
With the government pledging to expand regional airport construction, firms such as GMR Infrastructure Ltd. and GVK Power & Infrastructure Ltd. could benefit.


LOSERS



Bond Investors
Bond investors drew some relief from a lower than expected borrowing program. Nevertheless, the relief could prove short-lived. India missed its fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent, saying its targeting a 3.5 percent target for fiscal 2019. Big bond investors such as India’s state-owned banks could be hit as yields go even higher than the the 96 basis points they climbed in the past six months, the most in Asia. Shares of HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd., Axis Bank Ltd., State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank might be affected.


Financial Sector
The government’s decision to impose long-term capital gains tax on equity investments may dent investor sentiment for financial services companies, life insurers and providers of mutual fund products including IDFC Ltd., Reliance Capital Ltd., Aditya Birla Capital Ltd., ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co Ltd., HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co Ltd., General Insurance Corp of India


Defense Sector
Jaitley praised the armed forces and promised an industry-friendly policy to promote defense production as he addressed parliament. But there was no indication of a huge boost to defense spending. Companies such as Bharat Forge Ltd. may not see a boost."

3,2018-02-05,Britannia,"By JK JainWhere are We? The Index eroded major of the gains generated in the last few weeks and formed bearish Engulfing pattern at the peak of the recent up-move suggesting weakness is likely to continue in the near term. On the other hand, India VIX also gained more than 9% in Friday’s trade indicating volatility is likely to go higher in the coming sessions as well.


What is in Store? In the coming week, Nifty may continue to exhibit further weakness and may drift towards the previous breakout levels of 10,550-10,600 where major unfilled gaps are placed on the daily charts. On the derivative front, highest concentration of open interest in the puts is witnessed at 10,500 strike which is likely to act as the next crucial supports for the markets, while 11,000 levels may act as the psychological resistance. In the shorter term period, no major up-move is expected in the index until it decisively crosses 11,000 on the higher side.


What could Investors Do?We expect the current correction in the mid- and small-cap stocks to continue and recommend investors to avoid building any fresh long positions. While medium-term investors may start accumulating frontline large-cap stocks on declines. We remain bullish on the IT space, which may continue to be the flavour of the markets. Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech remain our top picks. Also, select defensive stocks in the FMCG space like HUL, ITC & Britannia will be our preferred bets for the near term. On the Index front, one can create short positions in the Nifty on any rallies keeping stop loss placed above 11,000 levels.

12,2018-02-11,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market witnessed highly volatile trade during the week gone by. Selloff on Wall Street amid fears of rising inflation, higher interest rates and a spike in US Treasury yields engulfed stock markets globally, including in India.

On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex shed 407 points to close at 34,006 while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) lost over 1 per cent, or 122 points, to settle at 10,455. On a weekly basis, the Nifty50 lost 2.84 per cent while the 30-share Sensex pack declined 3.02 per cent.

Among key highlights of the week, RBI kept the repo rate unchanged in its sixth bimonthly money policy review on Wednesday while maintaining a neutral stance. However, it did flag concerns on inflation.

From the earnings corner, country's largest public sector lender SBI took everyone by surprise when it reported a massive quarterly loss on the back of a spike in provisions towards bad loan and hardening of bond yields, which led to treasury losses. On the other hand, steel giant Tata Steel's Q3 net jumped five-fold to Rs 1,136 crore from Rs 232 crore reported for same period last year.

Here's a look at the events and triggers that may decide market direction next week. The market will remain closed on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, on account of Mahashivratri.


Global cues hold keyMovement in US stocks and in Asian markets will be watched keenly. On Friday, US equities ended higher, but posted their worst weekly loss in two years. The sharp falls of the week confirmed that the market was in a correction, down more than 10 per cent from its January 26 record high, and throwing the nearly nine-year-long bull market off course, said a Reuters report. The benchmark S&P500 fell 5.2 per cent for the week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. Asian indices such as Nikkei and Hang Seng also witnessed heavy selloff.


Nifty may rally when volatility easesNifty's recent gap-down openings suggested fear among the traders, but post such openings, the market did not witness follow-through selling at least for that day, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. ""This kind of behaviour points to some accumulation at intraday low points. Hence, there will be a higher possibility of a rally once volatility subsides in global financial markets,"" Mazhar added. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said if the index manages to cross and hold above 10,500, a bounceback towards 10,600 and 10,650 levels cannot be ruled out.


Next set of quarterly resultsNext batch of quarterly earnings will continue to influence stocks in the holiday truncated week. Among notable names, Bank of India, Britannia Industries and GAIL (India) will announce their Q3 numbers on Monday, February 12 while NBCC (India) and NMDC will release theirs on Tuesday, February 13. Godrej Industries, Grasim Industries, Jet Airways (India), Nestle India, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Tata Power Company are slated to announce their December quarter earnings on Wednesday, February 14.

13,2018-02-12,Britannia,"NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: The government’s spending in the budget aimed at bolstering rural development and providing higher income for farmers has not increased significantly and it may take at least two quarters to drive growth in the hinterland, consumer goods companies said.

More than a third of daily-use branded products are sold in the rural areas, home to about 800 million people, whose purchasing behaviour depends on farm output.

“We don’t see this as a game-changer for consumption in rural markets and don’t expect sustained results before the second quarter of the next fiscal,” Dabur India’s chief executive officer Sunil Duggal said. The rural markets contribute close to half of Dabur’s Rs 7,800-crore turnover.

“We are seeing green shoots of recovery in rural markets but we expect it will take about two quarters for growth to accelerate,” said Saugata Gupta, managing director of Marico, the maker of Parachute hair care oil and Saffola cooking oil.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley’s measures this year include a minimum support price (MSP) for crops of at least 1.5 times the cost of production, liberalisation of agricultural exports, increase of institutional credit for the agriculture sector, doubling of allocation for food processing and health protection coverage of Rs 5 lakh for 100 million poor and vulnerable families.

“We are seeing FMCG growth coming back on track and these initiatives will provide an additional fillip, especially to rural. However, the need of the hour is to ensure that these initiatives get translated into tangible results through faster implementation and better on-ground execution,” said Vivek Gambhir, managing director at Godrej Consumer Products.


Rural income still stressed
Biscuit maker Parle Products, which gets more than half its sales from the rural market, said measures announced in the budget need to be implemented effectively to translate into sustained, long-term rural growth.

“We are not making any strategic changes in our rural strategy and will continue with our existing focus,” said Parle Products category head Mayank Shah.

Between 2008 and 2012, growth in consumer product sales in rural areas was almost double that of the urban markets, helping the overall segment expand about 18%. With bad monsoons in 2014 and 2015, rural consumption growth fell back. The trend reversed over the past two quarters, with sales of consumer products in rural markets outperforming urban India, largely on the back of a good monsoon, which resulted in better farm incomes, companies said.



Spending on the rural economy is budgeted at 0.6% of GDP in FY19 compared with 0.65% of GDP in FY18, indicating a broader stable allocation, but no significant increase. Rural spending in FY18 was Rs 109,000 crore, while the budget estimate is Rs 112,400 crore for FY19.

“We will be tracking the actual spending patterns, especially towards the second half of the fiscal year and also will watch the trends in rural wage growth to assess if there would be any impact to the inflation outlook,” Morgan Stanley said in a research report.

Britannia managing director Varun Berry said while the MSP increase would improve farmers’ earnings, it may lead to unintended inflation if it is not carefully managed.

“Higher support prices for farm produce could push up retail inflation and hurt company margins. Overall, though, we expect the focus on infrastructure, rural development and large-scale employment generation should provide a springboard to spur consumption,” Berry said.


UNDER STRESS While there is a consensus building on the recovery in the overall market, rural income is still stressed. Government estimates suggest that nominal agri GDP will decline 1.8% in FY18, the third instance of a fall in 50 years.

“Even if we assume that this will be revised to 2% growth, it will be the fourth lowest rural growth rate in 50 years. With over 50% of India having agriculture as their primary occupation, weak nominal growth in agriculture does not bode well for FMCG demand,” IIFL said in a recent report.

At the same time, experts said stagnation of disposable incomes due to unchanged income tax slabs and rates, coupled with modest growth in rural scheme spends, would imply largely a status quo on urban and rural consumption trends, which is expected to have a gradual recovery in line with improving nominal income growth in FY19.

In calendar year 2017, purchases of consumer products recorded their fastest growth in almost five years, underpinned by a good monsoon and improving market sentiment after the introduction of the goods and services tax, among other macroeconomic factors."
14,2018-02-13,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: FMCG major Britannia Industries on Monday reported 19.6% increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs 263.7 crore for the third quarter ended December 2017. 

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 220.4 crore in the October-December period a year ago, Britannia Industries said in a BSE filing.

Britannia’s total expenses in Q3 FY 2017-18 were at Rs 2,204.5 crore as against Rs 2,072.4 crore, up 6.4%. Shares of Britannia on Monday settled at Rs 4,766.55 apiece on BSE."
15,2018-02-13,Britannia,"FMCG major Britannia Industries has plans to launch around 50 new products under its existing as well as new categories by the end of the next fiscal as part of efforts to be a total food company, said a top company official.

In view of its growth strategy, Britannia will launch dairy products and croissants by October-November this year through its joint venture with Greek cakes and confectionery major Chipita.

Besides, the company will continue with its strategy of adding new countries in its list and scout for new markets in Africa, while foraying into Bangladesh and Myanmar.

""Almost 50 new products would be there by the end of next financial year,"" Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry told PTI.

The Kolkata-headquartered company is looking to diversify in bakery and non-bakery segments and also focusing on snack items.

""We are also looking into other areas as bakery and outside bakery, the macro-snacking category, which could be potential areas for us to grow,"" he said.

Besides, Britannia may also launch new sub-brands in the market for some categories, although it will primarily rely on its existing ones.

The group will continue with its existing sub-brands to make sure that it is not completely entering the unknown territories, Berry said, adding that however, in some categories, the company will look for a new one where there is no suitable brand.

The company is in the process of putting up a manufacturing line with its joint venture partner Chipita for croissants, which is expected to come up by October-November of 2018.

""In view of its growth strategy, Britannia will launch dairy products by end of 2019 and croissants through its joint venture with Greek cakes and confectionery major Chipita by October-November of 2018,"" he said.

The company is also in the process of setting up a Rs 1,000-crore plant at Ranjangaon, Pune which would be an integrated food park, he said, adding tow plants in Guwahati and export-oriented unit at Mundra SEZ would be commercialised early next year.

Britannia's Nepal plant would start in the fourth quarter of the next fiscal as it is awaiting environmental clearance there.

""Our target is to add new country every year and that is going well,"" Berry said.

On being asked about the next destination, Berry said, ""We have still not identified the next destination but we are looking at a bunch of countries in Africa, and countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh. We would identify one of those and move forward in FY 2019-20.""

At present, Britannia has manufacturing units in Dubai and Oman, which cater the Middle East markets."

17,2018-02-14,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The Nifty50 index staged a smart recovery on Monday and reclaimed the psychologically important 10,500 level with the momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalling upward crossovers for 135 stocks on NSE.

The MACD is known for identifying trend reversals.

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Amara Raja Batteries, Rolta India, Ruchi Soya, Sakthi Sugars, Atul Auto, Caplin Point, Dilip Buildcon, Jindal Stainless, Take Solutions and Vadilal Industries.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bullish crossovers included DFM Foods, Page Industries, Star Cement, P&G Hygiene, KM Sugar, Cox & Kings and Britannia Industries.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience an upward movement, and vice versa.



However, MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm any such trend.

Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed bearish crossovers on three counters on NSE, which analysts tend to read as ‘sell’ signal. They included Jubilant Life, SBI Life Insurance and Healthcare Global.



On Monday, the 50-share Nifty index settled 84.80 points higher from its previous close at 10,539.

“The Nifty50 has to continue to hold above 10,500 to witness an upmove towards 10,650, while a hold below 10,480 could trigger the next leg of decline towards 10,400 and 10,350 levels,” said Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Understanding MACD


A close look at the chart of Amara Raja Batteries shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

Shares of the company closed 5.82 per cent higher at Rs 844 on February 12."
18,2018-02-16,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group: The rural recovery is truly underway — and India Inc. is veritable proof of that resurgence. Increases in farm-gate prices and crop output appear to have revived consumption demand in Indian villages, prompting market leaders such as Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Astral Polytechnik to enhance their annual growth guidance.

M&M, India’s largest tractor manufacturer, has raised industry tractor growth outlook to 15-16 per cent after the December quarter results from 12-14 per cent earlier, marking the second such upgrade in FY18. Escorts, the country’s fourth-largest tractor-maker, expects volume growth of 15 per cent and 8 per cent for the current and next fiscal years, respectively. Both companies increased prices in the range of 1-3.5 per cent in the current fiscal.

The finance ministry has already budgeted a 21 per cent increase in food subsidies at Rs 1.7 lakh crore. According to CLSA, the government’s MSP announcement in the Budget implies at least a 10-15 per cent increase in paddy procurement rates.

Mirroring the confidence of tractors is Astral Polytechnik, a manufacturer of pipes used in the farming industry. It has indicated an upward revision in volume growth from more than 15 per cent earlier and expects the momentum to continue.

Rural consumers account for about 40 per cent of the total demand for soaps, detergents and other personal-care products. In the food and beverages segment, the agricultural market has a high share in the biscuit and packaged tea segments.

According to analysts, the rural FMCG market is around $19 billion and grew at 13 per cent per year since 2010.

Hindustan Unilever, Dabur and Marico have indicated that their rural volume growth outstripped urban demand in the December quarter. Marico said rural volumes rose 26 per cent against 15 per cent in value terms in the cities.

Likewise, Dabur’s rural stocks rose 26 per cent compared with the total volume of 13 per cent. Manpasand Beverages, a manufacturer of fruit pulp-based drinks, witnessed volume growth of 36 per cent YoY in the December quarter. Britannia witnessed double-digit rural growth in low-income states such as Rajasthan (29.8 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (20 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (19.7 per cent)."

Based on the recommendations of various broking houses, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 11 to 21 sessions.


Analyst: Jay Thakkar, AVP – Equity Research, Anand Rathi 


Britannia | Buy | Target price: Rs 5,100 | Stop loss: Rs 4,670
This stock seems to have completed a wave 4 correction in an A-B-C Zigzag corrective pattern wherein wave B was a symmetrical Triangular pattern. It has fallen in a downward sloping parallel channel and a breakout from the same has come on the upside. The daily and monthly momentum indicator MACD has come into buy mode whereas the weekly indicator seems to be reversing from the zero reference line. 


Analyst: Gajendra Prabu, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities

Amara Raja Batteries | Buy | Target price: Rs 940 | Stop loss: Rs 760
This stock has started a fresh rising leg from the low of 720 which is end of either “wave b/ii”. Price is finding support at the key moving average i.e. 200-day EMA, and has also almost covered the gap witnessed on February 12, 2018. This gap area would be a cluster support and it could provide strength to the stock to move up further in coming sessions. In addition price has validated the last week’s piercing line candle pattern (Moved above pattern’s high) on weekly chart which is a bullish reversal confirmation. In bigger picture, price is in internals of major “wave V” and has good upside potential. “Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price (CMP) and add in dips to Rs 790 for the upside target of Rs 940 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 760,” said Prabhu.


Godfrey Phillips | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,015 | Stop loss: Rs 820
This stock has been forming a contracting triangle in bigger picture, a multi-year pattern started from Dec 2015. Now price is in last leg of the triangle i.e. “wave e”. The said last leg has ended or likely to end soon above Rs 820 level. Structurally, the stock has formed triple bottom around Rs 825 levels which is bullish bottom reversal pattern. The price started gaining momentum from the recent low of Rs 825 levels. RSI oscillator is rebounding from the overbought territory which is bullish development. Apart from this, major “wave v” has begun to unfold and the stock has fair potential to make new life high in the long run. For short term buying can be initiated at CMP and added in dips to Rs 850 for the upside target of Rs 1,015 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stoploss at Rs 820.


Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 349 | Stop loss: Rs 300
In the present uncertain market conditions this counter is registering new life time highs suggesting that it has decoupled itself and can move higher based on its own inherent strength. “Last one year price action chalked out a well defined ascending channel on weekly charts with multiple touch points based on which we can project a modest target of Rs 345 going forward in next couple of weeks. Hence, positional traders should go long with a stop below Rs 300 on closing basis for an initial target of Rs 349,” said Mohammad.


Kotak Mahindra Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,110 | Stop loss: Rs 1,020
This counter appears to have made a decent bottom around Rs 1,028 level and making an attempt to bounce from the basing formation it made last seven sessions. Despite Friday’s attempt to bounce was aborted this counter still managed to close in positive zone. Hence, traders should make use of this opportunity to go long for targets of Rs 1,110 with a stop below Rs 1,020 on closing basis. 


Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities 

CESC | Buy | Target price: Rs 1130-1190 | Stop loss: Rs 935
CESC has retraced 40 per cent of prior down-move, where its long-term moving averages worked as key reversal point. In the past, such kind of reversal from its long-term moving average turned out well for the stock. Major technical indicators are bullish and in favour of a probable up-move.


HDFC Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,020 | Stop loss: Rs 1,830
The stock is oscillating between its medium-term and long-term moving averages after witnessing sharp decline from its life-time- high. Due to undergoing consolidation, the key technical indicators reversed from their lower levels. “We believe the stock will soon surpass near-term hurdles and record new high,” said Jain.


Siemens | Buy| Target price: Rs 1,420-1,460 | Stop loss: Rs 1,200
The stock has retraced 60 per cent of prior up-move and later consolidated between its major daily moving averages. Recent rebound in the stock price helped the key technical indicators to move upward from their lower levels.


Brokerage: Prabhudas Lilladher

PI Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 960 | Stop loss: Rs 830
The stock has made a higher bottom formation pattern in the daily chart after the correction from the peak of Rs 1,034 and has now indicated a positive bullish candle to signify strength and potential to rise further in the coming days. Technical indicators have turned favourable with the RSI showing a trend reversal, indicating a good revival from the oversold zone and on the rise showing a positive bias. With good volume participation witnessed, Prabhudas Lilladher recommends a buy in this stock with an upside target of Rs 960 keeping a stop loss of Rs 830.


Power Grid | Buy | Target price: Rs 215 | Stop loss: Rs 188
The stock has witnessed a gradual correction from the peak of Rs 226 to slide to make the low at Rs 190 level and has shown a good support. The stock has made a good recovery and is on the rise and along with supporting favourable indicators like the RSI which is on the rise indicating a positive bias and also the MACD which is in a positive trend, the stock looks attractive.

40,2018-02-28,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: 
After the exclusion of Aurobindo Pharma, it seems that the weightage of pharmaceutical sector in the Nifty50 could slide further this year.


A study by Centrum Broking on potential Nifty50 
exits suggested that three pharma names Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Lupin could be shown the door in the forthcoming index reviews.


Aurobindo
Pharma would cease to be a Nifty50 component from April 2.

""The removal of 
Aurobindo Pharma from Nifty reflects the ongoing pharma sector downturn resulting in only 4 pharma stocks Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy's and Lupin remaining in Nifty50, with aggregate weightage of mere 3.2 per cent,"" the report said.

Meanwhile, with Bajaj Finserv's entry, the NSE barometer will feature 11 stocks from BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector. This will take BFSI stocks weightage in the index to 33.7 per cent from 33.3 per cent at present, the brokerage said.

Meanwhile, Hindustan Zinc, JSW Steel, Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, Motherson Sumi are some of the stocks that have potential to be a part of Nifty50 going ahead.

Piramal Enterprises MRF, Shriram Transport Finance and Shree Cement are a few other potential Nifty50 stocks.

The 
index is a diversified 50-stock index, which accounts for 12 sectors of the economy. The index reconstruction after considering several criteria such as the free-float market caitalisation of the company, average impact cost during the last six months, trading frequency and so on.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects Hindustan Zinc to deliver healthy volumes going ahead to strong management focus, investment in drilling and human resources. ""We maintain a bullish zinc price outlook and expect LME to average at $3,800/t in FY19 and little lower at $3,200/t in FY20. Ebitda is expected to increase 45-50 per cent, driven by volume growth, cost reduction and favorable LME,"" the brokerage said.

Another brokerage JM Financial likes JSW Steel given its lowest conversion cost and premium realisation for its products against products of peers. ""We factor in Ebitda per tonne at Rs 8,500/8,700 for FY19E/20E, respectively. We roll forward to FY20 to arrive at our SOTP fair value of Rs 300 per share,"" the brokerage said

0,2018-03-02,Britannia,"It’s been three years since Priya Kumar spent a festival with her parents or inlaws. The 30-something prefers to stay home with her husband or use the precious time off to travel to a new place. “Our parents are in Bengaluru and we live in Mumbai. Festivals are the only holidays we get so we prefer a quiet evening at home, just the two of us,” says Kumar.

Busy work schedules and fewer holidays mean more people are spending less time with family. A study, conducted by AC Nielsen and commissioned by Britannia across six metros, found that one in two respondents said they hadn’t met family during festivals for the past three years.

About 50% of respondents said they spend less than 30 days a year with their parents while 76% of working professionals have cancelled a family holiday at least once in the last three years.

They are, however, still bonding digitally — 89% said WhatsApp was the new “meeting place” for families, while 73% were connected on Facebook.



 Sagaya Mary, 30, who works in the social sector in Chennai, hasn’t gone home for close to a year though her family lives less than 200km away in Cuddalore.

“I would have liked to celebrate Christmas with them but my team is understaffed so I chose to stay back. Plus they pressure me to get married,” she says.

Expensive tickets also make travelling home difficult. Stand-up comedian Guru Narayan Chandrasekar, whose day job is as an assistant manager at L&T in Mumbai, misses celebrating festivals with family. “I don’t get enough days off to travel back home to Chennai and tickets are too expensive during festivals,” he says.

10-12% of trips are booked by large groups but they’re not always families

Online travel service Cleartrip says 10-12% of trips are booked by large groups but they’re not always families. “Vacations taken by extended families have reduced, and nuclear families taking trips with friends is now the trend,” says Amit Taneja, chief revenue officer, Cleartrip. “With more Indians settled abroad, vacation time doesn’t coincide so family trips are rarer.” Travel websites have also recorded an increase in the number of travellers with similar interests forming groups and travelling, he says.

5,2018-03-09,Britannia,"In an interview with ET NOW, Neeraj Deewan, Director, Quantum Securities talks about his top picks in midcap space, outlook for sugar segment and stocks that may do better going ahead in the market. Edited excerpts:

ET Now: What is your general approach towards midcaps given the current market scenario? Is it time to get out of midcap stocks and switch to largecaps as they offer a better margin of safety?
Neeraj Deewan: I would not advise anyone to get out of midcaps rather one has to be selective while investing in midcap and smallcap stocks. Definitely the management quality and the growth have to be taken into consideration before deciding to invest in any stock. Even after the market fall, midcaps have corrected a lot. A lot of them have corrected up to 25-30 per cent.

I will still stick to my investment thesis that at least 30-40 per cent of your portfolio should include midcaps because they are the ones that give you extraordinary returns when the markets turn.

Now is a good time to select midcaps especially the ones which have performed very well even in this downfall. These stocks are the ones that have been stable. One should definitely keep a small part of their portfolio ready to be invested again in midcaps once the tide turns.


ET Now: What is on your shopping list in the midcap space?
Neeraj Deewan: Stocks focussing more into domestic demand have gone up a lot and now they are correcting. Then there are spaces like the automobile ancillary space in which stocks like Jamna Auto were doing well because of the demand coming back to the commercial vehicle segment. So, now is a good opportunity to buy such stocks.

The real estate sector too is undergoing some improvement. Stocks like DLF, Indiabulls Real Estate can be looked at as there are talks about them becoming debt-free in the next six-seven quarters.

So we can look at real estate, commercial vehicle focused auto ancillary space, retail (Future Lifestyle) and textile stocks (Nandan Denim). These stocks have corrected along with the market correction and are domestically focussed. They are likely to gain with the improvement in the market and the results of the past four-five quarters of these companies have been pretty encouraging too.


ET Now: Going forward into the year, do you believe that outperformance would be restricted to some of the largecap names as oppose to midcaps because we know it is going to be a volatile ride this year?
Neeraj Deewan: I will reiterate that some part of your portfolio should have midcap stocks. Whenever the market stabilises, largecaps are the ones that start performing. Midcaps play a catch-up.

In the last two-three years of the bull run that we have seen from FY13 to now, we saw lot of midcaps giving you return of 10-15 times and even after giving those kind of returns on valuation front, these stocks are not that expensive.

For example, if you look at Avanti Feeds over the last four or five years, you will notice that even after rising 20-25 times in share value and the growth the company delivered on profitability front, at the return ratios of 30-35 per cent, the stock does not look very expensive. In the midcap space, you have solid well-managed companies, which have been performing well. One should not put all midcaps in one basket.


ET Now: The one lucrative pocket within midcaps has been the road EPC plays. Do you it is a pocket one could look at? Or do you think valuations and the stock prices have run up too much already?
Neeraj Deewan: The valuation in the prices has run up too fast in some of these companies. Even the prices of the companies that we preferred earlier, like the Sintex Infrastructure, JMC Project, have soared too fast and are not cheap even after the correction.

One has to be very selective while choosing these companies because most of them have healthy order books. We saw this in the last economic upturn too that order books became very healthy but then what happened was that interest rates started going up and execution became a challenge. This may happen again because interest rates in the next two-three quarters may start looking up.

One needs to be careful and select companies which have been there for some time. Companies like HCC and NCC have seen both up and down cycle; they have been in the dumps but are still standing. So such companies will be little better in execution.


ET Now: Are you willing to look at some beaten down banks or would you say that these are best avoided right now? Do private compounding stories like HDFC Bank or HDFC merit a buy on the corrections if and when they come by?
Neeraj Deewan: If you have a long term perspective of two to two-and-a-half years then opportunities in beaten-down PSU Banks may show up. Even the private sector beaten-down banks like ICICI Bank can do well.

With the NCLT resolutions and the exposure these banks are getting their issues might resolve in the next two-three quarters. So, look at this fall as an opportunity to invest in banks with higher corporate exposure. We have seen retail-focussed banks doing well and going ahead they may give you performance returns but I think better returns can come from corporate-facing banks though it will be a choppy ride. But if you invest with a perspective of over two years you will get better returns.


ET Now: Why do you think sugar sector is seeing so much correction?
Neeraj Deewan: Sugar sector has seen two good seasons and it is a cyclical industry. So with markets correcting people are getting scared that sugar’s two-year cycle is coming to an end and it may now see one-and-a–half to two years of bad cycle. This is why some of the selling is in sugar sector is taking place. Sugar prices which were going up earlier have stopped too. One now needs to be careful about this sector because we do not see three-four good cycles for sugar in a row and the sector may now consolidate. However, we have to wait for the coming monsoon to take a call on sugar stocks.


ET Now: What is your outlook on the real estate space? I believe you are fairly upbeat on select names - like DLF and IB Realty, what is the rationale here and why are those your top bets?
Neeraj Deewan: DLF is going through debt repayment and they have are raising money to repay the debt. The price slide has also halted and the stock is becoming more stable now. The interest rates are almost at the bottom and it is the time when demand can really start picking up with economy picking up. That is why DLF would be my pick. And Indiabull Real Estate is also retiring its debt. They plan to list the commercial rental arm and the residential arm separately. This move can create value because they have a good rental income from the commercial space. So once stability comes back in the prices a lot of these capacities will start getting consumed and things will improve on the operational front too.


ET Now: Do you think that the domestic flows into equity markets will continue to sustain?
Neeraj Deewan: Yes, I believe so. A large part of the domestic flows are coming in the form of SIPs and even when our clients ask us, we tell them this is a good time to increase the SIP allocation because you are supposed to invest when the markets are coming down.

Most of the investors must be getting this same advice from all the advisors. If SIP inflows persist the support to the domestic market will continue. Also there are hardly any other options where one can invest money right now. Even the interest rates are quite low on fixed deposits and fixed income securities. So, I think SIP and the support that we are getting from the domestic mutual funds should continue for some time. If the markets take a huge correction or see a long period of correction then you can get concerned about inflows from SIP but immediately there is no such concern.


ET Now: What are your views regarding the FMCG sector and how are you looking at it from a valuation standpoint?
Neeraj Deewan: I am positive on the consumer space and stocks like HUL, Godrej Consumer, Nestle and Britannia. I think ITC has been under pressure. Whereas in the other stocks you see a pick-up in demand and GST is also been of help to them.

When you see valuations I do not see too much value. I am not seeing merit in investing in stocks like Hindustan Lever or Godrej Consumer but there will be pockets like Britannia and Nestle where I think there is still some scope of improvement because there the return ratios are pretty good and they still have some scope of improvement."

7,2018-03-15,Britannia,"By Vrishti Beniwal and Bibhudatta Pradhan

Shankar K.C.’s wife pawned her jewelry to help pay for a new red tractor, which the 46-year-old farmer parks in his courtyard as a symbol of his prosperity.

Encouraged by relatively good rains, better prices for his grain and vegetable crops and a state government subsidy for the cow milk he sells, Shankar scraped together a deposit of Rs 3,00,000 ($4,627) and got bank finance for a matching amount to make his biggest-ever purchase. Premlatha was so confident that her husband would make enough money from their small-scale farm to buy back her jewels that she didn’t protest.

Both of them were beaming with pride as they spoke about their fresh acquisition, sitting in their living room furnished with just a cot and an old-style television. “We wanted to buy a tractor for a long time but had no money,” said Shankar. “Life has improved -- I can supplement my income by renting out the tractor to other farmers.""

Shankar is one of the 300 inhabitants of Kuragunda village in the southern, largely rural state of Karnataka, enjoying early signs of a recovery in the agricultural sector. If sustained, it could bode a turnaround from years of distress in rural India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 and bolster his re-election chances next year.

At Vijaya Farm Equipments, a dealer of Mahindra Tractors where Shankar bought his vehicle, the mood is upbeat. The showroom doubled its sales in February from a year ago, underscoring figures from Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., India’s largest tractor maker, where sales jumped 39 per cent that month.

“This year has been a positive one and the tractor industry growth is riding on the cash liquidity in the farmers’ hands due to a good crop, government support to the sector and a push towards building rural infrastructure,” said Rajesh Jejurikar, president of the farm equipment sector at Mahindra & Mahindra.

Rural Tracker
A Bloomberg Economics index that tracks the rural economy shows tractor and two-wheeler sales are up and the government is spending more. Monsoon rains are set for a third good year -- another sign of hope for an industry that was beset by back-to-back droughts followed by a disruptive cash ban in late 2016.

“A revival in rural activity bodes well for the broader growth recovery,” said Abhishek Gupta, an economist at Bloomberg Economics in Mumbai. “It is likely to boost the equity returns of agrarian and rural consumption stocks. And with nearly two-thirds of India’s population residing in rural areas, a recovery is likely to enhance political stability by improving Modi’s chances of re-election next year.”

After sweeping to victory with the help of the rural vote, Modi’s popularity has taken a knock as farming incomes slumped, debts piled up, joblessness rose and suicides climbed.

Growth Prospects
Hit by criticism that he’d neglected his rural base and after his party’s worst electoral showing in two decades in his home state of Gujarat, Modi has set out on a course of correction. He has pledged to double farmers’ incomes by 2022, raise the support prices on additional crops and spend more on irrigation and infrastructure in rural areas. On Wednesday, the government agreed to extend a fertilizer subsidy program until 2020. Farm loan waivers by some state governments are also helping.

“Life has started returning to normal now,” Laxmi Narayan Gowda, a 48-year-old farmer, said on the side of the road in Kuragunda village. “It’s not the best situation but people are able to spend on marriages, buying goods and building houses.”

With almost 70 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people living in rural villages and agriculture contributing about 16 percent of gross domestic product, what happens in the sector determines not only Modi’s election fate, but also growth prospects for the $2.3 trillion economy. The statistics office is forecasting expansion of 6.6 percent in the year through March, slightly above its earlier estimate of 6.5 percent, while the central bank expects government programs to boost rural incomes and investment will help underpin demand.

Protest March
Consumer goods companies such as Marico Ltd., Eveready Industries India Ltd., and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. saw traction in rural sales in the December quarter and expect further growth in coming months.

Britannia Industries Ltd. has witnessed higher growth in rural markets compared to urban markets, India’s most valuable cookie maker said by email. The company expects rural sales to account for 40 percent of its revenue in the next two years, up from 30 percent now, as the government’s support helps to boost consumers’ disposable income.

For many in rural India though, recovery remains elusive. Nearly 50,000 farmers marched to the financial capital of Mumbai on Monday demanding loan waivers and higher crop prices.

“Sales numbers are an indicator of change but not an indicator of the condition of agriculture or rural economy,” said Narendra Pani, a professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru. Doubling farmers’ income would be an electoral boost, but doing so may be a tall order, he said.

Rain Forecast
India’s biggest maker of consumer products, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, the local unit of Unilever NV, said while there’s a pick-up underway, it would wait for another two quarters before concluding that the rural market’s out-performance over urban areas was here to stay.

Good rains will be key. The meteorological department hasn’t given an official forecast yet, but Bloomberg Economics’ analysis, based on forecasts for El Nino and La Nina weather patterns, shows favorable conditions.

“Hopefully my income will double to Rs 1,00,000 this year,” Shankar said, counting on favorable rainfall to help pay off his debts quickly so he can buy another tractor in three years. ""I’ll be able to give a better future to my children."""
8,2018-03-15,Britannia,"Worry not if you have missed the bus on last year's stock rally. You can still cover the lost ground, according to a top fund house, given the recent market correction.

A judicious stock selection here is the key, says Gautam Sinha Roy, Senior VP and Fund Manager, Motilal Oswal AMC.

""The universe of investible ideas is probably narrower today than it was three years back. Hence, judicious stock selection will be even more critical for outperformance,"" he adds. 

Roy throws in a caution. He expects a PE derating for small and midcap stocks, considering the valuation premium they command compared with largecaps. 

He makes the point that large caps would steal the show, going forward. However, there are always select midcaps that will continue to do well irrespective of broader trends.

Roy, who manages Rs 13,500 crore of equity portfolios, advises investors to make full use of the recent correction. Benchmarks Sensex and Nifty have come off 9 per cent till March 9 from their all-time highs hit this January.

“These phases are nothing, but a sale that happens occasionally in an asset class whose long-term journey is upwards. My advice to retail investors who have not been able to participate in last year’s rally because of the runaway nature of it will be to make use of the current correction phase to build up their long-term equity allocation,” says Roy.

The market has given handsome returns to investors over the past five calendar years, with the 30-share BSE Sensex climbing 75 per cent to 34,056.83 on December 29, 2017 as against 19,426 on December 31, 2012.

Roy has managed to beat the benchmark index by a wide margin over the past three years. His funds MOSt Focused Long Term Fund and MOSt Focused Multicap 35 Fund have delivered 17.60 per cent and 14.49 per cent annualised returns, respectively, in the past three years till March 9 whereas benchmark Nifty 500 went up 7.80 per cent annually during the same period.

Roy told ETMarkets.com, “The returns for the Motilal Oswal MOSt Focused Long Term Fund have been driven by prudent picking of stocks which have delivered strong earnings growth. Superior earnings growth has been driven by a strong set of core largecap holdings which are compounding at a steady clip and a select set of midcap names which have earnings growning at a very strong pace.”

As of February-end, Motilal Oswal MOSt Focused Long Term Fund was holding stocks like HDFC, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Lombard General, Quess Corp, Can Fin Homes, Bayer CropScience and Britannia Industries, among others.


Asset allocation
He believes that asset allocation is a very individual-specific decision based on factors including risk appetite, age and the like. What is fundamentally true about equity is that it is arguably the best asset class for long-term wealth creation, provided one is judicious about stock selection and allocation, he asserts.

“Equities have been expensive till a couple of months back and have since corrected somewhat. So, individual investors should start allocating more aggressively into equities now with a time horizon of three years or more,” he says further.


Top ideas to bet on
The fund manager is looking cautiously at the public sector banking space, but believes that select domestic consumption as well as retail financing stocks will continue to fetch strong returns.

There seems to be no end to the NPA woes for PSU banks. And now, a series of scams involving some big names have dented investors’ confidence in these stocks. 

The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of all the banks in the country stood at Rs 8.40 lakh crore in December, led by industry loans followed by services and agriculture sectors.

“While valuations of the PSU banks have indeed corrected and the worst of the NPA problems might be behind us, we will wait and watch for fundamental improvement in the quality of underwriting and growth. Strong high-quality earnings growth would be the biggest trigger for PSU banks,” Roy adds.

However, he believes that IT, pharma and other exporting stocks will do well as the business fundamentals improve from a low point in their evolution cycle. Besides, oil refining, marketing, and names across the gas value chain look attractive on fundamentals backed by reasonable valuations.

“We have a very well defined investment framework wherein we look for high-quality earnings compounders available at reasonable valuations,” Roy points out.


Global environment 
The market analyst thinks that there is a decent probability that global cues, especially from the US, might upset the applecart as far as Indian equities are concerned. 

With the new Fed chief indicating a hawkish stance, any policy tightening and money supply contraction could surprise with their intensity and lead to broader sell-off in equities globally. Talks of strong trade protectionism are not healthy either. 

“We need to keep our fingers crossed and see how the US situation evolves through the course of the year. Such macro conditions and the expensiveness of the Indian market are deterrents for FII flows. But a strong correction in Indian markets combined with benign US macro outcome can actually be very positive for FII flows into India. So, wait and watch!” suggests Roy.


Selecting ELSS
Since it is the end of the financial year, many look at ELSS as an active investment. Roy advises investors to check the track record of the fund manager and the investment philosophy. 

The other material aspect is fund size. Other things remaining the same, investors should definitely go for smaller AUM-sized schemes, he cautions."

10,2018-03-23,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group: The lack of a clear trend in sustainability of earnings, increasing crude oil prices and rising uncertainties in global macro-economic environment are some of the challenges for investors. In such a situation, low-beta stocks may be a better choice. Here are five such stocks you may look at:


BALKRISHNA INDUSTRIES
One of the largest tyre makers, Balkrishna Industries is expected to benefit from stable rubber prices. It is expected to boost operating margin. Analysts expect the company’s tyre sales to rise by 13-15 per cent for the next two fiscals as demand for off-the-road (OTR) and agriculture tyres is expected to be strong. A key reason for this is improvement in business activities in the mining sector.


BRITANNIA INDUSTRIES
Factors such as encouraging double-digit volume growth in the December 2017 quarter after six quarters, cost saving measures, geographical expansion, and new capacity augur well for the country’s largest biscuit company. In addition, it has forayed in high-priced biscuit products and the dairy segment, which are expected to boost revenue growth.


CG CONSUMER ELECTRICALS
The company has dominant market share in fans, residential pumps and consumer lighting. The government reforms focusing on housing for all, electrification and favourable situation for organised players after the implementation of the GST may boost revenue. The company has gained market share in premium segments of fans and lighting which should enhance operating margin in the next two to three years.


POWER GRID CORPORATION
India’s largest electric power transmission utility is expected to benefit from $16.3 billion worth of proposed projects. Being in the business which generates fixed return of 15.5 per cent on equity, the company provides high stability to the portfolio. The company has been able to complete projects on time, which has resulted in healthy cash flows. This has reduced the risk of equity dilution since capital expenditure can be finance through internal accruals.


GSK PHARMACEUTICALS
Healthcare company GlaxoSmithkline Pharmaceuticals has been able to fix issues related to shortage and supply of vaccines and other medicines from its parent company. The company relaunched Neosporin, which is an antibiotic used to treat minor wounds. Besides this, the company launched two new healthcare products. It has a pipeline of new launches in the form of three more respiratory products and one diabetic drug in addition to two vaccines in the next two years. These products are expected to boost revenue in the present and the coming fiscal."
11,2018-03-26,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Realty developer Indiabulls Real Estate is in advanced talks with global private equity (PE) majors including Blackstone Group, Brookfield Asset Management and Xander Group to sell its Chennai commercial asset One Indiabulls Park for around Rs 1,200 crore, said two persons with direct information of the development.

This is the second transaction the developer is about to conclude following the sale of 50% stake in its two office properties One Indiabulls and Indiabulls Finance Center in central Mumbai to Blackstone Group for $730 million or Rs 4,750 crore.

The developer has entered into executed definitive transaction documents with Blackstone Group LP to divest 50% stake in subsidiaries Indiabulls Properties Private Ltd and Indiabulls Real Estate Co. Pvt. Ltd at an aggregate enterprise value of $1.46 billion or Rs 9,500 crore.

This transaction for Indiabulls Finance Centre and One Indiabulls Centre, in central Mumbai, with over 4.1 million sq ft office space is expected to be concluded by the end of this month.

“The plan was to monetise Mumbai and Chennai commercial office assets separately. Now that the sale of first two properties has been finalised, the process for Chennai assets monetisation has gathered momentum,” said one of the persons mentioned above. The transaction for Chennai commercial asset is expected to be concluded over the next two-three months.

One Indiabulls Park, Chennai, is a 1.9-million-sq-ft commercial office asset and houses tenants such as Royal Bank of Scotland, YES Bank, Vodafone, BSNL and Britannia Industries. The property is 90% leased and generates annual rent of Rs 75 crore, which is expected to rise to Rs 95 crore by 2019-20 owing to rental escalation clauses.

The company has also sold its Chennai residential development project for around Rs 300 crore as part of its asset monetisation plan.

The residential development Indiabulls Greens, Chennai, has 2.07 million sq ft of saleable area and according to the company’s most recent earnings release, around 63% of the project is sold and handover of flats has begun.

ET’s separate email queries to Brookfield Asset Management, Xander Group and Indiabulls Real Estate remained unanswered until press time.

Blackstone Group declined to comment for the story.

The company has stated that substantial part of the funds raised through the Blackstone transaction for two Mumbai office properties would be utilised towards repayment of existing debt of the company and its subsidiaries.

As at the end of December 2017, Indiabulls Real Estate had total debt of over Rs 10,600 crore. According to the persons mentioned above, the proceeds from the Blackstone deal and the sale of Chennai properties will be used to repay the company’s debt and bring net debt to under Rs 2,000 crore.

Indiabulls Real Estate, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Yashita Buildcon, has recently entered into a binding and definitive agreement to acquire a newly constructed commercial building with leasable area of around 2.5 lakh sq ft in Gurgaon.

With this acquisition, total annualised annuity revenue would be Rs 1,513 crore in 2020-21."

7,2018-04-14,Britannia,"L&T and ICICI Bank could emerge as earnings dark horses, said Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Consulting, during an interview with ET Now. He is also confident that consumption will be a big turnaround story. 

Edited excerpts: 


Would you concur with CLSA and Citi that earnings will continue to be muted or a revival is imminent?

Fourth quarter is going to be much better than what most people expect because we believe that the profitability is going to be significantly better for a couple of reasons. One, of course, is a lot of laggards are going to be a little bit better-off this time, which is mainly IT stocks and pharma -- the two big laggards in the Nifty. They should do better. 

Auto should be at par. By and large, no major surprises. Metal companies should be okay. The worry is of course there is one nationalised bank in the index. The real worry is oil companies. Perhaps, they could be the only big laggards in the market. Infrastructure wise, L&T should be okay. Most segments should be good this quarter.


Let us talk about auto. Do you think demand spurt plus a low base will lead to a very speedy earnings growth in Q4?

It's going to be pretty good across the board because it is not that one company made good this quarter. All of them by and large should be at par in growth rate. We already know what it looks like, we already know the numbers of the auto companies. And every one of them has done reasonably well. We know the dispatches coming through. I do not think there will be any kind of a divergence between market leaders versus the others in the field. It will be pretty well spread out across the board and that would be true for the auto sector. 

That would also be perhaps true for the private banking sector because all would be roughly with about 20 per cent growth and profitability. By and large, Hindustan Lever should be at about 13-14 per cent or maybe a little higher than that. GAIL about 15 per cent... I think demand wise if it is auto, banking or everyone else, we should be at par. I do not think there will be an outlier like a Tata Steel. But by and large most index stocks would behave in a range this quarter.


You have mentioned oil and gas earlier. Would inventory gains from higher crude make up for subdued GRMs now that we already have it at $70?

Well, one does not know the mechanics of this pricing because oil is not only about ONGC, but also the retail marketing companies. That is a complex web to look at. But this quarter, at least the price increase has lagged the purchase price, that is one. Two, the benefit of the opening inventory is perhaps over at this point or maybe marginal. I do not know whether the oil marketing companies would get the same upside as a oil production companies.


The other leg of the market which you track very closely is consumption and a bunch of names are Britannia to Pidilite, Nestle, Page, Colgate, your favourite liquor stock UBL and USL. Can one expect strong earnings from them?

Yes, I think. We have invested in most of the stocks in the consumer space, whether it is Britannia or Bata. Their numbers would be fantastically good. We are very clear that not only they will give you a surprise on the upside on total increase in profit, but the margins will go up. The reason is the competition has been much less, the growth has been good and they have been able to push volumes. Also, price pressure has been much less and price increases have come through. Across the board in the consumer space, you will find that this quarter is going to be one of the typical turnaround quarters that happened once in a while in the industry. 

I think the market has sensed it, the share prices have gone up in the last quarter quite appreciably. There may not be much price upside left, but result wise I think this will substantiate the customers' preferences who have invested a lot of money in this sector. If you are left behind, you better be invested. If you are there, I think enjoy the ride. I would believe that the good part of the price and the margin increase is already built into the share price of most of these companies.


Finally, are you expecting any outliers this quarter and dark horses that you think could surprise on the upside perhaps?

I think the dark horse should come out. L&T is one dark horse because that is a composite story and it has got L&T Finance, L&T Infotech, L&T IT services and L&T itself. I feel that could surprise us on the upside this quarter and that is a big one which can come through. The second one that can surprise you perhaps is going to be ICICI Bank because there is a battle of survival happening there and if I was the CEO and MD, I would pull out all the stops to ensure I have a stellar performance coming this quarter. Two dark horses in my view are going to be L&T and ICICI Bank. They could really surprise investors."

8,2018-04-16,Britannia,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Companies may revise their policies on the online behaviour of employees, even in their private capacity, as some comments face a backlash from social media users in the country, CEOs and HR managers said. 

For instance, Kotak Mahindra Bank sacked an employee in Kerala on Friday following a contemptuous Facebook post about the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl that was met with furious condemnation. The bank, however, said it had terminated the employee due to “poor performance”.

“Social media is redefining the boundaries of what is private communication and what is public—imposes new responsibility on management and rightly so,” said Ramesh Tainwala, global CEO at Samsonite International.

Many companies, especially consumerfacing ones, maintain there is a fine line between what is acceptable and what is not. But comments should not be contrary to the belief of a company, neither should they be hateful or insensitive.

“Social media is a platform that is fast changing and we need to not just evolve around it but also be sensitive about every issue in the country,” said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group, the country’s biggest retailer.

Last year, Facebook users in India crossed the 240-million mark.

India has become the largest audience country for the social media giant.

The country has also emerged as Twitter's fastest-growing market in terms of daily active users. With these platforms exploding, companies are increasingly confronted with the consequences social media can have on company image. With every user an existing or potential consumer for companies, any disparaging comment could hurt brand image and even sales.

“In this day and age, all employees need to be sensitive about what they are posting on social media because of the ever-increasing impact and reach of social platforms,” Britannia MD Varun Berry said. “Every employee is, in a way, a brand ambassador of the company he or she represents— so responsible conduct on social media is a given.”

While social media policy is already part of employee contractual terms, guidelines have to evolve further, companies said. This can also help put employers in a stronger position when they want to take action against employees doing things they don't approve of.

“A code of conduct of any company has to be a living document which must get updated from time to time to reflect the contemporary expectation of conduct by the organisation and its employees,” said Santrupt B Misra, head of group HR at Aditya Birla Management Corp. “As new facets of lifestyle and behaviours emerge as social trends, these living documents must capture the new realities.”

Unthinking use of such mediums can heighten the risk. “So sensitisation and informed usage have to be encouraged through structured education and interactive understanding of the dos and don’ts,” Misra said.

Several people have lost their jobs globally after posting comments deemed offensive on social media. For instance, a Bank of America employee lost her job after posting a racist rant on Facebook nearly two years ago while another was sacked from internet firm InterActive Corp for a tweet that linked Aids with race.


RECRUITERS KEEP TRACK 
Job seekers also need to be careful as recruiters are keeping track. “With people increasingly exposing themselves on social media, organisations are starting to scan potential employee profiles to watch out for any inappropriate content being posted by the candidates,” said Vibhav Dhawan, managing partner at executive search firm Positive Moves.

“Though the processes are not refined yet, going forward, social media behaviour will increasingly influence decision making by recruiters.”

Employee messages should also feel connected to the brand’s values, something that is already established in HR policies. “We believe that all Godrejites are brand ambassadors of our company, both in their individual capacity, as well as together as a group,” said Sumit Mitra, head, group HR, Godrej Industries and associate companies.

The group said its code of conduct that applies to all team members across geographies and details its business principles and guidelines about representing Godrej appropriately, across different platforms including social media, within and outside the company."

15,2018-04-18,Britannia,"India is set to witness a third consecutive year of normal monsoon which is likely to give a fillip to companies in the automobile, consumer and agri-related sectors. ET spoke to senior analysts for their picks to play the monsoon theme. Hero MotoCorp is being favoured by many among automobile stocks that will benefit from a normal monsoon.


GAURAV DUA
Head of Research, Sharekhan

Hero MotoCorp
The outlook for the company is encouraging on account of positive rural sentiments resulting in higher farm incomes. This coupled with higher budgetary allocation towards rural geographies in the Budget is expected to further aid volume growth for Hero MotoCorp.


Godrej Consumer Products
Godrej Consumer has derisked its business model with 50 per cent of revenue coming from India and the rest from the international business. Godrej Consumer’s domestic business is expected to maintain its strong growth momentum in the coming quarters with expected recovery in rural demand and new product launches getting good response in near term.


AMIT KHURANA
Head of Research, Dolat Capital

Hero MotoCorp
Hero MotoCorp has a relatively high rural exposure and there are product launches on the anvil in a couple of quarters. The company is likely to post better numbers going forward because of the rural recovery.


Britannia Industries
Britannia is focusing on new areas, expanding distribution reach and managing costs well. The company has positioned its brand well and should also benefit from the transition to GST.


PANKAJ PANDEY
Head of Research, ICICIdirect

KSB Pumps
KSB Pumps has 35 per cent exposure to the standard product segment catering to the agriculture sector. We expect the company to benefit from the increase in farm income consequent to a normal monsoon and from the government’s thrust on augmenting the irrigation penetration.


Rallis India
The company stands to benefit from low penetration of crop protection chemicals domestically, transition of domestic farmers towards more quality-oriented products amid the central government’s thrust on augmenting farm income and Rallis’ strong brand recall amid robust farmer connect.


ABHIMANYU SOFAT
VP-Research, IIFL

Hero MotoCorp
The company is more focused on rural India relative to other players. It has been outperforming Bajaj Auto in terms of market share and has good focus in the scooter segment. Valuations are at 17.5 times FY20 earnings and Bajaj Auto is at about 15.5. We expect the gap to continue.


Jain Irrigation
On a lower base, the company’s growth is expected to be good. We expect 37 per cent CAGR in FY19-20. It is trading at 12 times FY20 earnings. We expect the stock to touch Rs 140 in a year."
16,2018-04-19,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group : The stock of Parag Milk Foods has been range bound for the past three months despite improved performance in the December 2017 quarter. However, the company may be back on investors’ radar considering the company’s increasing share of value-added products, lower milk procurement cost and cheaper stock valuation.

Over the past decade, the dairy company with its major facility in Pune has created brands such as ‘Go Cheese’ and ‘Gowardhan’ and new products such as ‘Whey Protein’. Milk products now contribute two third of the company’s revenue compared with 50 per cent four years ago.

The cheese business contributed 21 per cent to the company’s revenue in FY17. According to industry trackers, Parag is now the second largest cheese producer with 33 per cent market share. Market leader Amul owns 40 per cent share, Britannia 9 per cent and Dynamix 7 per cent.

Parag Milk has also launched fully vegetarian Whey protein product under the brand ‘Avvatar’. At present, this segment is dominated by foreign brands. It plans new branded products in the curd, ghee and paneer segments.

The size of the country’s dairy sector is estimated at Rs 6 lakh crore, growing at nearly 10 per cent annually. The organised sector is only 20 per cent of the total dairy sales.

Since the beginning of 2018, milk procurement cost has fallen by 7-8 per cent year-on-year due to good monsoon. The trend may persist given the prognosis of a normal rainfall in the current year as well.

In the first nine months of FY18, Parag’s revenue grew by 10.3 per cent to Rs 1,437 crore while operating profit before depreciation (EBIDTA) shot up by 194 per cent to ?138 crore year-onyear. The EBIDTA margin expanded to 9.6 per cent from 3.6 per cent. Analysts expect the margin to improve more since the cheese and whey protein segments have higher margins of 25-45 per cent compared with a single-digit margin in the milk business.

The rising share of branded products is expected to improve the company’s return ratios and therefore stock valuation. At Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 272.6, the company’s stock was traded at 18 times estimated FY20 earnings, lower than 30-50 times for some of the consumer goods companies."
17,2018-04-19,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Parag Milk Foods on Thursday said it will acquire French food giant Danone’s Indian manufacturing facility for Rs 30 crore.

The facility at Rai in Haryana’s Sonepat area produces curd, yogurt among other dairy products and the acquisition is aimed at expanding Parag's presence in the northern part of the country.

""North market contributes near 25% of our total sales. This acquisition will help us grow at 35-40% in the northern markets. We used to send products from our Maharashtra facility to north. This deal will save us logistics cost,"" said Devendra Shah, Chairman, Parag Milk Foods. ""We expect this acquisition to add annual sales of Rs 150 crore to our topline in the next two years.""

Over the past decade, Parag Milk Foods with its major facility in Pune has created brands such as ‘Go Cheese’ and ‘Gowardhan’. Milk products now contribute two third of the company’s revenue compared with half four years ago while cheese business contributed 21% to the company’s revenue in FY17. Parag is now the second largest cheese producer with 33% market share. Market leader Amul has 40% share followed by Britannia at 9% and Dynamix with 7%.

Earlier this year, French foods maker Danone said it will exit its dairy portfolio in India, seven years after it entered the category dominated by Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)-owned Amul and Mother Dairy, besides Nestle.

While India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of dairy, Danone’s dairy business could not compete with bigger players and remained a non-starter. The size of the country’s dairy sector is estimated at Rs 6 lakh crore, growing at nearly 10% annually. The organised sector is only 20% of the total dairy sales."
18,2018-04-24,Britannia,"Over the last one year, leading dairy brand Amul has further strengthened its market leadership by eating into the shares of rival brands, Britannia and Go, in general and modern trade.

While Amul’s all-India volume share in cheese rose to 71% during the period from March 2017 to February 2018 from 64% in the previous year, Britannia’s volume share declined to 17% from 20% and Go’s share shrunk to 6% from 10%, respectively, industry sources said quoting Nielsen data.

Usually, according to industry experts, it’s difficult for a leader with a large majority share to further shore up its position. However, what helped Amul grab share from its competitors is a major expansion that trebled its production capacity to 3,000 tonnes a month.

When contacted, R S Sodhi, MD of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets its dairy products under Amul, said after the expansion, the company became aggressive on the distribution and pricing front, especially to the HoReCa (hotels, restaurants, catering) segment.

Another factor that assisted Amul, which has a strong network of 5,000 distributors, is that it did not increase prices in the last two years. The strategy paid off in boosting volumes. GCMMF plans to further expand its capacity to around 5,000 tonnes a month in the next two years.

Britannia Industries said it does not subscribe to Nielsen’s market share data for the dairy category. “As far as the cheese category for Britannia goes, we have seen healthy double-digit growth in 2017-18 with modern trade contributing marginally higher than general trade to this growth. While cheese slices (which were pioneered in India by Britannia) continue to be the largest segment for the brand, the growth has been funnelled by cheese blocks, cubes and spreads,” said Venkat Shankar, VP and head of dairy business, Britannia Industries.

Devendra Shah, chairman of Parag Milk Foods, the maker of Go cheese, also said the company’s cheese business has been growing well. “As per our internal data, our cheese business has grown more than 20% CAGR in the last one year. Along with consumer business, we are also focusing on institutional sales and direct supply to QSRs. Almost half of the consumption of cheese comes from institutions. Going by the growing demand, we are increasing our capacity from 40 metric tonnes per day to 60 metric tonnes per day,” said Shah.

The roughly Rs 2,000-crore cheese market in India is growing at 10-12% annually. Although cheese has always been an acquired taste in India, its consumption has been growing significantly driven by pizza chains and consumers adapting to new forms of cuisines.

During the year, general trade in cheese is said to have grown ahead of modern trade. While general trade grew 20%, modern trade’s growth was around 8%. In general trade, while Britannia grew by 1%, Amul is said to have clocked a growth rate of around 30% and has a market share of 86%. Go, on the other hand, declined significantly by 65%."

20,2018-04-26,Britannia,"Superior economies with reasonable competitive moat of a business can create long-term wealth for investors. An efficient business with consistency and sustainability normally creates value for shareholders, which can be measured by incremental return on capital employed (I-RoCE).

According to Edelweiss Securities, a Mumbai brokerage, I-RoCE is a true reflection of a management’s ability to redeploy incremental capital at higher returns, not clouded by past capital allocation decisions. Hence, it’s a lead indicator of future RoCE.

A screener using this criteria throws up companies like Kajaria Ceramics, Avanti Feeds, MRF, Atul, Sheela Foam, Vardhman and La Opala; evergreen companies that have either been improving or sustaining high RoCE at over 20 per cent for at least 10 years now.

Edelweiss classifies Heritage Foods, CCL Products, KPR Mill and Nilkamal as rising stars. From low historical RoCE of less than 20 per cent, these companies are now moving up the curve.

Kajaria Ceramics, Nilkamal, Avanti Feeds and La Opala have seen their RoCE increase from 12.81 per cent, 15.33 per cent, 4.77 per cent and 5.59 per cent, respectively, in FY08 to 32.19 per cent, 23.29 per cent, 61.69 per cent and 29.26 per cent as of March 31, 2017.

KPR Mills, CCL Products and Heritage Foods have also witnessed a substantial rise in RoCE during this period. Shares of these companies have delivered between 740 per cent and 9,000 per cent returns over the past 10 years.

Kajaria is the leader in tile industry, with 22 per cent market share (from 13 per cent in FY10) and enjoys highest Ebitda margins, whereas Heritage Food is focusing on high growth, high margin value-added products (VADP) segment, aiming to increase market share from 24 per cent to 40 per cent by FY22. 

CCL Products is the largest manufacturer and exporter of instant coffee. Its focus on B2C branded sales, high margin freeze-dried capacity and cost efficiency are projected to help the business grow faster.

Avanti Feed, a leader with around 42 per cent market share in feeds business, is already a multibagger stock. It is targeting $1 billion revenue by FY22, and has been focusing on the value-added shrimp processing segment.

Incremental- RoCE is a key metric that measures value creation in a business. This rule of measurement is not limited only to the field of management. Higher I-RoC usually is a reflection of superior quality of an underlying business such as, high earnings growth, superior pricing power and hence higher operating margin as well as higher working capital efficiency, says ArunaGiri N, CEO & Fund Manager, TrustLine Holdings.

Edelweiss has picked Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, Britannia and Pidilite as evergreen stocks in the largecap space, and sees D-Mart as a rising star.

While doing stock selection, one should focus on I-RoCE as it reflects a management’s capability to redeploy incremental capital for superior returns (only 25 per cent BSE500 companies, excluding banks, could do this) and it is also a better tool to assess new capital allocation decisions made of CEOs. 

“Companies with high I-RoCE have outperformed Nifty & BSE500 with an alpha of around 11-14 per cent CAGR over 10 years,” Edelweiss said.




A sectoral RoCE analysis done by the brokerage threw up media and entertainment, textiles, retail and building materials with superior I-RoCE, while industrials, metals and mining, cement, tea, coffee, sugar, real estate and electrical equipment showed deterioration on this count."

10,2018-05-14,Britannia,"Just a day before the Fortis board was to meet last week to shortlist a suitor for the company from four contenders, a quartet of directors wrote to shareholders to take an “informed decision” while voting on the resolution seeking their removal at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on May 22. The ouster concerned Brian W Tempest, Harpal Singh, Sabina Vaisoha and Lt General Tejinder S Shergill, who have been under fire from minority investors such as East Bridge Capital and Jupiter India Fund for failing to exercise fiduciary duties towards all shareholders and maintain expected levels of corporate governance. 

Some like ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who owns 1% of the company, gave public expression to a view held by many when he told ET last month, “What is the sanctity of a board appointed by a group who are no longer shareholders of the company?” 

Consider the facts. Harpal Singh, father-in-law of Malvinder Singh, chairs the board. Tempest is a former managing director of Ranbaxy, the former flagship pharma company of the Singh family, while Vaisoha and Shergill are old Singh family friends. Between them, they are to preside over some of the biggest corporate decisions that India’s second-largest healthcare chain is undertaking in the middle of its deepest crisis; all the while Singh brothers Malvinder and Shivinder –former promoters of the chain – are under investigation by various government and private agencies for alleged financial misappropriation. 

Elsewhere, in March, the boardroom of India’s largest private lender, ICICI Bank, decided to hunker down, expressing “full faith and confidence” in chief executive Chanda Kochhar. Kochhar faces allegations of quid pro quo involving businessman Venugopal Dhoot — whose struggling Videocon group is a large debtor to ICICI Bank — and is under the scanner for windfall gains by husband Deepak. 

Credit rating agency Fitch warned of “potential risk of financial penalties, as well as legal action,” if the government’s investigation into Deepak Kochhar’s business dealings came up with findings against the bank. The probe continues and so does Chanda Kochhar, at her post. “We have lately seen that many boards have not been able to play their roles well,” says Harsh Mariwala, chairman, Marico. 

“The onus is on the chairman and the nomination and remuneration committee (NRC), especially where there is reputational risk involved, such as in the case of ICICI Bank. Indian boards are evolving in a way, and this is a learning curve. The truth may well be that she (Kochhar) is innocent, but let an independent inquiry prove that. Board members need not feel obligated to anybody or buckle under pressure. Things have to change now.” “The task of a good board is never easy,” adds Harsh Goenka, chairman, RPG Group. “In case of issues of conflict of interest, get independent investigations done.” 

Once India’s technology bellwether, Infosys lost its chief executive last year to allegations by minority shareholder and founding promoter NR Narayana Murthy. Murthy questioned moves by CEO Vishal Sikka that seemed to have raised no alerts in subsequent audits. The board that had stood by its CEO was dissolved. Several corporate boards have been under scrutiny. 

“We have all been complicit while accepting the repeated extensions to YC Deveshwar and AM Naik in ITC and L&T, well past the company’s own charter or, in some cases, even the law governing retirement age,” accepts a former board member on condition of anonymity. It’s the Indian mentality, argues Nawshir Mirza, one of the few outspoken independent directors in India Inc. 

“We can’t take dissent and any criticism is taken as a person affront. That is the same with our boards… I am sorry to say, but I have seen many big names sitting like quiet mice on boards. If there is an issue, have the guts to flag it or look into it and be ready to be chucked off the board.” 


SYSTEMIC ISSUES The problem often starts at the very beginning — in appointment of members. Most global boards go through headhunters and search firms to hire independent directors. Election is after exhaustive diligence and based purely on merit. In India, though, it is still ad hoc. 

“With predominantly promoter-driven companies, the practice of appointing independent directors has largely been about who you know and feel comfortable with. So, the tendency is to assemble an easy board,” says Vinita Bali, former chief executive, Britannia Industries, and an independent director at global firms such as Bunge and Novartis, among others. In cases, the long tenures of independent board members have been self-defeating. Much of this stems from role clarity, feels M Damodaran, former chairman, Sebi. 

“The board should understand what its role is and so should the management. Both should play their bit… Boards needs to discharge their responsibilities, be better constituted and everyone — including the government — needs to step back and allow them to run the organisation. Their job is to address difficult questions, not to stay away like many government nominees on several boards these days.” 

In the developed markets of Europe and the US, a chairman manages the board while the CEO runs the business. 

Vikram Pandit got his marching orders — even after he steered a floundering Citigroup Inc out of the squalls of the 2008 crisis — for failing to take his board into confidence. Uber Technologies founder Travis Kalanick had to leave the company he created and even the late Steve Jobs, father of the Macintosh computer, was once fired from what was then Apple Computer Inc.

In 2017, Richard Cousins of Compass resigned from the Tesco board because he reportedly disagreed with the decision to acquire Booker, a cash-and-carry chain. The company still went ahead with the acquisition, but the episode is treated as an example in the UK, of how directors should take calls and exercise independence. 

“Both in the US and the UK, being an independent director is a profession by itself,” quips Roddy Martin, partner & head of corporate, India at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. “Directors are incentivised to exercise their independence for the sake of their reputation.” The other systemic issue, feels Bali, is the time that independent directors spend on board-related work and the remuneration they get. 

“Global boards usually have more meetings — six in a year and four to six conference calls. The expectation, time commitment and remuneration are higher,” she says. 

Biocon chariperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw an independent member of several boards, feels a culture of over-governance is taking over from one of little governance. 

“We are going from one extreme to another. Everyone wants to drown out the sound of the board members, who have been nominated to do a job… Independent members know only as much as the management shares with them, so the board may ask tough questions but accountability should rest with the management.” The management, executive directors and independent directors, though, can’t be treated at a par, believes Rahul Bajaj, head, Bajaj Group. 

“If genuine entrepreneurs and independent directors have to keep looking over their shoulders all the time, it will discourage good independent directors from joining boards and will make Indian industry less competitive globally,” he warns.


GLASNOST ACTIVISM Since the Companies Act of 2013, the role and responsibility of company directors have increased manifold. The recent Kotak Committee Report on Corporate Governance, accepted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), assigns criminal culpability. Other recommendations include limiting chairmanship to non-executive directors, splitting the roles of chairman and CEO and increasing the number of board meetings to five. 

“Till recently, Indian boards have operated like a club. The rules on paper are only useful if they can be implemented in spirit,” cautions Mariwala. But all promoters are not always looking at rubber stamps, feels Amit Tandon, founder, Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) and a member of the 20-strong Kotak Committee. “People are indeed raising issues and there are an increasing number of promoters who are looking at value additions from the board as they have a generational view towards their businesses,” he points out. 

“Things are changing, but I wish they changed a little faster.” Earlier this year, when a director at one marquee private bank brought up the question of succession planning, as per the new law, the entire boardroom fell uncomfortably silent. 

How could they ask their friend, the founder, to plan for someone to take his place? When the regulation of having at least one woman director came about, many promoters asked if their wives or daughters could join the board but many such proposals were rebuffed. 

Activism among minority shareholders is gaining prominence as institutional ownership of Indian equities has been steadily on the rise. From Alembic Pharma, Tata Motors, Sesa Sterlite to Jindal Steel, Siemens, Maruti Suzuki, HDFC-Max and United Spirits — diverse issues such as executive remunerations, reappointments, valuations, noncompete fees, merger ratios and related party transactions have all come under the spotlight and been voted on. 

A study by proxy advisory firm InGovern last year showed that in 45 of the top 100 listed companies, there was at least one AGM proposal that received more than 20% of the dissenting votes. Boards, too, have been forced to retract many original resolutions. In most cases, shareholders have failed, but in some — like the Sesa Sterlite merger — they did manage to delay the step for over two years. 

Banker BNP Paribas says activism among shareholders is the highest in Asia as rules like the consent of “majority of minority” shareholders have given teeth to the ranks. At Fortis, for example, following shareholder protests, the board had to expand to accommodate three new members for improving transparency and governance. There was dissent when the board decided to go with a bid from the Munjal-Burman family, thereby exposing fissures within. 


“Directors have to do due diligence before they accept companies they take on,” points out Haigreve Khaitan, managing partner, Khaitan & Co. “Quit if you want to simply attend a few meetings.” But for some, even that’s not enough, as in the case of a former chief financial officer of a leading technology company, who was on the board of Nirav Modi’s eponymous diamond company. With the promoter on the run after defrauding Punjab National Bank of Rs 13,700 crore, directors are now facing the music from investigative agencies. The bank accounts of at least three independent directors have been frozen and, as one of them puts it, “It’s a struggle to even buy milk in the morning.” He can possibly seek solace from Keshub Mahindra’s three-decade-old woes in the Union Carbide Bhopal tragedy case."

Nifty50 forms indecisive candle 
The Nifty50 on Monday traded in a narrow range to eventually settle the day flat. The index made an indecisive small bearish candle resembling 'Doji' on the daily chart ahead of the outcome of Karnataka elections. While the event will dominate the market on Tuesday, analysts believe that the 10,830 level would pose as immediate resistance, while a move below 10,770 can trigger short term selloff.

16,2018-05-16,Britannia,"America’s No.1 cheese brand Kraft has disappeared from Indian retail shelves.

Old stocks have not been replenished for a few months even while Kraft Heinz India continues to invest in Complan, its milk drinks brand, for which it has roped in Sourav Ganguly as brand ambassador.

Multiple sources in the industry and trade said the company is withdrawing from the cheese market here. The development comes a few months after French foods giant Danone announced its exit from dairy in India. In response to TOI’s query on Kraft Heinz’s withdrawal from the Indian cheese market, a spokesperson responded, “Kraft Heinz has no comments.”

The Kraft Heinz Company is the fifth-largest food and beverage player in the world with several billiondollar brands, which include Planters, Jell-O, Capri Sun, Classico, Kool-Aid, Lunchables, Maxwell House, Ore-Ida, Oscar Mayer and Philadelphia. The $26-billion company was formed by the merger of Kraft Foods Group and Heinz in 2015.

Although the company has not officially communicated its plans on cheese to distributors, trade sources said, as of now, Kraft Heinz is not taking further orders for production of cheese in India.


Kraft cheese, which was launched with the ‘Say Cheese’ campaign, has not performed according to the company’s expectations. The brand was priced at a near 40% premium to existing brands like Amul and Britannia, which, industry observers said, could have been counter-productive.

On the other hand, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (the maker of Amul) and Parag Milk Foods (owner of Go Cheese) are expanding their production capacities to cater to the growing demand.

Branded cheese is a roughly Rs 2,000-crore market in India, growing at 10-12% annually. Amul is the leading brand with a volume share of around 71%, followed by Britannia (about 17%) and Parag Milk Foods (around 6%)."

27,2018-05-19,Britannia,"The domestic stock market lost steam during the week gone by and slumped due to the twin pressure points of rising bond yields and crude prices along with the rupee crossing the 68 a dollar mark.

Frontline FMCG companies surpassed growth expectations by posting double-digit PAT growth. HUL reported 14.2 per cent rise, while ITC delivered 9.8 per cent increase. Britannia increased PAT by a whopping 25 per cent, which has kept Nifty on a strong wicket.

However, the same is not true for smallcap and midcap stocks. They have been beaten down hard due to the weak sentiment and lesser liquidity in the system amid rising interest rates. Sooner or later, even the heavyweights will correct in line with the smallcap and midcap indices.

Headlines in the media such as ‘Crude on the boil’, ‘Oil a big worry’, ‘Crude to touch $100’, ‘Iran to drive oil prices higher’ – all these indicate sentiments are super bullish, but then that is how tops are made.

The oil chart below shows a contrarian picture that it is time for the bears in crude oil and the bulls will soon run away. The chart is self-explanatory.





Events of the Week
Does the Karnataka conundrum really matter to equity investors? Swinging political fortunes in the Karnataka elections, being the most watched out event of the year, popular media opinions and perceptions were so heated that to the common man the election outcome would have felt like a make-or-break event.

But Mr Market is far more mature and is really not bothered about the outcome of the state elections, save the shortlived kneejerk reactions.


Technical Outlook
The market has made an intermediate top by forming a shooting star. Lack of momentum since the previous few weeks had signalled fatigue in the market, but eventually a shooting star pattern confirmed the top.

Other smallcap and midcap indices are still weak and expected to make a bottom sooner than the Nifty50.

We will assess at that time when the bottom is made. Currently, the market is expected to head lower.

Traders should not short but wait for lower levels to create long positions.





Expectations for the Week
The market will remain extremely volatile with a corrective bias since majority of the earnings season is mostly over and there is a worry of rising interest rates. US bonds yields are kissing their seven-year highs, and there is no reason why it can’t still go higher. This will keep the market under pressure. Panic will strike if and when US bond yields reach the 4 per cent mark, but till that time, it will certainly have negative influences.

Look out for key results next week such as that of Cipla, Bosch, MGL, Dr Reddy’s and IOC and the outcome of the Karnataka floor test, which will add to existing volatility. Investors are expected to be on the sidelines till clarity emerges. The Nifty50 closed the week at 10,596, down 1.94 per cent for the week."

The revenue growth was driven by double-digit volume growth in the domestic business.  Gross margin expansion was muted at 50bps, led by Dairy and International business. Outlook remains stable as fall in sugar prices should offset the rise in other inputs. EBITDA margin expansion was healthy at 190bps, led by cost savings, which we believe should continue given the sharper focus on cost reduction initiatives. Recovery in volume to double-digit growth is a positive and indicates Britannia’s increasing dominance. Further share gains in Rural/Hindi belt, plans to enter new food categories and margin improvement offer high visibility on growth and earnings.Steady visibility on growth and earnings; Maintain ACCUMULATE: Britannia’s initiatives to increase market share in rural and Hindi Belt along with cost-saving initiatives offer healthy growth visibility.

34,2018-05-21,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: A consistent performer. Check. An industry beater. Check. A strong legacy. Check.

A large cap stock fetching 10 times returns in 5 years is a rarity. But exceptions remain as this stock proves otherwise. This has been an outlier, rewarding investors quite generously. 

An established leader in packaged food space, Britannia Industries has come a long way. It has proved to be a consistent money spinner for those who have stayed put. 

On May 20, 2013, the stock had stood at Rs 568.3. But that was then. It has now zoomed to Rs 5,587.9, as of Friday's close (May 18) -- a jaw-dropping 883.26 per cent jump. Other than Britannia, only two companies in the S&P BSE 100 pack -- TVS Motor Company and Bajaj Finance -- have fetched over 10 times returns. The benchmark index Sensex has risen only 73 per cent during this window.

With a 100-year legacy, Britannia Industries enjoys annual revenues in excess of Rs 9,000 crore. The company is the manufacturer of brands like Good Day, Tiger, NutriChoice, Milk Bikis and Marie Gold. The product portfolio includes biscuits, bread, cakes, rusk, and other dairy products, including cheese, beverages, milk and yoghurt. 

Its dairy business contributes close to 5 per cent of revenue with a reach of 1,00,000 outlets.

The company has been consistent in its all round-growth. Top line (sales) has clocked an 11 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) in five years. During 2012-13, the figure stood at Rs 5,936 crore, which has gone up to Rs 9,829 crore in 2017-18. 

Bottom line (net profit) saw a 31 per cent jump to Rs 1,004 crore, from Rs 260 crore during the same period. 



The FMCG major has seen a 2.5 times jump in its direct reach. Also, net sales value in rural areas has paced up consistently. 




The company posted a healthy 25 per cent increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs 264 crore for the fourth quarter to March, riding on a double digit volume growth. It had racked up net profit of Rs 211 crore a year ago.

March quarter consolidated net sales, EBITDA and net profit grew 12.5 per cent, 28.9 per cent and 25 per cent to Rs 2,510 crore, Rs 400 crore and Rs 260 crore, respectively. 

Brokerage JM Financial in its report said, ""Revenue was on expected lines while profits were 6 per cent ahead of expectations on the back of significant savings in ‘Other Expenses’, which grew at one-third the rate of growth in volumes. Part of the savings was offset by higher-than-expected rise in staff costs.""

The brokerage, however, finds the quality of growth a little disappointing because of two factors. First, the pace of growth in domestic volumes fell a tad against third quarter (11 per cent against 13 per cent) on a broadly similar base. Second, despite a deflationary trend in sugar and wheat prices, and higher contribution of pricing to growth this quarter, domestic GPM (gross profit margin) felt the squeeze, even though by just 38 bps.

The management, however, cites marginal inflation in key raw material to be the key reason for the same.

According to HDFC Securities, ""the quarter marks the beginning of aggressive product launches (50 products in the next 4-6 quarters) with focus on innovation and premiumisation"".

New launches will lead to category extensions (biscuits, cake, rusk & dairy) and entry into newer categories (croissant), the HDFC Securities report said. Britannia is lining up a capex of nearly Rs 1,000 crore over the next 3 years at Ranjangaon plant to support these launches. With this plant, the company is seen to be focusing on backward integration of dairy (earlier via contract packers) and flour (flour mill for scale). 

The brokerage reels off reasons why it likes the stock.

- Premiumisation (nearly 80 per cent mix of premium biscuits vs industry figure of 55 per cent) 

- Distribution expansion (rural and weak states) 

- Entry into new segments (croissants and other macro snacking products) 

- Cost optimisation (saving of Rs 2,400 crore in FY19 against Rs 2,250 crore in FY18)

Even during tough days, leaders (HUL and Britannia) have stood tall and outperformed their peers in terms of volume and EBITDA growth. 

The HDFC Securities model factors in 25 per cent EPS CAGR over FY18-20E. It has maintained 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 6,020.

""Britannia is one of our favoured consumer themes, but valuations could now pose some near-term headwinds, especially post the recent run-up in the stock,"" said JM Financial. The brokerage has maintained 'buy' on the stock with revised target price of Rs 5,530.

Nirmal Bang Securities is equally positive on the stock. ""We expect the company to maintain healthy growth in FY19-FY20 supported by healthy innovation pipeline and expansion into new categories, continued expansion in Hindi heartland and finally commercialisation of its new greenfield facilities at Guwahati and Mundra SEZ,"" it stated.

It has maintained 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 6,350, based on FY20E EPS, implying an upside of 16 per cent.

The company's international business grew in double digits despite a slowdown in many geographies like the Middle East and Africa. 

Britannia has a presence in more than 60 countries across the globe. Its international footprint includes the Middle East, with the FMCG player being the No 2 biscuit player in the UAE."

31,2018-05-21,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Going is getting tougher for Dalal Street by the day. Rising oil prices, a falling rupee, surging US bond yields and now more political uncertainty following the BJP’s setback in Karnataka, many say, would unite opposition forces, making it harder for Modi to return in 2019.

Headline equity indices Sensex and Nifty shed 2 per cent each during the week gone by, registering their biggest weekly fall in 10 weeks. On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex closed at 34,848, down 301 points or 0.86 per cent. The broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended below the 10,600 level at 10,596, down 86 points or 0.81 per cent.

The market will be volatile in the short term on the back of political uncertainty, higher oil prices and weak global markets, says Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan. “We continue to be positive on select counters such as financials and consumption with Bajaj Finance, Britannia, HUL and YES Bank being on our buy list,” he said.

Like Jani, many other analysts feel any dips in this market should be used for picking stocks.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock ideas that they say can potentially deliver gains over the next three weeks.

The Nifty50 index failed to cross the previous day’s high and corrected towards the 10,420 level on Wednesday. It formed a bearish candle on daily chart and witnessed sharp selling in the later part of the session.

It was making lower highs and lower lows for last six sessions and was not ready to surpass any immediate resistance. Now if it sustains below 10,500 level, then weakness could drag it towards 10,350-10,333 zone. The index needs to negate the formation of lower highs and lower lows in order to get any short-term stability, else weakness could persist.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,500, followed by 10,400, while maximum Call OI was at 10,800 followed by strike price 11,000. There was significant Call writing at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,600, which shift its resistance lower while Put unwinding happened at 10,500 and fresh Put writing was seen at 10,400.

Options data suggests a shift in lower trading range between 10,350 and 10,550 levels. India VIX moved up 4.10 per cent to 14.16 level.

Bank Nifty remained rangebound compared with a sharp 100-point decline in Nifty50. The index has broken and closed near its three-day support at 10,700. If it forms a bearish candle and holds below 25,700, that could take Nifty towards 25,500 and then 25,250 levels, while on the upside, hurdles exist in the 25,950-26,000 zone.

51,2018-05-26,Britannia,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first four years in office have been anything but smooth, with the economy witnessing its own share of ups and downs. 

Benchmarks Sensex and Nifty breezed past 36,000 and 11,000, respectively, this January -- that's a first. And investors smiled. 

But macros worsened from time to time. Expectations were skyhigh when Modi came to power in May 2014. Things have just got a little harder since. 

To give the credit where it's due, planning and policy execution have been the talking points in a few cases. 

Which is to say, there are hits and misses. Let's map them. 


Sensex, Nifty and other major indices

Midcaps as well as smallcaps created huge wealth for investors on Dalal Street during the past four years. The BSE Midcap rallied 87 per cent whereas the smallcap index soared 92 per cent during the same period. Benchmark NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex advanced 44 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, during May 26, 2014, and May 25, 2018.





Top largecap multibaggers


As many as 15 largecap stocks from FMCG space, NBFCs and auto sector rallied more than 3-fold during the past four years. Bajaj Finance skyrocketed 964 per cent during the last four years, followed by Bajaj Finserv (581 per cent), Britannia Industries (570 per cent), Ashok Leyland (355 per cent) and TVS Motor (354 per cent).


Top small and midcap money multipliers


Small and midcap stocks rallied up to 9,577 per cent during these four years. Ducon Infratechnologies jumped to Rs 30 on May 25 this year, from Rs 0.31 on May 26 in 2014. Other stocks, including Uniply Industries, Medicamen Biotech, V2Retal, Minda Industries, KEI Industries, Avanti Feeds and Indiabulls Ventures, rallied up to 7,234 per cent during the same window.


Institutional investments
 

Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) overtook foreign portfolio investors (FPI) in terms of net investment in domestic equity markets over the past four years. DIIs pumped in Rs 2.11 lakh crore in equities since 2014 whereas FPIs invested Rs 1.86 lakh crore. This year, DII inflow is 45 times higher than FPI inflows. FPIs have poured Rs 1,027 crore in equities in 2018 so far whereas DIIs have invested Rs 46,649 crore.


Reforms
 
Jimeet Modi of Samco Securities sees implementation of goods and services tax (GST), IBC and recapitalisation plan for addressing the NPA issue, FDI in defence and railways, controlled inflation and improving business environment as hits for Modi. On the other hand, he believes demonetisation, slower GDP growth, lacklustre growth in jobs and lagging private investment as misses.


GDP
 
India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.3 per cent between fiscals 2015 and 2018, a tad lower than 7.5 per cent in the previous five years, according to a Crisil report. This is in spite of the two big domestic disruptors of demonetisation and GST which pulled down growth in fiscal 2018, and an environment of monetary and fiscal restraint. 

“While the economy had witnessed higher growth rates before the NDA government’s regime, it was on the back of unsustainable policy stimulus,” said Crisil.


Fiscal deficit
 
Barring the stress in fiscal 2018, when the fiscal deficit slipped to 3.5 per cent of GDP from the budgeted 3.2 per cent, the NDA regime has seen fiscal consolidation. According to Crisil, from an average 5.2 per cent of GDP between fiscals 2010 and 2014, the figure came down to 3.8 per cent between fiscals 2014 and 2018, helped by fortuitous winds from lower crude oil prices, which reduced the oil subsidy burden and hike in excise duties on petrol and diesel. In the absence of such hikes, the fiscal deficit between fiscals 2014 and 2018 would have been on an average 80 bps higher.


Current account deficit



India’s current account deficit (CAD) has almost halved in the past four years, compared with the previous five. While most of the decline in CAD can be attributed to good fortune, given a decline in oil and commodity prices, some policy measures such as curbs on gold imports also helped moderate the deficit, Crisil said. 

However, with oil prices trending up, CAD has started rising again from 2017-18. A rise in core imports (non-oil, non-gold imports) has also exerted upward pressure as domestic industry – hit by the twin disruptions of demonetisation and GST – could not cater to the demand.


Investments
 
Investments have remained weak in the past few years. The investment rate or share of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in GDP has come down from an average 33.6 per cent between fiscals 2010 and 2014 to 31 per cent between fiscals 2015 and 2018. The slowdown is largely attributed to lower household investments in housing and subdued private sector investment due to poor capacity utilisation and debt overhang.


Lower export growth




Export growth on average has tumbled to -0.2 per cent on-year in the past four years compared with 14 per cent in the preceding five. Both external and domestic -- mainly GST-led -- factors contributed to the slowdown."

56,2018-05-29,Britannia,"Milind Karmarkar, Head-research, Dalal & Broacha Stock Broking, sees a consumption boom taking hold in India. This, he says, will come on the back of a spike in per capita GDP. The consumer behaviour analyst explains to ET Now how his faith in Trent and Titan has paid off.
Edited excerpts:


What do you think of the future of consumption in India? 
As our GDP grows, the per capita income should correspondingly go up. I see another 3.5x growth in the per capita GDP of India. That will mean our per capita income will be somewhere around $6,000 effectively or around $25,000 for a family of four. In US, that is the poverty line and entire India will be above US’s poverty line and then look at the kind of consumption boom which can come in. That is what I am banking on. I still believe this is not the end. This is just the beginning for anything to do with consumption.


You are anchoring your portfolio around the fact that Indians will consume more. You got to buy anything which has got to do with consumption.
That is correct but when we say consumption, it is not focussed only on the retail or FMCG or white goods. They do form an important part, but then there is insurance, banks and pharmaceuticals and there can also be insurance, that I have already spoken about. Hospitals could be the other theme. There are a whole lot of sectors which come under consumption.


Let us talk about retail first. You bought into Trent 15 years ago. At that time, online retail was not there. Walmart has voted for the online format and has bought Flipkart. The biggest retailer in the world is not going for offline model they are going for online model. Why are you bullish on the Indian retail mode?
But then Amazon is going for a brick and mortar buyouts as well. When it comes to online, it will be one of the ways in which we buy. I am sure many of them like Trent or Titan or the Future Group will go online at some point in time. And then, there will be one more additional space from where you can buy the stock.


Is it an urban legend that you bought into Trent 15 years ago or is it actually true?
It is true. It was trading at Rs 60, a Rs 10 paid up share and they had just got money from the sale of Lakme. They had announced that they want to go into retail. We thought that organised retail was a great idea for India. There were very few players at that time. So, we decided to go and talk to them. As we talked to them, there was nothing much which they could say except that their focus was going to be on organised retail. 

We looked at countries around. We looked at the US and we realised that over a longer period, organised retail has got a huge scope and even one more point was that at that point in time. Trent had Rs 70 cash in the balance sheet and it was available for Rs 60 or Rs 62. So, it was virtually a no-brainer. That is why we went and bought it. The market probably at that time thought that the money will be lost but we thought the other way around. We bought it and we just held on to it.


You have got no reason for locking or booking out of Trent even after 15 years?
As I said, I see another 3.5x growth in the per capita GDP of India. I do not have any reason. It is just an anecdotal thing that in the recent Berkshire AGM, Warren Buffett was talking about investing in stocks. He said in 1942, what was required was only a belief that America will do well over a longer period of time. The same thing is true in India also. You need to believe that India will do well irrespective of what is happening at the current juncture at any given point.


You do not think Trent is trying to spread themselves too thin because they are present in the hypermarket format which is the kiranawala or sabjiwala format? They have Westside that is another format. They have come out with the low-end fashion brand. For a company of that size, aren’t they trying to spread themselves too thin?
Each of these segments has got a huge opportunity -- be it Zudio, be it Westside or be it Star Bazaar. Of course, Zara is their joint venture. Each of this segment in its individual capacity can be a very big business over a longer period of time. Who knows over a period they may spin off these businesses. I do not know whether they will do that but that is a possibility.


Just a personal belief.
Yes, it is a personal belief. Second thing is it is not a recommendation. We are just discussing certain stocks which I like and which I hold over a longer period of time.


You have been very bullish on the entire food space in India. What is the best way to participate in that space?
There are many companies which are in that space. It could be a company like Britannia or Prataap Snacks which is a new entrant. I have not looked at the company but one needs to look at these companies. There could be DFM Foods. There is a Nestle, there is HUL, there is ITC. There are a huge number of companies. Individuals need to work on the numbers or look at the kind of opportunity which is there and then take a call and buy these stocks.


Buffett now seems to be acknowledging that the margins in the package food business or the diary business or the food business are getting diluted and retailers will have a strong say and not the manufacturers. What could that do to companies like Britannia, HUL and ITC because these companies are built around brands and somehow the brands are losing their mojo?
I really do not know whether it will happen over next 10-15 years or may be over 25-30 years. But it will happen because as of now, in India, these companies are much stronger than the retailers themselves. When retailers become extremely strong like what happened in the United States, it took nearly 50 years for that to change. It can happen in India as well but the size of opportunity will not come down.


Typically, when you value a business, you are not in a rush to buy something cheap. How do you judge the potential of the business? If you are buying gold at the price of diamond or silver, it may not be a good investment. How did you convince yourself when you bought Titan or Trent or Britannia for the first time because they were never cheap also.
I will give you the example of Titan. When I bought Titan, the turnover was roughly about Rs 800 crore. Dalal & Broacha’s main mentor was Mr Priyakant Dalal. I trained under him. He used to tell me that your investment should be such that the amount you invest, after 20 years should give you similar dividend. Keeping that apart, what happened was basically you need to think your right side of the brain should work much more than your left side of the brain. You should be able to visualise how large the opportunity is and then have a belief that based on the corporate governance the promoters have. Find out if there is a clear-cut distinction between management and shareholders? Can the company deliver a long-term growth? You just buy and sit on it and then, keep monitoring. 

It is not that you just buy and forget about it. You keep monitoring. One or two years of bad performance is fine but if it goes beyond that, then you need to be serious. Otherwise, just hold on to the stock. Coming back to Rs 800 crore, this year’s PBT is Rs 1600 crore. It is two times the turnover 15 years back.


So you still believe in the classic buy and hold which is a rarity in today’s market.
People do say that buy and hold no longer works but I think it still works, at least in a country like India where we are still at $1700 per capita GDP.


You are saying that when you bought a stock, you were able to visualise the potential of the business and what India could be or where the potential of consumer is…
I think fantasize is a better word than visualise…


Of course, but when you bought into Titan it was a watch company. There was no jewellery business.
That was the time when they announced that they are getting into jewellery. So, we bought Titan not because of watches but because of jewellery.


In markets, you do not make money by betting on yesterday’s growth. You have to identify tomorrow’s winner. Where do you think the potential of this kind of dynamic change or growth potential or exponential demand could kick in?
There is a big opportunity in hospitals. Last time also, we talked about hospitals. They have not gone anywhere. Maybe they have come down…


But isn’t that against your grain because hospital is a very asset-heavy model?
There are companies which are getting into asset-light model in hospitals and when it comes to consumption, poor people typically spend nearly 10% to 20% of their income in healthcare. So hospitals which provide the lowest cost services should do pretty well over a longer period of time. The same thing is true for insurance also. Insurance has just started picking up in India and there is a huge opportunity going forward.


The news is that now the government is committed to bringing the healthcare cost down. First, heart operations were capped in terms of pricing, then knee operations. The Delhi Government has just come out with regulations capping the maximum prices that the hospitals can charge for drugs and other stuff. It started with Delhi but this will be an all-India rule as well. This clearly means that there would be a cap on margins and profitability for hospitals. 
Hospitals need to focus on reducing their costs and if they can do that, a decent margin is still possible.


Would you be going for specialist hospitals or with pan-India hospitals?
I will be going in for pan-India hospitals and I will also be going in for the lowest cost service providers in that particular speciality or in general.


But just to take a hint from what is happening in Fortis right now, the fact that there are multiple bidders and everybody is upping their price on a daily basis, it clearly means that genuine long-term investors and good entrepreneurs understand the potential of the healthcare sector.
The same thing had happened in retail also at that time. In 2003, there were so many people who wanted to get into retail. Many of them ultimately lost out but yes the opportunity was there. Same thing is going to happen in hospitals also. I am sure many of them will be bought over or there will be mergers but there will be three-four good players which will continue and do well over the longer period.


When you say insurance, it is again a very complicated space. There is life insurance, general insurance, re-insurance. Within life insurance, there are companies which are giving ULIP-based models and stock market linked models.
Which I do not like.


So, you like life insurance, you like general insurance?
I prefer general insurance.


Why is that?
It is simple. Every year you know what is you P&L so there would be one bad year but that is fine. At the end of the year, you know how good or bad the company is."
55,2018-05-29,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The usual market fireworks that mark the arrival of monsoon in Kerala are conspicuous by their absence this time around.

There was hardly any life in stock benchmarks this morning, which ruled flat.

The big news came from a bunch of monsoon stocks, which have rallied ever since the IMD predicted normal monsoon for this year on April 16. This list includes FMCG scrips such as Colgate Palmolive, Hindustan Unilever and Dabur India, tractor maker M&M and fertiliser producers such as GNFC and Punjab Chemicals. 

A normal monsoon boosts farm income and brings into spotlight FMCG, farm equipment, consumer durables and two-wheeler players. Even banks and NBFCs with a focus on rural areas and chemical and fertiliser companies get a leg-up. Keep tracking, say analysts. 

Last couple of years, urban volume growth has remained resilient at mid-single digit levels, but rural growth weakened after FY14. This continued to be the case till the June quarter of FY18, which was hit by supply disruptions ahead of GST implementation, said Motilal Oswal Securities in a note.

""The recovery in the past three quarters has happened despite disruptions in the wholesale channel due to GST implementation. The wholesale channel acts as a feeder for almost the entire rural demand in the sector,"" the brokerage pointed out.

This year, select monsoon-linked stocks have rallied up to 20 per cent since April 16 -- when the IMD prediction came -- compared with 2 per cent jump on the BSE Sensex. 



GNFC, which manufactures urea and other organic fertilisers, rose 17.50 per cent in the just over one month. 

Colgate-Palmolive went up 15 per cent during the period. The company has guided for 4-5 per cent volume growth, but analysts see more upside as the oral care company's family pack segment (CDC) may see an uptick with rural recovery. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Dabur India have also added 10-11 per cent during this period.

""We have buy ratings on all four stocks that have high rural exposure – HUL, Colgate-Palmolive, Dabur India (Dabur) and Emami. HUL and Emami remain our top rural picks from a medium term perspective,"" brokerage Motilal Oswal said. Shares of Emami have dropped 6 per cent since April 16.

""While Britannia is currently an urban company (rural is only around 20 per cent of sales), a combination of its efforts in distribution ramp-up -- both in direct and total reach -- over the past four years and its success in its new strategy of low unit packs of its premium products as well as ‘Tiger’ Creams have resulted in tremendous growth in the hinterland states... with FY18 being particularly strong,"" the brokerage noted. 

This stock has moved up 10 per cent during the said period.

""With a normal monsoon and higher MSP along with improved procurement, we expect rural consumption to continue to accelerate,"" JM Financial said in a strategy note.

Tractor maker Mahindra & Mahindra has advanced 6 per cent. Increasing mechanisation in India is leading to a structural shift towards the higher HP segment where M&M is ahead of the curve with the presence of two products already, said Edelweiss Securities. Mechanisation will hence accelerate growth and enhance profitability for M&M, the brokerage predicted.

The June quarter accounts for nearly 80 per cent of water requirements for agriculture crops, said analysts. The monsoon turned out to be normal in 2016 and 2017.

Barring IFB Industries, the consumer durable lost ground in the last one month. A few nitrogenous and phosphatic-based fertiliser stocks have fallen 15-16 per cent during the period. Will they get back their mojo, going ahead?

""There is demand for consumer durables, two wheelers, four wheelers, tractors and even capital goods because of two years of suppressed demand, GST and demonetisation. We had good monsoons. That pent-up demand is reflected just now. But beyond this, there is no real trigger for the broader market to do well,"" Pradip P Shah, Chairman at IndAsia Fund Advisors, told ET Now."

61,2018-05-31,Britannia,"Overseas portfolio investors, or FIIs, have been largely bearish on Indian equities so far in 2018. But there are a few companies FIIs would not desert no matter how bad the future outlook gets.

For last 40 quarters, FII holdings in nearly 100 companies from the BSE500 index have been hovering above their mean and median. No marks for guessing, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is the most favoured firm among them all. 

FIIs held 74 per cent stake in the country’s biggest mortgage lender as of March 2018 compared with the median and mean of 73.40 per cent and 69 per cent in last 40 quarters, data available with corporate database Ace Equity showed. Shares of HDFC have grown nearly 275 per cent in last 10 years.

HDFC reported strong growth in loan disbursement for March quarter as well as for FY18. Reliance Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,372.

Then there are a couple of private lenders FIIs seem to be backing steadfastly. They include HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and City Union Bank. At the end of March, 2018, FII holding in each one of these was higher than the median and mean holdings of past 10 years. 



“I would stick with HDFC Bank, because it has got the balance sheet strength to move into the corporate space and take up market share, which has been vacated by PSB banks,” Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities, told ETNow in an interaction.

Foreign portfolio investors have been rather cautious on Indian equities this year, having been net sellers in 32 out of 40 sessions till May 29; meaning they offloaded more shares than what they bought on all these days.

FIIs’ net outflow so far in 2018 has been Rs 640 crore against total net DII inflow of over Rs 48,000 crore. 

A shift in yield dynamics between the developing and developed world, weakness in emerging market currencies against the greenback, softer earnings growth, concern over corporate governance issues and political risks ahead of the general elections in 2019 are some of the factors that have kept FIIs jittery. 



Auto companies Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra and Mahindra, Eicher Motors also have pride of place on the list of FII favourites. Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied over 9,500 per cent in last 10 years, while those of Maruti Suzuki have jumped over 1,000 per cent in the same period. Global brokerage Credit Suisse is ‘neutral’ on Maruti Suzuki with a target price of Rs 9,800.

Jefferies recently upgraded its target price for M&M to Rs 975 from Rs 860 earlier. “Mahindra & Mahindra is among our preferred rural picks and FY19 growth outlook remains positive across tractors, LCVs and PVs,” the brokerage said.

FII holdings in pharma firms IPCA Laboratories, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Jubilant Life Sciences at the end of March quarter were nearly the same as the average and median of the previous 40 quarters.

Centrum Broking has maintained a ‘hold’ rating on Dr Reddy’s Labs with a target price of Rs 2,000 (earlier Rs 2,450). The stock traded at Rs 1,983 on May 29.

Several midcap stocks, many of which have been multibaggers in recent months, such as Astral Poly Technik, Page Industries, Kajaria Ceramics, Supreme Industries, Britannia Industries, Motherson Sumi System, Balkrishna Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, SRF, Shilpa Medicare, Phillips Carbon Black and Titan Company too figure on the list of top 100 FII favourite companies in India. Even in the most bearish times, these overseas investors have rarely sold shares on these counters.

Edelweiss Investment Research is positive on Phillips Carbon Black with a target price of Rs 328, indicating an upside of over 30 per cent from current level. 

Cholamandalam Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on Balkrishna Industries with a target price of Rs 1,327. Shares of Balkrishna Industries are up over 1,600 per cent in last 10 years.

FIIs are also looking confident on oil and gas majors Petronet LNG, Hindustan Petroleum, Gujarat State Petronet, IGL and Bharat Petroleum. At the end of March quarter, their stakes in these companies were higher than their mean and median holdings of last 10 years."

2,2018-06-06,Britannia,"When the broader economy is not firing, look beyond. There may be a glimmer of hope in the hinterland.

Going by some of the early indicators, rural India appears to be on the cusp of a rebound and companies focused on rural demand should be able to boost your portfolio through these depressed times.

Two-wheeler sales, considered a good proxy for rural demand, crossed 20 million units for the first time in FY18, hinting at demand revival down there.

Analysts say a resurge in rural demand may help boost topline growth of the Rs 3.4 lakh crore fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector by 300-400 basis points to 11-12 per cent this financial year.

The FMCG sector is likely to report 11-12 per cent revenue growth for financial year 2019, up 300-400 basis points from 8 per cent reported for financial year 2018. A revival in rural demand and new product launches powered this growth, domestic rating agency Crisil said in a report on May 8.

Why are two-wheeler sales important for India Inc?

IIFL said a consistent rise in two-wheeler sales hints at a revival in rural discretionary spending power. As rural India constitutes a major chunk of two-wheeler sales, it is a good indicator to judge the health of consumption in the hinterland. 

After the 2016-end slump, the numbers have looked up and Indian two-wheeler manufacturers have cumulatively surpassed 20 million units sales in FY18.
“On fast moving consumer goods as well, manufacturers and distributors have reported momentum in earnings. Going forward, guidance for rural revenues is upbeat,” IIFL said in a report.

There are expectations that rural India may get a further boost from higher minimum support prices (MSP) to announced by the Centre besides a favourable monsoon and more non-agriculture rural employment, which will in turn increase disposable income of farmers, leading to a consumption boom.

Projections of a normal monsoon this year, accompanied by a hike in minimum support prices (MSP), will incentivise better agricultural output. For this year, crop MSP would be determined at 150 per cent of input costs, including rent and unpaid labour. 

“It is estimated that on an average MSP will rise 15 per cent for all crops, compared with around 4-8 per cent rise over the past few years. Growing sales of agri-inputs such as fertilisers and tractors corroborate higher agricultural output. Indisputably, rural wage growth and disposable incomes would receive a boost,” IIFL said.

Crisil says revenue growth from the rural segment, which contributes 40-45 per cent of total income of the FMCG sector, should improve to 15-16 per cent in financial year 2019 compared with 10 per cent estimated for financial year 2018.

Growth has recovered partially from the 5 percentage point range seen during FY16 and FY17.

FMCG players posted decent earnings for March quarter, 2018. Hindustan Unilever has reported 14.2 per cent YoY increase in standalone net profit to Rs 1,351 crore in Q4 of FY18, driven by a strong double-digit volume growth.

“With trade channels stabilising and demand environment improving (especially in rural India), we expect the volume growth momentum to sustain at 7-9 per cent levels in the coming quarters,” Sharekhan said.

The brokerage is positive on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,650.

ITC posted a 9.86 per cent increase in standalone profit at Rs 2,932 crore for March quarter. The company had reported Rs 2,669.47 crore profit for the January-March last year. 

Sharekhan is bullish on ITC with a target price of Rs 325. “With demand for consumer goods improving in rural India, we expect non-cigarette FMCG business to maintain double-digit revenue growth momentum in the coming quarters (revenue will also be driven by an increase in scale of business of few categories),” the brokerage said.

Britannia Industries reported 25 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 264 crore for the fourth quarter ended on March 31, 2018, on the back of double-digit volume growth. The company had reported Rs 211 crore profit for the same period of last financial year. HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on Britannia with a target price of Rs 6,020."

Britannia, with its improving operational efficiencies and aggressive strategies in expanding its distribution, is moving up the value chain and capturing more market share. At CMP, Rs. 5877 per share, the stock is currently trading at 50.3x FY20E EPS. We value the company at 54.0x FY20E EPS (marginally above the 5 year average 1 year forward P/E) with “HOLD” rating and arrive at target price of Rs. 6306 with an upside of 7%. However, increase in raw material prices and competition from other players will be the key risks to earnings growth."

As a Holland fan, the World Cup has never been very kind to me. Three losses in the final, twice in the semis. There were many moments when they dazzled -- like in the last World Cup in Brazil where they decimated defending champions Spain 5-1. But they are yet to win the Cup. 2018 is another year they won’t. Why? Well, they didn’t even qualify. Then we have this team — of 40-yearolds pretending to play football, playing 6-a-side for almost 10 years. We play once a week, but talk football every day. It’s one of those weird WhatsApp groups that comes alive at 1.30 am on Champions League nights.

So, when this World Cup in Russia was approaching, somebody suggested we go. My face fell. A World Cup without Holland. Then the Marwari blood injected into me through marriage acted up and told me: This is a killer deal! Go all the way to Russia to watch games, and seeing your team lose yet again is masochism.

Given that this time Holland weren’t going to be there, I had nothing to lose. I had become the ultimate neutral, the one who just wants to see great football! Fifa had been selling tickets through Tatkal systems, lucky draw systems, talent hunts, ice bucket challenges etc on its website. We waited for November 16 when the ticket window opened at 2 pm IST. Fifteen people whose organisations had placed implicit faith in their work ethic looked at their computer screens from 1.45 pm onwards. The site was loading and we were ready to book.

Supro, the self-proclaimed gang leader started barking instructions. Shocky, the understated nice guy, started listening to Aashiqui 2. Jeet, the banker, started sending positive quotes. Anubhav, our fat footballer, was bouncing in joy. Lionel, the mathematician, was working on five computers at once. Prakhar, the film producer, wore his Arsenal jersey. Passport numbers flew here and there. Dates of births too.

At 1.58 pm, we all sang ‘You’ll never walk alone’, and as the seconds ticked, we were all welcomed to a new web page which said, you are in the queue and your estimate waiting time is more than an hour. It was like a kick in the adenoids from Roberto Carlos. Then as hell broke loose and we started abusing Fifa, Shocky managed to get through and found us four tickets for the semis in Moscow, and some more tickets for the 4th round in Sochi. Anubhav got 4 tickets for the Sochi quarterfinals. Everyone else just kept waiting... until we defied odds and got tickets for all of us.

Then came the rest of the planning. Russia has done some nifty things this World Cup for the convenience of spectators. First, they sent a Fan ID, a free identification card to all ticket holders, by post. This can be used instead of a visa for all World Cup ticket holders. So no lengthy trips to the consulate. Trains within Russia for the matches are free for spectators, too.

So here we all are, tickets booked, accommodation booked, waiting for June 14th to begin. Ready to storm Moscow, St Petersburg and Sochi. Ready to watch Messi, De Bruyne, Neymar, Salah, Iniesta, Suarez, Modric take the field and slug it out for the ultimate glory. Jogo Bonito!

11,2018-06-11,Britannia,"You could have been forgiven for not putting all your money on Brazil and Ronaldo in 2002. Much like the richly-valued stocks on offer now. The seemingly safe bet on Brazil had not paid off in 1998. But class always tells. Ronaldo shrugged off the meltdown in France to lead Brazil to a fifth World Cup in 2002. The market has been volatile of late, and the fear of losing money on equity bets is not misplaced. Yet select stocks, though expensive, have outperformed amid the turbulence on the Street.

Could ‘richly’ valued stocks act as effective insurance shields in a falling market? The answer is ‘yes’, provided the chosen company has sufficient revenue and profit visibility, and promises to offer superior margins than its peers.

That explains the limited downside for richly valued scrips such as Bajaj Finserv, Britannia Industries, Avenue Supermarts, Jubilant Foodworks, Colgate, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, and Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in a market where receding liquidity could easily call into question growth stories premised on less proven business models. This club of richly valued stocks has, therefore, outperformed the Sensex by 22 per cent since the January high.



For the record, Britannia, Avenue Supermarts, Jubilant Foodworks and HUL are trading at more 50 times their projected earnings of FY19, while Kotak Mahindra and HDFC Bank are trading at more than three and half times their book-value, levels significantly higher than the sector average. Returns on these stocks suggest that high P/E alone would not be the criterion for exiting them. Sustained high valuations for these scrips show that investors give due weight to sustainable earnings growth, brand moat, and a strong franchise.

Higher earnings predictability also dictates how mid and smallcap outliers are valued. In May, when small and midcap indices dropped nearly 10 per cent, Colgate-Palmolive, Varun Beverages, or Jyothy Lab gave returns of 10-16 per cent.

Earnings growth in these stocks has significant predictability, with most of these companies expected to report 20 per cent expansion in profits in the next two years. For instance, Avenue Supermarts’ earnings growth was driven by same-store growth (SSG) and new store additions. The operator of D’Mart stores has increased its outlet count to 155 at the end of FY18 from 55 in FY12, and the impact of store addition is visible in the earnings growth and revenue per square feet.

The revenue per square feet increased to Rs 33,000 in FY18 as against Rs 15,000 in FY12.

The palpable impact of new store additions and double-digit SSG reinforced investor confidence in D’Mart’s earnings growth. Analysts expect D’Mart will add 27 and 30 stores in FY19 and FY20, respectively. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, earnings growths for FY19 and FY20 are expected at 31 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. Avenue Supermarts is trading at 92 times of FY19 projected earnings.

Furthermore, these stocks also have what is called the ‘moat’ premium, meaning a dominant market share in an expanding pie. For instance, HUL has been consistently benefiting from selling more premium products. Similarly, new launches and premiumisation are driving earnings growth at Britannia, which is focused on expanding its bailiwick beyond just cookies to a wide range of food items."

14,2018-06-16,Britannia,"Football requires a team of players, and so does investing, which requires a portfolio of stocks to make outstanding returns. Football and investing, in that sense, are very similar.

A football team is composed of 11 players; attackers or commonly known as forwards, midfielders, defenders and a goalkeeper who work in sync to score goals and defend the territory.

In the same way, an investor’s portfolio should be made up of high-risk, high-return stocks – the forwards in the football terminology, growth stocks – the midfielders, stocks performing in line with the markets - the defenders, and high dividend yield stocks who perform in good or bad times by giving out dividends – the goalkeeper.

When the above combination of stocks is made, then the portfolio can provide protection against loss and at the same time deliver big gains.

The portfolio that we have constructed ideally represents the football game. Hold these stocks till next FIFA to make above-average returns. The cumulative portfolio returns in four years would enable you to attend the next FIFA live at Qatar with your family.

Accordingly, LIC has raised its stake in prominent consumption companies such as Gillette India, Asian Paints, Britannia Industries, and P&G Hygiene, and proxy consumption companies such as Castrol India and Indraprastha Gas by 0.8-2.2 per cent in the March 2018 quarter on a sequential basis, show the data released by Kotak Institutional Equities.

23,2018-06-27,Britannia,"India Inc’s earnings recovery has remained elusive in last five years, due to varied challenges such as rising raw material costs, higher slippages, GST rollout and the war on bad loans.

However, as many as 25 companies from the BSE500 pack defied this broader market trend and reported higher profits and sales growth year after year for five years till FY2017-18.

Today, most brokerages are bullish on them.

Shrimp feed manufacturer and exporter Avanti Feeds tops the list. Look at its profit growth profile: Rs 446.50 crore profit in FY18, Rs 215.70 crore in FY17, Rs 157.50 crore in FY16, Rs 115.90 crore in FY15, Rs 70.40 crore in FY14 and Rs 30.10 crore in FY13.

The top line, too, have been rising in a similar fashion.

No wonder then, the stock has rallied 5,508 per cent from Rs 9.30 on June 25, 2013 to Rs 521.60 on the same date this year.

ICICI Securities is bullish on Avanti. India’s shrimp exports are projected to grow in mid-teens in value terms and that would make Avanti the biggest beneficiary.

With 35 per cent return on equity (RoE) and 66 per cent average PAT growth over FY13-18, Avanti’s earnings growth trajectory is expected to remain on a steep gradient though lower margins may cause a dip in FY19E, ICICI Securities said.

The brokerage recently initiated coverage on Avanti Feeds with a ‘buy’ rating.

Four other companies that have put up similar performances are Meghmani Organics, KNR Construction, Aarti Industries and KPR Mill; whose shares have surged over 1,000 per cent in last five years, as both bottom lines as well as top lines strengthened.

Brokerage Anand Rathi is positive on Aarti Industries (AIL) with a target price of Rs 1,489. The company manufactures specialty chemicals and pharma products and has a global footprint. The brokerage projects the firm to post Rs 410.80 crore profit for FY19 and Rs 554.50 crore for FY20.

Roads builder KNR Construction multiplied profit by five times in last five years even as sales increased over 2.5 times. Antique Stock Broking has projected the company’s net profit for FY19 at Rs 207.70 crore and for FY20 at Rs 216 crore against Rs 243.50 crore net posted for FY18. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 338.

Bluechip firms Infosys, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank also reported growth in net profit as well as net sales for the fifth straight year in a row in FY18. Shares of these companies have rallied between 100 per cent and 500 per cent in last five years.

Motilal Oswal has ‘buy’ ratings on HDFC, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Infosys, Maruti Suzuki and LIC Housing Finance.

Shares of CCL Products, Edelweiss Financial Services, Natco Pharma, Britannia Industries, Cholamandalam Investment, Aurobindo Pharma and Solar Industries have risen over 500 per cent between June, 2013 and June, 2018.

Edelweiss Financial Services’ profit climbed to Rs 890.10 in FY18 from Rs 178.50 in FY13, while sales grew to Rs 8,405.10 crore from Rs 2,144.40 crore.

Britannia’s profit increased to over Rs 1,000 crore in FY18 from Rs 259 crore in FY13. The FMCG firm is in a sweet spot given its leadership position in the largest segment of processed foods, which has a market of around Rs 30,000 crore.

A strong pipeline of premium products priced low at Rs 10, Rs 15 and Rs 20 is projected to increase sales and improve product mix of the FMCG major. Prabhudas Lilladher is positive on Britannia with a target price of Rs 6,170.

Motherson Sumi, JM Financial, Pidilite Industries and YES Bank have also seen profit grow year after year for the fifth straight year, even as share prices soared 250-400 per cent in last five years.

22,2018-06-27,Britannia,"Mumbai: The mouse that had quietly entered the Mumbai bull-ring more than two decades ago has taken about a quarter of a century to put the paper scrip finally out of business.

About 2.3 per cent of India’s $2-trillionplus market capitalisation is still held in the form of physical stock even more than two decades after Mumbai exchanges went online. Holders of these shares in listed companies now face a December deadline to convert them into dematerialised form if they have to transfer or sell them.

The Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR), which the market regulator tweaked earlier this month, have made the conversion mandatory for all classes of investors. Many investors, especially senior citizens, still hold shares in physical form.

On June 8, Sebi notified the amended LODR regulations saying that except in the case of transmission or transposition of securities, requests for the transfer of stock shall not be processed unless the securities are held in the dematerialised form with a depository.



“Promoters were barred earlier from selling or transferring shares in physical form. Now, the new regulations become applicable to all other investors,” said Arindham Chanda, head of broking at IIFL. “This means all off-market trades in physical mode in respect of shares of listed entities shall be prohibited and shall be required to be done compulsorily in the Demat mode”.

Long-term retail investors and some institutional investors hold a sizeable part of their stakes in physical form even seven years after Sebi ordered 100 per cent dematerialisation of the shareholdings. Retail investors own stocks worth Rs 1.24 lakh crore in physical form, while mutual funds hold Rs 45,760 crore worth of paper stock.

For instance, 31 per cent of ITC shares worth Rs 1 lakh crore are still in physical form. Similarly, Reliance Industries’ shares worth Rs 9,600 crore are not yet dematerialised. Companies such as MRF, Sun Pharma, JSW Energy, and HUL have shares worth Rs 7,000-8,000 crore each in paper form.

Most of these shares have been purchased decades ago before the Depository Act was passed and since the investors intended to hold them long-term, they did not see any reason to pay for a demat account.

“To keep a check on the instances of fraudulent transfers and for ensuring more transparency, this amendment has been brought into force,” said Vikas Jain, co-founder of Share Samadhan. “Investors holding physical shares sometime lose track of the corporate action such as bonus/dividend due to change in their address and those corporate actions remained unclaimed”.

In 2016, several listed companies, such as TCS, Aptech, Britannia Industries and Asian Paints, filed a complaint against share transfer agent Sharepro for diversion of unclaimed dividends and shares of investors.

In June 2011, the market regulator had mandated promoters of listed companies to convert their entire equity holding in dematerialised form by September 2011. Sebi had then said that failure to comply with compulsory dematerialisation of the promoter holding would invite punitive action.

National Securities Depository and Central Depository Services are the two main depositories that hold securities of investors in electronic form through their registered depository participants."

As the bears keep a tight grip on the domestic equity market, testing the limits of investors’ patience, market pundits are seeking to look at the situation as a glass half-filled, pointing out opportunities to accumulate shares of good businesses.

They say the way SIP investors of mutual funds are going whole hog to lap up the dips in the market, direct equity investors too can use the systematic equity planning route to hoard fundamentally-strong stocks, one lot at a time.

While mutual funds are always there for such a systematic approach, if you don’t want to go for the entire mutual fund portfolio and instead focus on a few high conviction ideas, systematic equity planning (SEP) or SIPs in direct equities can help.

In a tumultuous market, which itself looks unsure of its direction in the near term, such a systematic approach can help accumulate stocks at lower prices by averaging out costs.

Direct equity SIP can help eliminate the risk of timing the market and average out benefits. Investors can put in a pre-decided amount or pick a specified quantity of stocks at regular intervals over long period. If the investment is constant, one buys more units when the price is low and fewer units when the price is high. Similarly, when one buys a specific quantity at regular intervals, it may lower the cost by averaging it out.

The only flaw, if any, is that direct SIP does not allow automatic diversification the way a mutual fund SIP does, unless the investor himself/herself picks a set of diverse stocks to buy in the first place.

Direct SIP in equities can help accumulate stocks of your choice in your portfolio on a regular basis. It benefits you by cost averaging, says Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.

“It gives the power of compounding to your investment. A well-diversified stock portfolio generally smoothens out the impact of the market’s highs and lows,” he said.

Prakarsh Gagdani, CEO, 5Paisa.com said the process works just like mutual fund SIPs, but a long-term approach is needed to see significant gains.

Stock selection is important for SIP in direct equity. If one company’s performance deteriorates in the long run, the benefits may not be as good as in the case of a mutual fund SIP, he said. 

Similar to mutual fund SIP, direct equity SIPs also allow investors to put in money on a monthly or quarterly basis. 


Time frame and cost
Market experts say investors opting for this route must have a clear view about the company and its stock price for 2-3 years or even more. One should go through the company’s balance sheet, study cash flow statements, return ratios and consider the impact of any micro and macro changes.

Direct equity SIP allows you to save on expenses that you incur in a mutual fund SIP. In mutual fund SIP, the fund manager may have an edge and better ability to switch funds to better stocks, book profits when required or shift fund to the safety of debt when the situation goes out of hand. In direct equity SIP, one has to do it all by himself, brokerage Bonanza Portfolio said in a note.

Goldi Jain, AVP for Advisory, Sharekhan said the cost is low in direct equity SIP compared with a mutual fund SIP, where the expense ratio ranges from 1.2 to 2.5 per cent.


Current market scenario
Investors have been cautious on the domestic equity market this calendar amid rising crude oil prices, unabated outflow of foreign institutional investors’ money, worries over global trade war and weakness in the rupee. 

The domestic equity benchmarks are trading at around 8 per cent premium to its 10-year average P/E ratio. However, a faster pace of economic growth and commodity prices can be favourable tailwinds for corporate earnings growth. In FY19, corporate earnings are projected to grow at 20 per cent after many years of single-digit growth. However, the equity market has already factored in the earnings recovery in prices. That may mean downward pressure on the market in the near term, said Abhimanyu Sofat, VP- Research, IIFL.


Investment options
Considering the scenario, if you are looking for systematic investment in direct equity with a 2-3 year investment horizon, Bonanza Portfolio recommends a basket of 8-10 stocks, which include Bajaj finance, Godrej Consumer, HUL, Titan, L&T, Maruti Suzuki, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank. 

5Paisa.com recommends direct equity SIP in Tata Motors, HDFC, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma and Lupin.

Jain of Sharekhan prefers HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Marico, Ultratech Cement, Britannia for direct SIP. 

Investors need to do due diligence while choosing stocks. Also, one would need to review the portfolio from time to time."

Equity markets were down amid mixed global cues.

Rising crude oil prices and weakening rupee too hit market sentiment. 

Moreover, investors were on the sidelines on the last of June series of future and option contracts.

26,2018-06-28,Britannia,"KOLKATA: Aashirvaad atta, Sunfeast cookies, and Bingo snacks are helping cement ITC’s credentials on the Indian packaged foods leaderboard, helping the segment log about half the annual sales of the conglomerate’s traditional mainstay — cigarettes.

At the tobacco products-FMCG-hotels major, which just published its annual report, the branded packaged food business made up 22.1% of the net turnover in FY18, compared with the 46% contribution from cigarettes, which also had a far higher base. Agri-business was the third largest — about half of packaged foods — in net sales contributions. ITC’s net revenue in FY18 was Rs 39,255 crore.

The packaged foods business was the first FMCG category the conglomerate had entered 17 years ago to reduce its reliance on the cigarette revenue stream. It clocked sales of Rs 8,668.7 crore in FY18, ITC reported in the annual report.

In FY17, packaged food sales were at Rs 8,036.4 crore, but the revenues are not comparable due to the transition to the GST regime, in which sales are calculated net of GST. Earlier calculations included the impact of the excise levy.

The company’s packaged foods division now accounts for 76% of the total sales of non-cigarette FMCG business, which also includes personal care, stationary products, lifestyle retail, safety matches and incense sticks.

The non-cigarette FMCG business also clocked gross profit of Rs 164.1 crore in FY18, driven by the food business, with other categories yet to break even. ITC continues to be the third largest listed packaged foods company in India: Nestle (Rs 9,472.5 crore domestic sales in CY17) leads the table, followed by cookies maker Britannia (standalone sales of Rs 9,380.2 crore in FY18). ITC has ambitions to establish itself as India’s biggest packaged foods company.

In foods, ITC is the market leader in packaged atta, premium cream biscuits, and the bridges segment in snacks. It is the second largest in instant noodles and the third in packaged juice.

By way of consumer spend that includes taxes, Aashirvaad is the largest non-cigarette food brand at more than Rs 4,000 crore, followed by Sunfeast at more than Rs 3,500 crore, and Bingo at more than Rs 2,000 crore. In FY18, ITC had entered into packaged fruits and vegetables, blended spices and frozen prawns, and is betting on the dairy business as the next big growth driver."

12,2018-07-10,Britannia,"Mumbai: Biscuit maker Britannia Industries and steel products manufacturer JSW Steel are likely to enter the benchmark Nifty index in place of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Lupin in the upcoming index rebalancing, analysts said.

The exchange may come out with its list of inclusions and exclusions in the latter half of August and these stocks may be included in the Nifty from the October series, said ICICIdirect in a note.

As per the guidelines, a stock may be replaced in an index in case of compulsory changes like corporate actions and delisting. The stock having largest free float market capitalisation and satisfying other requirements related to liquidity, turnover and free float will be considered for inclusion in this scenario.

A change is also made when there is a better candidate for inclusion. The stock which is included in the index should have market capitalisation which is 1.5 times the market cap of the stock which is excluded.



“Britannia will have close to 0.5 per cent weightage on introduction in the Nifty. Britannia is most likely to replace HPCL as it exceeds HPCL’s current free float market cap by 1.5 times,” said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICIdirect. The retail brokerage said that either JSW or Godrej Consumer Products are likely to replace Lupin in the Nifty.

According to the guidelines, a maximum of 10 per cent of the index size may be changed in a calendar year, which means a maximum of five stocks can be replaced among the 50 stocks. As three changes have already been made in the last rebalancing, only two changes are expected in the upcoming rebalancing.

“JSW Steel and Britannia are likely to be added in the Nifty index. Exit is likely for HPCL as its free float market cap has come down,” said Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal. “Sentimental buying can come in as funds which use index as benchmark will come in,” said Taparia.

There is also a chance that Lupin may not be excluded from the index given the recent spurt in pharmaceutical sector stocks.

The Nifty Pharma index has risen 17.8 per cent from its 52-week low of 7,900.35 was hit on May 23.

Lupin has gained 26 per cent from its 52-week low of Rs 723.65 hit on May 15."

20,2018-07-14,Britannia,"Online marketplace Amazon will double discounts offered on daily consumption products during its Prime Day sale starting July 16, upping the ante in a fiercely competitive and rapidly growing online grocery market.

The marketplace will offer best-ever deals on FMCG products across categories such as food, grocery, staples, beauty, personal care, baby care, detergent and home care during Prime Day, with the backing of brands, said Saurabh Srivastava, director, category management (FMCG), at Amazon India.

Large consumer product firms such as Marico, Britannia and Parle Products confirmed they will offer discounts on value-added products during Prime Day sale, while maintaining parity across trade channels on mass products. “We will offer discounts on developmental, premium and niche products,” said Varun Berry, managing director at biscuits maker Britannia.

“It helps them (Amazon) because of the profile of consumers they focus on, and it helps us get trials,” he said.

Amazon’s Srivastava said there will be discounts of 50% on brands such as Nivea, Kaya and Saffola Oats during the 36-hour sale exclusively for Amazon Prime members, up from earlier highest discounts of 15-25% offered on these products. For diapers, discounts will be about 45% against earlier best deals of 35%, while on protein supplements discounts offered will be up to 70%, he said.

“People associate Prime Day for best deals on mobiles and electronics. While that will remain, FMCG is one category where consumers can engage with us on a daily basis,” Srivastava said.

There would be deals on brands such as Colgate, Ariel Matic and Royal Canin, while brands like Nestle, Nivea and L’Oreal will launch exclusive products, he said. “Apart from outright discounts, we will also offer Rs 2,600 cashback through the year to consumers who purchase FMCG products of more than .`1,000,” Srivastava said.

Head of a leading fast-moving consumer goods seller said Amazon is going all out to acquire customers. “Amazon wants to burn money on food and grocery discounts since it wants to enter the monthly and weekly purchase habit of consumers which leads to recurrent orders,” the person said on condition of anonymity.

Chief of a leading food company said Amazon is trying to attract buyers for everyday items such as salt, sugar and pulses, which till now has been the domain of online grocers Big Basket and Grofers.

Industry executives said Amazon will perhaps offer the highest discounts on its own labels within personal care and grocery. Amazon recently ventured into pulses under its own brand Vedaka. It has also launched own brands in categories such as nuts, floor cleaners, kitchen paper, and aluminium foils.

Despite the aggressive discounts Amazon has lined up for Prime Day, its competitors don’t expect the event to trigger a discounting war in online grocery space.

“While Amazon may reach out to FMCG companies to support sales, FMCG companies will not allow deep discounting since that will disrupt their pricing structure and they can’t sell at a loss,” said Albinder Dhindsa, cofounder of Grofers.com. He, however, said Grofers will continue with its strategy of everyday low pricing.

Price war or not, Amazon clearly wants to establish as a marketplace for daily use products, hence the focus on FMCG, staples and groceries during Prime Day sale.

A Crisil report released earlier this year estimates the online retail sector in India to grow 250% in three years from 2016-17 to 2019-20. Grocery is expected to be one of the fastest growing segments with 65-70% compound annual growth rate, though from a small base. The report expects online grocery market to almost quadruple in three years to Rs 100 billion in terms of revenues.

India is among 17 countries participating in Amazon’s annual event for its Prime members on July 16-17.

Amazon Prime is estimated to have 10 million subscribers in India, out of 100 million subscribers globally. India is the fastest-growing market for Prime with the number of subscribers in the country having doubled in the last 12 months.

Amazon India has more than 20 lakh FMCG products on its platform and serves more than 20,500 pin codes across the country. It also offers next day delivery service on FMCG products under Amazon Pantry in 34 cities."
23,2018-07-16,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries and Cigniti Technologies featured among the 17 stocks that touched 52-week highs on NSE on Monday despite weak market sentiment.

Godrej Consumer Products, HDFC, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mphasis and Sanofi India too joined the pack of stocks that touched 52-week highs on NSE.

Frontline equity indices Sensex and Nifty extended losses to the second consecutive session on Monday owing to losses in metal, pharma, auto, bank and energy stocks, while weak macroeconomic indicators and mixed global cues kept investors' mood subdued. 

Sensex registered a muted start in the light of tepid Asian cues after an official data showed that China's economy slowed a little in the second quarter. 

Moreover, a set of weak macroeconomic numbers eroded market optimism.

Market's risk appetite was dealt a blow after India's trade deficit widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee. 

The market mood got further hit as a government data released today showed that the inflation based on wholesale prices shot up to 5.77 per cent in June on increasing prices of vegetables and fuel items.

Earlier, a government data last week had revealed that the retail inflation jumped to a 5-month high of 5 per cent in the month of June on rising fuel prices.

Surging inflation may push India's central bank to hike key rates in its next policy meet in August.

The BSE Sensex tanked 218 points, or 0.60 per cent, to settle at 36,324, with 10 stocks advancing, 20 declining and one unchanged.

24,2018-07-16,Britannia,"GUWAHATI: Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has said the Advantage Assam: Global Investors’ Summit has established the state in the global arena after the Congress called it a drain on the exchequer.

“Investors across the globe came to know about Assam’s investment potential through this summit,” Sonowal said about his government's signature event at the launch of a unit of Britannia industries on Monday.

The Opposition Congress has challenged the BJP-led government to come out with a status paper mentioning the investment that has come to the state in the last two years and on the number of jobs created in the state.

He said Prime minister Narendra Modi suggested that Assam should organise such an event to attract investors and had promised to inaugurate it and get the support of the Union ministers in a big way. 

During the summit held in February a total of 264 MoUs worth Rs. 78,208 crore were inked and investment commitments worth Rs. 19,950 crore made. 

Sonowal argued that investments have started coming. While Britannia Industries has invested Rs 200 Crore, Kishore Biyani-led Future Group is planning to set up a food park and flour mill in Assam. The group has announced it will ramp up its retail presence across the Northeast India and has already set up a couple of malls in the state.

He added, “Tata Trust has started investing close to Rs 1000 Crore in setting up 19 cancer hospitals in the state.”

Industry minister Chandra Mohan Patwary said a Kolkata-based group is planning two jute mills in Assam. 

“We are trying and will start international flight to some South East Asian countries from Guwahati by October this year,” he said"
21,2018-07-16,Britannia,"Several stocks generate excess returns compared to their benchmark indices. The most consistent among the outperformers also have the ability to generate wealth over the long term. 

So, we have identified stocks that have outperformed the benchmark BSE Sensex for most of the trading days over the last three years. We restricted our study to BSE 500 stocks and calculated their daily returns from 29 June 2015 to 29 June 2018. We also calculated the daily returns of BSE Sensex for the same period. 

We then considered each stock from our universe of 500 stocks and looked for trading days on which the stock outperformed the Sensex. After that we added all the trading days on which a stock outperformed the Sensex, and calculated the outperformance of the stock in percentage terms. 

For instance, IndusInd Bank outperformed the BSE Sensex on 395 trading days out of 745 trading days in the past three years, so its outperformance stands at 53%. We repeated the exercise for each of the 500 stocks and then sorted them in descending order on the basis of their outperformance.


Outperformers analysts are bullish on
The average 3-year return of these consistent outperformers is a whopping 178% compared to the BSE500’s 34.2%.
 *Number of trading days the stock has outperformed the BSE Sensex in past three years. Operating profit (including other income) and PAT growth is y-o-y. Absolute returns as on 29 Jun 2018. Source: ACE Equity and Bloomberg

After analysing point-to-point returns of the selected stocks, we found that the top 10% delivered an average return of 143% between 29 June 2015 and 29 June 2018. The BSE500 returned 34.2% during the same period. These top 10% stocks delivered 25% point-to-point average returns between 29 June 2017 and 29 June 2018, while the BSE500 generated 10.6% returns during the same period. 

So, in the past one and three years, the top 10% of the outperforming stocks have generated a premium of 2.4-times and 4.2-times respectively compared to the benchmark index. These stocks have not only consistently outperformed the BSE Sensex but also score highly on their fundamental attributes.

The unaudited results for 2017-18 show that the top 10% of the stocks have delivered year-on-year aggregate operating and net profit growth of 15% and 12% respectively. Comparatively, aggregate operating and net profits of BSE500 were 8.1% and 2% respectively for the same period. Our study shows that the analysis of stock performance with respect to market benchmarks could help investors identify medium to long-term outperformers.


 Let us look at the five stocks from our top 10% list that have got the highest buy recommendations from analysts.


1. IndusInd BankIt’s a new generation private sector bank with more than 1,000 branches and around 1,800 ATMs spread across the country. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the bank’s profit growth will be supported by robust revenue momentum, driven by strong loan growth and healthy expansion in net interest margins. The bank’s loan growth is likely to strengthen further in the June 2018 quarter and its asset quality will continue to be among the best in the industry.


2. Britannia IndustriesIndia’s leading food company, Britannia manufactures bakery and dairy products. According to a research report by KR Choksey, the company is likely to grow faster than the market due to the management’s efforts on new innovative products in the premium segment, improvement in distribution channel, focus on capturing new markets and increasing penetration in the rural areas. Steps to mitigate the impact of inflation on raw material prices will help improve Ebitda and profit after tax margins by 2019-20.


3. Dalmia BharatThis cement manufacturer has an annual installed capacity of 25 million tonnes. Sustained improvement in variable cost parameters, rising market share across regions, increasing scale of premium brands, discipline in capex and debt repayment, and organisational restructuring will be future growth drivers, says a research report by Antique Stock Broking.


4. JSW SteelProducer and distributer of iron and steel products, JSW Steel has a capacity of 18 million tonnes per annum. The company has invested $1 billion in the US. According to a research report by ICICI Direct, JSW Steel will benefit from its expansion, given the stringent trade measures announced by the US to support its domestic steel industry.


5. Asian PaintsThe company’s product portfolio comprises paints, water proofing material, wall coverings and adhesives. According to a research report by JP Morgan, healthy domestic demand aided by rural recovery, improved overseas operations, extensive distribution reach and product innovations offers positive revenue growth outlook in 2018-19."

25,2018-07-17,Britannia,"The claims of the Opposition, the Congress, that Assam’s BJP-led government’s signature event –– “Advantage Assam: Global Investors’ Summit” –– held in February last year was a drain on the exchequer was countered by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal who said the Summit had put his state on the global and domestic map and made investors aware of the business potential here.

The Congress has asked the BJP government to come out with a status paper outlining the investments which have come to the state over the past two years and the number of jobs created.

“Investors across the globe came to know about Assam’s investment potential through this summit,” Sonowal said at the launch of a Britannia industries unit here.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested that Assam must organise such events to attract investors. He had promised to inaugurate it and asked all the ministers to support the event in a big way.

During the Summit, 264 MoUs worth Rs 78,208 crore were inked and investment commitments worth Rs 19,950 crore were made.

While Britannia Industries invested Rs 200 crore, Kishore Biyani-led Future Group plans to set up a Food Park and f lour mill in Assam, he said. The group has announced that it will ramp up its retail presence across Northeast India. The group has already set up couple of malls in Assam, he said.

“Tata Trust has started investing close to Rs 1,000 crore to set up 19 cancer hospitals in the state,” he added.

Industries minister Chandra Mohan Patwary said a Kolkata-based group is setting to two jute mills in Assam. “We are trying to start international flights to some South East Asian countries from Guwahati by October this year.”

“The investment summit showcased to investors what Assam has to offer. Assam became known everywhere,” he said."

Gains in energy, bank, auto, pharma and metal stocks lifted equity benchmarks Nifty and Sensex up after their two consecutive sessions of losses.

A fresh rise in the Indian rupee against the US dollar and subsiding crude oil prices too influenced market mood. 

The market rebounded a day after it was knocked down by macro woes as government data showed India's retail and wholesale-based inflation rising, raising speculations of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India in its next policy meet.

The Sensex index finished 196 points, or 0.54 per cent, higher at 36,520, with 22 stocks in the green and 9 in the red.

27,2018-07-17,Britannia,"RAMPUR (ASSAM): Food company, Britannia Industries (BIL) has come up with a greenfield manufacturing facility in the country, at an investment of.`200 crore in Rampur, Assam. The Rampur facility will produce a wide array of Britannia products to cater extensively to Assam and the north-eastern states. The unit has a production capacity of 60,000 tonnes of biscuits annually.

The company already has two manufacturing facilities in Assam with a production capacity of 30,000 tonnes annually. Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia Industries, who was in Assam on Monday, said the facility in Rampur has come up in record time of 14 months. “The way government of Assam has supported us in getting clearances is unprecedented and unseen in any other place in the country,” he said. He added, “Britannia is Rs 10,000-crore company with operations in 75 countries. Northeast India roughly accounts for Rs 600-crore business annually and Assam facilities contribute 8% to the total production. In the three units in Assam, the company has invested close to Rs 350 crore.”

“As government of Assam is initiating for communication with South East Asian countries, we may look at supplying our products from here to those countries. We are diversifying and adding more products, we will soon emerge as a complete food company. Assam could be an ideal base to evaluate business expansion to International markets,” Berry added."
28,2018-07-17,Britannia,"Stock picking turned difficult this year thanks to strong volatility in the domestic equity market. Market participants look undecided whether to go with a technical or fundamental view.

But how about going with the combination of the two? CAN SLIM does exactly that to identify potential value stocks. 

Developed by investor William O’Neil, this is a techno-fundamental strategy that helps pick quality stocks. Fundamentals give the conviction to hold a stock while technicals indicate attractive entry and exit points.

 “CAN SLIM is a rules-based investment system based on the study of historical multibagger price runs in stocks. The system was created by one of America’s most successful stock investors, William O’Neil, after he studied stock market winners and market cycles going back to the 19th century,” says Anupam Singhi, CEO, William O’Neil India.

William O’Neil observed that most multibaggers shared seven common characteristics. He then started investing in stocks that had developed there seven traits and went on to become one of the all-time investing legends.

“The methodology is based on 100 per cent realistic historical studies of how the stock market has actually worked,” Singhi said.

Since its inception four years ago, the MarketSmith India model portfolio based on CAN SLIM has grown around 111 per cent between June 1, 2014 and July 6, 2018. The Nifty has gained over 40 per cent during the same period. 

“CAN SLIM is primarily a momentum trading or investing strategy. It tends to work well in a directional market. Like any other strategy, it too has its pros and cons. CAN SLIM may not do very well in a choppy market. As a strategy, it tries to merge fundamentals and technical analysis,” says Kolkata-based value investor Abhishek Basumallick.


How does CANSLIM work?
CAN SLIM is a guideline where each letter stands for an important factor that needs to be considered before investing in a stock.


C – Current Earnings
Healthy financial performance in most recent quarters demonstrates that a business is able to succeed in the current environment.


A – Annual Earnings
A history of healthy sales and earnings growth in recent years demonstrates that a business model is sustainable and viable, and can generate profits consistently.


N – New Product/Service, Management or Price High
Studies have shown that the greatest stock market winners of the past were all trying something new. Always look for companies with new, game-changing products and services


S – Supply and Demand
S is for supply and demand of the stock. As more investors demand a limited supply of shares, a stock’s price goes up. Look for heavy volume accumulation by institutional investors, particularly at key moments like when the stock is breaking above prior resistance levels.


L – Leader or Laggard
True leaders are those companies that show best earnings growth, strongest sales, superior price performance, and are in leading industry groups. Every bull market has a new leader and there is no point getting stuck with stocks that belong to the lagging industry groups. Look for the best of the best – leaders in strong industries that are showing superior earnings growth and sales.


I – Institutional Sponsorship
Mutual funds, banks and other professional investors are big players who drive the market. For a stock to be a top performer, it must have institutional support to fuel its price moves. Look for stocks that are showing signs of heavy accumulation and consistent increase in the number of funds holding the stock.


M – Market Direction
Studies have shown that three out of every four stocks follow the current market trend. You should always trade in sync with the market. You should be buying more stocks when the market is in an uptrend, and protecting your capital when the market is in a downtrend.

“This rules-based system helps identify stocks with the right fundamental profile to succeed. Once the stock passes this litmus test, one needs to look out for a breakout from a sound base pattern. Base patterns are periods of sideways movement where the stock has less buying interest. No stock can be in a rally forever, even multibaggers have periods of consolidation and we must wait for the stocks to breakout to new highs before we take any fresh position. A rules-based system helps us nail down fundamentally strong growth stocks, and then we wait for the technical buy signal, i.e. the breakout, to pick up the stock,” said Singhi of William O'Neil India.


Who can go with the strategy?
To be successful in the stock market, all investors regardless of whether they are first-timers or experienced investing professionals need to learn sound, historically proven buy rules as well as sell rules.

Singhi says CAN SLIM strategy is tailored for investors looking to beat the market by investing in stocks with high quality fundamentals. The aim of the system is to capture big price runs by buying fundamentally strong stocks that are market leaders. 

“Our strategy gives investors a huge advantage by materially improving stock selection and timing. The system requires strict discipline and helps investors develop the right money management skills,” he added.


Top stocks on the basis of CAN SLIM model
William O'Neil India shared a list of 10 stocks based on the CAN SLIM model with ETMarkets.com.


Asian Paints: Organised paint companies are likely to get benefitted from increasing population and housing shortages in India, which will drive growth for residential construction industry (expected to grow at 15 per cent during the period 2018-2022). Moreover, the government’s push for affordable housing under its plan “Housing for all by 2022” is providing much needed traction for the paint industry. 


Nestle India: The revival of its major brand Maggi (60 per cent market share) and new product launches (40 new products over the past two years across various segments) helping the company to substantiate its position in the market. Moreover, the reducing material cost helping Nestle in expanding its margin. The deflationary price trend in Q1 2018 (-11 per cent YoY) for skimmed milk powder continues to prevail owing to an excess supply leading to a decline in prices by Rs 4-10 per litre. Coffee prices also continue to decline 4 per cent YoY as of H1 2018, reaching the low recorded in 2014. “With the lowering input prices, we expect its margins to further expand in 2018, supported by a favourable product mix and input costs,” said Singhi.


Maruti Suzuki: Maruti Suzuki is the largest passenger vehicle company in India by sales. The management is confident about its future prospects and expects to sell 2 million vehicles by FY2020. 


VIP Industries: The company manufactures a wide range of hard-sided and soft-sided luggage under the VIP, Skybags, Alfa, Aristocrat, Carlton, and Caprese brands. The company reported five consecutive quarters of high double-digit EPS growth. It is expected to grow further on the back of its capacity expansions in Bangladesh, where it currently enjoys a tax holiday of seven years. Moreover, aggressive brand promotion, growth in the aviation industry, and wider retail network add more revenue prospects for the Company.


Britannia Industries: This company drives its growth through its capacity expansion plan, new product introductions, and geographic expansion. In addition, the goods and services tax has brought the unorganised sector (25 per cent of biscuit market) under the tax net, helping the company gain 170bps of market share in the Hindi-speaking belt, where it faces intense competition from regional players. It reported three consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth and two consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth.

Edelweiss Financial Services: Edelweiss has delivered industry leading growth with its credit book growing to Rs 42,010 crore in FY 2018 from Rs 3,956 crore in FY 2012, implying a CAGR of 48.3 per cent. The company achieved this growth while maintaining healthy net interest margins (7.7 per cent in FY 2018) and robust asset quality with net NPA at 0.7 per cent, at the end of FY 2018.


KEI Industries: This is a cable manufacturing company involved in the manufacturing and supply of power cables and other industrial cables. KEI Industries’ strong order book and the growing pace of export are helping it substantiate its position. It aims to boost its B2C business and increase its distribution channel to 1,500 by FY 2019 from 926 dealers in FY 2016. Moreover, it also increased its advertising budget to reach to a wider audience. These measures should help the company increase its retail sales in the long run.


Quess Corp: Quess is India’s leading integrated business service provider with a pan-India presence, headquartered in Bengaluru. It has 65 offices across India in 34 cities along with overseas footprints in North America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The stock posted double-digit sales and EPS growth over the last three years. Quess Corp is also tapping into the smart city project in Ahmedabad by entering into a joint venture with Trimax IT Infrastructure and Service. As a part of the project, it aims to create digital, communication, and information infrastructure.


Tata Elxsi: It is one of the leading providers of technology and designing services for product engineering solutions to the automotive, broadcast and communication, and health care industries. The company largely thrives on R&D spends by global companies. Moreover, it is expected to largely benefit from the government’s target of selling 70 lakh electric and hybrid vehicles by 2020.


HDFC Bank: It is the second-largest private lender by assets with a focus on rural and semi-urban markets. Its asset quality remains top-notch thanks to stringent credit origination practices, strong monitoring system, and adequate provisioning.

Along with increased digitisation, the bank is also expanding its presence in rural and semi-urban areas, which are largely underpenetrated. Among the total number of branches, 53 per cent of the total bank outlets are in semi-urban and rural locations. The expansion strengthens its retail segment, which is highly dependent on SME and unsecured lending. The share of unsecured lending and SME continues to trend higher; recorded at 47.6 per cent in FY 2018 compared with 40.8 per cent in FY 2015. Double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with strong ROE continue to attract the investor community, according to William O’Neil India."

32,2018-07-18,Britannia,"One mega theme to emerge will be to have asset managers and life insurers in the portfolio. The second mega theme will be staffing as a space and formalisation as a theme, Saurabh Mukherjea, Independent Market Expert, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 
You have been bearish and you have been right. You were calling for this sharp correction in midcap and smallcap stocks. It was a very isolated call and you were the only caller of this bubble in the midcap space. Are you still bearish or do you think it is time to put money to work now?
The market cap migration from smallcap and midcap to largecaps will continue.


It is actually mega caps, if you think about it..
Yes. Liquidity is getting tighter. If you see the RBI LAF window, for the first time in five years, we are going to stay where the banks will start borrowing from the RBI. Deposit growth is weak for the banks. The banks will soon have to start borrowing from the RBI and that will be the first time since this bull market started in say autumn of 2013 that the banks will start borrowing from RBI. This is a good indicator that liquidity is tightening in the system. 

If liquidity tightens cost of money goes up, and smallcap and midcaps will have a tougher time. A migration to FMCG and auto stocks will benefit from rural plays. Migration to IT and pharma, which obviously have a currency linked element to it, also makes sense. It has already started in the last six-seven months. This will continue through the next three-four months as well.


12 months ago, the general view was that economy was on the mend, cyclicals will make a comeback, industrial demand will open up, capacity utilisation will pick up. But the data points what we are looking at are telling us that the corporate demand is not making a comeback despite government spending on bijli pani road (electricity, water and roads). On the flip side, demand has picked up in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Did the market misread where the demand would come from?
What has happened is consumption has recovered. Basically, the disruptive effects of DeMonetisation and GST have worn off. Over the last six-seven months, clearly consumption has recovered. Rural has recovered even more than urban because rural suffered more than urban. Now unless we can fix this banking system, it is difficult to get a capex cycle going. 

We are largely a country where capex is funded through the banking system rather than the bond market. We do not really have a long-term bond market. Pending meaningful recapitalisation of the banking system, perhaps changed the ownership of public sector banks which I cannot see happening this side of the general elections.

A meaningful capex recovery will be hard to spot. What is encouraging though is the first sign that the job creation cycle seems to have begun -- in terms of construction jobs, a few signs of capex in the FMCG and auto sector. But overall, the capex cycle will have to wait for the general election and for the banking sector to be repaired.


I completely agree with your point when you say stick with consumption, FMCG, auto. But how much more of Nestle or Britannia would you buy? These are the most expensive stocks. Nestle is now trading at 56 times, Unilever at 58 times, Britannia 60 times. Nestle has already crossed that Rs 1 lakh crore market cap. It’s the same in Maruti.
Obviously in some pockets of FMCG, the valuations are high. If you look back to November-December, I was shouting myself hoarse saying that IT stocks were undervalued. IT has had a very smart recovery and it will hold itself together quite nicely as the currency stays weak and America recovers. 

Similarly, in pharma there will be a recovery if the rupee continues to stay a weak 69-70 to the dollar. Pharma stocks were pulverised last year and there is an upside story in pharma which the market is ignoring currently.

Coming back to the rural story, we can look at tractor stocks. We have got M&M. In the FMCG context, there is ITC. There are pockets in auto and FMCG as well where there is value to be had. Not all FMCG and auto stocks are sensibly priced but there are pockets of value in FMCG and auto as well and more generally in pharma and IT.


The only problem with pharma is you do not know which way USFDA is going right now. Just yesterday, there was that injunction on DRL and again the stock tanked. Pharma continues to be a little bit of a grey zone.
The day-to-day action in IT, pharma, the regulatory cycles in these sectors, what President Trump does, will have a bearing. All we can do as stock pickers is to say look for companies in these sectors with great long-term capital allocation track records.


Like? Take the case of the pharma sector. If you look at Lupin’s long-term capital allocation track record, it is very difficult to find fault with that. We obviously know the company has been through a set of challenges from the last…


Even the Gavis has backfired.
There has been a set of challenges but if you step back and say I will take the Coffee Can Portfolio, look for companies which have allocated capital sensibly over 10-20 years. I will buy them and run with them. Back in November-December, when I was saying IT is significantly undervalued, a lot of people were saying TCS is a stock with barely any growth. Why would you buy it? Look at what has happened to TCS in the last six-seven months. 

Just look at companies with great track records, buy them at sensible valuations and not crazy valuations of 50-60 times. Buy them at high teens, low 20s and then just run with them because overall that will give you strong compounding in the portfolio. 

The Coffee Can Portfolio constructs still works. All you are trying to do is keep some cognisance of valuations which are becoming a little crazy in spots of the market.


Not in IT.
Not in IT, but the sector which worries me the most is banking and NBFCs which have got both several stocks which are at north of four times price to book and in many of these cases these lenders are borrowing heavily from the wholesale market -- the CP or the CD market and they are lending to private sector borrowers.


What is your concern there? Is your concern that now things are looking good and so they are riding the wave and asset quality is not a concern but if rates continue to go up, then that will like affect them?
Yes. The 10-year bond yield goes up from 6.5% a year ago to close to 8% now. In the short-term money market, cost of money market borrowing is up 130-140 bps. My reckoning is liquidity will continue to get tighter -- whether it is banks struggling to get deposits or whether it is the Government of India’s bond yields going up. 

Liquidity is going to get tighter and as cost of money goes up. All of these lenders whether they are private sector banks or NBFCs, who are borrowing in the wholesale market, will have to increase their lending rates and that will be a double whammy which slows down the loan book growth and it increases the NPA numbers and the valuation on these stocks.


But private banks have a more balanced business model. My concern is with the NBFCs. Do you think there is a bubble building there?
Within NBFCs, let us draw a distinction between housing finance companies where this risk is particularly high. They are borrowing in the short-term market. They are borrowing 6-month, 12-month money and they are giving out 20-year loans. You are taking a massive asset liability mismatch. The risk is a little less with say truck financiers because they are doing three-year, five-year loans. 

But even in private sector banks, while some of them have great CASA franchises, some of the private sector banks do not really have very powerful CASA franchises. They are heavily dependent on wholesale market, something like 70-80% of their borrowing for some of the private sector banks is coming from the CD market. They have a banking license but that does not necessary mean that all of them have built CASA franchises. Some of them have but some of them have not.


Which ones are you hinting at?
If I look at the better CASA franchises, then obviously an HDFC Bank or a Kotak Bank could count amongst them. But beyond the top three or four names, the other private sector banks do not have powerful CASA franchises and the cost of money is a huge driver of the stock market and of banks and NBFCs. Nearly 40% of the market cap of our market now is these stocks.


Yes, it amazes me. I was looking at DCB Bank and the CASA is not even 30%. The liability in the market is getting less because there is AU Finance, there is Ujjivan. Everybody wants the share of liability and it is not easy to get that liability.
And it is an election year. State and central governments will borrow heavily from the bond market -- whether it is to fund these farm loan waivers or to fund the MSP hikes they have announced two weeks ago. As the government crowds out money from the bond market, the pool goes down and deposit growth is not very high.


The data as of now is indicating that we have seen a massive bull run in NBFCs. In Bajaj Finance, a lakh of rupees in 10 years has become a crore. In Gruh Finance, a lakh of rupee in 2008 or 2009 has gone up 60-70x. Do you think in the next big sector or cycle which could be called a secular cycle for next 5-10 years, this sector will have a natural tailwind? All you need to do is just align your portfolio with two-three large players and hit a home run? 
I have discussed a couple of mega themes before. The first was around savings. For the last three years, for the first time in this country’s history, we have saved more through financial savings than through physical savings and real estate and gold. We are doing roughly $200-250 billion per annum of financial savings. 

In the next 10 years, that number will hit a trillion dollar per year of financial savings. There is enormous room for plays which are linked to asset management, life insurance, wealth management and good quality broking. There are not too many listed plays in that. There will be more asset management and life insurance companies listed in the years to come, but that will be a structural theme. It will work wonderfully well over the next decade.


Flip your HDFC Bank with a top insurer name. Flip your NBFC may be with an asset management company?
I am not so sure you should flip your HDFC Bank but if you have a lesser bank in your portfolio, then certain consider exposure to high quality insurer or a high quality asset manager. 


Lesser bank will be non-index bank?
 A lesser bank in the sense a bank which does not have a great track record of lending money or of CASA. 


I can think of only two…
Right. We will discuss those names on another show perhaps later on but for high quality Indian portfolio, to have asset managers and life insurers will become a must. So, that is one mega theme. We have to think about it very actively. The structural thrust is towards financial savings, leaving aside the financial economy in the real world and the formalisation of the country. While we have discussed various building materials plays, the staffing companies will be a natural play on formalisation because you are taking a labour force which is primarily informal. 

They will start coming into the formal world. The staffing companies are a kind of go between. They are the brokers of people. Staffing as a space and formalisation as a theme would be another mega theme that will work wonderfully well.


What about the good old India romance – consumption? It may not be exactly soaps, shampoo or the typical HULs of the world but if we are saving more, we are consuming more. Instead of buying five pieces of apparel a year, millennials would say buy 15; instead of watching one movie in a month, they would watch five. There are lot of these trends at play.
Absolutely. None of us are denying that the good quality consumption plays will continue to have a…


Despite have a good life, all I am saying…
 …one thing to worth remembering is when you consume heavily as a country and your capex cycle is not particularly strong, you naturally end up with a big current account deficit. A current account deficit is big and I think it is potentially going to get bigger in the next 12 months…


That is what America is doing.
That naturally means a weakening currency and if the currency is going to weaken further, and I believes the rupee is overdue for a further bout of weakening, then sectors which are linked to a weak currency -- IT and pharma -- naturally come back into the reckoning.


Is the distress in broader market anywhere close to over or would this huge dichotomy continue for a while?
I believe that at 36,000-37,000, the Sensex is overvalued by a good 15%. The market is overvalued. Smallcaps and midcaps were egregiously overvalued. The market is overvalued but within the largecap space, BFSI specifically stands out like a sore thumb. The BFSI fate is linked to the liquidity cycle. The data from RBI suggests meaningful tightening in the liquidity cycle over the last six months. 

There is a very strong correlation between bull markets in India and the RBI’s LAF window being open in terms of banks’ lending money to RBI rather than borrowing. As soon as banks start borrowing money from the RBI, that is a clear sign that liquidity has tightened and in the next two-three months, you are going to get into that.


Are you calling a correction even in the largecaps from these levels?
The market is overvalued. Smallcaps and midcaps were egregiously overvalued, almost bubble like.


You are talking about shifting money into largecaps. Is it time to really buy more index funds or largecap oriented instruments versus midcaps?
There is double consideration that one should do. Rotating from smallcaps and midcaps to largecaps makes a lot of sense. Within largecaps, being underweight on financials makes sense and overall thinking long term over three-five year horizons rather than trying to make money from the market over a 12-month horizon makes sense."
33,2018-07-18,Britannia,"PepsiCo India has cut the sodium content in its Lay’s snacks by 13-15%, a company official said, in line with its global goal to make its products healthier.

Simultaneously, the India arm of the Purchase, New York-based company is shrinking the pack sizes of Lay’s – a Rs 2,000 crore-plus brand — and Kurkure products without reducing the quantity offered in them.

This follows mounting concerns over plastic pollution that’s prompted states, including Maharashtra, to either ban such packaging or ask companies to pay some or the entire cost of managing these materials.

“We are exploring multiple packaging solutions for salty snacks, many of which have to be supported by a technology unlock. It is work in progress,” said Jagrut Kotecha, vice president for snacks at PepsiCo India.

Starting this month, the company has resized the packaging for Lay’s and Kurkure snacks and reduced the consumption of paper used in cartons, which will lower fuel consumption and shrink its carbon footprint. The pack size of Kurkure snacks has been reduced by 6%, while keeping the quantity of the product inside intact.

Kotecha said the company is working on making its metallised packaging recyclable and biodegradable, a project it will pilot in the fourth quarter. It will start compostable packaging for Lay’s and Kurkure this year, he said.

Nestle’s Maggi, PepsiCo’s Lay’s and Parle’s Frooti were identified as the top three plastic waste generators in Mussoorie, a popular hill station in north India, in a survey by the Uttarakhand Environment Protection & Pollution Control Board and Gati Foundation released two months ago.

Kotecha said work is on to meet multiple global commitments and make its portfolio healthier. The US company plans to reduce sodium in 75% of its food products by 2025. It said the volume of sodium in these products will be less than 1.3 milligrams per calorie and that they will not exceed 1.1grams of saturated fat per 100 calories by 2025.

Food companies in India including Nestle, PepsiCo, ITC and Britannia have voluntarily set targets to reduce salt, sugar and trans-fat content in their products as part of the national food regulator’s ‘Eat Right Movement.’

PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has said ‘healthier’ products contributed 50% of the company’s revenue last year compared with 38% in 2006."

The Nifty has entered an overbought zone and unless there is a decisive breakout above the key resistance levels of 11,080 and 11,171, a pullback from current levels cannot be ruled out, said technical analysts. Stocks such as Bandhan Bank, Britannia Industries, Reliance Industries, RBL Bank, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Nalco will continue to trade constructively, they said.


Where are We? Amid an eventful week at the bourses, India’s frontline composites failed to make much progress. The divergence between key composites and broader market indices grew bigger as the Nifty Midcap (-1.1 per cent) and Smallcap (-2.4 per cent) underperformed the Sensex for the sixth straight week. On the sector front, weakness was spotted in the Nifty Metal (-5.9 per cent), Pharma (-2.9 per cent), Auto (-2.3 per cent), and Media (-1.7 per cent) indices.


What is in Store? Key composites continue to be supported by a few stocks while the broader market struggles amid high overhead supply. The Nifty Midcap and Smallcap have corrected 17 per cent and 27 per cent from their all-time highs, while the Sensex and the Nifty are just 0.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent away from lifetime highs.

The list of stocks making new highs continues to be dominated by a few largecap stocks while a majority of small and midcap names struggle below their 50-day moving averages. Going by the weekly RSI, both the Nifty and the Sensex have entered overbought zones. Unless we see a decisive breakout by the Nifty above the key resistance levels of 11,080 and 11,171, a pullback from current levels cannot be ruled out. On the downside, the 50-day line continues to act as a strong support zone for the market.


What could Investors Do? Markets could remain volatile in the coming week owing to the ongoing earnings season and the expiry of July series of derivate contracts. With the overall market displaying divergence, investors should stick to fundamentally strong names, such as Bandhan Bank, Britannia Industries, Reliance Industries, and RBL Bank."

40,2018-07-27,Britannia,"The nationwide truckers' strike, which entered the eighth day today, has impacted industries such as e-commerce, FMCG and automobile, besides hitting the supply of cotton, grains and spices.

The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) started the indefinite strike on July 20, with demands to reduce diesel prices by bringing it under the GST and reforming the ""flawed and non-transparent"" toll collection system.

E-commerce major Amazon said the strike has affected its product deliveries in some cities.

""Owing to the ongoing difficulties caused by the strike, the delivery of products in a few cities has been impacted and we are working closely with these customers to get their orders to them quickly,"" its spokesperson said.

Flipkart, however, declined to comment on the issue.

FMCG major Dabur India's executive director - operations, Sharukh Khan, said the company had put in place appropriate measures and ensured adequate inventories to meet the demand in anticipation of the strike.

""However, if the strike continues, the entire industry would be staring at supply disruptions,"" he warned.

Vinay Singh Kushwaha, vice-president - supply chain, Britannia said the prolonged strike has adversely impacted both inbound and outbound stock movements.

""This has resulted in a complete slow-down of sales over the last few days. The situation is getting out of hand and need a quick resolution,"" he added.

Kushwaha said the strike has also resulted in factory stoppages in some locations leading to idle manpower and associated issues, and warned that if the situation does not improve, ""we will have irreversible losses"".

Industry body Assocham today said the strike has already caused direct and indirect estimated loss worth over Rs 50,000 crore to the economy, with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) being worst affected.

Automobile industry body SIAM today said companies have had to adjust production as the strike affected both parts supplies and distribution of vehicles.

""Our members are facing unprecedented crisis as it is affecting the movement of vehicles and components supply because of the strike,"" Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) deputy director general Sugato Sen said in a statement today.

Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil) chairman Ujwal Lahoti said the transport strike has started adversely affecting textiles exports.

""There is sharp disruption in the movement of raw materials to the factories and finished goods to the ports for exports,"" he added.

Lahoti said there are strict shipment schedules given by the foreign buyers for exports and many of the textiles exporters will miss these schedules which may result in the loss of export orders.

Cotton Association of India (CAI) president Atul Ganatra said ginning factories are on the verse of closing down because of the lack of raw material.

""The traders are not able to move the cotton sold and in turn all payments are stuck up due to non-movement of yarn,"" said Ganatra.

Anil Chavan, secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Mumbai, said the grains and spices market were affected due to the transport strike, with only 12 trucks and tempos of spices and 145 trucks and tempos of grains arriving at the mandi today till 4 pm, compared with 193 for spices and 308 for grains on July 20.

Similarly, in vegetables, 612 trucks and tempos arrived in the mandi today, compared with 636 on July 20.

However, Chavan said fruits and vegetables supply remained unaffected during the strike."
41,2018-07-30,Britannia,"After several weeks of consolidation, the Nifty touched a new closing high of 11,278 on July 27. The new peak also provides us with an opportunity to look at some mutual fund schemes which have done exceedingly well between the benchmark’s previous and current peaks. The previous high for the Nifty was at 10,452, which it touched on November 3, 2017. It means the benchmark appreciated just by 7.9 per cent. In contrast, some large-cap funds have give much better returns during the same period. We bring to you four such mutual fund schemes and their investment strategies:


Invesco Large Cap Fund
Fund manager: Amit Ganatra

The scheme largely focuses on business leaders across sectors. This gives it a large-cap bias. Ganatra selects companies based on their competitive advantage. For manufacturing companies, he focuses on return on capital employed or Return on Equity. For banks, it is net interest margin and for commodity companies it is about cost leadership. Keeping these factors in mind, Ganatra have created a portfolio of well-placed large—sized companies which have delivered compounded annual growth rate of more than 15 per cent in the past 10 to 15 years. Since there has been high interest in large-sized companies in the year-to-date period, the scheme has benefited immensely from it. Companies such as HDFC Bank, TCS, Infosys, and Reliance Industries have boosted the scheme’s performance between the two peaks of the Nifty.


Axis Bluechip
Fund Manager: Shreyash Devalkar

After a lacklustre performance for several years, Axis Bluechip is back in the reckoning in the past one year. There are a few reasons why the scheme has done well. First, the scheme’s fund manager Shreyash Devalkar who joined the scheme in November 2016 focused on quality and growth companies which was in sync with the flavour of the markets. Factors he kept in mind in selecting companies have been high Return on Equity, revenue and margin growth and penetration in market. Three sectors met these criteria. These are financials especially retail-focused banks, auto and auto-ancillaries and consumption. Besides, unlike his peer schemes, Devalkar reduced the scheme’s exposure to midcap to 6 per cent and enhanced to large-sized companies to over 90 per cent. Hence, in the past one year when mid-sized companies fell, Axis Bluechip’s returns did not fall as much as its peers.


DSP Blackrock Top 100
Fund Manager: Harrish Zaveri

Zaveri has been a stickler to quality. He hunts for stocks with strong cash flows, high ROE and secular growth. These factors have paid off quite well for the scheme. Zaveri has been bullish on private sector banks in which he has picked up HDFC Bank. In the BFSI sector, he picked NBFC like Bajaj Finance. The scheme also benefited from its exposure to insurance companies. Among the auto companies, which indicates Zaveri’s focus on consumption theme, he chose Maruti. Such diversified portfolio creation across sectors have helped the fund emerge as a winner in the past one year.


Canara Robeco Bluechip Equity
Fund Manager: Shridatta Bhandwaldar

As a fund house, Canara Robeco focuses that capture compounding stories which have visibility, sustainability, and longevity of earnings. In this, Bhanwaldar focussed largely on stories which fall under consumption theme. Due to this, the scheme’s portfolio had companies which are well-established, have strong competitive advantages in their respective sectors and entry barriers in those sectors will be high. Selecting companies based on these parameters has paid off and upped the scheme’s performance. Companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Britannia and L&T have enhance the scheme’s performance. Also Bhanwaldar stayed away from sectors which were draw-downs. He stayed away from sectors such as metals, telecom and PSU banks."

7,2018-08-03,Britannia,"Amarendra D is collecting and scanning inventory at the Flipkart warehouse in Hoskote. After a series of job refusals, he has finally gained a career foothold at India’s largest ecommerce company. Finding a job was challenging not due to lack of qualification but because this history graduate is hearing- and speechimpaired.

What made employment even more crucial was that the 27-year-old’s father, a farmer from a water-scarce village in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, has debts to clear. Amarendra’s career path has one important objective — to learn as much as he can and not be limited to a specific task at the warehouse. His goal, he says in sign language, is to become a team leader in the next two years and buy a flat in the city so that his parents can finally retire from farming.

Amarendra is among the 153 full-time differently-abled persons currently employed across five metros with Flipkart. The city-headquartered ecommerce platform first employed 25 persons with disabilities (PwD) as delivery executives in 2016. Now, the recruitment has expanded to include various roles along the supply chain — from the warehouse to smaller fulfilment centres (delivery hubs). Employees are primarily speech and hearing impaired while some suffering from physical disability.

The organisation is collaborating with sign language interpreters and local nonprofits working in this space. The latter step in to engage with family and caregivers, who are often too protective to let PwDs work in mainstream jobs.

While delivery executives have SOSenabled smartphones, along with special badges and flash cards, to communicate with customers, differently-abled individuals on the warehouse floor are identified with black and grey-striped jackets that they wear as a security measure.

“Recruitments are underway and we hope to work with 300 differently-abled people across various roles by the end of the year,” said Aashima Jain, project lead of the Ekartians with Different Abilities (eDAB) initiative. Ekart is Flipkart’s logistics arm.

The hiring underway at India’s largest ecommerce platform is another step towards an inclusive workforce that corporates have been trying to create. The list of startups, quick-service restaurants and companies in Bengaluru that hire PwDs is a long one — Amazon, Accenture, Cisco, State Bank of India, Big Basket, RedBus, Cafe Coffee Day, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Capgemini, ThoughtWorks, Lemon Tree, Britannia and ITC. With conscious capitalism and technology enablers, PwDs are becoming an integral part of a company.


BEING THE CHANGE
With a 1.3-billion population and 450 million-plus workforce, the 2011 Census states that India has 2.68-crore people with some form of disability. Estimates by the World Bank and the World Health Organisation (WHO), however, put the figure upwards of 7 crore. Given the country’s jobless economic growth and the fact that almost one million people are added to the country’s workforce every month, PwDs are often denied employment opportunities. At a fundamental level, they often do not have access to basic educational infrastructure and healthcare.

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2017, have contributed to companies not only ensuring that at least 3% of their workforce is differentlyabled but also providing assistive technology, tailor-made training and support systems to ensure that PwDs learn and grow in their jobs.

SAP Labs, for instance, employs PwDs in roles including human resources, software development, quality control and technical writing. “By year-end, we will formally roll out an end-to-end policy for PwDs, This will address all concerns including hiring, educating managers, appointment of liaison officers and support services for communication, disability councils and grievance committees,” said Kiran Venkataramanappa, lead for inclusion, SAP Labs India. “In the past five years, we have seen a 95% retention rate among differently-abled employees.” The software company also has an Autism at Work initiative.

Companies across sectors have said that employing PwDs also makes sound business sense given the low attrition rates, high productivity, loyalty and low absenteeism. IBM, for instance, has created a business resource group called EnAblers India, a collective to increase sensitisation, networking, mentoring and learning opportunities. “We ensure that essential job functions are clearly laid out for every position along with the fact that reasonable accommodation is available so that PwDs can understand the nature and requirements of the job and apply for it as per their skills, interests and abilities,” said Chaitanya N Sreenivas, vice president & HR Head, IBM India / South Asia.

There is, however, need for consistent sensitisation. Deepa Narasimhan, head of diversity and inclusion at Dell-EMC India, said that one of their biggest responsibilities is to increase awareness and create more opportunities for PwDs to rise up the corporate ladder. Narasimhan is tetraplegic, paralysed neck down and leads by example to ensure that inclusion is not restricted to a recruitment initiative and is internalised by the company top-down.

“Our biggest learning has been to adopt a case-by-case approach to understand what each employee needs to be independent and empowered and provide assistive technology or infrastructure accordingly,” she said. This has helped the organisation to employ over 100 differently-abled individuals, including ones with multiple disabilities like deaf-blindness and paralysis, apart from autism and cerebral palsy.

Asha Sreedhar, quality associate at SAP Labs India who is autistic, said that in the past three years, she has observed the level of sensitisation go up significantly. Today, her colleagues are communicating more easily, being more understanding and ensuring that she participates in all official and cultural events organised.




LONG WAY TO GO
Muthu Raj, project executive, Youth4Jobs, a company that skills and helps PwDs find employment, said that despite legislation and awareness, only about 24% of PwDs get access to livelihood opportunities. Furthermore, what stunts their growth prospects in organisations is also the lack of open-source alternatives for expensive assistive technology. “The Refreshable Braille Display used by deaf-blind or paralytic individuals, for instance, costs Rs 2 lakh and can be serviced only in the US or UK. Not all companies can afford these solutions, which is why individuals with severe or multiple disabilities often fall back in the employment race.”

According to Shiva Hiremath, deputy director, The Association of People with Disability (APD), the formal employment sector is growing at 1.5% annually, but the graph is moving up steadily. PwDs, he said, are also unable to capitalise on job opportunities because of a skill gap. He pointed out that there are over 1000 skill development centres in Karnataka, each training individuals for at least five job roles. “Very few of them include and train PwDs. The government has to make inclusion mandatory there.”

At a fundamental level, Hiremath said that the health and education departments must pull up their socks to increase sensitisation among themselves about available welfare schemes for PwDs and also make sure people are aware of it and utilise it. “The health department must provide therapy and counselling support to PwDs and caregivers right from when a child with disability is born. School teachers must be trained. This will reduce the lacuna in policy implementation,” Hiremath said.

Dell-EMC India’s Deepa Narasimhan pointed out that for effective inclusion in job sectors, the government must be as serious about strengthening its policy for the disabled as it is with the Right to Education. “Availability of public infrastructure will go a long way in increasing employee productivity and encouraging more people to apply for jobs,” she said.

VS Basavaraju, State Commissioners for Persons with Disabilities in Karnataka, admitted that government school teachers and health centres are illequipped to handle PwDs. “Many-atimes, teachers cannot even identify disabilities. To correct this, I am travelling to every district, holding meetings with all the concerned officials, local nonprofits and caregivers over two-three days, increasing sensitivity and demanding accountability,” he said. “Even companies employing PwDs have to maintain and provide regular reports about their employees. If PwDs are discontinued from service or rejected, they have to provide detailed reasons why.”

At the end of the day, engaging PwDs is not about numbers, said Avesh Kumar Jha, Senior VP, Organisational Development and Performance Management, Hinduja Global Solutions, which employs 275 PwDs. “Not only does it make sound business sense in terms of loyalty and productivity, engaging with PwDs helps other employees learn creativity, patience and tolerance.”

For Narasimhan, it is about keeping the happiness quotient high at all times. “The differently-abled must know that they just need to reach out. There are many opportunities out there.”"

14,2018-08-06,Britannia,"FMCG major Britannia Industries today reported a 19.41 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 258.08 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, driven by double-digit volume growth.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 216.12 crore in the April-June period a year ago.

Its total income stood at Rs 2,585.84 crore in the quarter under review. It was Rs 2,375.01 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, Britannia Industries said in a BSE filing.

The company said the reported revenue, part of total income, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, is not comparable to the revenue reported in the previous period due to implementation of GST with effect from July 1, 2017.

""Excise duty has subsumed into GST, and hence revenue from sale of goods for the period commencing July 1, 2017 does not include excise duty,"" it added.

""We have witnessed positive momentum in the market over the last few quarters. Our double-digit growth for the quarter is backed by a double-digit volume growth primarily due to our investment in brands and widening our distribution network through focus on direct reach, rural market and weak states,"" Britannia Industries MD Varun Berry said.

Britannia said its international business remained flat due to slow-down in geographies like Middle East and Africa.

""The growth in dairy business has been subdued due to our focus on driving value added products and reducing our play in the less profitable commoditised products, which has helped us improve our profitability,"" Britannia said.

The company said in its 100th year it will enter into "" many unchartered territories"" to secure disruptive growth.

In a separate filing, the company said its board of directors has recommended and approved issuance of secured redeemable non-convertible debentures as bonus debentures of Rs 60 in the ratio of 1 bonus debenture for every 1 equity share held by shareholders of the company.

The company said it would issue 12,01,59,147 bonus debentures of Rs 720.95 crore.

""The company will utilise balance in retained earnings to the extent of Rs 869.11 crore including deemed dividend tax,"" it added.

It further informed that a meeting of the board of directors will be held on August 23, 2018, to consider the sub-division of equity shares of the company of face value of Rs 2 each.

18,2018-08-07,Britannia,"KOLKATA: India’s second-largest listed packaged food company Britannia Industries promoter chairman Nusli Wadia on Monday hinted that he may soon step down from the board to pass on the baton and make the board younger.

Addressing a shareholder query on the “age of the board” during Britannia’s 99th annual general meeting (AGM) in Kolkata on Monday, 74-year-old Wadia said the company will soon “refresh the board, including myself.”

Later talking to reporters, he said that when the time will come to review the board, “we will renew the board. I am also getting older...” He joined the Britannia board in 1993. He, however, declined to comment on any succession plan.

Britannia’s board includes Nusli Wadia, MD Varun Berry, and three promoter directors — Ness Wadia, Jeh Wadia and AK Hirjee. There are eight other non-executive independent directors.

Incidentally, Britannia’s board of directors at a meeting in May recommended the continuation of Nusli Wadia as director who would turn 75 in February 2019 and promoter non-executive director Hirjee who has turned attained the age of 75 years. The proposal was put up for shareholder approval during the AGM. Britannia in its latest annual report said non-executive independent director SS Kelkar, who attained the age of 75, has expressed the desire to step down from the board during 2018-19.

Separately, the company also took shareholder approval to extend the MD’s tenure for another five years from April 2019 to March 2024.

Wadia said Britannia will invest Rs 400-500 crore by next year for capacity expansion and new product development, including Rs 300 crore to set up a dairy plant whose site may be relocated from Maharashtra to Andhra Pradesh since the company is yet to hear from the Maharashtra government on incentives.

“Britannia has been waiting to hear from the Maharashtra government for over a year on the incentives for the dairy project. Hence, we are exploring whether to shift the project to Andhra Pradesh,” Wadia said.

Berry said Britannia’s largest selling brand, Good Day, will overtake the country’s largest selling biscuit brand, Parle G, of Parle Products in next three years if it continues to grow at this pace. Good Day has sales of around Rs 4,000 crore.

The company will also launch 50 new products this year to celebrate the company’s 100 years of operation, he said. “While biscuit business is 75% of our revenue, we expect the non-biscuit segment to grow whereby the ratio should be 50-50 in next five years,” said Berry.

20,2018-08-07,Britannia,"Today we feel we are very solid as far as our base business is concerned so we can be a little bold, a little adventurous, Varun Berry, MD, Britannia 
   
   
   Industries, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What is your plan for Britannia?
What we want to do is to create a total foods company. With the kind of brands that we have, I think we have a right to succeed in a lot more categories which are outside our core and that is going to be our credo for the next century. We are not 100 years old, we are 100 years young, we want to make sure that we bring a lot of energy for taking our business to a lot of unknown territories. 

These unknown territories could be within bakery or outside bakery but certainly within macro snacks. Also, we are looking at expanding our footprint internationally. It is going to be a very exciting phase. Personally, I am very excited about the entire strategic framework that we have been able to develop at Britannia and we have got a complete buy in from our board as well so we are looking forward to the next century.


Up until now, your focus and expertise has been in biscuits business while non-biscuits share was 20% to 30%. But it is still going to be a little tough. You are going to enter unchartered territories. How do you plan to push the non-biscuits businesses to the consumer? How do you plan to relate the Britannia brand with those products because Britannia means biscuits.
We are thinking in concentric circles. Six years back, we decided that it was not the right time for us to be in so many new categories and so we consolidated. There were some categories that we decided to exit because we wanted to strengthen our biscuit business which was a little unstable at that point.

There is a time for everything. Today we feel we are very solid as far as our base business is concerned so we can be a little bold, a little adventurous. Hence, comes the confidence to get into new territories. If you take aim and want to hit a target you will not hit every bullet into the bulls’ eye and we understand that every product that we launch is not going to be successful but the concentric circles are going to start with our core. 

There is going to be a lot of innovation in the territories that we already operate in with completely new products and formats. Within biscuits, Deuce is a chocolate slab on a biscuit and it is a completely new territory. Similarly, we are going to look at other hybrid biscuit categories. 

We have a very basic cake business. So, we are looking at bringing in some very interesting value-added cake products in the next four to five months. Similarly, in rusk, in dairy, we are looking at bringing in some highly value-added products. This is how the concentric circle works, filling up the gaps within the categories that you operate in and then start to move outwards.

If you take bakery as a concentric circle, there are a lot of gaps. We have a joint venture there. We are going to look at fulfilling those gaps within the bakery segment. 


Would there be some synergies between your operations?
Obviously. If you are looking at the bakery business, at the same time, you are looking at building a business which is different but where the core is the same and then we move outwards to other categories which are outside of bakery and which could be in the macro snacking category. I cannot discuss what but you will know soon enough.


Can we expect a launch in that category in the next one year or two years?
Yes, for sure.


I was reading one of your interviews where we spoke about brand equity. A brand should have a certain amount of equity. I have to talk about a moat that Britannia has because at the end of the day, biscuits is a bit of a commoditised company and it is only in hardcore innovations where you guys have so far been excelling. If I have to talk about a moat, what would that be?
There are two moats for Britannia; the first moat is the brand itself and in my 30 plus years of experience, within the consumer industry what I have seen is that you can do a lot of stuff but you cannot build brands in a hurry. So, that is our big moat and it is something that no one can match. 

The second moat that we have is about being a low-cost operator. I do not think that there is any company which operates with the kind of costs that we operate in. While we make a not so healthy gross margin, we make a very healthy net margin because our fixed costs are reasonably low. Those are the two moats that we think we have completely built around our business and we will continue to strengthen them as we go forward.


I am going to ask you about your Q1 numbers. Your stock has soared to new highs on account of the strong top line. It impressed the street a lot, almost 14-15% odd. , I know you do not give out this number very often in the press but I am take my chances. What are your volumes because that is the key parameter …
No, no, I give volume numbers. Volumes have been pretty good. Domestic volumes have grown by almost 12.5% and overall volumes have grown 12% and this is the third quarter of double digit volume growth. It is looking good. I feel very positive about the way we are moving forward and frankly I have been dreaming about double digit volume growth for a long time and now we have done it three quarters running.


But you do not believe this is on account of a low base?
It is. There is a little bit of that but I think that the momentum should continue to an extent. The last two years have been a little disturbed because of demonetisation and GST implementation. This could be our first year of double digit volume growth. I have got my fingers crossed.


You have not only looked at a brand from the revenues point but also margins and profitability, which brings me to my next question. You said gross margins may not be at the top compared to the industry but EBITDA margins have done very well. Are you seeing support? 
The commodity basket has been flat. Versus last year, there has not been too much inflation till now. But now we have started to see the MSPs increasing. So now onwards, there will be slightly larger inflation. We do not get support from raw material prices. If we are growing volumes at 12.5% and if there is hardly any price, there is only a little bit of mix change and rest is all volumes, we do not take the prices up. 

When there is inflationary trend, we will be forced to take prices up. So the delta between the volume growth and the revenue growth widens a bit. As we go forward, maybe that delta widens a bit.


But are you confident of maintaining margins, at least the margin expansion trajectory?
We will certainly try our best. We have done it in the past. We have seen inflationary trends in the past as well. We are hopeful that we will be able to do that.


 Your dairy business has not picked up the way one would have expected. You have lost a bit of market share in cheese to your peers. How did dairy do in Q1 and how do you think dairy is going to shape up for Britannia?
Dairy is the largest category within foods and that makes it very attractive. Two things that make dairy very attractive – one is the size of the dairy market and second is the health connotations. This is a category that a company like ours cannot avoid. 

In last two years, we have grown the value-added business fairly. There is a double-digit growth as far as value-added business is concerned in dairy products. We have trailed off our commoditised businesses like ghee and that’s why you can’t see a large growth in dairy prodicts.

Currently we are doing a trading model in dairy. We have contract packers who do products for us. We brand them with Britannia brand name and we sell it in the market. In the dairy business, to be profitable you need to own your backend and need to do a lot more innovation than we have done which will come once we get into value added products and do a lot of R&D work, etc, so that is what we are looking forward to."

22,2018-08-08,Britannia,"Fonterra, the world’s biggest dairy exporter has entered into an equal joint venture with Future Group to launch dairy products in India.

With revenues exceeding $14 billion, Fonterra is New Zealand's largest firm and twice the size of India's Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, that sells Amul. The group’s fast moving consumer goods arm Future Consumer (FCL has nearly three dozen brands, half of which is sold at its flagship Big Bazaar stores and nearly 21% at retail firms that it acquired including Nilgiris, Heritage and Easy Day. 

“ Within the dairy space, we will launch new categories and innovative products for India’s new age customers,” said Kishore Biyani, ceo at Future Group. “Its a segment where consumers indulge over 3-4 times a day. We will merge our existing Nilgiris dairy business into the new firm”

Fonterra Co-Op was formed after two major dairy co-operatives - Kiwi Co-operative Dairies and New Zealand Dairy Group merged with the New Zealand Dairy Board in 2001. A year later, it entered India through a joint venture with Britannia but exited in 2007. 

The JV - Fonterra Future- will launch its first product by mid-next year on retail shelves and will also have direct to home subscription model. 

“It will allow us the prepare the groundwork and make the most of our expertise as we enter the world’s largest and fastest growing market. Consumer demand for dairy in India over the next seven years is set to increase to 82 billion litres - seven times the forecasted growth for China. 

FCL, which counts Arisaig Partners and Verlinvest as its investors, has been building distribution network beyond its own stores - it partnered Indo-Nissin to sell products at kirana stores and also has partners such as Tata StarBazaar, Metro and Spar, besides 5,000 Rajasthan fair price shops. In addition, the Company has also built a rural wholesale club model through Aadhaar in other states in Western India.

The company also has a host of other global tie-ups including Hain Celestial to manufacture and sell food products in the health and wellness space and Mibelle AG, a division of Migros Group, Switzerland, to make a range of personal-care products under the brand Swiss Tempelle."
23,2018-08-08,Britannia,"From a valuation perspective, do not buy everything just because it seems to be going up: Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind, tells ET Now. 
  
  
  Edited excerpts:

A lot of people are saying the market will be rising higher. We are getting aggressive targets of Nifty moving towards 12,000, 13,000 and 14,000 in six months, one year, two years. How are you viewing market? Do you have valuation comfort at these levels or do you feel that this is a stock specific market and not a broad-based rally?
To be honest, all markets are stock specific. Very few markets will move based on the index. But having said that, the index level valuations in some stocks are at crazy new extremes. Yesterday, they had the second highest PE number on the Nifty ever since early 2000s when it was higher than this.

Secondly, we have got earnings growth as a whole at an abysmal 3% or 4% on Nifty. You are not seeing earnings recovery happening just now. For last three years, it has been suspect. Nifty next 50 is also at an all-time high in PE terms.


There has been a huge change in composition of Nifty index over last 10 or 15 years. Earlier, we had more of manufacturing companies where PE has to be less. Today we are in an index dominated by financials and FMCGs where PE has to be high. Is it right to compare 10-year-old data with current PE?
Well yes. At the index level we have 50 stocks. It is true some are FMCG companies and some are financial services. But why are we giving banks 30 PEs? We used to give banks 7 PEs earlier. They are not even growing at the same rate as they used to. We used to give IT companies 100 times earnings. Today we are giving them only 10 times earnings. PE numbers of individual stock or sectors basis will change but as an aggregate on a broad index, 50 stock indexes are reasonably good.

If you do not grow your PE or your PE goes haywire, you should at least be seeing earnings growth. You are seeing PE expansion but no earnings growth on aggregate. Your manufacturing company base changed to financial service or a FMCG company base today. If earnings on aggregate are not growing, then we are paying too much. It is wrong.

If you look at the PE metrics for the last one year, very often caution is not abundantly stated and sometimes you just give up saying that this is overvalued just because markets not going down. But it is in my opinion. Having said that, individual stock stories still continue with basically great earnings in some stocks. I would still stay stock specific, I am still a buyer. I have not shorted the market and from a valuation perspective, I would say do not buy everything just because it seems to be going up.


We are seeing private banks making a comeback. ICICI Bank is up by 1.63% and I am not just referring to today’s price action. Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have been making a comeback at the cost of IndusInd Bank, Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank. These stocks have not been performing now. May be people will not increase the exposure towards banking space to accommodate ICICI Bank and Axis Bank in their portfolio once again and that is the reason we are seeing cut in stance when it comes to HDFC Bank, Kotak or IndusInd. Is this the right way to think?
There is another round of NPAs coming and this is primarily because there is another AQR with the RBI. There will be obviously an NCLT four level suggestions on cross- industry NPA recognition. Both these factors will lead to Axis and ICICI getting impacted more than HDFC, Kotak or IndusInd. Therefore, if you were to make a choice between them, one should stick with HDFC, Kotak, IndusInd and may be a Yes Bank. There are some corporate problems in Yes Bank as well.

If you are willing to own some of the newer banks, then an RBL or may be a Bandhan Bank can be considered after may a be couple of quarters’ results because the NPA cycle there is in a much more controlled fashion. I would say allocating more to the financial sector may not be a good thing, given interest rates are rising. But if you were in that, then I would concentrate on HDFC, Kotak and IndusInd.


Some of the high value expensive names include Reliance Industries, Piramal Enterprises or for that matter, the newly listed entity HDFC AMC. Do you continue to chase quality and do you buy them at that expensive price?
I wish I could say yes but the most expensive stock I am buying is probably Maruti. There are reasons to buy these stocks. Reliance is not actually very expensive if you look at it from an earnings multiple perspective. It is probably just higher priced than it was two or three years back but historically it has been valued at much higher. 

But stocks like the FMCG biggies are at 80x and 70x. Britannia or Nestle are good quality companies but I do not know whether you would pay the price of a Mercedes Benz for a Maruti. It is just not the same thing. You are not going to get the value for your money at these prices. It is okay to be in cash and so we still retain a reasonable cash position. 

We are still buying some of the smaller cap companies and even the large caps companies where valuations are lower. Maybe a Hero MotorCorp or two-wheeler companies because I can see some growth coming in from earnings in the longer term there. I do not see that happening in some of the larger names. If you pay a high PE, then expect high growth in earnings. But that is not happening and my theory is that I would not buy it.


Why are you sitting on high levels of cash right now? Do you sense that the market is getting a little toppish?
We are probably 30-40% in cash, which is fine. We do not see that having been fully invested will give us great returns five years from now. So, it does not make sense unless you are trading momentum or you are trading short term to be completely invested.

If you are a long-term investor, you should keep some cash at hand. It is historically all times when valuations were at these levels that we have seen corrections. In corrections, you need to be in cash because you need to be able to buy. 

We have kept that cash position and we are happy. We still participate 60-70% of the positions but we are not going to completely put our money in right now because this is not the time."
24,2018-08-09,Britannia,"A question that cropped up at the Tata Motors AGM — why did Nusli Wadia’s name still figure as a company director on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs website?
Britannia Industries promoter chairman Nusli Wadia’s boardroom presence, or the lack of it, are both newsworthy.

So naturally word from Wadia about an impending decision to step down from the packaged foods company’s board is a talking point. But so is his ghost presence on the board of a company that he didn’t quite part ways with amicably.

At the Tata Motors annual general meeting, held in Mumbai last week, one of the shareholders had a single question for the management team on stage, that included chairman N Chandrasekaran, CEO Guenter Butschek and group CFO P B Balaji — If Nusli Wadia was removed as a director from the Tata Motors board on December 22, 2016, why does his name still show up on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website as a company director? The question wasn’t answered.


Nusli Wadia
A search on the website confirms the shareholder’s query. What makes the question interesting is the events surrounding Wadia’s removal from the board at the time. 

Following Cyrus Mistry’s ouster as the Tata Sons chairman, Wadia had publicly supported Mistry. He subsequently had even sued Ratan Tata and the Tata Sons board for defamation. Right after, he was removed from the boards of three different Tata Group companies — Tata Steel, Tata Chemicals and Tata Motors — through shareholder voting at extraordinary general meetings.

Of the three companies, only Tata Chemicals director list on the website is updated. Tata Steel as well as Tata Motors continue to list Wadia as a director.

26,2018-08-09,Britannia,"Till the time we are out of the election cycle, what has worked for last couple of years will continue to work, Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, Institutional 
  
  
  Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Light at the end of the tunnel now seems to be a reality. For the longest time, experts have argued that earnings recovery is round the corner and markets did not oblige. But for the first time, it looks like analysts are finally getting it right. There is reason to get optimistic about earnings recovery.
Yes, you put it right. The things seemed better this time compared to the last couple of quarters. Numbers are doing fine even though they are not surprising big time but at least they are not disappointing which we had gone used to. What one still needs to be circumspect about is that the downgrades have not stopped. 

When I look at my universe, we are still downgrading two companies for every upgrade that we are making. The upgrade to downgrade ratio is still 0.5. For the quarter at least, the numbers are in line. EBITDA across the board whether it is my universe or Nifty, is up 22-23% which is in line with expectations. 

Of course, as far as Nifty is concerned, there is some disappointment in profit because of the corporate banks where the provisions have been raised up, but markets will look beyond that because it is at least signalling that we are now nearing the end of that bad asset cycle. So yes, fingers are crossed. We are not having too much of an upside room as far as valuations are concerned on Nifty and midcaps are still trading at 20-22% premium to largecaps. That also is in a way in a rising bond yield environment and caps the valuation room for upside.


We cannot take our eyes off ICICI Bank. Within days, it has climbed up to 320 levels. Would you say that the worst is over for corporate banks and is ICICI Bank the go-to story here? Everything seems to be in its favour. 
Absolutely. This has been our preferred pick in the corporate banking space. It is part of our model portfolio since long and as you said clarity on the asset cycle, provisions have been raised further. Valuations are in its favour. Subsidiary valuations are also quite attractive. Things seems to be settling down for this bank. We will need to see a couple of more quarters whether these things are finally over and whether we can restart the new cycle as far as asset quality is concerned. 

But given the valuations, clearly the risk reward is very favourable and for the quarter also they have done pretty well. They have raised the provisioning estimates. To that extent, there was some miss on the bottom line front but the quality of earnings has turned better. The watch list has reduced significantly. Overall stressed assets have also come off and clearly subsidiaries are doing pretty okay. It continues to be a part of our model portfolio. It remains the best pick as far as corporate banking part of the portfolio is concerned.


We were talking about Eicher Motors earnings coming out later today. Do you think it is time to step away from the auto space like Maruti or Eicher Motors and start looking for that alpha play?
For this quarter, auto numbers across the board have been disappointing, save Ashok Leyland and for that matter, Maruti, Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, Hero, TVS Motors also. The numbers were well below expectations from the profitability front even though volumes were in line. 

Clearly margin pressures are mounting and we are in a rising commodity cost environment. Wherever there is lack of pricing power, it will get reflected in the numbers going forward as well. We have cut earnings estimate for auto across the board, and I am not talking about Tata Motors only. 

The other secular stories have also seen earnings cut. This quarter will go down as a disappointment for auto names. What we like within the auto space for some time now has been Maruti and M&M. Our preference has clearly been towards the four-wheeler space because we feel the competitive intensity in that space is relatively more stable and the opportunities of volume growth continues to remain very high -- be it M&M or Maruti. Within two-wheelers, we have liked Bajaj Auto for some time now. We feel that valuations are now reasonable and the market to an extent has over reacted to the fears of price war.


This morning we are talking about oil cooling off and we have seen that the OMCs have reported a good set of numbers. Do you think that the oil and gas space which is plagued by concerns of higher oil prices, can be seen as an opportunity and is there value in OMCs?
Clearly there is a lot of value in OMCs whether oil is at $70 or $75. We had actually done a report talking about the value that current market prices are discounting and there is substantial undervaluation in the space. But the problem that we need to contain within the next couple of months is that we will be heading straight into the election cycle and that is where a lot of uncertainty will creep in. 

While numbers can be fine and oil prices could remain range-bound, the markets propensity to ascribe the multiple to those numbers will be constrained in my view. This will remain a trading bet till elections are out of the way and even yesterday’s number of both HPCL and BPCL on core GRM front has disappointed big time. The numbers which were reported obviously propped up the inventory gains. I will stay sideways on OMCs.


In the past, retail banks, retail NBFCs, consumer staples and consumer durables have worked. At a time when markets are looking at a rotation, if ICICI Bank is making a comeback, if Axis Bank is recovering, do you think what has worked in last three years as a pet theme may start taking a backseat? HDFC Bank may start underperforming or get into timewise correction. HUL and Britannia may not give you any returns. Maruti may slip into a timewise correction. Could there be a very stark rotation for next 12 to 18 months?
There is non-zero probability of that happening but my view is that till the time we are out of the election cycle, what has worked for last couple of years will continue to work. And the reason is very clear. Some of these corporate banks, some of the cyclicals have done well. But as a pack you cannot take a call based on one quarter of numbers. 

My view is that the same four-five sectors which is consumption, private banks, NBFCs, autos and to an extent IT will continue to do very well at least till election related uncertainties are out of the way. While micros have clearly improved, we have seen some deterioration in macros in the last four or five months on the inflation front, rate hike, bond yields, crude, the global trade war concerns. That will keep the market little bit on the tenterhooks as far as the broad cyclical or the value part of the equation is concerned. 

We prefer quality with earnings visibility plays and selectively wherever we find things to be getting better, we increasing the weights for those stocks in our model portfolio. ICICI Bank is part of our model portfolio. We have Yes Bank as another proxy to play the same corporate banking cycle. Broadly, I will still side with the quality plus earnings visibility theme which has worked well and will continue to work well even for the next 12 months.

Consumption has done well and you will see very strong recovery going forward as well. This has been our view for last 15 odd months. Even last three-four quarters including this quarter, the commentary that has been coming in from consumers -- whether it is stables or discretionary – is that things are picking up both on urban and rural front and my view is that for the next nine months this consumption recovery will gain further strength. While clearly there is no debate on valuations from a one year point of view, those valuations can remain irrational for some more time.


In light of this mega HDFC AMC IPO, what are you making of the AMC business? Could you see a shift out of the HDFC Bank into HDFC AMC?
As far as AMC business is concerned, clearly, we are in the midst of a very important and structural shift in favour of financial assets as far as saving is concerned. So financialisation of savings which has been talked about for some time now remains a big theme to play in the next couple of years, maybe even five years, 10 years. 

But whether investors will shift from HDFC Bank to HDFC AMC looks a little improbable because of the size of the companies that we are talking about; also secondly, AMCs remain a cyclical business whereas private bank if far more structural and there is far stronger value migration away from the PSU banking set and there the opportunity is still humungous because 70% of the system is still with PSU banks. 

While on an absolutely basis people will play the AMC scheme, people will play the theme of brokerages, insurance which is a broad spectrum of financialization of savings but I do not think there is a possibility of people moving assets from the banks or NBFCs towards this. We have 40% weightage for financials already in the index and it looks like this could inch up a bit higher because we still do not have representations of the non-bank, non-NBFC space in the bigger indices. So that theme will continue to play and it looks very solid, just that as you mentioned about HDFC AMC has had a stellar listing. So, maybe from a near term point of view, there is obviously some cap on the upside that one can make but if somebody has a medium to long-term view. clearly this is a theme to play.


Themes for Value Migration

If you have to summarise one big trend for the next three to five to 10 years, where you see a strong earnings visibility and a big migration of value, where could that be? 
Just two months back, we had come out with a sequel report on value migration where we looked back to what exactly has happened in the last 12 months since our first report came out. We found that there are two areas where the pace of value migration has accelerated; one is clearly PSU to private banking or even insurance place because this is a theme which will continue to play out for the next five, ten years and I have no hesitation in admitting that even at these prices, I will not be too concerned if I am overweight on private retail banks. 

The second theme which we have highlighted is the jewellery space. Titan has been our top India consumer discretionary bet for the last two years now. Even at this price, I will be very positive there. Titan can easily compound earnings at more than 25% for the next three years. What has happened in the jewellery space is that even before GST, demonetisation itself has started the migration away from unorganised to organised. 

GST has just come in and helped and that space is big, $55 billion of jewellery industry we talk about, almost 800-900 tons per annum of gold consumption and hardly one player standing out there which has a pan India footprint and a very strong brand equity which is gaining share every single day. So, I will be very positive on that space.

Then of course, there is a broad set of consumption categories -- consumer electrical, adhesives, diagnostic space -- where the room for growth by sheer shift from unorganised to organised base trade exists for a long time. It has not materialised yet barring one or two categories, because we are still in the early days as far as GST is concerned. It is hardly one year but these are things where from a 3-5-year point of view, there can be many compounding opportunities."
29,2018-08-10,Britannia,"The correction is a a wonderful opportunity to ignore the so-called highest quality largecaps and come to the mid and smallcaps, Porinju Veliyath, Founder & CEO, 
Equity Intelligence India, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Last time we spoke, there was a carnage, a messy selloff in mid and smallcap stocks. Do you think that sharp summer correction is behind us?
I strongly believe so. That was a very big selloff and some correction was definitely due because of the small and midcaps space had been overheated. There had been four-five years of rally in that space while the blue-chips underperformed in general. When the correction came, it was overdone.

I feel this is an ideal time to explore value among the small and midcap companies. When we say midcap companies, according to the new definition even companies at Rs 28,000-30,000 crore valuation are midcaps. There are wonderful companies and some of them are industry leaders with a relevant business model. Some people say do not buy those things, buy only the highest quality companies today at 100 PE, 80 and 70 PE. I do not agree with that. It is a cycle. Everything has its cycle and opportunity. Those who underperformed in last five years are performing over last six months, which does not necessarily mean that this is the strategy to adopt. Maybe this is the peak of the strategy if you are buying a Lever, a Nestle, a Britannia, a or Page or an Eicher -- very high quality companies with 70-80-100 PEs. A lot of people are doing that today. But that will be like buying the midcaps in November-December last year.


Looking at Nifty and Sensex, we can see that it is only a handful of stocks that have taken us to the top. But you believe that the market is going to get a little more broad-based and it is not going to be those select few 15-10 odd stocks which are going to move, and the rest of the index stocks would play catch-up. What makes you think so?
There is a herd mentality that works in the market. Smallcaps and midcaps are moving down now and the largecap blue-chips are moving up. So, everybody jumps into that band wagon and makes it a dirty place. This is what is happening today. There are very high quality companies which in the past 10 years have done exceeding well. Their best of times are going on and the best of earnings happening and the best of margin, the least competition and those are the companies that are quoting at 100 PE at today’s EPS. I do not understand that. Expecting these companies to grow at 20-25% for next 100 years is utter nonsense. It does not work. 



There is a disruptive world out there. Competition can come from nowhere. But all said and done, I am strongly bullish on Indian markets, Indian economy. I still believe in changing India and improving corporate governance. I still believe this is the best theme to continue to play for Indian markets. That does not mean just go and buy any chor (fraud) company. What I am saying is provided there is a very relevant business model and high business value in the company, then only we should bet on improving corporate governance if that was the reason for lack of wealth creation in the past. 

There are clear symptoms that India is changing, structural economy is changing. We had been talking about this change from unorganised economy to organised, from black to white. This has a long-term positive impact on a lot of companies. The former promoter of Bhushan Steel was arrested yesterday. All these things are very important. There would not be any incentive to remain unprofessional and it is happening in many companies. 

My own experience also says that there may be a few companies doing badly and that is what is being projected today in the social media but there are companies doing wonderfully as well. I have a smallcap bought one year ago. It is a five-bagger today and it is at an all-time high. This promoters were not considered to be very professional but today they are becoming professionals, they are showing profits, they are ready to pay tax. These changes provide one-time opportunity in India since independence.


At an index level we are talking at 11,500-12,000 for the Nifty. I know you track the midcaps more but their midcap and smallcap portfolios are not reflecting that euphoria. What would you say to viewers and investors who are feeling a bit confused in the market?
Nifty and Sensex definitely represent Indian equity markets today. I am not saying that investing in blue-chips is bad. But if you buy the top quality 10 companies in India at today’s PE and valuations, it may give you 5% to 10% CAGR for next five years or ten years because these companies are doing the best in terms of margins and lack of competition. With above normalised earnings, they are giving very high PE. Investors should think twice on earnings or return when they invest. Otherwise they are going to be disappointed in next five years’ time. 

There will be some companies still giving you 20% CAGR. If you make a portfolio of the top 15-20 companies, you are going to get 5% to 10% CAGR in next five years. Whereas if you look at opportunities in the mid and smallcaps, especially after the sharp correction, you are going to make maybe 30-35% CAGR for next five years. However, that does not mean you go and buy and fraud companies, dying companies, irrelevant businesses. You should look at medium quality companies with relevant business model and which are futuristic going forward among the mid and smallcaps. In these places, after selloff you are getting maybe 10 or 15 PE. Some of them maybe in single digit PE but there are not too many of these companies. 

The opportunities are not like 2013 or 2014. Maybe it has come down by 75% but India has only 1,000 investable quality companies. You have to choose 15-20 companies from them. That is called stock picking. I think this is a wonderful opportunity to ignore the so-called highest quality largecaps and come to the mid and smallcaps. Today companies with Rs 5000-6000 crores market cap are also considered to be smallcaps. For me, they are midcaps. 

I feel the opportunities are immense and the general market continues to be good. Any further move in the market will be broad based. Last week, there are signs of a greater participation happening and we will see broad-based market move in coming days.


Next Cycle is Starting for Investible Quality in Midcaps and Smallcaps


For long term investing, is banking still a good sector? Considering the turnaround which seems to be hinted at, should one look outside private banking names?
Yes, I still feel if somebody is interested in banking that makes a lot of sense. There are small microfinance companies quoting at high valuations, five times, ten times the book value because of the growth happening. And India has definitely lot more growth prospects in that sector, especially in the consumer finance in the retail finance so this is going to grow in a big way in India. We are so much under-banked or under-financed in that segment. 

I would still prefer something like and IDFC plus Capital First is going to merge, maybe a Federal Bank kind of bank. We have exposure in Federal Bank, of course, recently we have bought after the big selloff. Maybe a JM Finance kind of stock in the capital market related activity too. So there can be similar kind of midcaps and of course, the smallcaps which have got less NPAs, more visibility and good people managing.

I feel IDFC Bank plus Capital First can be a stock to watch if somebody is looking for next five years. There is more safety and more growth prospects in long term investing. Also, it is too early to write off some of the old generation private banks which are improving their efficiencies, have got a control over NPAs. The next three quarters are very important also. They will give you much more visibility. But once that visibility happens, the stock price could be doubled and maybe you have to take some chance before the full visibility comes if you buy it at a bargain price.


What is the future of speciality chemicals, especially dyes and dye intermediaries?
I do not follow this space much because it was too much fancied and valuations have gone through the roof. They had a great time in earnings. I do not have knowledge how this industry will look going forward in the next 1-3 years. The Indian companies in speciality chemicals segment were all in a sweet spot. We even made money in a company called Balaji Amines. We used to buy it at two-digit prices a few years ago. But we have exited it. 

Some of the companies have gone up five and ten times. Graphite Electrodes people have been after that. We have a habit of ignoring the current fancy or too much fancied segments and we always look for sober valuations in the mid and smallcaps. At the same time, in our PMS, we have also got ITC. It is not that we are always into smallcap companies. We have got high quality companies also like TTK Pharma or Hawkins as well.

I consider that is a very high quality company, we have a large exposure. I am not recommending these stocks, what I am trying to tell you is look at high quality, high PE stocks and also the value stocks with medium quality . This is the game now, which one you want.


Do you think you need to have a slightly greater weightage towards largecaps and megacaps because the four-year one sided bull market in those stocks is coming to an end. Earlier, 99% of the small and midcap stocks went higher and good investors like you were able to identify stocks which have done much better than the benchmark. Do you think it is time to get very selective?
I see it slightly differently. I feel the next cycle is starting for the investible quality in mid and smallcaps. It has started last week or maybe in the last two, three weeks. So another cycle is coming up in that and people will be not very happy with the kind of return that a Hindustan Lever or a Britannia or a Page and Eicher kind of stocks may give. They are wonderful companies, the best of companies. They have created great wealth and the promoters should be congratulated.

Remember Sun Pharma, Lupin in 2015. People were saying you the best companies are infallible, they can never disappoint you. At Rs 1200, Sun Pharma was the best company in the country and today after three years it is still below half the price. So, do not think everything is so evident in the companies. There can be problems in many sectors. Many of these high quality, high PE companies which created wealth in the last five, 10 years, are going to face competition going forward. 

Today the world is becoming smarter, entrepreneurs are becoming smarter, many of the family promoted and unprofessionally managed companies or traditionally managed companies are getting into a new growth orbit. They are understanding the benefit of growing the market cap, creating wealth through the market capitalisation. They are also going to be advised by the best of the talent in this country and they will create competition for the good players today. 

Certain companies were in a sweet spot and had very high margins and growth prospects in the last five, 10 years. That need not be repeated for the next five, 10 years. New people may come up. These companies that we are mentioning were all smallcaps years ago. Page Industries was only a Rs 500-crore market cap or Rs 300 crore in the beginning. People say do not buy smallcaps. What does it mean? That means you should not have bought Page Industries at Rs 500 crore?


You are of the view that there is serious money to be made in the small and the midcap space and one should not look at equities in a linear manner. Why don’t you clarify that viewpoint? Everybody thinks that equities are like fixed deposits, badhta hi rahega (will keep on growing)?
See, India has everything. Our economic structure is like that. Large global brands have an advantage. They will continue to be there. But that does not mean you buy a high quality company at any price. That is the simple thing I am telling you because if you stay overpriced, then there can be two, three sometimes five years of stagnation. This happened in Reliance. In last 10 years, Reliance did not create any wealth because people overpaid at that point of time and then they had to wait 10 years from where the stock went up by some 150%.

Even even I identified the stock and recommended below Rs 1,000. Now the stock is more than 100% up. So, this can happen to the best of companies in this country. We do not know. Do you have that kind of visibility for TCS for the next five, 10 years? I do not think, TCS management will be confidently telling you we can grow at this rate for the next 10 years. Things can change. So this is applicable also to the highest quality, most fancied companies today."
27,2018-08-10,Britannia,"A strong moat with huge opportunities can give you that adrenaline rush. 

Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry firmly believes so. He sees two crucial factors going for the company that's difficult to spot in any of its peers. 

In the pipeline are 50 new products this year to mark the company's 100 years of operations.

Returns are an eye opener. The scrip soared 54 per cent and 101 per cent during the last one year and three years, respectively, as against 17 per cent and 33 per cent of the benchmark Sensex during the same period.

Britannia even went up 775 per cent and 2,192 per cent over the last 5 years and 10 years, respectively. Which meant market capitalisation of the company moved to nearly Rs 76,000 crore, from Rs 3,200 crore, during August 2008-18.

Berry highlighted that the first moat for Britannia is the brand itself and his 30-year plus experience in the consumer industry. “What I have seen is that you can do a lot of stuff, but you cannot build brands in a hurry. So, that is our big moat and I think that is something that no one can match,” he said in an interaction with ETNow. 

He sees low-cost operation as the second moat for Britannia. “I do not think that there is any company which operates with the kind of costs that we operate,” Berry asserted.

The term moat is popularised by legendary investor Warren Buffett referring to businesses that maintained competitive advantages over its competitors. 

The market guru once said: ""A good business is like a strong castle with a deep moat around it. I want sharks in the moat. I want it untouchable."" 

Motial Oswal has ‘Buy’ call on Britannia with a target price of Rs 7,300. The brokerage house sees 28.40 per cent and 27.90 per cent rise in net profit and EBITDA of Britannia in FY19.

Emkay Global Financial Services in a report said, “We expect sales and earnings CAGR of 15 per cent and 20 per cent over FY18-21E. The stock is trading at 52x FY20E EPS after the 25 per cent run-up over the last 5 months. We believe that the current valuation offers limited upside and hence, we downgrade it to ‘Hold’ from ‘Accumulate’. We roll forward our target price to Rs 6,100 (previously Rs 5,850) valuing it at 45x September 20E EPS (in-line with Nestle and HUL).”

Top line as well as the bottom line of the company has already grown in double digits during the past 10 years. Net sales and net profit of the biscuit major grew 14 per cent and 19 per cent on a CAGR basis during FY08-18. 

According to market experts, with the GST rollout, the company will see some traction in the long term as organised players see market share gains. This space is seeing a shift from the value segment towards the premium one and Britannia is well poised to ride this wave. 

Also, the company is widening its reach in rural India. Their reach in rural pockets now stands at around 75 per cent of their urban reach.

For 2017-18, Britannia posted net sales of Rs 9,905.60 crore against Rs 2,776.30 crore in FY08. Net profit jumped to Rs 1,004.20 crore, from Rs 177.40 crore before.

Elara Capital in a report in July said, “Britannia has high distributor margins and investments are the lowest as they are aiming at 'zero inventory' days.” 

It added: “Britannia has high margin. Investment is the lowest and the volume is high. This makes good net profits from distributor’s perspective. Unilever and Nestle need more investments - RoI (return on investment) is lower. Marico is also low inventory -- just one day of inventory. The rest all are same across companies.” 

Britannia Industries, which earns 70 per cent of its revenue from the biscuits segment, would gradually increase the pie of non-biscuits category by foraying into new product space. In value terms, Britannia's market share in the biscuits category is 33 per cent.

Addressing shareholders during the company's 99th annual general meeting, Berry said Good Day is within striking distance of Parle G. 

""We are the number one biscuit maker and far ahead of Parle in market share. We expect Good Day to overtake Parle G in next 2-3 years,"" said Berry.

The company recently came out with a new logo and also proposed a stock split and issue of bonus debentures, subject to necessary approvals. It has plans to hunt for opportunities for acquisitions.

The FMCG major Britannia Industries has reported a 19.41 per cent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 258.08 crore for the June quarter, driven by double-digit volume growth.

Net profit stood at Rs 216.12 crore in April-June a year ago.

Global brokerages, including UBS and Goldman Sachs, have ‘Buy’ rating on Britannia shares with a target price of Rs 7,700 and Rs 7,235, respectively. UBS believes that Britannia is the key beneficiary of rural upswing, and diversification is on track. “Maintain buy on good revenue and earnings growth visibility compared with peers,” said UBS.

Goldman Sachs believes Britannia has re-invested gross margin benefit in ad spend to support volume growth. It maintained a bullish stance on the ability to drive premiumisation by launching affordable packs of premium products"
28,2018-08-10,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: As India’s equity benchmarks rule at lifetime peaks, with heartbeat index Sensex sprinting 1,000 points in 10 sessions, investor faces on Dalal Street wear more worry lines than euphoria.

You do not see the Nifty50 rule at a price-to-earnings multiple of 28 too often! In last 18 years, this has happened only twice before; on both occasions it ended up in quite a bit of bloodletting.

And then, there are some so-called growth stocks whose PE multiples have soared to anywhere between 80 and 100; expensive by any measure. Does it mean the ongoing rally in stocks is nearing a climax?

Dalal Street is divided. One school of thought says there is no harm stay put in high PE stocks as long as there is growth, while the other says it’s time to go beyond frontline companies to explore value in mid-quality stocks.

Prevailing market conditions are constantly reminding investors of the Nifty peak point in 2000, when a select few of technology, media and telecommunication (TMT) – the new economy trio – had led the show and lifted Nifty50 to a P/E level of 28 on a trailing basis.

This year too, only a handful of Nifty50 stocks have been pushing the index to new all-time highs every second day.

Most of India’s midcap and smallcap stocks are off their January highs by an average 16 per cent, reflecting lack of depth of the current rally. This has been unlike the 2007 rally, when the bull run was broad-based,

Some analysts say though Nifty P/E valuation looks expensive on a trailing basis, its price-to-book value – a ratio that maps price escalation relative to the value of total assets on balance sheets – still looks manageable at 3.7.

The Indian market, they say, is in a structural bull run, where earnings are showing signs of revival. Investors should remain mindful of growth prospects, they say.


High P/Es for how long?
But the average investor still has a dilemma: Will earnings keep justifying high PEs? 

Among BSE500 stocks, there are many NBFCs such as Equitas Holdings, Indiabulls Venture and Bajaj Finance, which are trading at price multiples of 60-160, data available with corporate database Ace Equity shows.

Shares of consumption-oriented companies such as Page Industries, Gillette, P&G, Britannia Industries, Jubilant FoodWorks, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur India, Nestle India, Marico and Emami are ruling at PEs ranging from 60 to 100. Select paints and discretionary stocks are hovering at even higher valuations.

Smallcap investor Porinju Veliyath, Founder & CEO at Equity Intelligence India, says one needs to find a balance between quality and value.

Look out for medium quality companies in the midcap and smallcap segment, he says.

The top 10-15 high quality largecaps, whose profit margins are at peak levels, and other operational parameters are at their best, may end up reporting compounded annual growth rates of around 5-10 per cent over next five years, while medium-quality midcaps and smallcaps may see 30-35 per cent earnings growth.


Price of a Mercedes for a Maruti?There are over 5,000 listed companies in India, but Porinju finds only 1,000 of them ‘investible’. “You need to select 15-20 of them, which is what is called value picking,” he said.

“I do not know whether you would pay the price of a Mercedes Benz for a Maruti. They are not going to get the values for your money at these prices,” says Deepak Shenoy, Founder at Gurgaon-based investing firm Capital Mind.

“The most expensive stock I am buying is probably Maruti. There are reasons to buy these stocks. But stocks like the FMCG biggies Britannia or Nestle are at 70-80 times. While you know, these are good quality companies, if you pay a high P/E, you also expect high growth in earnings. If that is not happening, I would not buy it,” Shenoy told ETNow. He says he continues to retain a reasonable cash position.

On Thursday, Veliyath in a tweet questioned the logic of investing in businesses which are at their peak operational efficiencies and environment, quoting P/E ratios near the 100 mark and have been giving guidance for 20 per cent CAGR growth for next 20 years. “Don’t you think it’s time to be cautious?” he asked.

In another tweet, Veliyath noted that even in April 2015 investors were being advised to buy highest quality largecaps such as Sun Pharma at Rs 1,200 and Lupin at Rs 2,100 as they were considered ‘very safe’.

“I see similar stories today in certain fancied sectors at 70-80 P/E multiples,” he said.

Sun Pharma shares are down 33 per cent in last three years and Lupin 52 per cent.


Consumption story unfolding
Not all analysts are this cautious on consumer stocks. Some believe the outlook is improving for the consumer-focused franchises. At the most, there could be a time correction, they say.

Some consumption-focused franchises are indeed trading at forbidding valuations. Some of these stocks will possibly see some time correction, says Ajay Bodke of Prabhudas Lilladher.

June quarter numbers of consumer-focussed franchises suggest strong growth dynamics. This is true not only for FMCG companies, but also some others. Quick service restaurants are seeing very strong same-store sales growth; auto and auto ancillary franchises are seeing solid sales volumes and even retail-focused private banks and NBFCs showing great traction, Bodke pointed out during an interview with ETNow

FMCG companies are posting very strong double-digit volume growth, where rural growth has been a few percentage points higher than urban growth. This is the second quarter on a trot when they have managed to sustain these double-digit volume growth numbers.

What is heartening is that the pricing power has come back to accompany this double-digit volume growth, leading to strong sustained growth in Ebitda levels, says Bodke. 


Growth hold key
Bodke says as long as the underlying earnings growth remains between, say, 25 per cent and 35 per cent, with strong working capital management – one can remain positive on these franchises.

Many of these companies have been operating on negative working capital.

If monsoon outcome is near normal, the growth impulses on the consumption side will strengthen post harvest around Dussehra and Diwali in the second half of the year. “We are pencilling in stronger growth for these consumer-focused franchises. Our allocation remains heavily focused on these franchises – FMCG, retail companies, auto and auto ancillaries and retail-focused consumer franchises,” Bodke said."
30,2018-08-11,Britannia,"Pharmaceutical major Lupin could see selling to the tune of ₹210 crore by exchange traded funds if it is excluded from the benchmark Nifty in the upcoming index review, said institutional brokerage ICICI Securities.

 JSW Steel, which is the most likely candidate to replace Lupin in the index could witness buying worth ₹360 crore by ETFs upon inclusion in the Nifty, said the brokerage.

 An index fund is a mutual fund which tries to mirror a market index as closely as possible by investing in all the stocks that comprise that index in proportions which is equal to the weightage of those stocks in the index. Any inclusion or exclusion, therefore, is likely to have a corresponding impact on the stock.

“Active funds wanting to align their holdings with benchmark indices could further add to the buy/sell momentum,” said ICICI Securities.

Lupin’s exit could also have an impact on the sector’s weightage in the index. The pharmaceutical sector, which has been losing weight in the Nifty due to decline in free float market capitalisation as a result of underperformance, could see its weightage dip to levels last seen post the Lehman crisis after Lupin’s exclusion, said ICICI Securities.

“Lupin’s exit comes after the exit of Aurobindo Pharma in the previous reconstitution in April 2018 and will result in pharma sector weight dipping to 2.7% in the NIFTY50. The drop of 430 bps (basis points) weight of pharma in the index since its March 2015 high of 7% is the highest across sectors in that period,” said ICICI Securities.

The analysis by the brokerage on float market capitalisations and weight calculations are based on free float market capitalisations at the end of July while the actual weightages in the reconstituted Nifty index would be based on August-end free float market capitalisations.

The index reshuffle will come into effect from September 28 and the announcement could come between now and September 1.

The index could also become marginally cheaper, to 20.53 times on a forward price-to-earnings basis from 20.69 times, as the likely new entrant in the index has a much lower price-toearnings ratio compared to the stock which is likely to exit, said ICICI Securities.

The situation would have been different if Britannia Industries were to be included in the index as the stock has a higher P/E and higher return on equity which would have increased the multiple of the index rather than decrease it.

However, the brokerage said that Britannia’s average free float market capitalisation in the six months to July is lower than JSW Steel’s, which is why the biscuit maker is likely to miss out on entry into the Nifty, said the brokerage."

34,2018-08-17,Britannia,"BENGALURU: When Swiggy roped in Amazon India executive Dale Vaz as its head of engineering last month, his total compensation, including stock options, ran into millions of dollars, according to one person aware of the matter.

The appointment reflects the upswing in the domestic startup ecosystem, where, according to headhunters, senior-level hiring has spiked after a gap following the funding winter of 2016. The Flipkart-Walmart deal that delivered a bonanza for many employees of the Indian ecommerce giant has also revived faith in employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs.

The last nine months have seen over 120 CXO-level hirings at 180 companies that received fresh funding, especially financial technology and food technology startups, show data from specialist staffing firm Xpheno. Chief financial officers lead the list of top-level appointments, followed by chief strategy officers and chief marketing officers.

“Even from small startups, mandates for senior executives have increased to 3-4 as compared with almost none last year,” said Shailesh Singh, recruitment expert. “While fixed salaries have more or less remained the same since last year, startups are able to offer more stock options after the Flipkart deal.”

India’s largest internet companies including Flipkart, Swiggy and Zomato have led the senior-level appointments, with the pay packages, including Esops, for high-level hires at some of these companies running into millions of dollars.

According to a headhunter, several senior executives hired by top internet companies have seen their overall compensations increase to almost a million dollars, including stocks.

Girish Menon, head of human resources at Swiggy, said the food-delivery company has been hiring at senior levels the past two years as it scaled up its business. The company hired former Britannia Industries executive Rahul Bothra as its first CFO in September last year and ex-P&G executive Vivek Sunder as its first chief operating officer in July.

Swiggy has boosted its leadership team with over 10 vice presidents and over 100 senior middle management employees, Menon said. The company has also roped in heads of new divisions through acqui-hires, such as 48East cofounder Joseph Cherian as the chief operating officer of its new supply vertical. “We are also looking to hire 8-10 more people at the VP-level and above in the coming months as we scale,” Menon said. He did not comment on Vaz’s compensation.

Flipkart recently hired five vice presidents. Zomato hired former General Electric executive Sameer Maheshwary as its CFO in May and ex-MakeMyTrip executive Mohit Gupta as the CEO of its food delivery business in July.

“Every time there is a Series-A funding, invariably CFO hiring is the first step as venture capital investors want their money to be utilised well and believe that CFOs are the guardians of governance,” said Kamal Karanth, cofounder of Xpheno.

Fintech startup Rubique, which recently raised about $20 million from Japan’s Recruit Group and Russian venture capital management company Emery Capital, hired its first CFO, Manish Ahuja, in June. It has hired six other senior-level executives in the last three months.

“To take the company to the next level, it is important to have domain experts to grow the business,” said Rubique CEO Manav Jeet.

Swiggy’s Menon said hiring of senior leadership makes the “company think-tank richer and offers mentors to young leaders… These experienced executives can also preempt solutions for challenges of scale.”

Other recent senior hires include Paytm Mall roping in Sanjeev Misra from Adani Group as senior vice president for international markets, and Curefit recruiting former Myntra executives Shamik Sharma and Naresh Krishnaswamy to head its technology and marketing functions, respectively. Quikr recently appointed Rahul Tewari, formerly with ICICI Securities, as its first CFO, and Foodpanda roped in Gautam Balijepalli as head of strategy.

“After a good 3-4 quarters, ‘C’-level hiring has picked up as the funding situation and size have increased, the sentiment is positive, and the appetite to hire seasoned executives has increased,” said Ashish Sanganeria of LongHouse Consulting.

More such hires are expected across startups in the coming months. “The pipeline suggests that the next two quarters will see more such hires as the number of funded firms continues to increase,” Xpheno’s Karanth said."

Sensex eventually settled at a record high of 38,285 and Nifty at 11,570, although by slight margins of 0.02 per cent and 0.17 per cent, respectively. The broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices outperformed the Sensex. 


Here’s a look at key developments of Tuesday’s session:

Look who moved my Sensex
RIL emerged frontrunner among the stocks that drove Sensex to a record high. The stock hit a fresh high of Rs 1,251 before settling 0.94 per cent higher at Rs 1,246. The stock has been rising ever since reports that the company was in talks with China’s Alibaba Group to form a retail joint venture. 


Headwinds for Jet Airways
Shares of the beleaguered airline fell 3 per cent after reports that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs had opened an inquiry into allegation of fund siphoning. Media reports said the Mumbai Registrar of Companies (RoC) will inspect Jet’s books of accounts. In a regulatory filing, the company said it “has not received any communication from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in this regard.” 


SpiceJet, IndiGo fall
Official data on Tuesday showed 21 per cent growth in air passenger traffic in July. IndiGo’s market share was highest at 42.1 per cent, which was ahead of SpiceJet’s 12.3 per cent. Strong July passenger data boosted the share of SpiceJet and InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) in early trade on Tuesday, but the gains proved to be shortlived. SpiceJet ended the day 2.89 per cent lower, whereas InterGlobe fell 1.18 per cent.


Reliance Jio subscriber base up 
A Trai report on Monday revealed that Reliance Jio increased its subscriber base most in June, adding over 97 lakh new connections. It was followed by Idea Cellular, which added over 63 lakh new connections. Shares of Idea Cellular fell 1 per cent while Bharti Airtel slipped 0.72 per cent on Tuesday.

40,2018-08-21,Britannia,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Breakfast cereal maker Kellogg and UK healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser Plc are the latest entrants in the race to acquire the consumer nutrition business of GlaxoSmithKline, joining Nestle, Unilever, Mondelez and Coca-Cola in the near $4.5-billion takeover pursuit, said several people with knowledge of the matter.

While Kellogg’s entry is regarded as a surprise, being ultra-conservative in India even after a presence of more than two decades, Reckitt Benckiser has been growing inorganically across the world under CEO Rakesh Kapoor. Its last big acquisition in India was Paras Pharmaceuticals eight years ago. Last year, Kapoor steered the $18-billion acquisition of US infant formula business Mead Johnson, its largest purchase.

Both companies have completed initial evaluations. Kellogg is being advised by Rothschild, and Reckitt, maker of Dettol soap and Air Wick air freshener, has roped in Goldman Sachs, said the people cited above.

Reckitt and Kellogg declined to comment. For British healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser, seen as a strong contender for GSK Consumer, inorganic growth has been a strategy that has mostly worked well. The Mead Johnson baby milk business helped it halt a string of disappointing results. Last month it posted higher-than-expected earnings that saw sales grow 4% on the back of its health and hygiene business. UBS analyst Pinar Ergun feels the July quarter marked the end of a long downgrade cycle.

“The Mead Johnson acquisition has taken RB into a global market leadership in consumer health and foods,” Reckitt has said. “Mead Johnson’s geographic footprint significantly strengthens our position in developing markets, which account for approximately 40% of the combined group’s sales.”




If the Horlicks deal does materialise, Reckitt Benckiser is likely to push it into chemist channels and pharmacies instead of traditional grocery, and reformulate the brand beyond just a milk-based beverage, said an executive aware of the development. Also, there are product synergies between Reckitt Benckiser and GSK’s over-the-counter (OTC) products such as Crocin, Sensodyne and Eno.

BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS

With its India sales at Rs 800 crore after 24 years in the country, Kellogg’s $14-billion parent has been pushing inorganic growth, especially in emerging markets to take its portfolio beyond breakfast to overall snacks. The potential acquisition of Horlicks will be a global move driven by its Michigan-based parent, people aware of the development said.

“Kellogg India doesn’t have the resources to push such a mega deal,” said a top industry executive, closely associated with the company.

“Besides, historically, it hasn’t been aggressive in India, and neither has it explored acquisitions, instead, basing its strategy only on localisation, pushing small packs and moving beyond breakfast to cereal-based snacking, which is witnessing intensified competition.”

Kellogg India contributes 10% to Asia-Pacific revenue and leads the Indian breakfast space with an estimated share of over 60%, but deep-pocketed rivals are looking to challenging that. Last month, Nestle announced its foray into the Rs 980-crore breakfast cereal category with Nesplus. Others such as PepsiCo, ITC Foods, Britannia and MTR have been pushing ready-to-cook products in the space. Kellogg India’s new managing director Mohit Anand, formerly of Unilever, has the mandate to push growth aggressively.

The maker of cornflakes, Honey Loops, Special K, Chocos, oats and muesli, has been pushing localisation and on-the-go consumption, penetrating small towns and markets with smaller packs of cereal at fast-moving price points of Rs 10 and Rs 5. It’s also been looking to broadbase distribution outreach to channels besides grocery stores. The Horlicks deal, if it goes through, will be its first acquisition in India.

With consumer trends moving away from breakfast cereal in mature markets that are perceived to be sugary and having artificial ingredients, the cereal maker has been diversifying into healthier foods inorganically.

Globally, Kellogg has been shopping for strategic brands and businesses. Its inorganic M&As include a stake acquisition in packaged food maker Tolaram Africa Foods (TAF) in May this year.

TAF is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of noodle products in Ghana and Nigeria. In 2016, it acquired Brazilian Parati Group which makes biscuits, and powdered beverage and pasta brands. It acquired Egyptian biscuit company Bisco Misr in 2015. Before that, it bought Pringles salty snacks in 2012. None of the brands has been brought to India.

While the health food drinks category has been growing only in single digits, GSK Consumer’s Horlicks and Boost are strong brands that can be leveraged into other categories in the health space. Kellogg could use it to enter biscuits, nutribars and crackers, for instance.

“A buy into Horlicks will not only give it instant shelf space in the healthbeverage category, but also help it expand into other categories such as biscuits, a space where it has had an initial failed attempt,” said a senior executive formerly associated with Kellogg. It made a shortlived foray into biscuits in India in the 1990s.

The Horlicks and Boost brands command approximately 70% of overall value share in Indian malted food drinks (MFD) market.

They had a combined revenue of £550 million in 2017, with India contributing most of it. In March, the company decided to review and potentially sell the nutrition products business to fund the $13 billion buyout of Novartis’ stake in a consumer healthcare joint venture.

The review will also include an assessment of the parent’s 72.5% stake in GSK Consumer in India. The current market cap of the company is Rs 28,522.91crore.

The outcome of the review is likely by end-2018. Morgan Stanley and Greenhill are advising GSK."

Where are We? Records kept tumbling as the benchmark indices hit a new high. For the first time, the Nifty crossed the milestone level of 11,600. However, global tradewar concerns might haunt the bulls. Buoyed by strength in IT and pharma stocks, frontline indices traded constructively above their 50-day lines and clocked a weekly gain of 0.8 per cent each.


What is in Store? With trade-war concerns resurfacing, the Indian market could face some short-term trend reversal. Also, due to F&O expiry in the coming week, chances of volatility cannot be ruled out. With the weakening of the rupee, IT and pharma stocks would perform better. On the upside, the Nifty’s previous high of 10,620 will be its resistance. An intermediate pullback from current levels to the 21-day line could be healthy for the market to maintain a longer-term uptrend. Both indices are trading 1-1.6 per cent above their 21-DMA. The distribution count, which keeps a track on high-volume selling, remains low at two on the Nifty and three on the Sensex. A distribution day count in excess of four generally indicates selling pressure building in the market.


What Could Investors Do? While the leading indices continue to trade in a new high ground, the Midcap and Smallcap indices still possess a high overhead supply. With the market hitting a new high, the overall environment is conducive to new purchases. However, investors should have a proper game plan. Some of the fundamentally solid names that continue to trade constructively are Britannia Industries and Page Industries."

The Nifty50 index failed to surpass previous day’s high and witnessed selling pressure towards 11,678 on Wednesday. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale followed by a Doji or a Spinning Top candle, which indicates that the bears are putting pressure at higher levels ahead of its monthly derivatives settlement. 

The index has been respecting to its support trend line but at the same time it is finding hurdle at the upper band of the rising channel. Now it has to continue to hold above 11,666 to extend its move towards 11,777 -11,800 zone, while medium term support is seen at 11,620 level.

On the options front, maximum Put OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,200, while maximum Call OI shifted higher to 11,800 then 11,700. There was significant Call writing at 11,750 followed by 11,700, while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strikes.

India VIX moved up by 0.12% at 12.44, however overall lower volatility suggested the bulls are likely to hold the grip on the market.

Bank Nifty opened flat and remained rangebound for most part of the session. It formed an Inside Bar and a Doji candle on the daily scale, which suggests a tug of war to surpass a major hurdle of 28,333 zone. Now a decisive move above 28,333 could see a fresh rally towards 28,500 and then 28,700 while support is seen at 28,128 and then 28,000 levels.

59,2018-08-31,Britannia,"The rupee weakness has helped the export oriented business, Yogesh Mehta,VP-Equity Advisory, MOSL, tells ET Now. Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma and Lupin are three stocks Mehta is betting on.Edited excerpts:


Rupee is depreciating. Does that mean any pharma company is a good buy should one look in details. Why have you shortlisted Aurobindo Pharma and Sun Pharma? Is it because their exposure to US market is high or do you think that the earning visibility is quite clear there compared to other pharma names?
 Apart from the domestic pharma, one should look at pharma exports. All are there, Lupin and Aurobindo are fairly good and Divi’s Lab is good in the R&D segment. The rupee weakness has helped the export oriented business. We are recommending Aurobindo and Sun Pharma and giving a target upside. These are the only two stocks which have got left on the upside with the fair valuation FY20 basis. Rest all are almost near the FY20 projected price targets.

Other than Sun Pharma and Aurobindo Pharma, even Lupin is there but it is quoting at a fairly decent valuation. The hangover of the US FDA import ban on the respective plants of all these companies is now getting over, That will give some more insight and foresight for these businesses and we believe that the upside could be here some more upside and there is headroom to earn money.


IT stocks, pharma stocks and private banking is something which you have mentioned as top bets. What is happening in infrastructure? L&T after buyback has seen a good move. Our technical experts are very bullish even from short term perspective. Any name from infrastructure space apart from L&T? Any midcap name which Motilal Oswal feels is a good buy even from current levels?
Apart from L&T, we have Sadbhav Engineering and KNR Construction in the midcap space. Again they will be heavily dependent on the new order flows. Right now the order book is very much full but as the execution capability is very much better than any other companies in the listed space, we have projected that these are the two companies where one should look at on any decline.

So far, the prices have very much declined even on names like Ashok Buildcon. This is the third company and these are the three companies where we are looking to buy at every decline. 


With Yes Bank clarification coming in on Rana Kapoor’s position at the helm, what is the pecking order among the private banks? What HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank and IndusInd Bank have delivered in terms of returns versus ICICI Bank and Axis Bank and is there a yawning gap there?
On the return side, there could be a variation on a monthly basis on the price performance of respective companies’ share prices. In the private sector, the correction has happened right now and the price to book valuation is still on a little bit of on a higher side. Correction in these names is decent enough. Yes Bank has different reason which is external one but valuation front, if it corrects further by 3-5% odd, that would be again attractive, because historically on the price to book multiple, HDFC Bank has never traded below 3 or 3.5% in the forward earnings basis.

Kotak Bank or IndusInd Bank are all names which can be included in the portfolio on correction. Last month’s underperformance may give some kind of a saturation or consolidation this month and probably can start as and when we have the second quarterly number season which will start from October.


What is the mood in the market? Are people putting in more money or are they thinking of taking out some chips as markets are trading at much higher levels than they ever thought?
We have interacted with many a customer day in day out but there is no fear redemption or pulling out money from the individual equity, direct equity portfolio. There is much comfort level because our portfolios are dominated towards the largecap companies and the mid and smallcap companies. We are avoiding smallcap companies because of the high beta reason. 

Of course, when the tide is in favour, then it may give you multiple returns but the defensive and the performing sectors are very much there. They are making money and our customer base are not so worried about the market sentiment so far neither they are going by or getting frenzied by the 11700-11800 levels. It is purely on value terms and they have confidence in growth-oriented companies. So far, as you see it is dominated by 8-10 stocks but IT, pharma are performing now. In between, there was the private sector bank rally. All these rallies are providing a good comfort level that can give you outperformance or if not outperformance, at least inline returns with the market returns.


Some of the stocks are trading at 40 to 50 multiples and are still finding a lot of takers. ITC has been a stock which has been in the FMCG space but cigarette growth rate is not as high as the consumer product growth rate. That is the reason its valuation has been less. Are you seeing any product mix change happening in ITC?
ITC is of course at 50% discount in terms of relative valuation to other companies. But they are improving and two years back, they broke even as FMCG company. Cigarette volumes are growing by 2 to 6 percentage variation every month and that is driving profitability right now. But as and when the management commentary guided that they are transiting from cigarette to non-cigarette business and an improved product mix with capex is on cards for every year. With high ROCE, the valuation gap cannot remain 50% in case of Britannia to ITC or Hindustan Unilever to ITC. That is driving some kind of rationalisation and may command a little more premium than what it is quoting right now, with Rs 10-12 EPS for FY20, 

It is still available at less than 30-31 times. It is an attractive one where others are quoting at around varying from 45 to 65 PE multiple band. The price improvement in the rationalisation and the calibration PE multiple scope is much more there on the expansion mode."

The new product range — Sunfeast Wonderz — will be launched first in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh before being rolled out nationally. Unlike existing products made with artificial flavours, ITC will use real fruit pulp for the milkshakes, the company said.

“This innovative range of milk-based beverages will be powered by the company’s institutional capabilities including agri-sourcing, distribution, infrastructure, among others,” said Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive – Foods, at ITC. “The ready to drink milk beverages market has seen high growth in the recent past with a paradigm shift to healthier beverages and we believe innovative offerings in this segment could have great potential for the future.”

The range will be manufactured in ITC’s new facility in Kapurthala, Punjab, where the company has invested in an aseptic pet facility.

Globally, shifting consumer tastes are prompting beverages giants, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Co, to diversify away from traditional soda and highcalorie juices. Growth has consistently slowed down in the `22,000-crore carbonated soft drinks market as consumers increasingly switch to healthier beverages such as juices, energy drinks, flavoured tea, fortified water and dairy-based beverages. Several companies are experimenting and bringing in flavour innovation; products including oats and fruits are combined with drinking milk products to cater to the needs of health-conscious consumers.

A research from global market intelligence agency Mintel said flavoured milk products accounted for 39% of dairy drink introductions in India in the first half of 2017, up from just 20% in 2012. Over one in four (28%) consumers of pre-packaged, ready-todrink dairy drinks consume it for breakfast, said the researcher."

4,2018-09-05,Britannia,"Though there are more risks in the short-term, Pratik Gupta, MD, Deutsche Bank India, says one should stay away from telecom, PSU banks and US generic 
  
  
  pharma players for next 3-5 years.Edited excerpts: 


India is outperforming at a time when there is gloom and doom in the world. Is this outperformance here to stay and if not, do you think Indian markets will correct and by how much?
India’s outperformance is likely to sustain given the weak outlook from some of the other emerging markets, especially China. In the short term, the noise around the trade wars will worsen. Deutsche’s China team has just put out a note saying that they expect the Trump tariffs to come through later this month and in that scenario, the Renminbi will weaken all the way to 7.5 next year. So, there will be more pressure on the emerging market currencies, the trade war noise will worsen and the EM outflows will continue. 

India will outperform in relative terms although on absolute terms, the market could still come off. If you turn that around, three-four months down the road, some of this trade war noises will cool off. India in absolute terms may do well, but in relative terms, we may underperform the other markets such as China or Taiwan or Korea, which have come off a lot more versus India this year. 

Those markets have come off and the valuations are cheaper over there. They could also bounce back a lot more strongly. A lot depends on how the trade wars pan out over the next few months. We think the market will continue to outperform in the EM selloff environment, partly driven by relatively strong earnings growth outlook and also given the fact that domestic flows are helping the local equity markets.


In the last couple of trading sessions, the crowded groups are witnessing profit booking. Names like HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank, HUL and Britannia have started correcting. Bajaj Finance has taken it on the chin. Are you getting a sense from some of your global investors that they are a bit weary of investing in some of the safe havens? Is it time to bet on rotation, on the other end of the spectrum which is metals, corporate banks and cyclicals?
I would say it is a mixed view. I do not think that is the overall view. From our perspective, we are recommending clients to take profits in consumer staples. We were overweight on consumer staples at the start of the year, but of late, we have turned negative or underweight. We are recommending an underweight stance, given the expensive valuations despite somewhat better growth prospects. 

On the retail oriented banks, the outlook is still good. Our view is that the liquidity environment in India will worsen in the next six to nine months. This time, the government borrowing programme is heavy in the second half. Credit growth is picking up, the rupee is under pressure and if the RBI intervenes further, it will suck out even more rupee liquidity. In such an environment, you do want to be with high CASA banks. 

But you are right, within the banks in particular, there is some amount of rotation underway. I would not say everybody is convinced globally. A lot of them are still sticking with the tried and tested retail banks which have performed well in the past and are not yet willing to jump the gun. They want to see a couple of more quarters of results from the corporate lenders to make sure that the provisioning pain is really behind them and there are no further negative surprises. So, there is some rotation happening there. 

In staples in general, we are seeing very little fresh buying. We recommend folks to take profits over there.


There is a lot of chatter around the Sebi circular on FPI KYC disclosures. It was being said that it would lead to $75 billion worth of outflows. This contention was rubbished by Sebi in a statement yesterday. Is that spooking the market because what kind of outflows you are going to see is not clear and I do not think anyone can calculate that.
That is a good point. Personally, I do not think the Sebi circular in itself caused that kind of selling. India was impacted by what is going on with the overall EM environment. But as far as the circular is concerned, this is not so much a Sebi-specific issue. It is related to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 

One of my colleagues at Deutsche is part of the Khan Committee. We should wait till we see regulatory response to this sort of the outcry over this circular. There is still three, four months left. I do not think we will see any changes in the circular. You could see some dilutions to begin with. So, that is point number one. Second point is I do not think you will see that much of an outflow. Most of these foreign clients say that in the worst-case scenario, they will have to restructure their FPI vehicles and appoint someone else. There will be some sort of restructuring done and they will find a way around. 
But it does increase the hassles for them and that is why you are seeing all these folks protesting in quite a big way. But in the end, we will get to that stage eventually. Let us give it some more time.


As an investor, what do you do in the market? Brokerages seem to be voicing same concerns. This morning too some of the notes are already calling FMCG stocks – Britannia, Unilever extremely expensive. They are already cutting their price targets and their ratings on some of these names. Do you go out and buy this decline or do you just profit take from here? Private banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, FMCG as a cluster and other consumption names have made some stupendous returns in the past one year.
Our view is that in this environment, given that globally interest rates are going up – be it by the US Fed or ECB which will start hiking rates further and BOJ will follow. In India, we expect at least another rate hike if not two. The liquidity environment is tightening. In general, our preference is; a) Stick with the largecaps versus the small and midcaps. b), You are right that where valuations are very expensive, it is very difficult to expect a further re-rating. If anything, we should be prepared for a de-rating for the next 12 to 18 months. 

The focus should really be on earnings growth. Companies with strong earnings growth prospects. Even if the PE multiple comes off a little bit, you could still see positive returns from stock investments. So, focus on companies where you see strong earnings growth. We are looking at IT services. The rupee is a strong tailwind. The US economy is doing really well especially the BFSI focussed IT outsourcing companies. Second, high CASA, high growth banks which are mainly the retail banks should do quite well. The third sector that we like is the industrial sector. In India, for seven-eight years, we have not really seen strong industrial growth. 

We are beginning to see green shoots of an industrial revival in India. When that happens, some of these capital goods companies from a longer term horizon, will do very well over the next couple of years and earnings surprises could come through starting in FY20 onwards. The market will start discounting that a little bit in advance. We actually like the industrial goods companies. Also some of the cement manufacturers, again those who have relatively better balance sheets in particular, and that is how we are looking at this space. 

We are underweight on some of the more expensive FMCG companies or even pharma. We think valuations over there have not come off enough. The US FDA problems persist. There might be a temporary tailwind because of the rupee, but structurally we are a bit cautious on the US generic space. Over there, we prefer some of the Indian pharma companies or the India focussed pharma companies instead.


If interest rates are likely to go higher, macro is a concern. Earnings recovery may be solid but a lot of good news is in the price and in the context of the political event which is going to be market moving in nature, why should one not go for 15-20% cash in the portfolio given the valuations levels we are at. Even if we get an earnings recovery, this market will not run up in a hurry. The downside could be large and open if anything backfires.
You are right that the risks are right now more in the short-term or if you take a 3-6 month investment time horizon. You should be raising cash and from these levels it is tough to make too much upside. In fact, the Sensex target is already breached. It was 37,000. We are at 38,000 odd something. If your investment time horizon is just about the next three to six months, then you should be raising cash right now. But again, it depends on whether you have a slightly longer term investment horizon of three to five years. We think equities could still outperform fixed income and the main driver is really the earnings growth expectation.

In India, in the last four-five years, the index earnings have hardly grown in single digits. For the first time, after man, many years, we are seeing an earnings growth revival. In the June quarter for example, if you strip out the financials, the Nifty index earnings were up 28% YoY in the June quarter. 

That rate will moderate given the high base effect but nonetheless you will still see relatively strong earnings growth in rest of FY19. Our discussions with corporates on the ground suggest that overall corporate commentary is getting better. The corporates are feeling a lot more positive. The demand environment is improving. The economy is picking up. Earnings surprises or strong earnings growth can be expected in the next couple of years. 

Even if you see a little bit of PE derating from a one-two years perspective, you could still make money as the earnings continue to deliver. But yes, if you have a three-month odd investment horizon, then you should be raising cash.


What will you not buy for next three to five years?
In general, I would stay away from companies which have weak balance sheets where there are corporate governance issues. There are structural issues in some sectors. I would be very careful in telecom. Unless these stocks come off a lot more, we would stay away from telecom. In PSU banks, a lot more needs to be done. So, stay away from PSU banks by and large. One or two the larger PSU banks might still be alright though. 

In pharma, we need to see valuations come off a lot more before we get excited about it. We would stay away from the US generic pharma players. There are obviously pockets of opportunities here and there but it is better to stay away from there."
5,2018-09-06,Britannia,"Next 10 months, do not chase the price. It will not be the time for momentum investment, Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC, tells ET Now. Shah says in short-term you 
  can hide in IT, pharma, blue chip, largecap , defensive companies.Edited excerpts:


What is your view on markets considering all emerging market currencies and economies are going through a patch of adjustment? Will this emerging market slide have impact on portfolio investments in India?
Clearly it is a tricky situation, where one part of India is witnessing dramatic correction. Rupee is down more than 4% in August alone. 10-year interest rate is up about 33 bps in August. On the other hand, equity market in index term is near all-time high. Clearly, from an FII point of view, they will be in two minds – one, should they look at the improving micro situations in India as is evident from the quarterly results or should they worry about deteriorating macro situation where oil prices are higher, rupee has weakened, interest rates have risen and which ultimately could have impact on growth. 

It is a tricky situation where FIIs hopefully will take a call on a longer term basis looking at the fundamentals of companies in which they are investing rather than taking a top-down view.


A lot is happening with Sebi in terms of the FPI money from NRIs. What do you think is the impact of this and is this a big issue? All kinds of numbers are floating around -- $75 billion, $80 billion.
Undoubtedly if the FIIs believe that their investments in India is not welcomed, they will take a different view. But the good part is that The Securities & Exchange board of India (Sebi) has clearly communicated that they are keeping concerns raised by the FIIs in mind. Anyway, the deadline is 31st December and there is no pressing hurry to do it tomorrow. This is an issue which can easily be resolved through consultation because on one side, FIIs have clearly said that they have no problem with the disclosure and on the other side, Sebi has mentioned that they are not in favour of restricting someone’s ability to do a business. They just want to ensure that there is no round tripping. The he objective is the same. How one arrives at a way to achieve that objective should be easily approachable.


Do you think India will be isolated or be a different market as earnings growth is showing the first signs of decent improvement. Do you think we are not that decoupled at all?
My hope is we would be in a better position compared to 2013 to withstand a global shock. In 2013, taper tantrums created a shock but at that point of time, macro India was fragile, inflation was in double digits, the current account deficit was upwards of 4.5% and fiscal deficit was almost higher than current account deficit. 

Clearly that was the time when India was also going into elections after a year. Put all these things together, we were in a far weaker situation at that time. Today inflation is rising but it is rising from lower single digit to mid single digit; fiscal deficit is likely to overshoot the budgeted number but it is on a much-much lower base; current account deficit is rising with higher oil prices but it is still way below what it was in 2013. 

So, we have a slightly deteriorating micro situation vis-à-vis current account deficit, fiscal deficit and inflation but it is significantly superior to what it was in 2013. More importantly, between 2013 and 2108, we have taken certain steps which will create a good platform for economic growth in the future. GST has been introduced and rolled out. It has made India one nation, one market. The demonetisation benefits are now visible with higher digital payments and better tax compliance. The government has also built infrastructures in terms of road, railways, solar capacity and so on. Put together, today we are far better than in mid 2013. Second, corporate India is looking at the future far more positively than they were in 2013. Therefore, despite higher oil prices, higher real interest rates and a weakening rupee, we have a reason to be optimistic about corporate earnings growth in the rest of the financial year.


For earnings to recover in a big way, the capex cycle needs to pick up. Do you think this is around the corner or is it going to be another long wait?
There is a slight differentiation. If you look at the IIP series and the GDP growth, capex seems to be recovering. But when we talk with the management in listed segment, we are not seeing significant recovery in capex. Clearly, capex is coming in the non-listed segment, in real estate. Looking at industrial recovery means we are seeing investments in sectors like power where there is surplus capacity. So, it is a little further away. But will there be investment pickup led by the government spending in infrastructure like roads and railways or a pick up in real estate sector by virtue of rural demand? The answer is yes. We will see one part of investments related to government and rural India doing well but the industrial capex is a little further down the line.


What is the view on midcaps and smallcaps? How do you look at the valuations there now that largecap valuations are seeming a bit stretched and the overall price points at which midcaps and smallcaps are available?
My feeling is that after the corrections from Jan 2018 level, midcaps have become worth looking at it. But clearly, over next 10 months, we expect markets to be highly volatile. It will be volatility partly because of global factors: a) interest rates in US are rising. B), Liquidity injection across US, Europe and Japan is slowing down. C) A tariff war is raging between US and China and India could have see collateral damage. Most important for us, oil prices are on their way up. From $40-60 a barrel, it has gone up to the $70-80 a barrel. 

All these global factors will have their own impact on Indian market on the way up. Second thing is valuation. Clearly there are some largecaps which are in overvalued category and finally, the political scenario. In May 2019 general election, if India votes for a stable government committed to reforms and growth, markets will be fine. But if we end up getting a coalition government which is not committed to growth or reform, there will be adverse reaction from the market. 

So over next 10 months, there will be enough opportunity for you to invest on a correction. This is not the time to chase the prices. This is not the time to do momentum investment. This is the time to build portfolio on correction.


In such a market place, do you think the best place to hide are export stocks? With the sort of currency move that we are seeing right now, should pharma and IT hold higher weightage in portfolios?
If you are taking a shorter term view, then yes IT, pharma, blue chip, largecap companies, defensive companies are the place to hide. If you are taking a longer term view, then you have to invest in companies which are using technology to disrupt the business models in various sector. Today we are at the cusp of digital and technological revolution just like we were in 18th century for industrial revolution. 

During industrial revolution, India missed the bus and partly because of that along with colonisation, our share in global GDP came down from 25% to less than 1%. Today world is at the cusp of digital and technological evolution. We should not miss the bus and if we miss the bus, there will be adverse consequences. 

It is not only technology and pharma where digital and technology is creating disruption, it is even in a commodity sector like textiles. Companies which will be agent of change, which will be harbinger of digital and technological revolution will outperform the market that is where investor will make money. Companies which are like dinosaur not reacting to the changed environment will become extinct. You would not 
 make money with them.


What do you think the markets will continue to do? Will they remain polarised and in the near term, high PE, high growth stocks will continue to outperform?
My feeling is that we will see defensive sectors, defensive stocks getting higher allocation of capital in view of the volatility ahead but the moment we see growth returning, we will see uncertainty receding either because oil prices have come down or because US Fed is saying that look we have raised enough interest rates and now we are on hold or if central bankers around the world start re-injecting liquidity. As uncertainty recedes, the markets will focus on the valuation gap between high PE stocks and low PE stocks. There will be rotation but that rotation will be driven by events or expectation of events.


How will you play the digital and the disruptive theme? Do you think it is time to buy a bank, do you see a decent digital revolution in some of the new banks that they are claiming and indicating now?
If we believe that history will repeat itself then there is a clear success story of a particular NBFC from western India. They adopted technology like no other company adopted and for the last almost a decade from a really low point in their career, they have created enormous wealth for the shareholders. While there are many contributing factors for that spectacular success, to a great extent, it can be attributed to their ability to ride technology in blending their business, in creating a niche for themselves which others fail to exploit. 

That example should serve as a lamppost, as a guidance and companies across the sectors which blend technology and digital revolution to disrupt existing business model to dis-intermediate intermediaries, to provide products and services which enhance value to the customers, will be the winners in this game. We have to find out companies which are riding the wave of disruption rather than which is getting under the wave of disruption.


Do you expect corporate banks to do well? Could there be a bottom in place around the corner?
Many of the corporate banks have already moved up by 25-30% over the last couple of fortnights and this is on expectations that the NPA cycle is behind us and the good days are coming for corporate banks. This is a case by case rather than sectoral call. 

There are some corporate banks where hopefully NPA cycle is coming to an end over the next one or two quarters. We believe there are a few corporate banks where the NPA cycle is not coming to an end. They will have to provide further NPAs in the power sector. They will have to provide further NPAs in SME sector and I want to particularly highlight the SME sector where credit flow is getting restricted. 

Eleven out of 21 PSU banks are under PCA. They cannot lend money unless and until your rating is highest. This along with six other PSU banks which are not under PCA but which have probably adopted voluntary PCA, contribute to a substantial size of banking balance sheet in the country. Their credit flow is restricted to SME segment and that is creating a kind of choke-up for the SME sector and could result in higher NPAs going forward. 

You have to be careful with corporate lending banks. It a bottom-up stock selection rather than top-down sector call, especially after last 25-30% run.


You mentioned case by case, but in the digital space, the way to evaluate the opportunity is really going to be business model per business model. Disruption will actually slow down growth for most obsolete players. How are you looking at opportunity within the digital segment?
This is a case where if you are looking for market outperformance by and large over next four-five years and have companies that are disrupting existing business model, they are likely to be the winners. Companies which are allowing their business to be disrupted are likely to be the losers. 
Digital disruption, technological revolution, they will have to be measured on a case by case basis. The past laurels will not be sufficient. There might be a start-up in a remote part of India which is already creating a model which will disrupt the giants. This is a fight between David and Goliath, obviously size alone cannot guarantee you success.


India has always been a big consumption story. Of late, one is getting the sense that global brokerages are downgrading stocks like a Unilever, Britannia etc. Do you think some profit booking or shifting is advised in high PE consumer durable names as they have run up so much already?
From a trading point of view, it might be so, but from a long term investment point of view, we still remain bullish on consumption sector. Maybe, it is worth rotating money from high PE highly valued consumption sector stocks to reasonably priced consumption stocks. 

Some amount of sector rotation might be worthwhile. We might see some shift coming from higher PE to lower PE stocks. We might see some shift coming from urban focussed consumer stocks to rural focussed consumer stocks. That sector rotation will be seen in consumer related stocks."

7,2018-09-07,Britannia,"Prices of daily use products will increase by about 5-8% starting third quarter while some have already increased prices in line with multiple inflationary pressures including all-time high petrol prices, hike in minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, and some commodity prices showing upwards movement, large companies said. “The environment is inflationary, and it is not possible to hold on to prices going forward. We will have to increase prices by 5% to begin with, to offset multiple pressures... we will try to balance value and volume growth,” Varun Berrry, managing director of listed biscuits maker Britannia Industries said.

This will be the highest prices hike for many companies in two years.

Prices of petrol are at a record high of RS 85 a litre, on the back of increasing prices of global crude, of which India is a net importer, further impacted by the falling rupee. Petrol prices, which directly impact crude derivatives, are key inputs for FMCG firms.

A recent report by Jefferies said its channel checks suggest that consumer goods giant Hindustan Unilever has taken price hikes in detergents, skin care and select soap brands in the 5-7% range last month. Parachute hair oil and Saffola edible oil maker Marico undertook a price increase in its value added hair oil portfolio by 7% while oral care maker Colgate Palmolive increased prices in some of its brands by 4% last month.

“We will take price increases of about 7-8%. The impact of MSP itself has been in the range of 10-12%, but we are not passing the entire cost escalation and taking some hit on the bottomline too,” B Krishna Rao, senior category head at Parle Products, said. Both food and non-food baskets showed mixed trends last month but crude oil was up 7% month-on-month and more than 47% higher over last year. Analysts said rupee depreciation is likely to drive input cost inflation higher for most companies led by higher packaging costs.

Petroleum derivatives are used in packaging material including bottles and tubes, while rise in crude oil prices compounds the effect of higher duties on palm oil, which is used in some food products. In March this year, duties on crude palm oil were increased to 44% from 30% and on refined palm oil to 54% from 40%."
8,2018-09-07,Britannia,"How volume and demand hold up, is the key to FMCG companies, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, tells ET Now. 
  
  
   Edited excerpts:


When it comes to an upside for FMCG stocks, is it time for consolidation or readjustment?
These stocks will consolidate at some point of time. What you have probably witnessed in terms of volume growth obviously came off of a very low base last year. But a lot of managements have alluded to strong volume growth going ahead as well. If they are able to stabilise their volumes as demand catches up gradually over the next few quarters because of MSPs, a lot of product innovations and smaller SKUs, the price points are far more attractive across different segments. 

That will prep up the overall volume led realisation growth for these companies. Now what you also witnessed in the past in terms of input cost inflation was because a few of these companies took the pass-through effect with hikes in terms of their end products. A large element of how volume and demand hold up, is the key to FMCG companies. That should remain on a gradual uptrend and the only concern that the Street has is valuations. But the FMCG companies have always stated at premium valuations. 

The Street would ideally like to watch out how this entire story plays out. Consumption as a basket is something that still will probably be top of investors’ minds. It is time for consolidation for these stocks but selectively, stocks like Emami, Dabur, HUL, Britannia do well. But again, investors should be looking on declines and buying in a a staggered way in all these counters.


How are you playing the currency weakness as a trade?
The obvious logical conclusion is obviously to play the export-oriented and service-oriented themes which include IT and pharma because the tailwind that these companies will receive are going to be substantial. But there are also other auto ancillary companies which might benefit because of a falling rupee. 

On the other hand, with the falling rupee, companies which probably import crude, crude oil derivatives as their input costs are obviously going to bear the brunt – the tyre companies, aviation companies and paint companies. If both crude prices and the rupee movement against the dollar persist at this level, you probably will be required to mandatorily take price hikes to offset the cost. That happens with a lag but the beneficiary obviously remains IT, pharma and a few of the other export oriented themes. 


There are a whole lot of concerns around BEL -- whether the margin trajectory can be maintained or not with some management comments coming in as well. How are you approaching some of these names?
The concerns on a nomination basis and the margins getting curtailed from 12.5% significantly downwards obviously creates a downward bias in terms of the earnings potential. Now the management was very categorical that FY21 onwards, the impact will be apparent and most of the orders executed till that point of time will continue with the margins that they had bid for. 

Again from an earnings perspective, over the next couple of years, the earnings trajectory at least from an FY20 basis should probably be impacted. But what the market is probably worried about is post FY20-21, as these contracts start coming on a nomination basis and as margins get curtailed, they will see the earnings hit coming through.

A few orders are still expected to be completed over the next few quarters, a couple of orders still expected to come through in their kitty and that is probably causing concerns for the stock. My own sense is that let the stock consolidate and let us understand going forward how the numbers will play out more specifically in terms of the forward looking contracts."

10,2018-09-10,Britannia,"ET Wealth together with Morningstar India have selected and ranked India's best equity fund managers, across categories, based on their five-year risk-adjusted returns. Here are the top 5 in the mutli cap category. These managers have proved their mettle while dealing with stock market volatility and have delivered consistent returns over the years. Read about each of these managers, their top stock and sector picks and what they think is the promising theme for the next few years.


Has your fund manager changed focus? 
After the recent scheme recategorisation exercise, several funds have changed colours. While some have shifted their market segment focus—from large-cap to multi-cap or mid-cap to large and mid-cap, etc.—others have altered their investing style, such as taking on a focused stance or value bias from the earlier diversified approach. For funds that have seen such a visible shift in mandate, the entire track record built previously has effectively become irrelevant. 

By extension, the performance of the fund manager handling the scheme will have to be viewed differently. The new positioning may require the fund manager to adopt a different approach, so his past performance with the same fund may not be a suffi cient guide for his future performance. However, this is no reason for investors to exit the scheme. 

In such cases, it would be a good idea to treat the revamped fund as a fresh offering and allow the fund manager to build a track record under the revised strategy. Track his performance closely over the coming year. This is particularly required for schemes under the newly defined largecap or mid-cap categories, as they gear up for generating alpha without some of the earlier flexibility.

1. Jinesh Gopani, Axis Mutual Fund
 Age: 39 Years

Education: B.Com, Master of Management Studies
Experience: 15+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 23.88%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 8,620 crore


Profile
Jinesh Gopani has an impressive track record, especially in steering the country’s biggest tax-saving equity fund. His approach has been to identify secular growth stories and stay invested for the long term rather than earning a quick return by opting for momentum-based plays. He prefers leaders and potential leaders across sector that boast of a strong business model or have the ability to disrupt existing models.

Capital preservation is an important pillar in his investing framework and he stresses on ensuring better downside protection. This is evident in the superior risk-return profile of the more aggressive of his funds— Axis Focused 25. Despite the burgeoning size of his tax-saving fund, Gopani has maintained a compact portfolio as it allows him to take meaningful exposure in his conviction bets.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“After a phase focused on quality, the rally has now become more broadbased. Earnings remain key and the numbers this time have been positive. We remain quality biased, and this has helped us deal with market volatility.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Our focus remains on quality. Results of our universe of stocks have been strong. Staying with fundamentally sound companies that have consistently delivered earning growth has been key to our strategy on generating alpha.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“We are bullish on rural and consumption themes. Here we are focusing on companies that can be market disrupters. There are two types of disrupters, traditional bellwethers looking to reinvent the market place and new disrupters that enter the markets and change the way the industry does business.”


2. Dhimant Shah, Principal Mutual Fund
 Age: 45 Years

Education: B.Com and ACA
Experience: 18+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 27.35%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 714 crore


Profile
The ferocity of market reactions in recent years have taken most by surprise, admits Dhimant Shah. The market tends to react much before one can analyse the situation, which has necessitated a greater speed of response, he points out. Shah has stressed on identifying businesses with healthy growth potential, aided by visible competitive advantages and backed by an able management.

His funds have favoured companies that emerged stronger after the market downturn five years ago. Shah believes that the market will significantly mature in the coming years as domestic participation increases—and show better resilience to foreign selling. With quality of corporate results likely to improve, stock selection will be critical to sustain alpha, says Shah.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“The market appears to be overvalued with the risk-reward scenario favouring a downside. The key risks will be falling government spending, forthcoming elections, rising inflation, currency risks, external risks of oil and repercussions of a trade war.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Steering through the current market is slightly difficult as volatility has increased sharply in recent months. We could take higher cash calls, increase allocation to defensives and book profits regularly.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Companies catering to defence appear strong for the next 3-5 years as they could see meaningful growth in the offsets and the size of opportunities that come their way. Select autoancillaries also show promise, given the rising affluence, middle class consumption and the scrapping policy.”


3. Rajeev Thakkar, PPFAS Mutual Fund
 Age: 42 Years

Education: B. Com, Chartered Accountant, CFA, and Graduate, ICWA
Experience: 17+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 19.23%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 636 crore


Profile
Rajeev Thakkar has clearly shown what it takes to steer a value-biased fund through market conditions hostile to value-based investing. With mid- and small-caps dominating investors’ mindspace in recent years, he acknowledges that a lot more caution and spadework is needed to navigate the tricky multi-cap space. 

While leaning towards value, Thakkar has opted not for the cheapest stocks but for reasonably-priced companies backed by better earnings visibility. Thakkar’s thrust has been on companies whose return on capital employed has been consistent across business cycles. He does not believe in staying fully invested at all times, preferring to take cash calls when faced with scarcity of investible ideas. He also stresses on the need to diversify across geographies to contain volatility—select bets in foreign companies have worked in his favour.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“The market is at elevated levels relative to earnings. We are also headed toward slightly higher interest rates, both in India and globally.

c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“The shift in market share from public sector banks to private sector banks is benefiting some of our holdings. The shift in advertising from traditional to the online medium is benefiting our digital investments—Alphabet (Google) and Facebook.”

Education: B.E. and MBA
Experience: 24+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 22.45%

Profile
In an environment where various sectors are witnessing disruption, Ajay Garg insists that companies willing to change and evolve through better ground research and product differentiation will emerge stronger. He places strong emphasis on future leaders and says there are several promising companies in every sector. 

Specifically, companies catering to the domestic market—that has huge growth potential due to discretionary spending—will benefit significantly, insists Garg. He also focuses on corporate governance practices, avoids leveraged plays, and prefers companies that are cash surplus and not in the habit of diluting share capital for expanding business. 

Pointing to the skew in stock market indices, Garg also stresses on diversification and takes a differentiated position vis-a-vis the index. He finds the financials segment crowded and has chosen not to align with the index.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“We see improvement in the economy and better earnings visibility. However, just 7-8 stocks have contributed almost 100% of the returns while the remaining stocks have seen meaningful corrections. Poor quality stocks are having a hard time justifying their valuations.”


b) Navigating current environment
“We will continue investing in quality companies catering mainly to the domestic space since the growth potential in India itself is quite big, especially because of the implementation of a mega reform like the GST tax.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Research-based firms with a technological edge over peers and a strong brand that gives them pricing power are a promising theme in our fast-changing world that is led by disruption. These basic characteristics, combined with scale, vision and management bandwidth will enable such companies to continue to have an edge over competition in the next 3-5 years.”

 Age: 39 Years

Education: BE and PGDM
Experience: 14+ years

5-Year asset weighted return: 22.49%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 11,189 crore


Profile
Mrinal Singh’s value investing tilt has often been at odds with the market in the past few years, yet he has remained steadfast in his approach. Even as prices and investor sentiments have changed rapidly, Singh has prioritised valuation, and has been tightfisted. 

He is optimistic about earnings growth and has chosen to stay invested for longer periods to allow his investments to unlock value. As investor sentiments have veered from one segment of the market to another, he has deftly re-aligned the portfolio to capture the emerging value. Singh has maintained a strict focus on bottom-up stock selection, while taking higher deviations relative to the index.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“Recent structural legislations like the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and National Company Law Tribunal along with GST are likely to do well for the long-term health of the economy and the industry. Also, there are green shoots of growth in the domestic economy, particularly in rural and investments-related segments.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Bottom-up stock picking with adherence to superior management quality, strong balance sheet and reasonable valuations are what we will be adhering to. We expect the market volatility to remain elevated. On valuation basis, we prefer large-caps over mid- and small-caps.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Value investing and high dividend yield are the two investment styles we believe will serve for long-term investors well.”

17,2018-09-21,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Consumers shopping for groceries and other items of daily use can look forward to value deals that are about 10-15% cheaper this festive quarter compared with the last two years.

Companies are planning a fullscale offensive with pricing offers and promotional schemes after two subdued December quarters in a row on account of demonetisation in November 2016 and the goods and services tax (GST) rollout in July last year, both of which hit consumption hard.

“We will create special offers across price points for the festive season across our brands of juices, biscuits, chocolates and confectionery,” said Hemant Malik, ITC divisional chief executive, foods. “Consumers find value in such special options.”

“We are optimistic about the offtake of these products during the festive season and expect demand to be better than last year,” said Malik.




Wholesaler Metro Cash & Carry will offer discounts that customers such as kirana stores can pass on to consumers.

“The upcoming festive quarter will be the first after two years when there will be no after-effect of either demonetisation or GST. We expect sales to be very strong,” chief executive Arvind Mediratta said.

The business-to-business wholesaler, which follows an October-September financial year, is also introducing an ‘own business day’ in October to drive traffic, aligning with large companies including Procter & Gamble, Dabur, Colgate Palmolive and Nivea selling at discounted prices to neighbourhood retail outlets. “This is the start of the financial year for us and we are expecting robust numbers given the economic macros,” Mediratta said.

Volume-led growth, innovations in product launches and the monsoon have added to optimism ahead of the upcoming festive quarter. Besides this, India’s economic revival has been robust and GST has been reduced on many items of daily use.

“We are creating multiple pricing and packs for trade and consumers, including for organised trade and kirana stores for the festive quarter,” said Mayank Shah, category head at biscuits and snacks maker Parle Products.

“We are, however, ensuring that we don’t disrupt existing equations with any of our trade channels.”

A number of launches have been lined up for the December quarter, a period that straddles Dhanteras, Durga Puja, Diwali and Christmas as well as much of the wedding season, retail industry executives said.

“Industry has overcome demonetisation entirely and the GST impact substantially,” said Anil Talreja, partner at consulting and audit firm Deloitte India. “So we expect festive discounting not only to be higher and more competitive, but we also anticipate some turbulence among trade channels, in terms of competitive discounting in the festive season.”

Market researcher Nielsen forecast in a report late last month that the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector will grow 12-13% in calendar year 2018 on the back of a favourable economic and policy environment and the easing of trade turbulence in the past two years triggered by demonetisation and uncertainties over GST. “The trade dynamism triggered by demonetisation and GST rollout has almost settled down,"" Nielsen India executive director Sameer Shukla said in the report. “Retail offtake is buoyant with double-digit growth on the back of tailwinds — GST rate cuts, strengthening macroeconomics, and robust monsoon projections.”

Homegrown packaged consumer goods maker Dabur’s chief executive Sunil Duggal said: “This festive season is certainly looking better than last year, and our consumer offers and pricing will be in sync with the outlook.”

The Nielsen report noted that modern trade channels, which contribute close to 10% of the overall FMCG market, have shown high growth while the rural market has picked up as cash is back in the market. In the June quarter, FMCG sales grew 10.9% from the year earlier. In the 12 months ended June, it grew 11.6%, nearly 70% of which was driven by consumption volume. The report said overall stock levels in the retail trade have improved by 10 percentage points since early 2017.

Nielsen also said that the increased focus on large-format stores by retailers, locally and nationwide, has helped distribution channels gain since June last year.

From 9% last year, modern trade now accounts for 10% of the FMCG retailing market, riding on consumer preferences for convenience, the report said.

Numbers for the last reported April-June quarter for large, listed consumer companies have been robust, with Hindustan Unilever and Dabur reporting volume growth of 12% and 21% ahead of street expectations, respectively, while Britannia and Marico grew by over 15% in the period."
18,2018-09-21,Britannia,"The recent selloff in HFCs looks like speculative unwinding and for a long-term investor, these are brilliant 
  
  
  opportunities to buy these companies, market veteran Madhu Kela, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


What went wrong in the market and should investors be worried?
This looks like a technical selloff. Both the NBFC companies came on your channel and clarified that their short-term liquidity situation is very good and when I say short term, they said that for the next one year they have enough liquidity in the liquid accounts to match the liabilities. So, this looks like speculative unwinding and for a long-term investor, if you really understand the company and if you have faith in the management, these are brilliant opportunities to buy these companies. Wherever the management is solid, they will be able to weather this storm and come out stronger.


Though some would argue silly and parallels have been drawn that emerging markets are going through a downturn, there is a rout in emerging market currencies and India cannot remain isolated. Should one focus on that also?
That is the point I am making. I just want to clarify that even if I have mentioned a company’s name, I am not recommending those shares to be bought or sold. Something like Indiabull Housing Finance, which enjoys the highest credit rating by CRISIL itself -- a AAA paper -- to think that there will be liquidity issues in these kind of companies is completely unwarranted in my view.


The grain of the truth is that interest rates are hardening and the cost of capital is going higher. Historically, we have seen that the financial sector and especially NBFCs perhaps may not do all that well when the macro regime is not that favourable. What is your view?
I agree with you to an extent but if your borrowing cost goes up, your lending cost will also go up and that goes up for the whole system, not for one or two individual companies. If it goes up, the borrowing cost will go even further up for banks. Yesterday provident funds had to increase the interest rate from 7.5% to 8%. So to think a 50 bps or 75 bps increase in interest rate will bring down the system to a halt, is not right.


Is one better off picking bargains in the financial sector? Indiabull Housing Finance, Yes Bank, some of these stocks which have fallen because of technical factors and because of sentiment or should one now keep it safe and stick to IT and pharma because of the tailwind in rupee and dollar?
No. I was the first one who came to your channel and recommended buying pharma stocks but at these valuations -- I will stick my neck out -- you very rarely get these kind of companies down 30-35% and if it is for some fundamental reason, then one can understand that something has gone wrong. But if it for technical reason, then these are the times you have to stick your neck and put your money.


Even though looking at the screen will make investors nervous, I can feel a sense of optimism in your voice...

Main saalon se bolte aa raha hoon ki ya to news acchha hoga ya bhav acchha hoga, jab news kharab hai to bhav acchhe hote hain or jab news acchha hota hai to bhav kharab hote hain (I have always said either news is good or the price is good. If news is bad, price is good and if news is good, price is bad.)


The news is not bad and yet stocks have fallen...

Yeh bata rahen na boss yeh satta bazaar hai yahan kuchh bhi sakta hai (This is stock market, anything can happen). That is the point. If you are on the right side of speculation and if you are a long-term investor, and I repeat that if you do not understand the company, do not buy individual companies, rather invest your money in a mutual fund. But if you do understand companie and fundamentals, of then these are great opportunities.


When people see this kind of a decline in their portfolio, they get nervous about their mutual funds commitment and SIPs. What is your message?
My message is you have to go with time tested people, you have to go with people who have withered these kinds of situations in the past. We have seen how these companies came out even in a 2008 crisis which was far deeper than anything we are seeing today. So you have to go with people who have got credibility and the capability to overcome these kind of situations.


In general your view is that one should be more constructive towards largecaps rather than midcaps and the party in mid and smallcap stocks is over?
I would say the valuation which you are getting for largecap companies are the valuations you normally buy in midcap companies. Where is the question of going for midcap companies if you are getting the same valuation for largecap stocks?


Your big call right now is that one should buy good quality NBFC stocks in this fall because suddenly they are available cheap?
Unfortunately you got me half an hour late, most of these companies are up 25% from the bottom.


You have become a private investor and is not managing mutual funds. How can we bet on Madhu Kela’s intelligence and his enterprise?
You have to get me more often on your channel.


What is your message for our viewers, do not panic and buy the fall?
Yes absolutely but be selective, buy companies which you know and understand.


What could go wrong from here which could inject 15-20% downside?
Any systemic global risk or real big spike in oil prices. Something which will be universal and not be selective to one or two companies but that risk remains. I see anything of that kind in the horizon, I do not see and for a change Mr Trump is also with us to bring down the oil prices.


So you are not worried about rupee at 72 and crude at 80, you think markets are discounting that?
Markets are more than discounting that and again remember this currency when in 2014 rupee was at 70. In 2017 it became 63 and from 63 it has gone to 72. So when you look at from 63, it looks like 12% depreciation but if I look at from 2014 level, we are up 3%, 4%.


Historically when markets have been volatile, consumers they outperform but do you think right now consumers run the risk of underperforming because in this market volatility, the first sector to decline is consumer – Britannia is down, HUL has been volatile, Marico is down. Do you think consumers will start underperforming now?
I think so. I would say that wherever you have very-very steep valuations and wherever you have extremely concentrated institutional holding on these steep valuations, those are stocks I would definitely avoid.


What exactly are you buying or selling right now, any theme, any ideas?
I do not have a problem in telling but the problem is in this kind of volatility what I buy and sell changes. If I tell you that I am buying this and I end up selling it one week later that will not be in line with my character and personality. So I would avoid naming individual companies.


Anything apart from NBFCs which you think is now nearing a level where markets are not appreciating or recognising the potential of earnings recovery?
One big theme is that I like the pharmaceutical sector, specifically the API players because there is structural change which is happening. The cost of producing drug is going up dramatically in China and it has gone up a lot in the last six months. That is one theme and sector which should continue to do well over the next few years. So again if you know the companies, you know you can monitor them, these are good sectors and select companies are available quite reasonably well keeping their long term fundamentals in mind.


What is your view on the Nifty, where do you think the Nifty is headed for next six months?
I leave that question to you."
19,2018-09-22,Britannia,"NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Urban Ladder makes a nice gesture to rival Ikea, Parle to Britannia, Mother Dairy to Patanjali. And not just in FMCG. There’s Mahindra & Mahindra teaming up with Ford, Tata Motors cozying up with Chrysler, Maruti with Toyota.

Why are rivals in the marketplace wishing each other well or collaborating on key manufacturing processes? Because these brands have understood two fundamental shifts are taking place. One, consumers are not so impressed with aggressive branding strategies that attack rivals. In fact, social media fallout of such ads can often be counterproductive. Two, cost pressures and rapid technological innovations mean shop floor collaboration makes sense for brands selling competing products.

FMCG is therefore seeing plenty of PDA (public display of affection) between rivals. Take these recent examples. When biscuits and dairy company Britannia Industries celebrated its centennial, Parle tweeted from its official handle:

“May you find the Melody to many more Little Hearts”. Nice touch, since Melody is a Parle brand, and Little Hearts, Britannia’s. Britannia responded almost immediately with a“Thanks for the love, Parle” tweet. Both tweets went viral, attracting plenty of positive comment. When Baba Ramdev-promoted Patanjali announced its dairy foray, milk behemoth Mother Dairy promptly released a statement “welcoming” Patanjali. 

Online furniture store Urban Ladder welcomed Swedish furniture and home accessories giant Ikea with a namaste through an Instagram video. Ikea’s near-immediate response was “Tack (Thank you in Swedish)… we are very happy to be here with you”. Companies have not only sent welcome notes, but also remained unaffected by spoof ads from rivals. 


'GETTING MORE CONVERSATIONAL'
Ikea didn’t mind Kishore Biyani’s Future Group hoardings that announced sale schemes in the Swedish company’s colours. Jubilant FoodWork’s Domino Pizza also didn’t react when rival Pizza Hut released ads spoofing Domino’s four weeks back. All this is miles away from those cola brand wars of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, or from more recent skirmishes between HUL and Amul over ice cream brands, or the Air India versus IndiGo brand battles, or the HUL and Procter & Gamble snarky hoardings on each other’s shampoo brands.

“Brands are loosening up and getting more conversational because that’s the need of the hour. With social media, consumer awareness and so much choice, conversations that need to break citadels are more relevant,” said brand and social commentator Santosh Desai. Brand consultant Harish Bijoor agrees. “In an environment where hatred and fear are increasingly being shunned, it’s brand love that’s refreshing… hit-and-run is the old format… for all stakeholders, brand wars are yesterday to a large extent”.


RIDING TOGETHER
In auto, too, big fights are yesterday, as far as engineering goes. Market rivals are shaving costs by sharing. The upcoming premium SUV from Tata Motors will have a Chrysler Jeep twolitre diesel engine and a Hyundai’s six-speed automatic transmission is built on a Jaguar Land Rover ‘D8’ architecture.

Mahindra & Mahindra is conceptualising a vehicle architecture in North America in partnership with South Korean brand SsangYong, codenamed W601, being designed by Italian design house Pininfarina. The W601 vehicle architecture of Mahindra is likely to churn out multiple SUVs and vans with an estimated volume potential of over 2-3 lakh units per annum, catering to multiple markets around the world, said several people in the know of the company’s plans. Pawan Goenka, MD at Mahindra & Mahindra, confirmed the exploration of three-way partnership on the C segment.

Toyota, which could not crack the mass market in India, is piggybacking Maruti into volumes end of the market. And the critical part of the partnership is electric and hybrid vehicles. Toyota is a world leader in technology, Suzuki is not, so one can see the value the partnership brings to the table, Maruti Suzuki chairman RC Bhargava told ET."

22,2018-09-26,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Hindustan Unilever and Nestlé plan to selectively increase prices of their products to take into account higher crude oil and petrol costs, the rupee’s depreciation against the dollar and more expensive commodities such as wheat.

“If crude remains where it is and if the rupee has depreciated, of course there are headwinds as far as costs are concerned,” Sanjiv Mehta, chairman of consumer goods giant HUL, told ET on Wednesday on the sidelines of the 45th national management convention of the AIMA. “There will be some price increases, though we will keep the price-value equation intact.”

Suresh Narayanan, chairman of Nestlé India, the country’s biggest packaged foods maker, also said price increases are on the cards. “Headwinds on commodities have already started and with the combination of the depreciating rupee and spiralling oil prices, we would take up prices selectively in some categories,” Narayanan told a media roundtable at the company’s headquarters in Gurgaon. 

Nestlé India’s logistics providers, too, are looking to renegotiate rates after record-high petrol and diesel prices. Mehta declined to comment on when and by how much prices would increase. “We don’t indicate pricing guidance. Price increases would not be basis a one-to-one correlation with input costs and we will keep the price-value equation intact. We are always circumspectwhen it comes to a pricing decision,” he said. Mehta said HUL had dropped prices in November after the Goods & Services Tax was introduced last year and an increase in prices now would likely not hurt consumers.

“Even if the price goes up now because of input costs and the devaluation of the rupee, we believe the consumer will be cushioned,” he said. ET reported in its September 7 edition that prices of daily consumption products would increase by about 5% starting the third quarter, citing companies such as Britannia and Parle Products. The impact of the minimum support price — guaranteed by the government to farmers — has been in the range of 10-12% and is in itself steep, the companies said.

However, not all companies will pass on the entire burden to consumers because it could hamper growth. “We will try and ensure that price increases are selective and growth doesn’t get impacted,” Narayanan said.

On the consumption outlook given the inflationary environment, Mehta said: “Market consumption does not change overnight. Definitely the market bottomed out when we saw a period when we had two consecutive years of drought to now, when volume growth has moved up.”

Petrol prices have crossed Rs 90 a litre in Mumbai on increasing global prices of crude oil, of which India is a net importer, further impacted by the falling rupee. Crude derivatives, which are key inputs for FMCG companies, and petroleum derivatives used in packaging material including bottles and tubes, have also become more expensive. However, Mehta said farm loan waivers and GST augur well for consumption, especially in the rural areas."

3,2018-10-10,Britannia,"MUMBAI:About a year after the #Me-Too movement went viral with the Harvey Weinstein case, India has seen a similar upsurge as women have called to account men in the film, media and comedy industries for sexual assault and harassment.

Amid this upheaval, companies say they have stepped up efforts to make workplaces safer for women in the past few years. Data from BSE 100 companies, which are required to furnish this information, show a 15% increase in the reports of sexual harassment complaints in FY18, based on an analysis of their annual reports by ComplyKaro Services. 

But another survey of 200 companies as well as BSE 100 data indicated that not all are necessarily proactive on this front. Some reported zero cases and more than half had less than three complaints.

However, awareness of legislation on sexual harassment at the workplace appears to be rising with companies putting in place mechanisms to handle such cases, experts said. “Companies do not have a choice but to be aware and sensitise employees because the cost they pay otherwise will be heavy,” said Biocon managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.

“There is a huge awareness being built and in the recent past many companies have started bringing a lot of focus on sensitisation.” Biocon has a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment and has previously dismissed employees on such grounds, even before the movement started, she said.

“The environment has changed; more women feel they can be open and report,” said Vinita Bali, former MD of Britannia Industries. “We have to be careful the movement does not become awave and die down… We have to hold companies and boards accountable for dealing with cases that are reported.More women coming out puts greater responsibility on those tasked with investigating to see action is taken.”

“It is no longer a taboo to report,” said Richard Lobo, head of human resources at Infosys. “There is the much important trust that when someone complains, it will be addressed and resolved fairly.”

As per ComplyKaro data collated for ET,Wipro, ICICI Bank, and Infosys had the maximum number of reported cases at 101, 99 and 77, respectively, in FY18.The two IT majors Wipro and Infosys also had the maximum reduction in number of reported cases with Wipro reporting 15 cases less than last year and Infosys 11less than FY17.ICICI Bank redressed all 99 cases during the year.Axis Bank had 47 reported cases, while HDFC Bank had 14.



“Where companies have had a number of complaints over the years but also showed a declining trend, it would mean that awareness sessions are bearing fruit in terms of behavioural change in employees,” said Vishal Kedia, director, ComplyKaro, which specializes in prevention of sexual harassment (PoSH) compliance.

Tech Mahindra, which reported 28 cases in FY18 from zero in previous two fiscals, saw maximum increase, likely due to exercises aimed at raising awareness. The company didn’t respond to queries.However, while there is more awareness on the subject, the number of cases not redressed has increased 28% to 82 in the past year, which shows that companies need to do more for prompt action.

“One needs to talk about the effectiveness of the reporting and companies must ensure that there is action taken promptly,” said Bali.

There is also a shift in quality of complaints, said Suresh Tripathi, vice president, HR management at Tata Steel. “Earlier, only when a woman was pushed to the wall she would come up to complain. However, with increasing belief in the system, people start understanding what is acceptable and what is not.” Tata Steel reported 24 cases in FY18, down from 26 a year ago, and redressed 16 cases during the fiscal. 

The survey by National HRD Network and KelpHR that assessed how effectively the sexual harassment law had been implemented by corporate India showed that 77% of organisations were compliant and felt it had helped in enhancing awareness among employees. The survey had responses from 200 HR and legal heads, internal committee officers and CXOs. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act came into force in December 2013.

The survey, however, showed 55% of organisations did not feel the law had made workplaces safer. “This can happen when the internal mechanism within the organisation is not effective even if the Act has percolated,” said Tripathi.

KelpHR CEO Viji Hari said: “The focus should be on a strong company culture and an empowered internal committee that will help the victims to report the incidents confidently.” According to Complykaro data, several large companies didn’t report any sexual harassment cases as per their annual reports. In 58% of companies, the number of cases reported was less than three, according to the KelpHR survey. Experts said this could be due to fear of retaliation, job loss and victim shaming.

“It is alarming large corporates disclosing nil complaints over the years which may indicate there is not much awareness created in terms of sensitisation sessions for employees and women are not feeling safe to come forward and complain,” said Kedia."

5,2018-10-15,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group: For those on the Street scouting to cherry-pick quality stocks in the wake of the recent correction, HUL is a strong temptation. The consumer goods behemoth’s second quarter performance was on expected lines with doubledigit volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter on a base of 4 per cent volume growth a year ago.

Despite the company’s strong first quarter performance, analysts had downgraded its stock on concerns over stretched valuations and imminent risks to a sustained strong performance. The stock steadily weakened 13 per cent from its record high hit two months ago.

The latest quarterly performance, however, should allay valuation concerns. The stock is now trading at 59.2 times its earnings against the peak of 72.5. The company posted 10 per cent volume growth on a base of 4 per cent growth a year ago. The volume growth is expected to temper down as the high base effect kicks in from the current quarter.

HUL has made all the right moves — cutting advertising spend, reining in other expenses and passing on input cost inflation over to the consumers. While raw material cost as a proportion of revenues increased, the ad spend and other expenses as a percentage of revenues declined from the year-ago levels. The result: strong revenue growth of 12 per cent and 160 basis points improvement in ebitda margins despite headwinds of a depreciating rupee and escalated oil prices.

Strong brands, economies of scale and agile execution help HUL tide over macro-economic headwinds. It deploys several levers like price increases, moderating ad spends, acquisition of brands to improve its portfolio and changing revenue mix to mitigate headwinds. Rural demand continues to grow better than the urban one, a good sign for the consumer behemoth that earns nearly half its revenues from Bharat.

However, factors like weak rupee, escalated oil prices, increased competitive intensity as well as high base effect in the coming quarters may limit a major upside in the stock price. HUL also faces competition on the bourses from stocks of its peers like Britannia and Nestle that too are trading at similar valuations post the recent correction. Investors are in for a difficult choice in the consumer goods sector."

7,2018-10-19,Britannia,"Governments come and go, but one thing remains a constant – their love for tobacco. Irrespective of who rules, the industry is among the heavily taxed and thanks to human frailties it remains an exception to the law of demand. The arguments for taxing it ranges from being a deterrent to filling the coffers.

So far so good.

But how can governments which want to promote a healthy life style for its citizens through high taxation on smokers justify their ownership of a cigarette company? That too a firm not started by the government, but a stake that landed on its lap by default.

Yes, it is the ITC debate that is back on the table. Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an organisation founded by S Gurumurthy, a man of clean habits, to promote native entrepreneurship and prevent multinational companies from gobbling up the locals, wants the government to raise its holding in the biggest cigarette maker. This is when the state is struggling to fund roads, hospitals, schools and there is a real threat of it breaching the fiscal deficit target.

Why? The argument goes like this: UK’s British American Tobacco’s (BAT) decision to turn down ITC’s ESOP scheme was a “plan to destabilise the Indian management to achieve its longterm objective of taking over the company and re-converting ITC into a tobacco company, maximising returns for the parent company,” ET reported. The question is why shouldn’t BAT do it?

If 80 percent of its profits come from cigarette sales while revenues is just about 40 per cent, it shows other businesses are a drain on the capital. No wonder, ITC, a consumer good company with no debt, is trading at 28 times its March earnings when peers such as Hindustan Unilever and Britannia are trading at more than 50 times.

It is a mystery as to why governments — from Vajpayee to Manmohan Singh to Narendra Modi — are holding on to stakes in firms that found their way to government’s vault while bailing out Unit Trust of India. In 2002, when the state-run UTI was teetering the government bailed it out by paying investors what the investment institution promised.

In return, the government got many assets, including stakes in ITC, Axis Bank, Larsen & Toubro that are held by an entity SUUTI.

Over the years SUUTI sold some to realise the values. Why not a strategic stake sale in listed firms where there are willing buyers like BAT. Even a beginner to investing would tell you that a chunky sale would fetch a premium if it goes with control. So is the case with Axis Bank and other ownership. If BAT is interested in ITC, a Uday Kotak may be interested in buying Axis. Government ownership is pampering vested interests and harming taxpayers.

SUUTI made a profit of Rs 3,940 crore selling shares in L&T. It also sold shares worth Rs 5, 521 crore by transferring Axis, ITC and L&T shares to Bharat ETF, data from its website shows.

Neither the United Progressive Alliance nor the National Democratic Alliance administrations have come up with a convincing answer. The only speculation could be lobbying and vested interests.

A sale of SUUTI’s holdings in ITC, Axis and L&T could fetch at least Rs 50,000 crore if not more. Other than these three, it also owns stakes in companies such as Crisil, Tata Global Beverages, Bloomberg data shows.

If there’s a lesson on how to deal with exits after bailing out corporations with taxpayer money, look no further than Uncle Sam.

When the US used hundreds of billions of dollars from the Troubled Assets Relief Programme during the global financial crisis to bail out firms like Citigroup and General Motors, there was an uproar. But the state soon sold out, and in many cases even made a profit.

It is a pity that a government struggling to fix its finances and aiming to boost foreign currency reserves does not think about selling down the SUUTI holdings to strategic investors to maximise value. It may be time to wind up SUUTI."
8,2018-10-22,Britannia,"The net profit earned by a company belongs to its shareholders, but not all of it is distributed to them. The profits not distributed by the company are called retained earnings. 

A company’s retained earnings depend on its investment opportunities, business and economic outlook, ownership structure, the business phase it is in, among other things. Retained earnings help finance research and development programmes and, therefore, companies that are in their growth phase retain substantial amount of earnings compared to those in the maturity stage of their life cycle. 

Ideally, a company should retain profits, if it can invest them to generate higher returns for shareholders. In other words, a rupee worth of earnings with the company should be more valuable than a rupee worth of earnings in the hands of the shareholders. 

Warren Buffett says that retained earnings should be used to create value for the shareholders but, if the management fails to create value, it is better that it pays dividends. The retained earnings-to-market value ratio, designed by Buffett, is used to evaluate the efficiency with which a company utilises its retained earnings. 

The ratio provides the value the management has created for every rupee of profit it has retained. For example, if the ratio is 2.5, it implies that the management has created Rs 2.5 worth of market value for every Rs 1 that it retained. 

We used data for the past five years, starting from year 2013-14, and calculated the earnings-to market value ratio for companies with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore. Only the companies with the average retention ratio—percentage of a company’s retained profits vis-a-vis total profit—of more than 50% in the past five years were included in the analysis. The retained earnings are calculated by adding the adjusted earnings per share for the past five years (2013-14 to 2017-18) minus the total dividend per share for the past five years.

Next, the change in the stock’s market value was computed by subtracting its price five years ago from its current price. Finally, the retained earnings-to-market value ratio was calculated by dividing the change in market value by the retained earnings.

The stocks were then sorted in their descending order of retained earnings-to-market value ratio. The top 10% stocks in this list have delivered average point-to-point returns of 20.05%, 166.2% and 654.7% in the past one, three and five years, respectively. 

On the other hand, stocks that made the bottom 10% of the list delivered an average point-to-point returns of -32.5%,-15.1% and 13.3% returns in the past one, three and five years, respectively. The BSE500 Index delivered -2.33%, 26.02% and 83.3% point-to-point return during the same one, three and five-year periods, respectively.

For long-term wealth creation, investors should not only assess the profitability of a company but also see whether the management is capable of generating growth from its profits. 

Let us look at the seven companies in the top 10% of our list that promise significant stock price growth over the next one year based on Bloomberg consensus estimates.


1. Havells India
 
An electrical goods company, Havells India has a strong global presence and offers a wide range of products including cables and wires, motors, fans, modular switches, home appliances and air conditioners. 



Analysts are bullish on the stock due to the company’s strong brand positioning, margin expansion, growing market share, reasonable upside from Lloyd business and improving consumption dynamics. They expect the stock to rise by more than 7.6% over the next one year


2. Relaxo Footwears
 It is engaged in manufacturing and trading footwear and related products. Analysts believe that the company’s strategy of penetrating into new territories, improvement in supply chain, reduction in inventory days, rising productivity, rich valuations, high asset turnover and return on capital employed ratios provide reasons to accumulate the stock. 



According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company is likely to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of over 26% in the second quarter of 2018-19.


3. Britannia Industries
 A food company engaged in the manufacture of biscuits, cakes and rusks, Brittannia Industries is present in more than 60 countries. According to a report by Prabhudas Lilladhar, Britannia is likely to see profit growth accelerate significantly, led by a gradual recovery in volume growth, gains from cost-efficiency and benefits from sustained traction in premium products at lower price points. 


According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company is likely to report 17% growth in its adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2018-19.


4. Solar Industries
 A manufacturer of industrial explosives and initiating systems, Solar Industries caters to the industrial and defence sector. A report by Equirus Securities says that higher commodity prices, strong demand for explosives and higher selling prices are likely to aid Solar’s sales growth.

5. Titan Company
 The company operates in the lifestyle space and has a presence in 32 countries. Its business segments include jewellery, accessories and eye wear.

According to the Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company is likely to report a 24% jump in adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2018-19


6. VIP Industries
 The company manufactures and sells luggage bags and accessories in India and abroad. Analysts expect that luggage industry will continue to grow on the back of rising disposable incomes and strong consumer demand. Moreover, the company has displayed pricing power in the past and its current scale of operations are likely to protect profitability going forward. 


According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company is likely to report over 27% growth in adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2018-19.


7. Grindwell Norton
 
It is a subsidiary of Saint Gobain and manufactures abrasives, silicon carbide, high performance refractories and performance plastics.

9,2018-10-23,Britannia,"Investment guru 
Mark Mobius 
has started his second innings with 
Mobius Capital Partners
. In an interview 
  
  
  with Nikunj Dalmia and Ayesha Faridi of ET Now, at the Morningstar Investment conference, Mobius explains why he wants to put money in India, why India is a special case and doesn’t need rate hikes to contain inflation and how he is looking for companies that other than valuation, have strong balance sheets, focus on ESG factors and are paying dividends.



Edited excerpts: 


What brings you to India?
The Morningstar Conference, and also we are planning to put money into India because we have a new fund and it is taking more time. I hope, we will be able to accelerate that.


What gives you that confidence? Do you think that we are at the end of the pain when it comes to India?
Well we know there is a liquidity crisis, we know that you had this problem with the infrastructure company and all these issues are at play and therefore the market has gone down may be a little bit too far. The currency has gone down as well. Put this all together and it means there are bargains, there are good opportunities.


You have been making a call that one should always go and commit when bear markets are on. Do you think the current route of selling in emerging markets across categories is a buying opportunity?
Yes. We are at a stage where with interest rate going up in the US, currencies in emerging markets are going down dramatically and the markets themselves have gone down. It is an opportunity to start buying. I am not saying we are at the absolute bottom, no one can predict whether it is going to be 20%, 30% at the beginning of the year. Who knew emerging markets would go down by 20 odd percent and we are now about 22-23% on the index. The important thing to remember now is that some companies are bargains, tremendous opportunities but some are not. We now have to separate the men from the boys, so to speak. 

You have to stay away from companies that have weak balance sheets, do not pay dividends and have poor management. Companies that have strong balance sheets, pay dividends and have a forward looking management are going to be the winners. Separate these two and do not pay so much attention to the overall index.


Emerging markets currently account for nearly 30% to 35% of the global market cap. That is a sizable chunk. It is no longer a billion dollar or a two billion dollar market. This 30% market cap now has corrected by 50% to 15%. So, even though emerging markets are supposed to be high growth pockets, why are these market correcting at a time when growth in general has been very precious?
It is mainly because of what has happened in the US. We must remember the biggest pool of money globally is in the US and so what US investors do, have a big impact. Of course, that impact is declining. As emerging markets grow internally, you are getting big pockets of money investing in the local markets. India, for example, has a big domestic market. But nevertheless, people look to the US and the US dollar. They trust the US dollar. 

If interest rates are going up in the US, money flows in to the US dollar until interest rates in emerging countries catch up. Look at Europe, the euro is still paying almost zero per cent interest. That has got to come up. Once that comes up, you may see money flowing out of US and into emerging markets. By the way, you have already seen reversal. We have seen money going into emerging markets recently as a result of these developments.


You believe that crude could go up all the way to $100. That is like a double edged sword, which is not working in favour of India. Do you think if crude were to move up higher and get to $100 per barrel, the whole India investment hypothesis will change?
No, not really We must remember India is a big country. There are lot of things going on where oil prices may not impact. For example, you have got huge coal resources. Agreed coal is polluting but the reality is that when people want to produce fuel, then coal becomes a big factor. You have increased your solar. You have increased your wind. So yes, oil does have an impact but it does not have to be disastrous and it depends again on the industry. In some industries, power consumption is not a big factor, it is very small part of their total cost. 


Where do you find tactical opportunities when it comes to India? A year back. it was financials, but look what is happening with financials right now. Just about everyone is shunning even quality NBFCs. Is that the right pocket to hunt now?
There are going to be opportunities. You would think micro lending and the non-banking institutions would be dangerous but there are opportunities in this sector and we are looking at that very carefully.


COMMODITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BIG FACTOR

In your previous avatar you have bought stocks like Reliance. You have bought nearly 5-7% in Sesa Goa. What is your view on commodities first and then commodity stocks as we stare at a trade war and a potential slowdown in China?
Commodities will continue to be a big factor. Just take your oil. Companies that are producing oil are going to be doing very well with the higher oil price. I always tell people do not give up on commodities because commodities are required and in increasing quantities. We must remember that two most populated countries in the world India and China are going to use more and more commodities. It is going to be a big challenge because there are environmental problems with commodities as you know. I do not think commodities are not going to get cheap. They are going to get more expensive. 


Parallels are being drawn between 2008 and 2018, looking at the quantum of the selloff. If one works with an assumption that the US economy will start slowing down in 12 to 18 months after the sugar rush which they are enjoying because of tax cuts, how do you see the flow of money moving and changing?
You will see flow out of the US increasing because as you reach these higher interest rates, that will come to an end. There will be a point when inflation will not come up at the rate they are expecting it to. This is one of my big theses these days --we are not in an inflationary environment globally, we are in a deflationary environment. Why? Because of technology. Technology is making things cheaper. The CPI is based on a basket of goods which are changing. But if you look at the basics, the food prices are going down. The World Health Organisation is looking at these prices and they seeing a declining trend. We are in that kind of environment which I believe will hold up the rise of interest rates by central banks but as the US central bank slows down interest rate hikes, other banks around the world have to catch up because they have not yet risen as much as they should. So, you are going to see money flowing back to take advantage of these higher rates.


In that sense would you say the Reserve Bank of India has been a little behind the curve because just about everyone on the Street was expecting it to be a 50 bps hike but they chose to hold back.
In the case of India, I am a little bit on the other side of the equation because I think in India, the central bank has been in the past too aggressive about raising rates. It would be better in the Indian environment to have lower rates because it will help the community at large and industry at large. India is kind of a special case, It is not necessary to raise rates in order to contain inflation. If you want to contain inflation, you have to increase productivity and that means you have to reduce the regulatory environment. 

The single excise tax or GST is a giant step in the right direction because that has the impact of lowering inflation, reducing overall cost. I think India is a special case.


When you think of India, you think of consumption. Consumption is just such a large basket. Just about everything falls under the bracket. Take autos. In the market correction, auto stocks fell down.Do you believe it is the time to buy this decline in autos because whenever the economy recovers a little bit, the auto stocks will come back?
It is now time to look at companies that are advanced in electric automobiles because that is the future and not only for the domestic market but for exports. So the degree to which Tata Motors or any of these companies can develop an inexpensive electric vehicle will be very important going forward. That is what I would focus on. And the technology is here, there is no reason why this cannot be done.


WHAT MARK MOBIUS IS LOOKING FOR IN COS

You have been an emerging market veteran and you generally have been investing into emerging markets for over 25 years now. If you have to make a list of your favourite investable companies in India, what will it show?
My favourite companies in India are those that have strong balance sheets, number one, that are focussing on ESG factors, number two and are paying dividends.


What about valuations?
And the valuations of course. We look at price earnings, price to book but we found that these are not really good long-term indicators in itself. Of course, they are important but we are looking more at the growth. I am not so much interested in what the PE is today but what it is going to be in five years.


Can you give me an example that what is looking expensive today may look cheap tomorrow because growth will come back?
If you look at the banks here, if you really do the numbers and look at the non-performing loans, you will find that the price to book is very high because a lot of the assets have been wiped out. But then if you look forward, the reforms that are taking place in the banks could look pretty good going forward. So that is an example where you have to take a five year view.


So let us take the next five years, EVs is one that you talked about. Where do you think the big disruption is going to come in when it comes to India, economy, stock markets all put together?
The big disruption will be the impact of the internet and technology in general. The reason why I say that is that many of the traditional industries have not yet adopted a lot of the technology that is required. You take retail, they do not have an inventory control based on the internet, they do not have an inventory of their customer base. All these factors have to come in into play because they are going to be running into a tremendous competition.


The India romance always has been centred around consumption and when I say consumption it is autos, staples and durables. Would you buy an HUL, would you buy a Britannia or would you buy a Nestle with a five-year view?
This is a very good question because very often you will find these tremendous names, that are selling at very high multiples and again I have to emphasise what are they doing going forward? If they are going to stay where they are, I am not interested. If they are making innovations in their product base, in the way they manage their businesses then I am interested, that means growth. Even though the valuation may appear to be high now, if you are seeing that growth, going forward PE levels will go down, price to book levels will go down, dividend yields will go up that is what we are looking for.


In your investing career in India, I have been told that Templeton had nearly $10 billion directly, indirectly invested in India. Which is one business you regret buying late and one business you regret selling early?
I would say that more than business buying too late was probably the outsourcing businesses. We did not recognise the incredible potential there. Some of the mining companies, we bought a little bit too early. They had a lot of reforms to go through and the whole environmental issues came in play. We could have been waiting.


A year from now, the texture of the market would be a lot different than what we are at now. We also have a very big political risk as well. This year, you have got three state elections, the run up to the big 2019 election. What would you want to see from the government in the next one year because the big fear in the market is that they are bound to turn a little populist in the run up to the election.
I would say that if the current government could focus more strongly on the reforms that they announced when they were elected, that would go a long way towards strengthening their position. So is implementing these reforms more forcefully. A good example is what we are talking about; of foreign investment making it easier for investments to come in, particularly now because the opportunity is tremendous with the trade war between the US and China, India has got an incredible opportunity to garner some of this manufacturing.


Do you think there is a big political risk attached to the markets right now,? If the same government does not come to power, is it going to be a big derogatory factor for the equity momentum?
I do not think so because any government that gets in is going to be pushed to reform because with the internet and smartphones, everybody is aware of what is going on. The young generation are very impatient, they do not want to wait, they want action now and any government is going to be forced to act.


After an extremely successful career as an emerging market strategist with Franklin Templeton, normally people retire at this age, but you are starting your second innings. What prompted this?
Well I recognised that there was a new era taking place and it was time to get away from index investing and focus on the index. It was time to look at the ESG factors. So looking at all this, I said well maybe I better turn over a new leaf, separate myself from what went before and start something new and that is really the exciting thing,

When you hear the new ideas of the analysts it is just incredible. The analysts today are so much more advanced in technology it is quite something.


What is the mantra for you fitness because we have been seeing you for the last 15 years and not a single wrinkle, the skin is as glowing?
The key is to exercise everyday without fail. I get up in the morning, I get on the stationary bicycle, I read from my i-Pad. I read a book or something and then in the evening, I try to do some weight training. It is very important because as you get older you bones will get weak. Now my weakness is proved, that is the problem. I love sweets. So. when I come to India I go wow about Indian sweets. It is a real problem.


So Indian stocks or Indian sweets, where is the preferred choice right now?
Mark Mobius: They are both sweet."
11,2018-10-24,Britannia,"It was a deluge of a different kind. India's biggest institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) found itself in the middle of a major stock churn in the September quarter.

To bring in some perspective, the said quarter was also marked by heightened volatility over the IL&FS default crisis. 

LIC, which holds stake in over 320 companies, was seen reshuffling its portfolio heavily in financials, healthcare, oil & gas, chemical and information technology sectors, shareholding data for the September quarter suggests. 

Close to 30 companies caught LIC's fancy during the quarter gone by. The insurance behemoth raised its stake in auto majors Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki to 6.45 per cent and 6.55 per cent, respectively, from 6.40 per cent and 5.76 per cent in the preceding June quarter. 

LIC also upped exposure in TVS Motor to 1.75 per cent from 1.12 per cent during the same period. However, it offloaded some shares in Bajaj Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra, according to data available with ACE Equity till October 23. 

BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty plunged over 6 per cent in September even though for the quarter both the indices gained around 2 per cent. 

The insurance company also bought additional shares in select public sector banks, including Allahabad Bank (to 9.90 per cent from 9.89 per cent), Bank of Baroda (to 3.86 per cent from 3.18 per cent) and Indian Bank (to 1.89 per cent from 1.82 per cent). On the other hand, it slashed stake in Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Vijaya Bank and YES Bank during the quarter under review. 



In the oil and gas space, it scooped up additional shares in GAIL, BPCL, Chennai Petroleum and Oil India for the quarter to September. 

Among FMCG majors, LIC further increased its holdings in Britannia Industries, Gillette India, Hindustan Unilever and Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Healthcare. However, it sold some shares of Colgate-Palmolive and Nestle during the quarter under review.

Piramal Enterprises, OFSS, Wipro, Blue Dart, Tata Consultancy Services, Crisil, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle, General Insurance Corporation of India, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation and Grasim featured among companies where LIC increased its holding during the quarter under review. Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have plunged over 65 per cent in 2018 so far.

On the other hand, NTPC, Tata Power Company, Peninsula Land, Bata India, Arvind Ltd, National Aluminium, Larsen & Toubro, Sun Pharma, Merck, Cipla, REC, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Rajesh Exports, Voltas, Pidilite, Chambal Fertilisers and Seshasayee Paper & Boards are a few where LIC reduced stake in July-September."

12,2018-10-25,Britannia,"ET Intelligence group: With fund flows drying up, investors are quickly realising that liquidity-driven PE expansion — even for quality names with robust earnings visibility — cannot continue. So, the Street advice now is not to buy a ‘wonderful’ stock at any price point.

Since the correction began on August 28, the relative valuation comfort of a stock with respect to its longterm average has become more important than the premium associated with earnings predictability. So, companies trading at lower P/E premium compared to their long-term averages have outperformed peers trading at the more expensive end of the range. On the BSE 100 index, stocks trading at more than 25 per cent premium to their five-year average PE multiples fell 22.5 per cent since August 28, compared with a 5.4 per cent decline for stocks trading at less than 15 per cent premium to the long-term mean.



Before the correction began, many consumer stocks were trading at three standard deviations away from their 10-year mean.

PE re-rating has been the prime driver for consumer staples and discretionary stocks, with multiples expansion contributing about half the total returns in many cases. It means that earnings estimates were much higher than historical growth would have suggested.

But investors are now pruning exposure to expensive stocks and buying those with reasonable valuations. That explains the precipitate decline in stocks such as Godrej Consumer, Page Industries, Britannia Industries, and Crompton Greaves Consumer. In contrast, stocks trading at reasonable valuation such as ITC, Tata Global Beverage and Colgate Palmolive have outperformed this bout of correction.

Before August 28, Britannia was trading at 63 times, at a 45 per cent premium to its five-year average, and Page Industries at 80 times, about three standard deviations from the longterm mean. Similarly, in the auto space, Maruti Suzuki was trading at 30 times the next 12 month earnings on August 28, a 36 per cent premium to the long-term average. It corrected 29 per cent since then and P/E has shrunk to 19.5, near the long-term average.

Bajaj Auto, on the other hand, outperformed as the stock was trading closer to long-term average when the correction began."
14,2018-10-29,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market witnessed a turnaround and opened positive on Monday, with benchmark Sensex jumping 230 points and Nifty touching 10,083 mark in opening trade. 

However, the headline indices failed to hold altitude and pared gains, taking cues from Asian peers as worries over corporate earnings and a slowdown in global economic growth weighed on. 

Analysts said a stock-specific approach should work in such an unpredictable market. Based on the recommendations from various brokerages, here are 10 stocks that can give you decent gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Coal India| Buy | Target price: Rs 299 | Stop loss: Rs 272
Recent price behaviour on this counter is pointing towards some sort of accumulation. The stock is holding on to its recent gains and has registered a bullish candle on the weekly chart, especially at a time when the broader market was witnessing a deep carnage. “Sustaining above Rs 273 level, this counter can be expected to initially target the Rs 299 level. Positional traders should buy into this counter for the said target with a stop loss below Rs 272,” Mohammad said.


Blue Star | Buy | Target price: Rs 576 | Stop loss: Rs 500
In last four sessions, this counter traded almost flat and appears to be moving in a horizontal fashion, pointing towards better relative strength compared with the broader market. “Sustaining above the current four-day-old base formation, this stock can initially target the Rs 576 mark. Traders should buy this stock for the said target with a stop loss below Rs 500 on a closing basis,” Mohammad said.


ICICI Pru | Buy | Target price: Rs 340 | Stop loss: Rs 307
This counter is clearly showing signs of an early bottom, as it tested the low of Rs 310 in last four weeks and then bounced back, suggesting a strong support around those levels. Positional traders should buy at the current price and add further around Rs 312 for an initial target of Rs 340. On a sustainable close above Rs 340, a higher target of Rs 370 can’t be ruled out. Positional traders should buy the stock for an initial target of Rs 340 with a stop loss below Rs 307 on a closing basis.


Aditya Agarwala, technical research analyst, YES Securities (India)

Sterlite Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 375-400 | Stop loss: Rs 320
On the weekly chart, Sterlite Technologies is on the verge of a breakout from a triangle pattern neckline placed at Rs 363, indicating the resumption of bullish trend. A sustained trade above Rs 363 with healthy volumes can take the stock higher to Rs 375-400 levels. The RSI has turned upward after taking support at the lower end of the bull zone i.e. 40 level, and has formed a positive reversal on the daily chart, suggesting bullishness in the counter. “The stock can be bought in the Rs 344-347 range for targets of Rs 375-400, keeping a stop loss below Rs 320,” Agarwala said.


TTK Prestige | Buy | Target price: Rs 7,100-7,400 | Stop loss: Rs 6,000
On the weekly chart, TTK Prestige has taken support at the lower end of a channel and turned upwards suggesting the resumption of an uptrend on cards. On the daily chart, it has broken out from a channel pattern after forming a positive divergence with respect to the RSI, indicating higher levels in the coming sessions. Moreover, the RSI formed a positive reversal on the weekly chart, suggesting that the uptrend is still intact. “The stock can be bought in the range of Rs 6,435-6,445 for targets of Rs 7,100-7,400, keeping a stop loss below Rs 6,000,” Agarwala said.


Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

Mahindra & Mahindra | Buy | Target price: Rs 825 | Stop loss: Rs 700
This stock has witnessed a decent correction from Rs 976 to bottom out around that level and there a consolidation phase going on to signify strength and potential in the stock. The chart looks attractive. With the RSI moving around in the oversold zone, the bias and risk-reward ratio has become attractive. “With good volume activity seen, we recommend buying this stock for an upside target of Rs 825, keeping a stop loss at Rs 700,” Parekh said.


Britannia Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 5,900 | Stop loss: Rs 5,000 
This stock has witnessed a good correction from the Rs 6,935 level. It is currently showing signs of bottoming out at around Rs 5,255 and the chart looks promising for an upside movement in the coming days. The RSI has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy. “With good volume participation, we recommend buying the stock for an upside target of Rs 5,900, keeping a stop loss of Rs 5,000,” Parekh said.


Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities


InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo)| Buy | Target price: Rs 960 | Stop Loss Rs 815
The declining trend of IndiGo seems to have completed as the stock has witnessed an excellent bounce in the past few weeks. After forming a consistent negative sequence of lower tops and bottoms on the daily charts, this stock has moved up swiftly, by forming higher highs and lows, which signals a positive bias. Volume and RSI are also supporting current upmove. “Buying can be initiated at the current market price (Rs 875) and add more on dips down to Rs 835. Hold for the upside target of Rs 960 for the next 3-4 weeks, with a stop loss at Rs 815,” Shetti said.


Jay Thakkar, CMT – head technical and derivatives research - AVP equity research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers

Maruti Suzuki | Buy | Target price: Rs 7,300 | Stop loss: Rs 6,500
This stock seems to have completed a five-week declining structure. So, a bounceback or a retracement of the entire fall is expected. Momentum indicators are showing positive divergence which also a positive sign going forward for this stock.


Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, senior technical analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas

Godrej Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 520 | Stop loss: Rs 434 
After a multi-week decline, Godrej Industries seems to be forming a base for itself. On the daily chart, it has formed a Doji pattern at the daily lower Bollinger Band, which shows that the momentum can shift in favour of the bulls. The stock is showing a positive divergence on the daily chart, which is a bullish sign. So, the stock seems to be gearing up for a short-term pullback."

16,2018-10-31,Britannia,"Samvat 2074 — the period from last Diwali to this — has been a tough year for investors with the stock market tumbling from their highs. In the past year, the Sensex has risen 2.5 per cent while BSE’s mid- and small-cap indices have declined 14 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively. Many smaller shares have fallen as much as 50-70 per cent from their highs, eroding the value of several portfolios. The next few months are likely to be challenging as well. In such an environment, it would be prudent to hold stocks that could stay resilient in testing times. ET spoke to five brokerages for their top picks for Samvat 2075:


Axis Securities

Mold-Tek PackagingImproved volume outlook from Paints and Food & FMCG customers with growing pie of F&F aiding strong margin delivery. We believe, with rising contribution from F&F segment, better off-take from paints sector, full scale operationalization of RAK plant, new product launches and consistent increase in share of IML products, MTEP can report 31 per cent earnings CAGR over FY 2018-20. We revise our estimates and assign it a 20 times PE basis FY20E EPS.


TridentThe company is the flagship company of Trident Group, with business interests in home textiles and paper. The company is trusted partner to the top global retailers & fashion houses adding premium customers globally present in USA, UK, Italy, France, Japan, Australia amongst other countries. Company is in process to reduce its debt burden thus making its balance sheet lighter. The net debt/equity ratio is already at 0.7 and the net debt stands at Rs 2,000 cr with LT debt at Rs 1,539 crore at the end of Q2FY19. We expect the return ratios to improve as debt falls and efficiency parameters improve.


Titan
While, we are cognizant of rich valuations for consumer and retail stocks, we believe these will continue to sustain the premium levels for companies offering highest visibility of earnings growth over medium to longer term. Revenue growth opportunity of 20 per cent CAGR over the long term is immense and far superior to peers. Further, with an up-trending margin profile driven by growing revenue from SSSG makes us believe in the structural growth outlook of Titan.


HDFC Securities

Cummins India
The company is well placed to capture the broad revival in industrial and infrastructure capex in India, with its bestin-class product portfolio, wide distribution reach, and technological leadership. With the kind of technological leadership CIL has in the Indian market, along with a healthy balance sheet and strong parentage, it deserves a premium over its peers in terms of valuation. We feel investors could buy the stock and add on dips to Rs 597–605 for a target of Rs 817.


Cyient
A niche engineering services, strong client relationships, timely acquisitions to support its roduct solutions profile, strong financial profile with minimal debt, and healthy debt protection metrics and liquidity makes a case for investment in its stock. It has some deals in the negotiation phase, and the overall deal pipeline remains good. We feel investors could buy the stock at the LTP and add on dips to Rs 545–555 (11x FY20E EPS) for a target of Rs 748 (15x FY20E EPS).


Hindustan Oil Exploration
The company is debt free, with net cash balances of Rs 35 cr and Rs 53 cr invested in its subsidiary. Over the next two years, company expects significant ramp up in volumes which would ensure growth visibility going ahead. Given strong management, a robust balance sheet and stellar growth expected over the next two-three years, we recommend buy at Rs 130, and add on dips to Rs 108 with a target price of Rs 177 till next Diwali.




IIFL

Petronet LNG
The company is set to benefit from 17 per cent capacity expansion at Dahej terminal to 17.5 mmt by FY 2019 from current 15mmt. We expect revenue and PAT CAGR of 16 per cent and 19 per cent over FY 2018-20 respectively. The stock trades at 10.8 times FY 2020 estimated EPS with discount valuation to its 3-year average. We recommend Buy on the stock with a target price of Rs 256.


Mindtree
India’s eighth largest IT services company has strong digital capabilities. The stock has corrected almost 30 per cent since Sep’18 and trades at attractive valuations vs. peers despite better revenue and EPS growth profile. In our view, the correction has factored in the concerns related to recent softness/macros and we reckon that Mindtree is likely to outperform peers like LTI, Mphasis and Hexaware.


Motherson Sumi
The company has successfully acquired / integrated 21 companies till date. Hence, it is set to achieve FY 2020 estimated revenue target of $18bn. At current market price, Motherson Sumi trades at 15 times FY 2020 estimated EPS and we believe the recent correction is overdone. We expect consolidated revenue, EBITDA and PAT to register 16 per cent, 29 per cent and 47 per cent CAGR respectively over FY 2018-20. We value MSSL at 18 times FY 2020 EPS and recommend Buy with a target price of Rs 293.

Maruti Suzuki India: A household name, Maruti Suzuki is largest passenger vehicles company with an impressive market share of  nearly 50 per cent in domestic market with 1.65 million vehicles sold in 2017-18. The brokerage believes that the government’s higher focus on raising rural income and overall increase in per capita income are big positives for four wheeler passenger vehicle industry. But challenges in the near term remain in the form of rising interest rates, firm crude oil prices and a depreciating rupee. But the long term growth story remains intact.Next

Motilal Oswal

ICICI Bank
ICICI Bank reported better than expected set of numbers for Q2FY19. ICICI is in the midst of an improvement in the operating environment and is showing healthy signs of earnings normalization. With challenges related to management transition getting addressed, the bank is now focusing on growing its core operating profits.


Britannia Industries
Rapidly expanding distribution, continuing investment in R&D, rapid pace of new launches and significant expansion of its own manufacturing indicate the immense confidence that management has on growth prospects. Opportunity beyond biscuits is also substantially high. Continuing premiumization, significant incremental cost savings and a favorable commodity cost outlook mean further EBITDA margin expansion prospects are bright as well.


Exide Industries
OEM and replacement demand remains healthy in both automotive and industrial segments. Also, there is a gradual shift away from unorganised to organised players. We believe that the battery industry should benefit the most and grow at a CAGR of 10-12 per cent over the medium-to-long term. We expect Exide to continue gaining market share, backed by new product launches for existing and new applications, and a sharp focus on customer service and marketing infrastructure.


Religare Broking

Asian Paints
The Indian paints industry is estimated to grow at a healthy pace of 13 per cent CAGR over the next two years. Further, the recent rationalization in the GST rates in paints could benefit the organized players in the long run. Moreover improved product mix and operating leverage should provide cushion to margins which would mitigate concern of rising crude oil price. We estimate revenue and PAT to grow by 10.9 per cent & 12.2 per cent CAGR respectively over FY 2018-20, driven by steady capacity addition, wide distribution reach and continued efforts towards innovative launches.


Ashok LeylandWe believe Ashok Leyland stands to benefit from the upcycle in the commercial vehicle industry given its strong position in the M&HCV and LCV segment. Further, implementation of BS-VI emissions norms from April 2020 would also lead to pre-purchases in H2FY20. Further, the proposed implementation of CV scrappage policy reduces concerns of volume growth post FY20 as it is likely to create an additional demand of ~2-2.5 lakh vehicles. We believe with positive industry growth prospects and Ashok Leyland’s strong brand presence in the CV segment and its focus on diversifying to less cyclical businesses makes it one of our preferred picks.


Godrej Consumer
Led by demand uptick and company led initiatives towards constant focus on product innovation, increasing penetration & distribution reach and sustained brand building efforts, we estimate GCPL’s consolidated Revenue and PAT to grow by 12.8 per cent & 16.8 per cent CAGR respectively over FY18-20E. Improving mix and cost efficiency measures should result in steady margin gains. Strong brand equity, low leverage, robust cash flows and healthy dividend pay-outs justify premium valuation. We recommend a Buy on the stock with target price of Rs 897."
17,2018-10-31,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Consumption, often touted as the biggest investment theme in the domestic market, has let investors and fund managers down this festive season.

There are clear signs of a slowdown in consumer demand, both in urban and rural India, and fewer investors are buying this theme on Dalal Street.


What went wrong?The premise for consumption as a preferred investment theme was based on hopes that rural demand would jump after MSP hikes, farm loan waivers and election-related spending in the runup to the 2019 general elections. But southwest monsoon ended up below normal this year, affecting farm output and food prices have remained sluggish, hurting farmer incomes.

Some analysts say MSP hikes are unlikely to aid demand due to poor procurement and infrastructure facilities. Among sectors , FMCG players are yet to pass on the recent hike in input costs. Their volumes might have peaked. 

Urban demand for consumer durables and automobile has slowdown down as many consumer-focused NBFCs are facing liquidity issues. Recent interest rate hikes and inflationary concerns due to rising crude oil prices have also dented outlook for consumption plays.


Data confirms slowdownNomura’s proprietary heat-map of high-frequency data is confirming early signs of a demand slowdown. The moderation is spearheaded by consumption – both rural and urban, the brokerage said.

“Traditional bellwethers of rural consumption – two-wheeler and tractor sales – have moderated to 5 per cent YoY in Q3 from 16-25 per cent in Q2. Higher fuel prices are also starting to bite urban demand – September witnessed a 3.6 per cent YoY contraction in passenger vehicle sales,” the brokerage said.


Q2 numbers & margin risksConsumer-linked firms have so far reported mixed numbers for September quarter. While Hindustan Unilever and ITC managed to meet Street expectations, Asian Paints disappointed the Street on the margin front. Risks on margins are elevated given the rising input cost dynamics, Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.

Data showed sectors such as consumer discretionary and consumer staples have seen a cut in FY19 price multiples. Consumer staples commands the highest valuation at over 40 times despite the expected price-to-earnings multiple for 2019 contracting 15 per cent since August 28. 


Unhealthy returnsAmong the consumption-linked equity indices, BSE Auto index has lost one-fourth of its 25 per cent of market value this calendar. The BSE consumer durables index is flat, while the FMCG index has delivered 6 per cent return since last Diwali.

Among mutual fund schemes, Sundaram Rural and Consumption Fund, which managed Rs 2,400 crore assets, has seen its NAV drop 12 per cent in last one year, compared with a 4.55 per cent fall its benchmark NIFTY 500 TRI. ITC, M&M, HUL, UPL and Britannia Industries were some of its biggest holdings of the fund as of September 30.

“Rising interest rates, short term issues on the liquidity front for NBFCs and rising cost of fuel were recent issues which could’ve had a toll on near-term demand viz., in discretionary segments such as auto. Oil inflation which flows into raw material cost of companies using the downstream products, could create pressure on profitability margins in the near term. Historically, consumer companies have demonstrated the ability to pass-on material cost inflation with a lag,” Sundaram Mutual Fund said in a written reply to ETMarkets.com query.

The mutual fund noted that its rural and consumption universe has a larger skew towards mid and small-sized companies where valuations have softened and have now moved to their long-term averages. The volume improvement and earnings growth trends across consumption categories, including staples and discretionary, continue to remain healthy all along, the mutual fund noted.

Among others, Reliance Consumption Fund, Quant Consumption Fund, UTI India Lifestyle and Canara Robeco Consumer Trends, too, have offered negative returns and failed to beat their benchmarks.

Mail sent to Canara Robeco Mutual Fund did not elicit any response.

“While we are not worried about a sharp slowdown in consumption demand, tapering is likely. Rural demand may remain stable to weak. State election spending and MSP implementation won’t be effective in raising demand. Urban and semi-urban demand may be dented due to limited NBFC lending,” said Phillip Capital.

This brokerage is factoring in weaker volume growth for automobiles (two-wheeler and commercial vehicles), consumer durables and FMCG firms in the second half of the financial year.

Consumer durables volume growth is expected to remain modest for at least a year. Auto volume growth is now seen at 8-9 per cent in H2FY19 against 13-14 per cent last year. FMCG volumes are already at peak, Phillip Capital said. 


No Diwali booster this time?There are lights and discounts everywhere, but showrooms are empty, making analysts wonder whether e-commerce onslaught or lack of demand is hurting retail sales this Diwali.

“It is no fun for retailers and businesses this Diwali. The festive demand has been underwhelming. There are the usual lights and offers splashed across windows, but (without exception) crowds are sparse. There aren’t any queues and there’s little or no buzz; most retailer conversations indicates as much,” said Edelweiss Securities.

Offline retailers are hopeful of a pickup in demand over the next weekend when the most auspicious shopping day of dhanteras falls.

Edelweiss Securities noted that among various segments, luxury apparel is taking big hit while mid-market apparel is doing just about okay for offline stores. This could be due to e-commerce discounts and easy financing. 

“Car sales have been slower than that of two-wheelers. But consumer durables stores are ready to outprice e-com offers and are seeing strong sales. Most retailers are optimistic (desperately hopeful?) about the next (last) and big weekend,” the brokerage said.


Marketmen still hopefulNilesh Shetty of Quantum Mutual Fund said the festival season has not gotten off to a great start, but his meeting with companies recently versus a year ago suggests the pricing power coming back for them. 

“Demand on the ground seems to be a lot better than it was a year ago. We are somewhere close to in the early stage of a pickup in consumer demand. I am not too sure about the second half of FY19, but it looks like we are at the cusp of a pickup in consumer demand from where we were a year ago,” he told ET NOW. 

Sundaram MF said that the near-term macro-led issues is expected to be transitory and its impact on market sentiments should get mitigated as confidence on consumption growth gathers pace in the coming quarter.
“Structural factors such as increased farm mechanisation, favourable demographics, increasing income levels and working population, premiumisation within categories, should help household consumption spending in the long run. Added to this, initiatives on financial inclusion have been the fulcrum to bring large strata of rural population into mainstream finance and increase institutional credit and create long-term drivers for consumption growth,” it said."

1,2018-11-18,Britannia,"‘Unstoppable’ is the term that can be used for non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, whose shares have rallied 1,318 per cent, the most in the largecap space, in last five years.

This break-neck rally shrugged off everything, from a painful downturn in domestic equities since February 2018 to a major demand slowdown in the economy that pulled down India’s GDP growth.

With more than 20 per cent holdings by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and over 7 per cent holding of domestic mutual funds, the scrip turned out to be the apple of the eye for big investors.

There were many factors at play throughout.

Net profit of the company grew over 40 per cent annually (CAGR) during these five years, while return on equity jumped to 22.60 per cent in FY19 from 19.60 per cent in FY14.

The company’s bottom line expanded to Rs 3,995 crore for the financial year ended March 2019 from Rs 719 crore in 2013-14. JM Financial projects 54.80 per cent profit growth for Bajaj Finance in FY20 and 30.10 per cent in FY21.

Despite a challenging business environment in FY2019, Bajaj Finance signed off the year with 41 per cent growth in consolidated assets under management (AUM) and a 60 per cent expansion in consolidated profits. The company’s cost of fund increased by about 5 bps in FY2019 over FY2018.

“Bajaj Finance (BAF) has a strong risk management framework with a large client base and best practices in terms of measures in keeping strong asset quality confidence. In a declining interest rate regime, BAF has strong pricing power and is better placed to tap growth,” JM Financial said.

Of late, a couple of developments drove the share price to its all-time high of Rs 4,277 on November 6 despite a slump in India’s economic growth rate due to consumption slowdown, which has dampened demand for consumer durables also.

On October 22, Bajaj Finance posted a 63 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,506 crore for the quarter ended September 30. The figure stood at Rs 923 crore in the same period of the previous year.

Net interest income of the country’s largest consumer durables lender grew 48 per cent to Rs 3,999 crore from Rs 2,708 crore in Q2 FY19.

Meanwhile, the company raised Rs 8,500 crore by issuing over 2.17 crore equity shares at an issue price of Rs 3,900 to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Going by reports, BlackRock, Nomura, GIC of Singapore and others lapped up these shares.

Majority of analysts are still bullish on Bajaj Finance. The stock had six ‘buy’, five ‘outperform’, seven ‘Hold’, one ‘Underperform’ and one ‘sell’ ratings as of November 15, data available with Reuters showed.

Brokerage Antique Stock Broking on October 23 gave a ‘hold’ recommendation on Bajaj Finance with a price target of Rs 3,960.

“Bajaj Finance has created one-of-its-kind customer franchise and the journey keeps on getting better with newer products, newer geographies and newer delivery mechanisms. Using its size to its advantage, both on borrowing cost and cross-sell front, operating leverage benefits can continue for longer than we expect.” It said, adding that the current slowdown in the economy could have a rub-off effect on the NBFC and any major price corrections should be looked as opportunity to build long term positions.

With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 55 times, shares of the company are looking dearer against their five-year average of 38.60 times. P/E is a valuation ratio that measures the company’s current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS).

Yes Securities on October 22 gave ‘reduce’ rating to Bajaj Finance.

“In the medium-to-longer term, we expect Bajaj Finance’s AUM growth to gravitate towards 30 per cent YoY considering a large asset base and sustained deceleration in few products. The flexibility in cost structure and rising digitisation in loan origination and collection will help the company in delivering a tight cost/income ratio. Despite assuming an elevated credit cost in FY20 and FY21, we estimate Bajaj Finance to report 45 per cent earnings CAGR over the next two years and an average RoA and RoE of 4.5 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. Valuation is lofty at 6x FY21 P/ABV,” the brokerage said.

Following in the footsteps of subsidiary Bajaj Finance, group holding company Bajaj Finserv (up 777 per cent) stood the second-biggest gainer among the bluechips in last five years. It was followed by Britannia Industries, Biocon, Pidilite Industries, Titan and Reliance Industries which advanced 200-300 per cent between November, 2014 and November, 2019."

Britannia, which also makes dairy and bakery products, said second-quarter net sales rose 5.88% to Rs 3,022.91 crore during July-September from Rs 2,854.81 crore in the corresponding year-ago quarter.

“We know that rural is growing much slower than urban. There is pain in rural. And it’s important that gets sorted out for the overall growth to come back for every possible FMCG company,” Berry said.

The maker of Good Day and Tiger brand biscuits gets 75% of its revenue from biscuits.

“We are launching new packs but at a slower pace and getting more packs into outlets we’re already present in,” he said.

Rural growth dropped below urban levels for the first time in seven years and the FMCG sector grew 7.3% by value in July-September, down from 16.2% a year earlier, market research firm Nielsen said in a report last month. The quarterly report said while the FMCG market witnessed a resurgence in modern trade, the rural market grew only 5%, which is one-fourth of the 20% clocked in the same period last year.

“The biggest issue is the liquidity crunch in the trade, especially in wholesale channels. Disposable income is under stress, especially in rural markets, while modern trade and e-commerce are doing better,” said Marico managing director Saugata Gupta.

The maker of Parachute hair oil and Saffola edible oils said instead of introducing new products, Marico would focus on improving existing brand strengths.

“While immediate consumer sentiment continues to be weak, along with the liquidity crunch, we expect to stay invested in both innovation and go-to-market,” Gupta said.

Berry said growth was being driven by premium products as financial stress in rural markets continues.

“The mix is moving towards premium. Sales are showing that premium products are doing better than value products. Consumers seem to be cutting back but whenever they’re consuming our products or any other products in the market, they are leaning towards the premium products,” he said.


Britannia Defers Launches

Almost all consumer good companies are focusing on premium products through channels including e-commerce and modern trade to hedge against the rural slowdown, which accounts for about a third of the overall FMCG market. Hindustan Unilever, ITC and Reckitt Benckiser are among those that have rolled out premium products in the detergent, chocolate and car freshener categories, respectively.

The National Council of Applied Economic Research pegged India’s GDP growth at 4.9% for 2019-20, compared with 6.8% in 2018-19. It said India’s economy grew 5% in the first quarter of 2019-20, the slowest in over six years. “On account of the rural slowdown, we are introducing products that are affordable and accessible for rural consumers in the form of low unit price packs,” Dabur chief executive Mohit Malhotra said. The maker of Vatika shampoo and Real juices will continue to add premium products for modern trade and e-commerce, he said.

Hindustan Unilever’s chief financial officer Srinivas Phatak said on an investor call last month that the wholesale and smaller retail trade faced an acute liquidity crunch, on account of which rural markets grew far slower than the urban ones."

11,2018-11-20,Britannia,"In telecom, there is a clear signal that the regulator, the government as well as players are taking the right steps to ensure long-term viability of the sector, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What do you want to start with -- YES Bank or telecom?Both are to an extent interconnected because one is talking about a specific bank and the other is talking about banking as a system because if you look at what is happening in the telecom sector, you know that post the Supreme Court ruling on AGR dues, the financial condition of the telecom incumbents has the possibility of becoming a systemic risk. 

Then the government got in and said okay we are looking at giving a moratorium and at the end of the day, finally, the players themselves have decided that somewhere the game has to move from market share accretion to profitability in terms of operations and that freebies can’t be doled out in perpetuity. That is the reason we are seeing pricing table shifts. 

Given the fact that India has got a fairly high mobile penetration of roughly 80-85%, there might be some shakeout but not very large because by and large the market shares have now got aligned and the fact that today data has become such an important fix that everybody first renews their data plan before going and buying the monthly groceries. Data is now an essential purchase rather than a discretionary spend. Therefore 10 GB per month data consumption can plateau out a bit, but the fear of a lot of subscribers going out of the network may be slightly premature.

Also, the tariff hikes are not likely to be too large in terms of hitting the purses and even at that modest increase, people are likely to stay put because now it has become a way of life. In telecom, there is a clear signal that the regulator, government and the players are taking the right steps to ensure long-term viability of the sector, which is in turn is good for the banking system and is good for both the players as well as the consumers in the long run.

Coming to YES Bank, the new management has taken charge ad post that, they have already taken steps for guiding the market. The watch list has expanded as they have made space for contingencies. Out of that, one can say that this has got realised now to that extent that one has to wait and watch as to what treatment is being given to balance the number in that bucket. People will give it time because it is not as if it is something new, but it clearly shows that a lot of things have to be taken care of before one turns the bend.


Would you be a buyer in YES Bank if the stock falls today?For a long-term investor, anything around Rs 60-65 levels is not a bad price because the visibility as to when does the investor come and at what price he comes in is, something not a question of if, it is a question of when. Once that happens, a bank this size will definitely turn and given the fact that the kind of people who come and do the second round of fund raising and that the management is committed, over the long run, clearly there is value in the stock at these prices.


Would you be a buyer in any of the telecom stocks? If so, Bharti or Reliance?I see good tidings for the sector as price wars seem to have ended.


But would you be a buyer?If I am looking for a multibagger opportunity, Vodafone Idea probably looks better because there in case the rate of change happens, you could probably have a lot of value accretion. At Rs 16,000 crore of market cap, the problem is the net debt of about Rs 1 lakh crore and in case you talk of increasing the tariffs, the EBITDA will probably grow by almost 70%. The rate of change is not perhaps getting priced and the stock has only doubled. If the EBITDA grows 2X, the stock should technically go 4-5X.


Where is something like a Chola or a Sundaram headed?The NBFC crisis took centre-stage about the same time last year. Now what has happened is that because the other guys have actually vacated the space, it is the large companies that have gained market share by virtue of this balance sheet strength. Their cost of funds has improved. So, today they are in a sweet spot whereby they have gained market share and as cost of fund has improved, spreads look better and their earnings delivery is far better than what the market had expected. 

Now if you roll forward another quarter, the base effect will likely catch up. As a sector, some amount of growth should be visible when you look at the December or March quarter earnings purely because of the base effect. The government has also started putting in a lot of money in the system. So, hopefully the velocity will pick up over the next couple of quarters and after the kharif harvest hits the market in Jan-Feb, some sort of consumer spending should get kick-started. 

Actually it shows that you could be in a situation whereby from here, the return ratios could improve for the large guys. There is an article 227 about the regulator taking it to NCLT, there is also a function that Rs 500 crore in plus AUM can be referred. The resolution process is also now beginning to take shape. These are conference boosters, but having said that, the valuations do not give some sort of comfort for fresh entry. People who are holding will continue to hold because the earnings are good and the outlook is not all that bad.

But will I make a fresh purchase here? I do not know. Whatever incremental flows are coming in, people are wanting to remain invested in these pockets because right now, they give you a sustainable and predictable growth. 


Suffice to say that the big pain for motown is behind us. That is what the stock prices also seem to be reflecting.As of now, the stock prices have reacted and the numbers have still not shown and therefore it will be a difficult case to say whether it has actually played out because our leading two-wheeler manufacturer was very buoyant about the festival season but last week itself he came and said that November is not all that good. 

Now, last year Diwali was in November whereas this year we had it in October. So adjusting for the base, the inventory definitely is coming down. But is it at a level where at the first sign of revival in demand, you will restock adequately so as to give you a fillip in the revenue line? One does not know because if you look at the 2008-09 example, there was a very clear and a very rapid U-turn . At that time, the inventories in the system had got completely cleaned and at the first sign of any change in demand, everybody just ran to restock inventory. This time, it is different for different players in the motown. 


I do not think there should be any fundamental reason for PSU stocks to go up further from here just on account of the cabinet clearance.-Sameer Narayan

In passenger cars perhaps, it is not all that great, whereas in two-wheelers, maybe it has got cleaned out quite a bit. The market has to make a decision as to where the level of demand will first start going in because we had the data of new registrations coming in for October. Passenger vehicles have already shown the base effect. They have already started showing 1% or 2% growth YoY, but the CVs and the two wheelers are still in fairly decent negative territory.


Britannia is saying they are expecting revival only in 9 to 12 months, contrary to what we are seeing on the index. What are you making of the latest comments?Well markets always move ahead of the actual earnings. I think this is some sort of a confirmation that earnings should turn the bend from here. The challenge is that the September quarter earnings have two clear trends; first, if you knock off the tax impact of the lower corporate tax cut, not much of earnings have performed below expectations and on the revenue line, there is a far bigger disappointment than what was earlier envisaged, given the fact that the expectations were low anyway. 

These are two very clear indicators that the worst perhaps should be behind us. But there is a hope that from here, in case the liquidity in the system starts to show its impact, you should see revival down the line. Whether it is one quarter, two quarters or three quarters, the verdict is still out. Today a very clear signal of consumption demand coming back is not visible. There is no credit offtake. Those are the factors which are still to be grappled with in terms of where the market is headed relative to valuations.


The cabinet is probably meeting today to decide on disinvestment. But these stocks have already run up in anticipation of something coming in -- be it a Concor, BEL or BPCLIs there an opportunity to buy into these names?There is still a bit of time left for the divestment process to get cleared by the cabinet followed by firms getting divested and the money coming in to impact fiscal revenues, etc. I do not think there should be any fundamental reason for these stocks to go up further from here just on account of the cabinet clearance. Since the time these names were put in the public domain, the stocks have already reacted. So from here onwards, it is just a confirmation that yes the intent is clear.

The larger thing is that when FM has said they do not intend shifting the fiscal target for this financial year which means that hopefully they have plans to ensure that some amount of stake sale or ensure monetisation. One would need to see as to how the execution of that intent takes place rather than just the fact that the Cabinet has cleared the proposals."

Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15.

18,2018-11-26,Britannia,"Foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Some corrections cannot be ruled out because valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, stay with good quality stocks, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.



Whether you call this a Santa rally or picking up from where we left off, we took maybe two to three weeks off in the middle. Now it looks like market momentum is intact. What are you making of it?I stay selective in my investment portfolio. I do agree that the current rally is largely propelled by the liquidity coming in from the global side and that too in select few stocks, where they matter most as far as the index is concerned. It is not across the board. Though definitely one would argue that in the respective sectors, selective stocks have started performing well in this particular rally, it is a good sign that it is merit driven. 

Now whether it will come off in a hurry, I do not know. My reading says that we are heading for relatively better times. Everybody wants to look forward to US and India signing some kind of trade treaty, wherein Indian exports would start looking up. That could signal probably a larger level of interest as far as the global investors are concerned into our market.

I guess the foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Maybe some corrections cannot be ruled out because the valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, my recommendation would be to stay with good quality stocks and corrective downside should be bought into in building the portfolio henceforth. We remain relatively confident about the market momentum on the upside for next year. Our bet would be on quality stocks.


What has been your big acquisition in October-November, where have you added a substantial amount of weight to your portfolio?We saw some amount of downside in HDFC and that gives us relatively more confidence to buy further into the stock. The company has a housing loan book which is probably one of the best in the industry. At the same time, the investments into the listed companies within the group including the bank AMC, the life insurance companies and also some of the yet to monetise businesses like Ergo are there. 

Among them, a few NBFCs from education companies, particularly NBFC side is among the themes which we picked up. We felt that this is one area where we could remain relatively safe in adding into the portfolio. We continue to add more weight into Reliance largely because we believe that consumer facing businesses -- Jio and retail would eventually get monetised. That is where unlocking of the valuation would take place and the benefit would go to the investors and shareholders. 

These are the areas where we have stayed focussed. We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them. We feel the larger ones would become bigger and they are going to create much bigger opportunity going forward. That is the theme that we are following currently.


It is a print of new all-time high on the Nifty. The global markets are also at an all-time high, as are we. Is it the start and the end of the story that there is nothing special about India? Last one month NASDAQ is up 4%, we are also 4% up. Should we stop complaining about the slowdown?Globally, few things are probably propelling this rally in equity. One of them is definitely the important aspect that the rate of interest is historically low in most of the countries. 


We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them.-Deven R Choksey
As a result, the funds had shifted to long-term asset growth like equity. That is one definite allocation perspective that one brings in. The second most important perspective that one brings in is that America and China are settling the trade row and as a result, prospects are brightening.

2020 is being seen as a year wherein we are likely to see relatively stable trade as a result of which, investors once again come back to the market with higher allocation of funds. Coming to India, in October and November, we have been seeing a good flow of money from FIIs. That is also propelling this particularly rally. 

From the indices’ perspective per se, some of the larger weight stocks are basically driving this rally. Reliance is one among them. Even a telecom company like Bharti Airtel is among them. At the same time, the HDFC and Bajaj twins are basically driving the markets and the indices up. The overweight of some of these stocks is basically driving the indices up. Overall, the midcaps and smallcap are still languishing. In select stocks, we have been seeing the buying coming from select corners but otherwise, markets are looking relatively stable. 


Yesterday we broke the story on government considering one-time rollover of debts. . Do you think a move like this could help ease the problems for the real estate space?It is a very positive move on structural side. This is where you are likely to see stress. Real assets are getting the breathing space and more money would come in to buy some of the properties which these realty companies particularly have been nurturing for some time. My reading says that if this activity gains momentum, probably we would be seeing a very strong emergence of paper use model and that is going to probably revive the real estate market.

Currently, real estate businesses are becoming prohibitively expensive for consumer and that is where the financers’ role is going to be very important. With the kind of structured vehicle that the government has built, it is going to have the potential of inviting more money into the system, particularly from the global side. We remain relatively confident about it. I do not know which company would get immediate benefits, but strong companies with good properties would probably have a better outlook to talk about going forward. 


You mentioned Reliance and of course that has been in focus. Let us also take a look at the telecom angle at some of the other teleco names, Bharti in particular. We have been going through some trends and the kind of move that it has made, is really standing out. What is your perspective on Bharti?The moratorium on AGR is going to help Bharti along with the other companies in the telecom sector. So, that creates a breathing space. At the same time, tariff is going up from 1st December. That is likely to spell out good news as far as the working of the company is concerned. 

If I am right, we could possibly see around 20-25% increase in the tariff. You could see a similar contribution coming into the EBITDA of the company. I think these are two positive news that I see. Alongside, there is one challenge and that is a challenge of putting in the 5G related bandwidth and the infrastructure in the business. So, that will need more capital and so capital infusion will have to take place. That is one challenge which one will have to look out for.

Otherwise, in current times, the stock probably he has been experiencing buying also because of the fact that I think in last few years telecom story was sounded negative now I think it is slightly stable comparatively so that is why I think you are seeing the Bharti going up. I do not think that I think the company’s financial ratios would change big time from here. They continue to operate in the single digit of ROC. That will not be changing beyond a point, even though an increase in tariff will take place, given the kind of pressure that they would have on the expansion side.


We have often debated about whether or not quality is overpriced. Has the time now come to ease off from some of these blue chip names? Would you believe that Nestle has a problem ahead because of the slowdown in the milk market?Well not as much honestly, if I start looking at the overall composition of the market and the purchasing power therein. Most of the FMCG companies are sitting on the brilliant prospect of finding themselves in a better position because of greater purchasing power in the hands of consumers, particularly the rural ones. We are definitely expecting to see more money in the hands of people, largely because of the rollout of the projects by the government and infrastructure projects.

At the same time, the favourable monsoon and the resultant outcome on the crops would spell out better times for the rural economy. Going forward, the FMCG company and food sector in particular should be in a favourable position. Having said that on the prospect side, companies and their valuations have always been challenging. They have been quoting at a premium.

If you buy any of the FMCG companies, they have probably priced in things for next two years. You should not be expecting any return out of them. On the contrary. you should be buying these companies if you want to have them in the portfolio, by doing an SIP into this kind of stocks. You are never going to get it cheaper and at the same time at least two years of prices are discounted fully at the current price level. The same story holds true for companies like Nestle, Britannia and many other companies in the FMCG basket. These are expensive but they have better prospects going forward."
19,2018-11-27,Britannia,"Academia and business need to co-create a curriculum that will address present-day skill needs. 

Technological advancements over the years have forced organisations to rethink the integration of man and machine. Organisations are spending a lot of money retraining and re-skilling their employees for the Industrial Revolution 4.0. But most of this training to address the present-day skill needs happens once employees have already joined the company not while they’re still studying. 

Is there an easier way to build the right skillsets? Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman & Managing Director, Hindustan Unilever Limited seems to think so. 

While delivering a keynote address at the CII 9th HR National Conclave recently, Mehta spoke of how forging partnerships between academia and business could help develop and sustain high skill levels. 

The education system needs to address present-day skills needs and businesses can help by co-creating the curriculum, said Mehta. 

“I think the interface between academia and business has to go up several notches,” he said. “Business has a role to play in helping co-create the curriculum. Otherwise, we’re working in silos where the academicians create a curriculum that might be irrelevant for the industry.” 


Start them young
Another way of bridging the gap between academia and business is building a culture of apprenticeship. “In India, apprenticeship hasn’t taken off at all. This is something we need to do at a far bigger scale,” said Mehta. “If you look at Germany of Japan, one of the biggest things they’ve done is (introduce) the culture of apprenticeship.” 

“(In an apprenticeship system) Young people begin working in an industry at a very young age, not just to earn pocket money but to understand what they need to learn (in order) to create a career for themselves.” 


Re-Inventing the Game
“My personal belief is that the best of Europe is behind them but the U.S. keeps reinventing itself. And one of the reasons why the U.S. keeps reinventing itself is because of its innovation ecosystem. In their innovation ecosystem, the corporation the academic institutions and the research institutions all come together. That’s how the best of innovation and the best of talent still works in the U.S.”

Pillai, who was a stakeholder in Britannia Industries, was charged by Singapore’s Commercial Affairs Department on 22 counts of fraud and breach of trust. He had taken a $17.2 million debt, which he was unable to service. Despite claiming to own Britannia, he owned just 3 per cent of its shares, with the rest managed through a complex web of interlinked companies. Pillai fl ed Singapore for his ancestral home in Kerala, obtaining bail against his extradition, following an Interpol red alert. However, his decision to travel to Delhi did not prove fortuitous.

Traders are advised to trade with a negative bias as the upside is pegged at 10,941 levels whereas the downside target comes to 10,050 levels, hence the risk to reward ratio is more than 1:2 on the short side, according to technical analysts. They have identified Colgate-Palmolive, Marico, Britannia, PTC, Zee Entertainment and GSFC, which have an upside potential of 15-20% over the next few months


Where we are: While the November expiry week ended on a promising note, the market participants were completely baffled with the market moves in the week gone by. The earlier breakout zone of 10,770-10,800 was expected to act as a support on the pullback moves, but a plunge in the global markets kept caught market participants on the wrong foot as index breached this range with a downside gap.


What is in store: Five state election results on Tuesday and the verdict of the Brexit deal are likely to have a significant impact on our markets as well and hence, this could well be the week, which would determine the short- to medium-term trend for our markets. As far as levels are concerned, major supports are seen at 10588-10489 and a breach of this could result into a sharp correction. On the flipside, the recent high of 10890–10940 is the resistance end which if breached, would lead to strong up move.

What could investors do: Amongst the sectoral indices, the Nifty Bank index rebounded higher from its support zone in Friday’s session. In case the market moves higher in the coming week, then the Nity Bank could be the outperforming index. At this juncture, we like ‘Dmart’ which has clearly been bucking the trend. One can look to go long for a target of Rs 1,710 and stop loss at Rs 1,397. Britannia looks promising for some immediate upside of Rs 3,280 and stop loss at Rs 2,880. From the midcap space, ‘Sun TV’ formed a Dragonfly Doji pattern, which could give a decent move towards Rs 640 and stop at Rs 568. All these should be considered if there is no unfavourable outcome during the week.

Where we are: Nifty, after the pervious month’s advance, witnessed some profit booking last week as it faced crucial hurdles around the 10,850-10,900 zone. The short-term trend remains bullish as long as the index holds the 10,550-10,500 level which also coincides with the November lows. The recent decline looks corrective in nature and is likely to hold its support levels. Bank Nifty is likely to consolidate its gains and indicates strong support clusters round the 26,000-25,900 levels on the downside which likely to provide cushion in case of a decline.


What is in Store: Nifty indicates range bound action around the 10,500-10,850 levels before any bullish trending move. The oscillators have declined from its overbought zone and any fresh bullish crossover will witness momentum once index exceeds 10,750 levels for higher targets towards the 10,950 and 11,200. Bank Nifty has tested its key long term averages and needs to close above 26,750 levels for any bullish breakout. Expect defensive sectors to outperform and traders can expect a short-term momentum play from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Glenmark, Dabur and Colgate-Palmolive.


What could investors do: The FMCG sector has shown relative outperformance and we continue to maintain our long term bullish view. Colgate-Palmolive, Marico & Britannia are our top picks from this segment and we expect an upside potential of 10-15 per cent. PTC India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and GSFC are stocks that can be bought for an upside potential of 15-20 per cent for next few months.

8,2018-12-14,Britannia,"This is the time to have a buy-on-dips kind of strategy rather than booking profits, Yogesh Mehta, V-P, Motilal 
   
   Oswal Financial Services Ltd, tells ET Now. Mehta is betting on RBL Bank, M&M Financial and Exide Industries. Edited excerpts:

What are you advising clients as we close out the year or step towards the end of 2018? Is it time to book some profits on the gains made and just stay a bit cautious?
We have not seen any kind of return so far till last week-end and we have seen a good run-up of almost 500 points from the lower end of the Nifty to 10,850. It seems that people are still struggling to make money this year. Rather, they are fortunate if they have not lost money. So, there is no question of booking profit but all the events have already been over and there is no further event in near vicinity, which is fortunate. However, any unforeseen event may come up in future. 

We would suggest that it is time to have a buy on dips kind of strategy rather than booking profits from here on. My 2018-end advice will not be that you should book profit right now because we still believe that the story has unfolded and the new RBI governor who has taken charge and a lot many things to get unwound and maybe NBFC sector and the PSU banks will remain in the limelight. Largecaps have done very well and we can book profits there. The midcaps valuations are still at 11% premium to the largecap valuations. One can take positions for next three, four, six months in midcaps and smallcaps where quality and earnings are visible. 


What do you have on your radar?
Selective PSU banks can be looked at. In the auto sector, where the MSP hike and the rural consumption story is picking up more and more and recently the Assembly election results are out with the Congress Party winning three states. The auto stocks including the two- wheeler stocks, the four-wheelers and commercial vehicles, all will have good days ahead and there could be a momentum and strong traction can be seen. 

Further, among NBFCs, auto or two-wheeler finance companies can also see better days from here. In the next RBI policy, I expect a rate cut because the inflation rate has been around 17- month lows and we can see some further picking up in the NBFCs book.


Some of these auto names have corrected significantly. Maruti is way off the Rs 10,000 level. The two-wheeler names are a little more resilient compared to the rest of the auto pack. Sales have been declining. What would be your strategy when it comes to autos?
In the auto space, Maruti has corrected and now the management has highlighted that they are going to have a higher single digit growth. But we do not have any option. Maruti has 50% to 53% market share in the auto segment as the new launches that will drive growth momentum from here on. In the two-wheeler category, we like Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra. It is the cheapest available stock. With MSP and the rural consumption rising, if one has to play on rural India, then this is the best stock available right now. So, M&M is also the preferred stock with us in our coverage baskets.


How much of a worry will the China factor be for you because it is now posting weakness in its frequent macroeconomic indicators. If its PMI does come below 50, that will be a big, big negative. Could that make them a little more desperate for a trade deal with US?
Yes, that could be a possibility there. They are at the slowest pace of the growth as of now and if the trade war with US intensifies, that will dampen some sentiment further. In other words, it will be good for opportunity for India because if there is a slowdown we should not have any worry cause of Indian growth. We are maintaining our pace of around 7-7.5% for next two, three, four years and that will be much better for us as the growth will be very consistent. 

China has slowed down from 10, 9, 8, 7 and is now near 6%. The downside risk is now limited for their growth but we believe that it should be an opportunity for India to have a more export dominated market share for them so in that context, it is advantage to India.


What are your top or three midcap ideas?
For midcaps, in the banking space, we like RBL Bank with its strong growth trajectory. The management commentary in every quarter have said that they would be growing their loan book 30-35% as also growth rate. We believe a strong momentum can be built over the banking sector for next two-three years and this is a company which has got high trajectory for growth. We are recommending a buy on RBL Bank.

Another stock is M&M Financial which has gone up by 15-17% in this week. Here again, we are recommending a buy with the rural consumption stories inching up. The credit cost is now in favour for the company and asset quality is also improving with the collection is going higher and higher. 

It has Rs 157-160 book value for FY20 and it is quoting at around 2.75 to 2.8 times price to book so that there are bright chances that it can inch up further from here. 

Another pick on the midcap side could be Exide Industries. They are equipped to take advantage of the transition to electric vehicles. With new capacity coming in, Exide is a story where one can look at with at least one-two years down the line scenario.


You said a rural theme will play out and there could be populist measures targeted towards rural areas. Which sectors do you think would benefit because of this apart from the two-wheeler space in the auto sector?
An NBFC which is the rural centric is Mahindra & Mahindra Finance and maybe L&T Finance company. These would be a beneficiaries of a rural push. In turn, the consumption story remains very high for rural India which we are betting on for next three, five, seven years. 

On the consumption side, Dabur, Hindustan Unilever or Britannia can benefit further from here. However, valuation concerns will always remain there for all these consumption companies. They have never been available for less than 40-45 times PE multiples, Their ROE and ROCE both are at a very good spot there and the volume growth is increasing. It is a high trajectory or the growth they are showing right now with upper side of double digit and that will drive further volume growth. They will have better trajectory on the growth side for consumption sector companies. 


What is your view on OMCs?
OMCs are quite unpredictable though at around $60 per barrel oil price, they look attractive. But then again on the capex and other stuff, it seems to be too difficult for them to come back to normal profits. Again, with mergers and buybacks and whatever is happening in the sector, it is beyond understanding and we believe that trajectory for oil marketing companies do not leave much return expectations for the investors. If crude again moves up to $70-80 per barrel, then subsidy regime may come back which has come in two months back. It is too difficult to predict anything and it is better if we avoid OMCs as of now and we have a neutral rating on all the three OMC companies."

13,2018-12-26,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Asian markets have become a hostage to the US political drama and India has been no exception. Many of the global markets have entered bear phase, which is getting rubbed off on domestic equities.

On NSE alone, 89 stocks are sending out weak signals on the daily charts, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The benchmark Nifty50 has slipped 4 per cent in four sessions, but analysts see more pain ahead. 

The technical indicator has signalled a downward crossover, meaning a bearish signal, on these 89 counters on NSE, hinting at possible downsides. Many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

The list includes private lenders ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and RBL Bank, pharma stocks Wockhardt, Biocon and Strides Pharma, FMCG firms Jubilant FoodWorks, Britannia Industries and Radico Khaitan and auto and auto-related stocks Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto and CEAT.

ICICI Securities, PVR, Eros International, Purvankara, Heidelberg Cement, Minda Industries, Quess Corp, Apollo Micro Systems, Bombay Burmah, Future Lifestyle and Whirlpool of India are some of the other stocks on the list.

MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 12 stocks have showed bullish crossover on the daily charts. They included Ruchi Soya Industries, Manpasand Beverages, PI Industries, La Opala RG, GE Power India and Igarashi Motors.


Others
The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call based on it alone, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As far as Nifty50 is concerned, the moving averages have thrice seen crisscross actions this month. “This is extremely rare and only tells us that the bulls and bears are pitted equally against each other,” JM Financial said in a note.

Most global equity markets remain in a strong downtrend but are approaching important stopover supports. Overall, with not-so-great cues on the charts, the bears are looking to take the momentum forward, the brokerage said.

Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, has maintained bearish outlook on the index for the short term with a price target of 10,005. He sees a reversal at 11,140 level.

15,2018-12-28,Britannia,"IT pack may remain subdued in 2019, Yogesh Mehta, V-P, Motilal Oswal Financial Services told ET Now in an interview.

Edited Excerpts: 

ET Now: When do you see a material recovery coming in in the real economy data points?
Yogesh Mehta: The data points are all showing a very tepid kind of growth and particularly in auto and cement realisations.

Overall, it seems that some of the sectors are still not out of the woods from the GST. So they will take some more time, maybe next three-four quarters to turn up, but on auto numbers side, it seems that post this MSP hikes and the farm loan waiver, the rural segment should do well. So that should impact further positive for auto and probably one or two months down the line we may see again further uptake into the sales volume.

As far as events are lined up, so uncertainty will remain there throughout 2019, or at least for the first half, but if we speak about January, then Q3 earning season will start. The Q2 was the first indicator that corporate earnings are now turning on positive trajectory, which should continue with the low base effect of the last year, and it seems that Indian economy should show some positive respite from the pessimism of the last few quarters.


ET Now: How you would be looking at advocating some of your top ideas within the broader market, because up till now it was really about bargain hunting given the fall in midcaps and smallcaps. Would you rather say cash is preferred given the volatility you anticipate because of pre-election season?
Yogesh Mehta: As you pointed out rightly that midcaps and smallcaps are still not out of the woods, but they are available at quite reasonable or the attractive valuations.

So keeping cash would be hardly 10-15% rather than more than that. Investment theme for calendar 2019 could be PSU banks, in which government is providing recapitalisation and infusing liquidity. Asset quality is also now improving as we have seen in last two quarters, but the provisioning is yet to be seen.

So over two-three quarters we may see uptick. They are already available at deep discount and are far discounted than their book value. So there could be some uptick in PSU banks in 2019.

Moreover, post this liquidity crisis, NBFCs have corrected significantly. Now though they have bounced back smartly, yet there are select pockets available in the NBFC segment where one can look at again on the buy side from the current level, especially with the rural sector specific.

There would be a good opportunity again to look at rather than running behind all the sectors, which have already performed in 2018.

We would prefer that these are the two sectors, which are available at reasonable valuation and in midcaps there are many stocks which are available individual rather than sector specific so there could be quite a few names in Oberoi Realty or the Britannia of the world or the PVR which is on media side. So these are quite a few names which can be looked at in 2019. 


ET Now: Despite the fact that the returns have been low single digits, Reliance Industries has been one of the relative outperformers for 2018. What does that tell you about the story for Reliance into 2019?
Yogesh Mehta: For Reliance, transformation towards telecom from oil & gas will drive growth in 2019. Jio’s equity value is at present about Rs 260 approximately, which can move up to Rs 280-290 in next three-four quarters.

Oil and gas again on the gas pricing and the crude oil prices which have gone down so probably that will give positivity. The margin can see more uptick and that will give better profitability.

Of course Reliance is growing by 22-25% growth rate year on year for last so many quarters so that will again give a good booster to the company, and probably downside risk is quite limited, and probably 2019 could be the year it can give a good decent returns for investors.


ET Now: What is it that you are feeling about IT? It has been a steady performer, the biggest outperformer sectorally in 2018. Do you sense that the optimism is in the price or do you think 2019 could also see the currency benefit and the US growth continuing to boost IT performance?
Yogesh Mehta: Now 2019 seems to be a bit challenging from the high base effect of the performance of the 2018 and rupee tailwind is not in the near term vicinity at least for next two quarters. So the growth rate will be 2.5-3% on the dollar terms and profitability growth can be in the range of 8% to 12%.

So we believe largecap IT stocks could see a mixed trend. Infosys and TCS can do better along wth a few midcap names, but largely it seems that the outperformance for the next year IT can remain subdued."
16,2018-12-29,Britannia,"The fast-moving consumer goods stocks could be re-rated over the next few months as falling input costs and rising demand pans out well for their margins, according to analysts at Jefferies.

However, given stretched valuations amidst steady demand trends, the brokerage remains cautious with select buys such as ITC, Dabur, Nestle, Asian Paints and Jubilant Foods in the sector.

After an increase in raw material prices over the past few months, input prices of both food and non-food items have corrected. In the backdrop of price increases in the past 4-5 months, the correction is good for the margins of FMCG companies, said the brokerage.

Jefferies raw material basket was down by 3.2% over a month, led by 2.5% month-onmonth dip in food-based raw materials and 4.7% MoM drop in non-food based raw materials. Correction in input prices was led by non-food based items as crude oil prices corrected 22% MoM, LAB prices used for detergents dipped 11% MoM, mentha was down 8% MoM, and palm oil corrected further by 13% MoM. Among food-based raw materials, coffee prices corrected by 14%, rice bran by 7%, and sugar by 6%.

Jefferies found risk-reward less compelling for HUL, Britannia and Godrej Consumer, given their very rich valuations. Its preference is more for ‘potential turnaround’ set of companies on improving fundamentals going into FY19 such as ITC, Dabur and Nestle. Jefferies still remains on the sidelines and less convinced with risk-reward on Marico, Emami, Colgate and UNSP. Within discretionary space, Jefferies likes Asian Paints and Jubilant Foods.

Jefferies checks suggest that promotional intensity remains rational across all key categories which is also a function of a rise in input prices in the past few months."
17,2018-12-29,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Less than 20 per cent of Nifty500 stocks are today trading below their 200-day moving averages. The market breadth suggests extreme bearishness. Is there too much of pessimism at play in the market?

Given that the coming year is going to be the election year, volatility is a given. The secondary market has turned cautious, and primary market activity has all but halted.

But historically, election years aren’t bad for the market, especially after the dust has settled post poll outcome. 

This was proven in last three elections. Cyclicals and select defensive plays were the leaders in all those years, giving returns in excess of 20 per cent.

Will 2019 exhibit a similar trend?

“Anxiety around key events (domestic or international) has always triggered market volatility in the past. However, markets always steer clear of them once such anxieties settle down, irrespective of the outcome,” said ICICI Securities.

In the last three election years, Nifty50 as well as the broader Nifty500 generated returns in excess of 11 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively. Both the indices delivered strong 27 per cent and 33 per cent returns, respectively, seven months after the elections.

“The message is clear; shrug off the nervousness and embrace equities,” the domestic brokerage said.

Even in the long term, government structure has hardly had any impact, either on stock performance or on economic growth.

Brokerage Elara Capital says despite an extremely weak coalition in the 2004 Lok Sabha, Nifty actually jumped 114 per cent during 2004-09. “We have had a very strong government in 2014-2018, but Nifty returned just 46 per cent so far,” it said.

Despite a fractured mandate in the 2004 Lok Sabha election, the Indian economy grew at a five-year average (2004-09) of 8.7 per cent. “Currently, despite the BJP having an absolute majority, the economy is growing at 7.3 per cent. Hence in the worst-case scenario, even if the BJP forms government with outside support (Biju Janta Dal, AIADMK, DMK, NCP), it may not have any material impact on economic growth,” Elara said.


Technical charts telling a story

ICICI Securities said 69 per cent of Nifty50 constituents have bullish overtone, as suggested by technical charts.

Others
The low percentage (below 20 per cent) of stocks above 200-DMAs has in the past coincided with market bottoms, be it 2004, 2008 or 2014. This year as well, the indicator is hovering around the oversold territory ahead of the general election.

In addition, net advance-decline ratio at minus 400 (for Nifty500) signifies that market sentiment is at its bearish extreme, which offers favourable entry points, ICICI Securities said.

Others

Others
History suggests cyclicals such as auto and auto components, banking and financials, capital goods, cement and construction stocks have done well in an election year (post the outcome), as have shares of defensive plays such as consumer discretionary and IT. 

Axis Bank, Britannia Industries, Voltas, Abbott India, TVS Motor, JSW Energy and Aditya Birla Fashion are some of the top picks of ICICI Securities for this election years."
18,2018-12-31,Britannia,"There is no need to go down the quality curve and while value hunting, be selective, Dipen Sheth, head, institutional research, HDFC Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


Between heartening surges and heart-stopping plunges, 2018 has been a very volatile year. What do you think the important trends of 2018 will indicate for what could have happen in 2019?
2018 has been a very challenging year for investors if we look at the broader market. The Nifty has gained 3-4% over the year but it has been highly volatile during the year. We have seen a peak of something like a plus 13-14% return from the point we started. We have plunged down to close to 10,000 in September-October. 

We have had a couple of fundamental events on the political front as well as on the business front with the NBFC crisis spilling over. So after the 29-30% gain over 2017 which I would say was a free ride, maybe this is not such a bad outcome and we need to take solace from that. Again this is only if you look at the headline index which is Nifty. But in the broader market, there has been a veritable carnage. If I am not mistaken, there is a recent study which says that this cue has only gotten worse across 2018 and what was costly has become even costlier on a relative basis as we moved across the year. 

Maybe finally, we are at a stage where some value hunting is called for. That is perhaps the mindset with which we need to approach 2019. It does not mean that we go down the quality curve. 

Of course, the argument is that quality is very costly almost everywhere but that may not necessarily be the case. The set-up for 2019 looks to me like a call for hidden quality or turnarounds in cheaper stocks where a performance turnaround can be betted on and where you can make a case for a re-rating. Maybe that is the way to look at markets here. I do not think there is very big money to be made in some of the costlier stocks. While we might have buys on many of them as a broking house, but just look at the numbers -- Lever at about 52X on F20, Titan at 31X, Havells at 39X, Britannia at 51X, Kotak at four times price to adjusted book net of subs despite the recent crack in the stock. 

I do feel there is a value trade coming up but one needs to be very selective. 


I completely agree with you that in stock market, you have to buy gold at the price of silver and right now if you are buying some of these quality stocks, you are buying diamond at the price of gold. But we have argued this in 2017, in 2016 and even in 2015..
It is not that I am asking you to go down the quality curve here. All I am saying is there are lots of stories that deserve higher multiples or will soon deserve higher multiples if some investment thesis that brokers like us or researchers like us are betting on, If these events do play out, then there is certainly a case for re-rating. What happens is that when you go through an earnings or a margin expansion, and it is backed by a multiple or a valuation change, then you get the double whammy of a very sweet ride up and that is the way to really make the big alpha in this market. It does not mean that I do not like the great companies going at high valuations. For example, TCS continues to be one of our top picks. We changed our mind late on that one but we said well better late than never and despite the stupendous run that TCS has posted, it is good for another decent run here on.


You had said ITC is the cheapest among the FMCGs but could this be the go-to story amongst the Nifty 50 names aside of TCS that you just highlighted? 
Yes and there are several reasons for this conviction or belief. Frankly, the story has not changed much. ITC is the cheapest stock in the FMCG/CND or consumer nondurables universe. It has been punished for being in a sin industry like cigarettes is par for the course. But it has been punished unfairly, The kind of discount at which it is trading to Lever or Britannia or a Colgate for that matter, is simply uncalled for. 

We are at something like 40-45%, 50% kind of discount, 50% discount if memory serves me right. Maybe that is a little too much that is one bit. The other bit is that you could give it this discount when it was going through a sluggish phase in the business. Even if not in terms of earnings, then at least in terms of volume growth which is how people look at consumer non-durable companies. 

Some of that is changing. After a six-year volume de-growth cycle for the last two quarters, we have actually seen volumes coming back in the low to mid single digits at ITC and that should get the pessimists to my side. The tax oppression cycle which was at play, actually drove down the volumes. I guess that cycle is coming to an end now with GST and there is a visible way forward for the next four or five years on how tax will be imposed on ITC. 

Of course, it is not beyond the capability of any government to get back to tax oppression. But it is a little unlikely. Also, there is non-cigarette business of ITC. ITC has a close to $2-billion FMCG/foods business and we are just at about 2% or so margins there. The critical mass has long been crossed and it is time ITC delivered on that front. The hotels business which has not really done too well in the past is poised for a very strong cyclical turnaround. It is all coming together for ITC right now and at a headline valuation of something like 24X or so on F20 numbers, there is nothing to lose in the stock. As you move into 2019, you encounter global uncertainty. This can be a very good place to hide.


In your latest note I see an interesting name, PNV Infratech. What interests you about this story?
It is at the other end of the risk-reward spectrum. Infra stocks have been mercilessly beaten down over the last three or four, five months or so. Many of them were of course, trading at unfair multiples of 18 and 20X. We have seen the large names going down to less than half their peak prices. And there is some justification for a derating of multiples in the infra space but remember, this infra cycle in India is unlikely to be broken materially by any government that comes to power, not just this government or a coalition version of this government.

One, all the political dispensations in the country have figured out that spending on infrastructure has electoral benefits. Two, companies like PNC Infratech in specific are sitting something like 7X, 8X book to bill ratios. They are not consuming capital like it used to happen in the earlier infra cycles. Some of these companies are very well managed and PNC, KNR of course, comes to mind in this regard, but PNC also falls into a category where capital consumption trails growth and in fact ROCs are maintained and cash flows are relatively cleaner compared to what they were in the last infra cycle. 

If you take away the value of its infra assets, the stock is available for some 7X or so on FY20 basis on core earnings. The money that it requires to fund its HAM products will really drive its top line because it is the HAM projects which will result into much of the standalone revenues. The Rs 500 crore-odd that it needs to invest into its HAM projects is going to probably get freed up on its balance sheet through strategic sale of its current infra asset portfolio. 

The visibility, the confidence on execution, the fact that PNC is now moving beyond UP in a big way also and that 8X book to bill execution strength, revenues having reached some kind of a bottom in terms of year-on-year growth in the second quarter, bodes very well for PNC Infratech. 

The headline risk is if a new political dispensation comes in and there is a little bit of victimisation, the company may go nowhere but that is why I said it is at the end of the spectrum in terms of a risk reward ratio. Our target price for PNC Infratech is as high as Rs 270.


Can you just take us through the rationale of this one and would you pick out some of the other names within the sector as a whole?
Sometimes, when you have a sector which has got multi-year growth and penetration potential and you have a clearly established sector leader, you do not have to think too hard. Multiples may not look very exciting and I remember the time when Lever used to trade at 40X people were saying how it has delivered all that it could have delivered and here we are at 51X! 

Voltas is going to go through that phase. Remember that Lever is actually in a highly penetrated category. Much of its product categories -- whether it is personal products or soaps and detergents and so on within the FMCG portfolio are reasonably well penetrated in the country.

If you look at air-conditioning market, the room AC market is still in mid to high single digits in this country and obviously it is a discretionary spend for Indian households and offices.

It is a spend that is going to become increasingly the norm as we move forward over the next 10 and maybe even 20 years. Some of that will obviously flow through to Voltas as it is the clear category leader and the brand leader. It has got 15,000 touch points and is the best positioned to benefit from the secular trend of Indians aspiring for more comfort in their day-to-day lives whether at home or in the office. 

It has got very high core return rations of something like 45% ROIC and very clean cash flows, a brand leader, consistently gaining market share well above 20%. The tieup with Beko will again get other categories in the product mix think we are not afraid to assign something like a 35X to its core air-conditioning business to suggest that this should be a permanent part of any long-term portfolio in the country.


There are two serious underperformers this year -- Tata Motors and Infosys. Which one will make a comeback?
The fundamental strength in the business model is much more visible right now at Infosys as it does not have to grapple with an existential crisis anymore. Both companies have gone through that. Infosys did not suffer as sharp a derating as Tata Motors for the simple reason that it is in a business which does not end up consuming capital and burning cash flows like Tata Motors or specifically the JLR part of the business at Tata Motors. 

For a long time, JLR was contributing 85-90% to the overall enterprise value for Tata Motors and therefore it was heavily levered to a discretionary consumption play which was being betted on to gain market share consistently in a highly competitive environment. Some of that came apart over a period of time. 

I do not think Infosys falls into the same category, at all. Core return ratios are well in excess of 30%. The company was cash rich. They went through a management strife but fortunately the business did not implode. The inflows of orders into the company and its execution engine which was Infosys was always famous for did not stutter or stumble and it got through this transition. 

Now it has got Mr Parekh in charge and the first few bits of news flow and developments that have come in from Infosys are more than encouraging. The stock has actually run up from the time it got derated in the times of its management or board strife. The worst is behind Infosys very clearly. 

It is actually set for a very good run driven by the fact that the end markets that it services primarily the United States and of course, large swathes of Western Europe. The broader economic prospects for these markets are reasonably positive even today. The transition to digital is happening slowly and steadily. Our finding is that the transition to digital should not be a worry for Indian companies, legacy is not falling off as fast as is feared and Indian companies are picking up digital skills faster than what we or you or I would have thought. 

All this bodes well for Infosys. It is a very steady play for the longer term. Again, like Voltas, there is no way that you can avoid putting Infosys into a long-term India portfolio at this point of time. 

As for Tata Motors, unless it gets something right in terms of getting the volumes back at JLR and controlling the margins and that crazy capex spend, that it is sitting on, we are in for trouble and that is exactly what the stock price is telling you."

3,2019-01-02,Britannia,"By Sagarika Mukherjee 
India’s FMCG story looks interestingly poised as we step into a new Calendar. From bigger awareness levels to better product quality, attractive offers and consumer shift to naturals; it looks like we have a good tailwind for volume and profit growth, though some challenges remain.

So, what to expect from this sector in 2019?

1) We expect the naturals segment within well penetrated categories to continue growing, led by a strong shift in consumer preferences to buy products which are herbal, natural, organic and to shun products with chemical substances.

2) Naturals as a segment is already 25 per cent of toothpaste category, and brands that have ‘naturals’ positioning like Dabur Red, Swarnavedshakti, Dant Kanti will continue to grow in double digits (10-15% YoY).

3) In personal care products (shampoos, fairness creams, conditioners, hair oils), the consumer in urban markets is definitely moving towards “higher value” products, as most companies have launched variants of their flagship products at higher prices, citing additional benefits (especially hair fall control, hair repair, volume, hydration) by including ingredients like argan oil, turmeric, aloe vera and keratin.

4) Categories that can see tailwind in skincare are pure extractions of rose oil, argan oil/Moroccon oil and virgin coconut oil, which consumers are using now instead of creams. However, since these pure oil extracts are expensive (Rs 650 -1,000 for 25-100ml bottles) and getting added as an additional product in skin care/ hair care regime, we don’t see any volume pressure for fairness cream brands.

5) In hair oils, the category has got divided into two sub-segments of ‘low cost’ hair oils and ‘ayurvedic’. Hair oils with anti-hair fall benefits are growing the fastest. The low-cost segment, which has coconut and amla hair oil brands like Parachute, Anmol, VVD Gold, Dabur Amla, Nihar Shanti Amla, Parachute Jasmine and Dabur Jasmine is growing at 6-15 per cent per annum. While ayurvedic hair oils with ‘anti-hair fall’ attributes are benefitting from the whole naturals wave and are getting stocked by all channels – modern retail, e-com, GT, chemists alike and brands like Indulekha (Rs 432/100ml) are even strong in wholesale channels, highlighting that it is also fast moving.


What’s pushing larger SKUsPremium detergents in urban markets will continue to grow at 15-20 per cent per annum, led by 360-degree push by the top players like HUL, P&G, Jyothy Labs for Surf Excel/ Surf Excel Easy Wash, Ariel, Ariel Matic, Tide Plus, Tide Naturals, Henko Lintelligent. Companies are ploughing back the commodity benefits, tax rate cuts, input tax credit on wider basket of goods and services and spending on both ad-spends and promotional offers to sell larger SKUs (stock keeping units).

In modern trade and e-com, it has now become a norm almost to sell 4kg / 6kg SKUs in detergents and 375/650ml SKUs in shampoos. With more awareness, consumers are shunning local brands and premium players are offering additional benefits, upgrading technology to improve product quality and offering price offs to an extent where the consumer is tempted to shift towards these ‘premium’ brands. This is not affecting margins of these companies, as selling more volumes only gives them scale benefits and bargain power. A similar trend is visible in shampoos, hand wash and shower gels.


OthersBSE FMCG index vs BSE Sensex
Rural markets improvingKey categories such as detergents, toilet soaps, dishwashing bars, hair oils, shampoos, fairness creams and toothpaste have all witnessed rural growth outpacing urban growth by 1.5 times (high single digit volume growth) at offtake levels and have also seen an improvement in trajectory on absolute level as they grew by 1.1 times urban growth in 2017. According to AC Nielsen, the full-year consumer offtake was 13.5 per cent in 2017 and is expected to drop to 10-11 per cent in 2018 and stabilise at those levels going forward. The reason behind the dip in growth from 2017 to 2018 was the effect of a lower base in 2016, which caused the 2017 growth figures to spike.


OthersFMCG stocks'performance in 2019
Premiumisation through smaller-sized packs All dominant market leaders have converged to a single strategy of expanding reach through affordable packs in their respective categories while strategically pricing them at 1.3-4 times the base portfolio.

Categories that have benefitted from this strategy are detergents (Surf Excel Easy wash sachet at Rs 10), post wash fabricare (Comfort - HUVR priced at Rs 3/sachet), shampoos (Pure Derm (HUVR) sachet priced at Rs 3 (7ml) to up-trade consumers from Clear (HUVR) priced at Rs 1.5 (5ml) and Tresemme sachets used to up trade consumers from Sunsilk), Rs 10/20 packs of toothpaste (Swarnavedshakti by Colgate), biscuits (Marie at Rs 5 price point, Nutrichoice, Goodday Wonderfulls priced at Rs 10-30 per pack), bakery (Britannia has covered 3 price points –Rs 5/10/15 through Tiffin Fun & Chocomuffils for kids and adults across age groups), cooking aids (Maggi Magic Masala sachets), and milk beverages priced at Rs 25 per tetra pack (Nescafe, Britannia).

6,2019-01-04,Britannia,"Consumer centric stocks are moving at high valuations, but in an election year, these are difficult to avoid, says Dhirendra Tiwari, head of research (HoR), Antique Broking. He is of the view that momentum should continue in 2019 as far as Indian equities are concerned. He spoke to ETNow. 


Edited excerpts:
Is that a happy feeling that we have managed to outperform the rest of the world stepping into 2019 or is it a scary feeling that we may just fall in line?

Exactly, it is a very happy feeling because not many times we see Indian markets outperforming for the whole of the year. It's good and not scary at all. 

Overall momentum remains pretty positive and therefore, there are events during this year which can be material on the market’s performance. Yet, we are pretty constructive and momentum should continue in the rest of 2019 also as far as Indian equities are concerned.



What is your big theme for 2019? What is it that you are advising clients to be on this year?

If you look at 2018, the big theme was consumption and exports. We had FMCG, staples doing pretty well. IT sector also performed very well. One can argue that the valuations sort of moved even ahead of earnings expectations. 

We have been contemplating for the last few quarters that probably the revival investment cycle will be the theme that is going to play out in 2019-20. The overall view is that while consumption remains a decent theme for the industry whether it is a good investment opportunity, one has to be cautious as valuations are trading significantly higher than the mean and averages. Recovery in investment cycle can lead to significant earnings growth in sectors dependent on the cyclical recovery and that becomes a very interesting area to look at for 2019.



Where do you find opportunities within consumption?

In consumption, retail for example remains a decent area of growth and valuation. If you look at staples, that has probably been trading at pretty high valuations. That is an area which is a market performer for us. In consumption, one would be a little more focussed on retail than staples. 

On the discretionary side, we are sort of cautious to negative on automobiles whereas we are positive on consumer discretionaries like air conditioners and consumer electricals and the like. There are certain opportunities in the consumer discretionary space, particularly retail, consumer electrical and electronics.



Where you would spot opportunities within investment-led themes? Do you think that the government’s increase in spending on infrastructure and engineering space would lead to a greater bias in buying stocks there?
I will just give you some background here. Look at the capex part of the country, which is GFCF, gross fixed capital formation. This has three components. One is private investment, the second is government and PSU investment and third is households. We have seen the government and PSU investment is shaping up pretty well for the last couple of years whereas private investment, which is almost 40 per cent of gross fixed capital formation, has been muted. 

What we are witnessing today is increase in utilisations. There has been a reasonable amount of growth in certain key sectors like cement, steel or you can talk about certain other areas of growth like ferrous, non-ferrous and automobiles and so on and so forth. 

As the RBI has pointed out, the system utilisation levels have also gone to almost 75 per cent, which in our opinion is a threshold capacity utilisation level. We are witnessing early signs of private capex recovery and this is sort of supported by all the companies that we meet. 

If that has to turn around, I would assume that there are a lot of opportunities in the investment recovery theme place. Corporate bank becomes a big large play within that space. We like capital goods and infrastructure stocks also within that category. These two areas along with select cement companies becomes quite interesting space to look at. 


Within cement, would you stick to sector leaders or would it be a more regional bet you are taking?

Cement has little confusing state of affairs in the sense that the overall environment remains quite conducive from the demand point of view. We have seen almost a double digit growth for the past few quarters and demand will continue to be strong because of the base effect. It can go to 7-8 per cent. 

Having said that, this has also attracted a lot of capacity expansion which in our opinion is likely to keep prices in check. In cement, it's very important to see the valuation comfort. We would pretty much go with the top company, which is UltraTech, and also look at some of the companies cheaper in valuations like ACC and Ambuja Cement. 



I was also just scanning some of your other bets and I see that there is a lot of focus on financing companies especially gold businesses. Muthoot Finance is part of your list. Are you going in for bargain hunting within financials outside the very obvious high quality names like Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv in some of the beaten down names over the the last three months?

NBFC remains a concern area. The only area which has done pretty well both in terms of earnings and stock performance has been gold financing companies. That has been one of our preferred bets for quite some time. 

Muthoot Finance is one. It has been a big outperformer. We continue to have faith in that. As for rest of the non-banking finance companies, we think there may be opportunities in CV financing companies. That also remains an interesting bet. A few companies exposed to CV financing are the ones which we should look at. For the rest of it, we will have to wait for a while before we start looking at valuations and where the opportunity lies. 



Apart from the names and sectors you have talked about, have there been any large additions to your model portfolio or any changes thereof?

If you go to our previous reports and strategy, we had very significant overweight on consumer sectors, which are basically staples and automobiles. W have cut down meaningfully on these two. Consumer is now a market performer or you can say market weight and auto are slightly negative. These are key changes. 

The change has been on the positive side on industrials and infrastructure and also consumer discretionary. These are three areas where there has been an upward change. In the financial space, we continue to have a positive bias on private sector banks essentially.



What would be a big avoid for you from a valuation standpoint?

From the valuation point of view, there are two which have been the outperformers last year -- consumer and IT. If you look at all leading stocks in the consumer space whether it is Lever or Nestle or Britannia or the like, they are all trading at meaningfully higher valuation than their historical averages. That is point number one.

Second, the growth has been quite robust in the last 4-5 quarters. There can be some moderation in growth, going forward. Valuations are capturing the sustained growth that we have seen, which are largely driven by not only volume growth but also cost side benefits. If there is a moderation in growth even by 2-3 per cent, there will be some challenge to high valuations these companies are trading at. 

It is very risky to say a complete sell on this sector because this is an election year and therefore investors would like to remain protected within consumer names to some extent. To make money from these levels is quite challenging and therefore we recommend no fresh additions, hold on to these stocks. 

In the automobile space, there are weaknesses emerging on the volume and cost front. That is again an area where we think one should look cautious starting from the leader in the category."
5,2019-01-04,Britannia,"Amit Khurana, head of equities, Dolat Capital Market, likes consumer largecaps and Britannia is one stock 
  
  where he is ready to allocate 5-8%. In this space, Marico is another stock he likes. Edited excerpts:

What is your base case expectation from the markets this year?
This year probably will be a tale of two halves. The first half is going to be quite challenging given the fact that we are getting into major global headwinds. We have the political season starting off in India which does not look as certain as was the case a few months back. India has outperformed the emerging markets over the last three-four months, significant premium versus historical averages, premium versus the emerging market basket. I guess it is going to be a little challenging to look out for returns in the first half in the least and then depending upon how the other news flow comes in, we will probably have a better picture for the second half but at this stage.

Our view is cautious to say the least because globally the picture is deteriorating. India continues to outperform on the back of valid reasons; crude oil has cooled off; currency has stabilised but how far this will take us in terms of outperformance and to what extent is a challenging question remains to be seen. There are going to be headwinds for India as well over the next few months and therefore we are a little on the cautious side. 


Given that Brent is still floating around $55 to a barrel, is there an opportunity in aviation or do you think the meaty part of the trade is over?
I have never been a fan of aviation as a sector. So my bias remains the same. There are challenges even in good times. The yields keep falling and competitive intensity takes over everything else. In bad times, when crude prices are higher, it becomes a cost pressure. So either ways, these models are not really able to make a sustained return on capital employed. India is one of the biggest aviation markets. I We should have been having an aviation sector which should be generating huge cash flows but that is not the case. So, my take is stay away. I am not a very great fan of these models.


It is often said US tech companies are correcting and it will have impact on Indian tech companies. This question will not be asked by institutional investors but some of our retail investors tend to connect the dots here. How would you respond to this?
That is a very valid way to look at it. We have also been debating internally for the last few weeks whether it really makes a material impact on the earnings for Indian IT vendors. I guess it is probably early for us to conclude anything but there could be some impact but that will probably play out in the second half FY20. 

As of now, we are holding on to our estimates for FY20. We had not made any significant revisions to that. 

But the other important part is Indian vendors do have strong balance sheets. They have strong operating bottles which have helped them to sustain in the last few downturns as well. To that extent, there is an opportunity for some of these vendors to reposition themselves. Valuations are not very demanding for Indian IT vendors. These guys are doing a share buyback which is deploying cash for the better and also helping accretion on the EPS front. I would not take a negative view right now on the Indian IT services. 

In fact, we believe that over the next few months this will be one of the safer places to have some allocation to the portfolio in specific stocks rather than go all out negative.


I am getting increasing consensus that one should revisit power utilities. Why do you think at a time when we are talking about economic recovery, cyclicals, industrials coming back, some of the smartest fund managers are saying buy NTPC, buy PFC, buy REC?
Part of the argument I would definitely agree to. The other part which we are more keen to push out for the sector is it is a defensive. The overall stability of earnings is far better and there is a preference amongst investors to move towards safer models and more predictable cash flows and the sector has not been doing much. 

The reason we are keen to look at that sector and within power, T&D is something that we have been bullish on and we still believe that there is enough opportunity to make money on. On the generation side, while the utilisation levels have marked up, it has not been strong enough for us to make a case to go out and buy. Our case is more as a defensive rather than as an outright buy. Therefore, we are probably on the same page but with a different perspective.


Which is one stock from the largecap space where you are happy to allocate 5-8% of your total portfolio?
We like consumer stocks. Consumer staples are richly valued but if there was one stock which I would still allocate, it will be Britannia. Another stock which will probably have better tailwind scenario is Marico. We have upgraded that and we like that as a name as well."
7,2019-01-07,Britannia,"With oil price declining and hopefully with an interest rate cut and the fact that currency depreciation seems to 
  
  
  be over, foreign investors can turn buyers, Samir Arora, Founder and fund manager, Helios Capital, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


Do you think from a market standpoint, the next 51 weeks will be good weeks or will they be choppy or volatile weeks?
Individual weeks could be choppy, but I do not think the overall collection of 51 weeks will be very bad for India. It has not been bad even so much in 2018 but in 2019 just because we do not normally have so many bad years in a row and even otherwise, should be okay. I feel good.


What is fuelling your optimism? Is it flow? Is it liquidity or earnings recovery?
It is a little bit of dealing with a lot of issues in 2018 and those no longer posing a challenge. First of all, let us look at the big picture. In any case, equity markets over the long term, do well. That is always a backdrop which pushes things at the rate of your earnings growth which is usually 14-15% but last year because of the currency depreciation and then the real estate/NBFC scare and also a midcap correction, the Indian markets did very badly in the initial part of the year. 

We can see for the last two-three months and with the oil price decline and hopefully with interest rate cut and the fact that currency depreciation seems to be over, there can be a situation where foreign investors are buyers and you can always justify that on the basis of current account deficit reduction and political uncertainty would be over in the next three-four months. Some earnings improvement in corporate banks can be justified but first we need an environment where people are willing to look at equity and not get weighed down by the fact that every day the currency depreciates. I am talking from a foreign investor point of view.


There is much talk about the heightened volatility that the election event may throw up. Do you believe that it is going to be really that choppy and a cliff-hanger for both politics as well as the markets? Or do you think it is going to be as always as history has told us that election years have given markets positive returns at max a two-day event?
It would have been a bigger event if in December, the results were not like this. Right now, you cannot build a scenario that BJP is definitely winning with a big margin and therefore there is no negative surprise that day. The markets will now discount it a little better and of course on that day, there will still be I think a 4-5% kind of move either way depending on who wins and loses. 

But unless the scenario throws out some very bad individuals as PM, it will be a one or two or a three-day event but it will still be worth 5% either way which is like a 10% difference but that is not a show stopper in markets where anyway markets are so volatility these days that you will not hold back your buying because it might fall 5% that day because it could also be a scenario that it goes up an additional 5-7% that day. But it is not a 20% up-down kind of a scenario which we had in 2009 and before that also in 2004.


Many are saying that this year would be really a year of two halves. Do you see it like that in the budget? Do you think, there would be a different portfolio strategy for first half versus what happens into elections?
No, I do not feel that way. What I could sense is that I think that if the US dollar depreciates a little because of they have one interest hike instead of two or something like that and then Indian rupee strengthens by 1% or 2%, it makes for a big cycle and logical difference to foreign investors. 

Foreign investors can handle normal equity markets which may be up or down but broadly there is a big selection of stocks to choose and you can choose what you want. So once the currency scare is out of the way which I think already is, I think foreign flows will turn positive. I feel you cannot have a runaway kind of rally which would mean something like say 20% before elections because that people will still like to negotiate but based on their other comfort factors and the fact, the election day or election week cannot bring you down more than 5-7%.

Whatever be the scenario, unless it is a super bad, low probability scenario of some lady leading a third front kind of a scenario, then you would not wait overly. So you will go along with a normal expectation that over a year you will make this much. I do not think it will be a big show stopper and you do not need to really change your stocks, you may keep some money in reserves if you want but that does not mean you will buy different kind of stocks. You will still buy the same that you always buy.


US markets have fallen and we are holding on. US markets fell more, nothing got affected because the view was that okay US economy will peak out, emerging markets like India will do well. A similar scenario played out for six-eight months in 2007 before the subprime crisis. US markets started coming down, emerging markets like India started moving up. Everyone said do not worry about US markets, we are decoupled. I get a same feeling right now that we are decoupled but after seven months, that decoupling got over and we got recoupled again.
We are not decoupled but please note that last year, the US market fell 6%. So do not get carried away that India did very well. The US market fell 6% in the total year and it fell out of that and 1.15% in December for whatever reason. But we also fell some 14% or 10-12% in September. So, I would not think it is decoupled. That is why I say that for making absolute money, you want the US market to do well or at least be stable. 

To outperform, you may do it if something very specific to US happens but normally US is the mother ship, you do not wish bad for the US market and think that we will do better. But I do not think US is in a 2008 kind of a situation. Please note that 2008 itself came after 70 years. It is not a normal bad year. In a normal bad year, you can do a little better or little worse but 2008 was like a global crisis. Even 2000 did not pose a problem not like that. So you cannot benchmark things of 2008.


Consumer stocks are expensive but it is not new. They were expensive in 2015, 16, 17 and 18 and yet if you bought an HUL or a Britannia or Marico, you made serious money. What is the way forward for consumer staples stocks? They are expensive but will they make money?
If you are talking only about these kind of stocks which are consumer staple, which are trading at say 45-50 times, you would have noticed that for the last seven-eight years, their stock appreciation has come more from re-rating of that earning rather than the earning. We do not buy these kind of stocks. We want a stock to be going up a little bit because you discovered it early and its rating has gone up on price earning multiples. 


Then, you want most of the stock returns to come from earnings growth and in all of these you will find that may be 60-70% has come from PE being higher but if you broadly define the consumer, we define it much more broadly. In consumers, if you leave out the HCV and commercial vehicles and all, you can do media, normal consumer durables and air conditioning companies. There are so many companies you can broadly define as ultimately consumer and not corporate or industry or even Titan. This is what you can call consumer. But if you say the consumer staples, we would not buy any of them.


In the market, this kind of portfolio churn or sector rotation is taking place. A lot of people are now saying that bet on the beaten down names like infrastructure and select autos as well which you just reiterated too. Do you believe that there is some serious money to be made in some of the beaten down names because you are going to see an earnings revival and sectoral churn is also going to be in their favour?
Everybody has some beaten up names in their own portfolios. So you do not need to look out for more because if you have 30-40 stocks, some will be beaten up. But actively seeking that as a strategy, I do not think it is so straight forward. You could also have a negative scenario of two kinds. One is that US has had basically a nine-year run and that is one of the longest in terms of their business cycle.

If they have a problem, the world has a problem and in India you could have a third front led by some lady from somewhere and that would be even worse. You cannot totally go one way or the other. We run a portfolio with about 35-40 names, of which some will be the largest names which are doing well and you feel comfortable that they would not blow you up in a bad scenario. 

There is no one strategy but if somebody wants to buy beaten up names, he is most welcome to. We are sure we already have some of them in our portfolio and so we are okay, but it is not a strategy. That way, if I buy one stock from this sector, that is not a strategy, it is a diversification. But I do not think it is a full blown case for buying beaten up stocks because some stocks right deserve to be beaten up, some have their lives changed with new changes in the world. There is no such strategy that anybody should have but you can buy a stock on this basis because you otherwise have some confidence that it will recover whatever it has lost and more.


Does Yes Bank becomes a case to look at at these levels?
Well, we are not supposed to discuss stocks but in a picture book sense, there are very few stocks which have so low hurdles to cross.


What about some of the infrastructure or select auto names which are getting thrashed?
We have Maruti, we do not have the others because it is still a dominant company and it has fallen a lot although we have had it for five-six years but otherwise we are mostly short some of the other auto two-wheeler types.


Let us talk about IT. The variable factor in 2018 was rupee. When we started the year, you said for the first time in my life I have gone short on IT. Given that rupee is now decisively trading below 70, what is in store for IT stocks?
After the very poor Infosys guidance in April of 2018, we did not have any IT. We sold out what we had thinking that again they are disappointing and the markets went up and all those stocks did very well. Today, I we own a very small weightage, in some general IT stocks. I would think I do not like it now because they have outperformed a lot They have got rerated on the basis of these macro factors. It is better to be domestically oriented where there might be an interest rate cut, where you can say capex cycle is recovering if at all a little bit here and there. But I do not like IT, we have a few stocks but much less than the index.


You have always maintained a ratio of long and short. So for 2019, if you have to look at your long-short positioning, are you likely to remain more long, less short or it is too early to get into that kind of a conversation?
There are two things; one is that as if you have a view for 2019 on the net, on the short side we maybe have a 30-day view. On the long side, we are always 100 long and short, depending on the individual stocks. Once in a while, on an event like when the introduction on long-term capital gains happened on that one day, the budget day, we might reduce it by 10-20%, but otherwise they are in the 60s range. We very rarely have more shorts than longs. Even today, we will be between 65 and 70% net long which means some 100 long and 35 short or 32 short and that depends on individual stocks, if we add or subtract. 

But we are not going to say that for this year we will be this much because shorting is more flexible in our minds than the longs. We want to hold for long, shorts depending on our view and our confidence.


A lot of parallels are also have been drawn between 2013 and 2108.In 2013, the rupee went down, crude went higher and there was a bit of a global concern because of taper tantrum. But after 2013, there was a big comeback in mid and smallcap stocks, and you ended up buying a lot of midcap stocks. One of the stocks where you made serious money was Eveready. Are you looking at hunting in some of the mid and smallcap stocks? 
No, we are not. But let me tell you that this 2013 connection you can also draw in 2008 and in 2011. The Indian currency depreciated between 10 and 15-17% in 2008 then the following years were very good because the currency did not depreciate it added to returns for everybody. 

So that way I agree, but in 2013 one reason was actually the political event which was a super positive and strong event of 2014 which basically led to that rally. That kind of an event does not exist right now. I do not think we are getting that big pop now. Also because the US market is more into the cycle, you will always feel that if not this year, the next year, US will have a recession and we may outperform. But we cannot have the kind of years that we had in 2014 where NAVs were up 70-80%. It is not going to happen. This is more a normal year."
9,2019-01-08,Britannia,"Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC, is fairly positive about 2019. And he has solid reasons to back up. Macroeconomic scenario is looking better, he says. Shah also told ETNow that valuations are near their fair value. 

Edited excerpts:


Are we in for a good year, poor year or just a very decent year where we should not expect anything extraordinary?

There are many events this year which will determine the outcome. But at least at the beginning of 2019, we are looking at markets with much more hope than in 2018. Oil prices have corrected from $85 to $55-60 range, 10-year yield has moved down from 8.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent, the rupee has moved back from 74 to 69-70, banking liquidity from Rs 1,50,000 crore negative is now roughly about Rs 45,000-50,000 crore negative. FIIs who were sellers in September and October have turned out to be buyers in November and December. 

Inflation has been consistently below RBI’s forecast level. IIP numbers have started recovering. Overall, we are looking at 2019 on a macro basis with much more optimism than 2018. And more importantly, from the market point of view, in 2018 beginning, markets were trading at a premium to historical average, small caps were at 33 per cent premium, large caps were at 10 per cent premium, midcaps were at about 25 per cent premium. 

When I last looked at the number a few weeks ago, small caps were at 5 per cent discount, large caps were at 2 per cent premium and midcaps were at about 10 per cent premium. Effectively, valuations are near their fair value. Macroeconomic scenario is looking better and hence, we are looking at 2019 with more optimism than 2018.



What to your mind could be that big turning point for this year? Will it be earnings recovery or election verdict?

Definitely, market is actually looking at earnings recovery, but somewhere election verdict also plays a role in such recovery. Market is not discounting just this quarter’s or next quarter’s earnings. It is trying to discount earnings over next decade or 20 years. 

When the election verdict comes, obviously on the day of election results, it creates far more volatility. But later on, what policies are followed by the incoming government determines the trajectory of earnings. So, market will be looking at earnings recovery and post election what economic policies are followed by the government will have material impact on the trajectory of earnings recovery.


Do you believe that there could be a case where there is perhaps better alpha generation when it comes to small and midcaps. You were just talking about the fact that if you look at the large cap universe, that is still quoting at 2 per cent premium whereas small and midcaps are at a 5 per cent discount. So, could we see this realignment or readjustment in which small and midcaps give better value and returns this year?

Undoubtedly, we believe small and midcaps today from a valuation point of view is just a little below their historical average. But more importantly, from the regulation point of view today, the top 100 companies are largecaps, next 150 companies are midcaps and beyond 250 companies are all smallcaps. The sheer range of a number of stocks available in small caps are far more and hence, the fund manager who can pick those small cap stocks will be able to generate better alpha compared to slightly restrictive environment within large and midcaps. 


In that sort of environment, what are your top conviction plays for 2019? Against the backdrop of an impending election result, how would you spread out risks versus rewards?

There is one sector which we have started accumulating and we believe post election there could be a fair amount of outperformance over there. This sector is related to capital goods and infrastructure. 

Over the last four years, private capex has remained subdued for a variety of reasons. But now, capacity utilisation has started improving. From bottoming out at around 70 per cent, capacity utilisation across many industries is averaging 72-76 per cent. As this capacity utilisation starts improving, real interest rate starts coming down, credit becomes available and banking liquidity improves, we believe that private capex will revive. 

Along with government infrastructure development spending, we will see good days for capital goods. More importantly, over the last decade or so, many weaker capital goods players that had flourished during 2008 boom have started disappearing. Effectively, there are a few quality players left in capital goods and infrastructure segments. Their order book will become reasonably solid and they will be able to dictate their margin and pricing. 

Because of all this, we believe capital goods and infrastructure sector could be an outperformer in 2019 subject to the election scenario. The other segment which we are right now focussing on is related to rural consumption. The election-bound government will pump money into rural economy. Many state governments have announced farm loan waiver packages that will raise spending power of the rural economy. So, the rural consumption theme can be looked at the current level.



Real estate is considered to be the ugly duckling sector. But if I look at the headlines, RERA has come into place, disclosure norms are better, consolidation is the need of the hour. It is a sector which is not going to die down completely and it is a sector where GST rates are coming down. Right now, nobody wants to buy real estate stocks but after years and years of underperformance and with so many reforms which have taken place, is it time to be a buyer in if not all maybe 2-3 top names?

One limitation in the real estate sector is many of the leading developers of India are unlisted. For example, if we look at Mumbai, some of the top notch developers are Raheja, Rizvi, Lokhandwala, Hiranandani and so on and so forth. But unfortunately, none of them are listed on the stock market. 

If we look at some of the large industrial houses -- for example, Tatas -- which are foraying into real estate and will benefit from all the things you mentioned, again that is unlisted. When we are looking at the real estate sector, we do agree that this is one sector which can bottom out and there could be opportunity for investors. Unfortunately, when we look at the listed segment, the opportunities are very, very limited. 

We intend to play this cycle through other ancillary sectors such as cement, pipes, fittings, tiles and building materials companies. Even housing finance companies will be a better bet to play on the real estate sector and wait for listing of leaders that will give you a reasonable opportunity if they are priced correctly.


How do you think this long corporate bank trade will pan out for 2019 because that is the consensus trade? The view on Street is buy ICICI Bank, buy SBI and buy Axis Bank, some fund managers have told me that they own all three.

We believe this private and public sector corporate focussed banks will be a longer term trade. Of course, today it is becoming a consensus trade and to that extent there could be a risk, but if you look from a fundamental point of view, RBI in its report has mentioned that they expect NPAs to decline from 10.9 per cent to 10.4 per cent. 

This probably indicates that NPA cycle is now bottoming out, incremental lending has been relatively towards better credit. All those banks which had to provide for NPAs by virtue of their corporate lending should be coming out of that cycle and their retail franchise has been fantastic. 

All the three banks which you mentioned have fantastic retail franchise, their retail asset book is also doing well, the only thing which was kind of restricting their share price growth was the NPA cycle and if they come out of this NPA cycle, then to that extent those stocks could be outperformers in the market. Yes, it is a consensus trade, but many a time, consensus can prove correct also.


Is it time to diversify and extend your portfolio, have a little bit exposure to gold because gold prices have been holding steady ever since there was that whiff that the Fed rate pause is going to come in and that bet has weighed on the dollar. Typically as well, you have seen safer haven rush coming into gold, gold prices have recovered from the August lows. Is it time then to take that small maybe, 5-10 per cent kind of exposure into gold?

Undoubtedly, as of today, gold looks attractive. Normally, when Fed rate fund is rising, gold prices underperform. As Fed is indicating that they will not be increasing rates as quickly as market was factoring in a few months back, certainly this provides some sort of support to the gold prices. 

Second, from a currency point of view, if there is uncertainty related to election and that causes high volatility in the Indian rupee, then gold being dollar denominated could provide an alternative option. So at this point of time, I do recommend investors to consider gold as a part of portfolio. My only request will be please remember how much gold you own, you should not be too much overweight into gold.


While you outlined some of the sectors you like, I would want your overview on how you would be placing your bets on essentially the exporters or the rupee related themes because we have seen IT and pharma being top plays because of what the currency did in 2018. Do you think in a meaningful manner one should look at the export theme in the market, not just IT, pharma but largely extending out to businesses which draw a chunk of their revenue through overseas?

Undoubtedly, that is one theme which is a multi-year theme. Of course, IT and pharma are pretty well known export themes. However, there is an opportunity which is emerging for India and we have captured that in chemical industry due to US imposition of tariff on Chinese exports. Many of the manufacturers from China are moving out into various other countries. 

Some of the buyers of Chinese goods in the US are also looking to buy or diversify their sourcing base and that creates opportunity for Indian exporters. In the chemical industry over the last 4-5 years, Indian companies have grown at a rapid pace to fill the little bit of vacuum created by China. 

We believe that in quarters to come, China will keep on creating more and more space for Indian companies and it will be for Indian exporters, Indian companies to capture that opportunity. What we have done in the chemical industry will be replicated in textiles, garments into shoes and leather accessories. It could be into food processing and clothing.

There are many opportunities which are available because China will be moving out of export market and their American buyers will be looking to source those goods from other countries, including India. This we believe is Y2K equivalent opportunity of Indian IT sector for Indian manufacturing companies. 

All we have to look at is entrepreneurs like Narayana Murthy, Azim Premji, Shiv Nadar so that we can ride this trend for multi years. 


Where do you think some of these so-called hallowed stocks are headed -- Eicher, Page, Britannia I mean these were the stocks which have done wonderfully well in the last couple of years. PE expansion has been humongous, growth has been steady, the market concentration has been huge and a majority of the funds now either own Eicher or a Page, some own both. There are a very few funds which do not own none of these so-called four and five digit hallowed stocks?

From here onwards, to expect more expensive valuation stocks to get rerated further will be very difficult. It will be purely their earnings growth which will determine how these valuations can be sustained. 

And we believe from here onwards, at least in the expensive stocks, it is all about stock specific. If you believe these companies will be able to generate higher earnings growth, there will not be material return from these stocks over the next 12-18 months. 

This is not to deny that these companies are excellent companies, they have excellent business models, it is just that their prices seems to have run up a little bit ahead of what kind of earnings growth these companies are going to deliver. So we are pretty cautious in the more expensive bucket of stocks. 

We are taking all those companies on a case by case basis and where we believe that in our opinion, earnings growth will be higher than what is priced by the market. We do not mind holding on to those companies."

11,2019-01-15,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: FMCG heavyweight Hindustan Unilever will release its December quarter earnings on Thursday, and investors will be keenly looking out for comments on volume growth and consumer demand environment.

Since rural growth of key FMCG segments, including detergents, toilet soaps, hair oils, shampoos, fairness creams and toothpaste witnessed an uptick last year, company's pace of rural recovery will also be a major point of focus.

Similarly, the market will monitor the performance of Lever Ayush and oral care. 

HUL had beaten Street estimates in its second quarter earnings by reporting a 19 per cent jump in profit after tax (PAT). Brokerages are now expecting it to maintain its growth trajectory for this quarter as well.

“HUL may maintain three years’ average volume growth trajectory of earlier quarters,"" said brokerage Edelweiss Securities.

The brokerage expects revenue, EBITDA and PAT to grow nearly 9 per cent, 18 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. ""We expect HUL to record nearly 6-7 per cent volume growth on a high base of 11 per cent growth, the brokerage said.

The tax rate of 30 per cent for the quarter compared to about 21 per cent in the base quarter may keep profit subdued.

		}Q3 earnings gather steam: The road ahead of 9NextPrevPlay SlideshowNumbers do the talking 15 Jan, 2019Welcome to the Q3 earnings show, which is slowly picking up pace. We have seen a quite a few companies kicking off their numbers. There are more to go.


So far, there have been no fireworks. But as we go along, there might be surprises along the way.

Sharekhan has brought out a report that has put 10 key sectors under the microscope for any possible leads.

Next​ Consumer Goods & Services15 Jan, 2019• In Q3FY2019, for the Sharekhan universe of consumer goods companies revenues are expected to grow by 12.6% in Q3FY2019 with favorable demand environment (uptick seen in rural demand).

• Though gross margins would be under pressure, operating efficiencies would help companies post stable margins. PAT for coverage companies is set to grow 13.1% during the quarter.

• Improving rural demand, widening distribution reach and premiumisation remain the key revenue drivers in the near term.

• The positive impact of correction in crude oil prices and other key inputs coupled with stable currency would start flowing in from Q4.

Preferred Picks: HUL, ITC, Britannia Industries, Marico and Dabur India 
Q3FY19NextAutomobiles15 Jan, 2019
• In Q3FY2019, for the Sharekhan universe (excluding Tata Motors), revenue growth is expected to moderate to 7% driven by volume moderation across categories.

• Operating margin (OPM) is expected to drop by 110 bps y-o-y driven by increasing commodity costs and increased marketing expenses. The universe’s PAT growth is likely to slow down further and we expect flat earnings.

• Correction in fuel prices, improving liquidity situation and clearance of excessive inventories are likely to result in gradual improvement in demand from Q4FY2019.

• Gradual volume improvement, recent prices hikes and cooling off in commodity prices and reduction in discounts would ease cost pressures going ahead.

Preferred Picks: M&M, Maruti Suzuki, TVS Motors and EscortsNextPharma15 Jan, 2019• In Q3FY2019, revenue for the Sharekhan universe is expected to grow by 7.5% due to a favourable movement in the Indian rupee.

• Operating profit margin is likely to decline by 162 bps to 23.3% due to rise in raw material cost. We expect adjusted profit to grow by 7.9%.

• We expect the US and India businesses to see single-digit growth aided by limited launches by competitors and a weak rupee, which will also help some recovery in RoW/EM businesses.

• We maintain our neutral stance on the sector and see opportunity in select, quality companies.

Preferred Picks: Divis & BioconNext Banks and Financials15 Jan, 2019• We find retail-focused and large corporate private banks attractive at present times; they would be helped by falling bond yields, peaking NPA cycle and improved credit outlook.

• The fall in bond yields, will also result in mark-to-market (MTM) reversals, lower provisions which will help profitability.

• Public sector banks to gain from healthy treasury profits in Q3FY19, but asset quality stress will continue to affect performance

• Structural challenges to persist for NBFCs; we prefer customer oriented, parent backed or players with a strong balance sheet in NBFC space

Preferred Picks: HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, RBL BankNext
Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects similar numbers for HUL for December quarter. 

It expects HUL's revenue to grow 10 per cent, with underlying domestic volume growth of 6 per cent in third quarter, while operating margin may expand by 150 basis points to 21.1 per cent, leading to EBITDA growth of 18.4 per cent.

""Adjusted PAT is likely to grow 17.8 per cent to Rs 1,410 crore,"" the brokerage said.

As per Kotak Institutional Equities, HUL's adjusted PAT may rise 2.7 per cent sequentially and 30.4 per cent yearly.

The brokerage estimates EBITDA to jump 28.3 per cent YoY and 6.7 per cent QoQ.

FMCG firms have a tailwind in terms of soft crude oil prices. Prices of most crude linked derivatives have eased sequentially and the benefit of it is expected to reflect from the fourth quarter. 

Brokerages are positive on volume growth of consumer goods companies. 

""We expect volume growth of consumer goods companies to sustain on account of farm loan waivers, MSP hikes, increasing direct distribution, muted growth of Patanjali, etc. Upcoming general and state elections will further boost consumption,"" Edelweiss Securities said."

Petchem margin, update on Jio business and capex-related plans will be the key monitorables, they said.

Brokerage Edelweiss Securities expects the oil-to-telecom major to report a 3 per cent sequential drop in consolidated Ebitda, but sees PAT to rise 2 per cent due to higher other income and lower interest costs.

“Weaker refining earnings (down 18 per cent QoQ) and flat petchem (up 1 per cent QoQ) will offset higher retail (up 9 per cent QoQ) and telecom (up 7 per cent QoQ) earnings. GRM is estimated to fall 7 per cent QoQ to $8.8 a barrel,” Edelweiss said in a note.

Sharekhan has brought out a report that has put 10 key sectors under the microscope for any possible leads.

Next​ Consumer Goods & Services15 Jan, 2019• In Q3FY2019, for the Sharekhan universe of consumer goods companies revenues are expected to grow by 12.6% in Q3FY2019 with favorable demand environment (uptick seen in rural demand).

• Though gross margins would be under pressure, operating efficiencies would help companies post stable margins. PAT for coverage companies is set to grow 13.1% during the quarter.

• Improving rural demand, widening distribution reach and premiumisation remain the key revenue drivers in the near term.

• The positive impact of correction in crude oil prices and other key inputs coupled with stable currency would start flowing in from Q4.

Q3FY19NextAutomobiles15 Jan, 2019
• In Q3FY2019, for the Sharekhan universe (excluding Tata Motors), revenue growth is expected to moderate to 7% driven by volume moderation across categories.

• Operating margin (OPM) is expected to drop by 110 bps y-o-y driven by increasing commodity costs and increased marketing expenses. The universe’s PAT growth is likely to slow down further and we expect flat earnings.

• Correction in fuel prices, improving liquidity situation and clearance of excessive inventories are likely to result in gradual improvement in demand from Q4FY2019.

• Gradual volume improvement, recent prices hikes and cooling off in commodity prices and reduction in discounts would ease cost pressures going ahead.

Preferred Picks: M&M, Maruti Suzuki, TVS Motors and EscortsNextPharma15 Jan, 2019• In Q3FY2019, revenue for the Sharekhan universe is expected to grow by 7.5% due to a favourable movement in the Indian rupee.

• Operating profit margin is likely to decline by 162 bps to 23.3% due to rise in raw material cost. We expect adjusted profit to grow by 7.9%.

• We expect the US and India businesses to see single-digit growth aided by limited launches by competitors and a weak rupee, which will also help some recovery in RoW/EM businesses.

• We maintain our neutral stance on the sector and see opportunity in select, quality companies.

Preferred Picks: Divis & BioconNext Banks and Financials15 Jan, 2019• We find retail-focused and large corporate private banks attractive at present times; they would be helped by falling bond yields, peaking NPA cycle and improved credit outlook.

• The fall in bond yields, will also result in mark-to-market (MTM) reversals, lower provisions which will help profitability.

• Public sector banks to gain from healthy treasury profits in Q3FY19, but asset quality stress will continue to affect performance

• Structural challenges to persist for NBFCs; we prefer customer oriented, parent backed or players with a strong balance sheet in NBFC space

Motilal Oswal Securities expects the Mukesh Ambani-led company to report consolidated profit after tax of Rs 9,540 crore, up 1 per cent YoY and almost same as in the September quarter.

It expects the company to report GRM of $7.5 a barrel, against $9.5 per barrel in September quarter and $11.6 a barrel in the year-ago quarter. This would still imply a premium of $3.2 a barrel over Singapore GRM.

“Petrochemical segment is expected to do better due to healthy deltas and strong volume growth in the segment. We expect RIL to report consolidated Ebitda Rs 20,280 crore, up 15 per cent YoY, down 4 per cent QoQ,” the brokerage said.

17,2019-01-17,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group: When everything is right in the business, it is the valuation that’s the worry.

On Thursday, Hindustan Unilever is forecast to post double-digit growth in revenue (to over Rs 9,300 crore) for the December quarter, with no major deviation expected. Volume growth is expected to be in the range of 6-10 per cent on a high base.

However, it is the valuation that is of topmost concern to the Street with regards to the FMCG bellwether at this point in time.

The company is expected to post 12-13.5 per cent increase in revenue and an EBITDA margin of around 21 per cent. Investors will punish the stock in case of any negative deviation from the expectation — but they won’t cheer as much if HUL delivers on the expected lines.



The HUL stock is trading at 67.5 times its earnings per share for the past four quarters. The price-to-earnings multiple of the ET FMCG Index is 48.5. The HUL stock's five-year peak PE is 72.5 (hit in July 2018). The stock has gained 28 per cent in the past one year, hitting a record high of Rs 1,870 last month. Against this, the ET FMCG Index posted a gain of 15 per cent.

According to data from Bloomberg, 20 of the 39 (51 per cent) analysts tracking HUL have a ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock. Six months ago, 28 of the 46 (61 per cent) analysts had a ‘buy’ rating. The stretched valuation seems to have factored in the secular growth in consumer demand, limiting the room for a major upside.

18,2019-01-17,Britannia,"The confluence of local and global cycle picking up together should play out in the agri input side and we prefer 
  
  
  agrochemicals over other inputs, Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest, tells Nikunj Dalmia of ET Now in an exclusive interview. There are good set of companies where significant returns can be made over the next two-three year period, says Dharamshi. Edited excerpts:


Well begun is half done or is this just beginners’ luck in 2019?
No. First of all, our tribute to John Bogle. There is a lot of contribution to the fund management industry and one has to recognise that. Coming back to 2019, we really went through a rough period in 2018, especially if you are somebody managing a midcap concentrated strategy focussed on Indian midcaps and smallcaps. 

Valuations are now in our favour and some of the things that were really bothering like crude or the interest rates going higher, have now fallen in place. We can be a little more sanguine about the prospects of interest rate hardening as well as the crude going up. That bodes well for the Indian midcaps and they are relatively more reasonably valued today. So 2019 will definitely augur well, much better than 2018. 


We had a global scare in the last leg of 2018. There was a scary selloff in Dow, a huge meltdown in the hallowed FAANG stocks. So far, we have managed to survive the first storm. But if this is a recurring or long unwinding, emerging markets like India will also get hit hard.
It is surprising definitely but I would say 2019 is going to be more a year of mean reversion than anything else. Since the 2009 bottom, American markets have had a huge outperformance to the world market. The global market cap moved from $25 trillion to $85 trillion over a span of a decade and the biggest contributor to that was from the US market.

Relatively speaking, emerging markets have underperformed significantly and this gap between developed market and emerging markets had reached a high point sometime last year and that I think is reversing. So that is one of the reason why we did not see a selloff even though nearly a trillion dollars were wiped off just from the FAANG stocks in the US. Since FIIs have been sellers in our market over last two years, it is not a phenomenon of last three or six months.

We are constantly being going down in weightage. Our market cap probably peaked at around 2.5 trillion and came down to 1.8 trillion. We have also seen quite a bit of wealth erosion and that is why today I am much less worried about global crisis setting off or some kind of contagion which can make our markets collapse. I do not think we are facing that kind of scenario today.


In markets we have to look forward but I will look back for last two years. 2017 was the big year for fund managers and smallcap investors. 80% of the market went higher. In 2018, 18% of the market either went lower or remains stable. What is in store for 2019?
You are right. One of our studies showed that in 2018, more than 50% of the stocks fell more than 50%. In that kind of a scenario, your portfolio cannot be too much different. But enter 2019 and there are many opportunities to invest and those risks where there are unreasonable valuations or unreasonable expectations those have been taken out of the market. Now there are good set of companies where significant returns can be made over the next two-three year period. It might not be immediately in 2019 because some of the concerns are real. The stocks have not come off without a reason. There are good reasons. But that is where the opportunity lies. But opportunity is dressed in overalls and looks like hard work. 


Are you able to find enough businesses which can give a potential earnings growth of 20% to 25% for next two or three years? Are those businesses available at reasonable levels now?
There is an opportunity in the market today in the kind of buckets that we have. What we look for is good business, reasonable valuation and a business tailwind. Now it is very difficult to find a combination of all these three things. So it is definitely very miniscule. But at the same time, if you were to take in a little bit of a cyclical headwind in the business or there are some with structural headwind, then there is a bucket of and a pool of companies available where you can make good money if you stretch your horizon into three and five years of investment. But you will have to live through next 12 months when the problems will still be in the transition phase of turning around. 

For example, PSU banks or real estate developers are going through some real tough times. Those are structural issues. But valuations are not an issue over there. It is only an issue of whether and if the sentiment will revive. If the sentiment revives, the business tailwinds will come back. There is a going to be a big supply crunch for sure. The number of players are going to be whittled down dramatically in real estate. So that is a positive.


Do you own a real estate stock?
No, I do not own any and only thing I am saying is that that is a bucket which requires more than five years’ horizon. If you look at something that has more cyclical business headwinds, then over there, your horizon can be three to five years and you can still make good money. Managing public funds, sometimes we face challenges of having a 10-year horizon. So, we have to look at three to five years. I would be more willing to buy a company which has some cyclical headwind going on and which can be corrected by say the raw material prices coming down or some amount of stimulus being given to the economy. Those kind of situations provide more clear and present opportunity for us today.



So if we talk about your portfolio positioning in Jan 2018 versus January 2019, how many stocks have vanished, how many stocks have entered and in terms of an aggregate approach is there anything new and different or is it an extension of the same?
The last time we spoke, there were stocks priced to perfection and especially some of them were on the consumption side. Now, we are out of stocks that are priced to perfection with a business tailwind. Everything is going in favour but there is no room for error. High quality, high performance, highly valued. The money has been chasing very few ideas in this market and those few ideas have become really outpriced now. As long as the business tailwind continues, the valuations can sustain but I think there is a real risk of a significant underperformance with a three-year point of view.


We have seen that in Eicher, we have started seeing that in a Page. , I think you are referring to the same obvious stocks?
Yes that is the pool of companies that I am referring to, no one particular name but that is the kind of thing. Whether it is Page or Eicher or even Britannia or VIP.


Raamdeo Agrawal told me one thing which is that mehanga roye ek baar sasta roye bar-bar, we are always trying to find something very cheap but it does not work?
No, no, we are not going down the junk road but at the same time Infosys can have 10 years of underperformance, Hindustan Unilever can have 10 years of underperformance. So, you better be clear about what you are buying and I think the risks are real in terms of underperformance over the next three to five years. Any long-term investors’ horizon is also a risk.


You have been bullish on private sector banks, select chemical names and select retail/fashion names. Have those themes extended themselves for 2019?
 In private sector banks, definitely the theme continues but probably now some of the larger or the retail banks are not the ones to be focussed on. Corporate banks are better placed and that is where a surprise possibility is there in terms or earnings as well as a comfort in valuation. 

Larger private corporate banks or even smaller private regional banks provide a very good risk to reward with a five-year point of view if the capex cycle was to revive and that should revive sometimes within next six and 18 months. That is a fertile area to look at.


You do not think corporate banks are becoming a consensus trade? 
Consensus or not, you have to look at how much of the ownership is with the institutions and if you believe that price performance has been fantastic, then the performance has not even started ye. Honestly speaking, they are still available. These banks are doing sub 1% ROA. Over the next three to four years, the ROAs will move from 0.7-0.8 to 1.2-1.3 and with some bit of leverage, the ROEs can move beyond 15%. 

In that kind of a scenario where all these banks that are quoting between 1 and 2 can quote anywhere between 2 and 3. We are at the beginning of the story, we should not be worried about consensus at this point of time. It is a large pool, FIIs have been selling and I do not see us being in an overcrowded trade by any stretch of imagination.


You have this reputation of being the pharma expert on the stock market. When you see an experience like Sun Pharma in 2018, it just shakes you that corporate governance issues have been raises at this bluest of the blue chip company, Debt is not a problem for pharma though growth may be challenging. What does that speak for the sector?
This does not speak for the sector per se, it is a company specific issue. The sector issues were definitely more on the FDA front and those are behind us. The corporate governance issues were not completely unknown to the market. It is only that they are out in the public domain today and they probably did not matter when you were a small company but today when you have trillions of rupees of market cap, they matter a lot more because all the global FIIs have taken an exposure to your stock. There is no choice but to get your act together, clean up the books. 

And you are right, they do not have net debt but that cash in US and the debt in India are not matching. They will have to probably get out of this mess in some way but it reflects more on the company.


We started with John Bogel but let us go back to our favourite investor Warren Buffett. We love to quote him. I wonder if he has to start charging IPs for his quotes...
Yes he should charge a royalty.


 ...he will be a richer man by a billion dollars at least.
For sure.


He pretty much is alluding to what you referred to that you have to buy good businesses when there is a temporary slowdown or news is bad. Where else do you see this kind of a thesis getting played out?
So one space where three-four years of bad period is coming to an end I believe is agri inputs side. Agri has been in a distress and it is more because of agri prices being down than anything else. The global cycle also was on a slowdown since the last three years and over here there is a very good possibility that over the next one to two years there will be a pickup.


Despite what data we are getting from rural India?
No, because there is so much distress that is when governments will be forced to take action and when government take action it will have impact You want to be positioned for it today.


Focus on where the buck is going to move?
Correct. Because there is distress today there is no choice but the agri prices to move up over the next 12 to 18 months and finally this is a cycle. If a farmer is not getting good realisation for his crop he will move to another crop that gives him better realisation and that will eventually create shortage in the other crop and that will make the prices move up. 

Cyclically, from agri prices point of view we are close to a bottom and we should move up in the next 12 to 24 months and that is the local cycle but even globally also, the commentary or the large chemical companies has now started being positive and they have started witnessing growth which had come down to close to zero, now they are talking about 5-7% kind of growth. 

So the confluence of local and global cycle picking up together should play out in the agri input side and we prefer agrochemicals over other inputs."

It is not like without a reason that the stocks have come off. There are good reasons. But that is where the opportunity lies. But opportunity is dressed in overalls and looks like it's hard work. 


Are you able to find enough businesses which can give a potential earnings growth of 20-25 per cent for the next 2-3 years and are those businesses available reasonably now?

The kind of buckets that we have, is there an opportunity in the market today? There is an opportunity. What are the kinds of opportunities available? What we look for is a good business, good valuation, reasonable valuation and a business tailwind. It is very difficult to find a combination of all these three things present. So, that definitely is very, very minuscule. 

At the same time, there is a little bit of a cyclical headwind in the business or there are some with structural headwinds also. If you are willing to look at those companies, then there is a bucket and a pool of companies where you can stretch your horizon into three and five years of investment and then make good money over there. But you will have to live through next 12 months where the problems are still in the transition phase of turning around. 

For example, even if I just want to put some context to it, PSU banks or real estate developers are going through some real tough times. Those are structural issues, but valuations are not an issue over there. 

It is only an issue of whether and if sentiment will revive. Business tailwinds will come back, there is a going to be a big supply crunch, for sure. The number of players is going to whittle down dramatically in real estate. That is the positive.


Are you happy to buy real estate stocks, do you own a real estate scrip?

No, I do not own any and the only thing I am saying is that is a bucket which requires more than five years of horizon. If you look at something, that has more cyclical business headwinds. Over there, your horizon can be 3-5 years and you can still make good kind of money.

In managing public funds, sometimes we face challenges having a 10-year kind of horizon. We have to look at 3-5 years. Over there, I would be more willing to buy a company which has some cyclical headwind going on and which can be corrected by, say, raw material prices coming down or some amount of stimulus being given to the economy.

Those kinds of situations are more clear and present opportunity for us today.


If we talk about your portfolio positioning in January 2018 versus January 2019, how many stocks have vanished, how many stocks are entry points? In terms of an aggregate approach, is there anything new and different or is it extension of same?

If you remember, we spoke about it last time. There are stocks which are priced to perfection and especially, some of them are on the consumption side. We are out of stocks that were priced to perfection. They are fantastic companies, business tailwinds, everything is going in favour, but there is no room for error. 

So, money has been chasing very, very few ideas in this market. Those few ideas have been really really out-priced now. Now as long as the business tailwind continues, the valuations can sustain. But there is a real risk over there of a significant underperformance with a 3-year point of view.


We have seen that in Eicher. We have started seeing that in a Page. You are referring to pretty much the same obvious stocks?

Yes that is the pool of companies I am referring to, no one particular name but that is the kind of thing, whether it is Page or Eicher or even for that matter Britannia or VIP.


Raamdeo Agrawal told me one thing which is that mehanga roye ek baar sasta roye bar-bar, we are always trying to find something very cheap but it does not work?

No, no, we are not going down the junk road but at the same time Infosys can have 10 years of underperformance, Hindustan Unilever can have 10 years of underperformance. You better be clear about what you are buying and I think the risks are real in terms of underperformance over the next 3-5 years.


You have been bullish on private banks, you have been bullish on select chemical names and you have been bullish on select retail/fashion names. Have those themes extended themselves for 2019?
Private sector banks definitely as a theme continue. But probably now, some of the larger or retail banks are not the ones to be focussed on, corporate banks are better placed. That is where there is a surprise possibility in terms or earnings as well as comfort in terms of valuation. Larger private corporate banks or even for that matter smaller private regional banks provide a very good risk to reward with a five-year point of view if the capex and corporate cycle was to revive.

That should revive whether it is in the next six months or 18 months. That is definitely a fertile area to look at.


You do not think corporate banks is becoming like a consensus trade or maybe I am speaking to all the smart guys who are bullish on corporate banks. I do not know what is this, is this a coincidence or is this a consensus trade now?

Consensus or not, you have to look at how much of the ownership is with the institutions and if you believe that price performance has been fantastic, the performance has not even started yet. Honestly speaking, they are still available. These banks are doing sub-1 per cent ROA. Over the next 3-4 years, the ROAs will move from 0.7-0.8 per cent to 1.2-1.3 per cent and with some bit of leverage, the ROEs can move beyond 15 per cent. 

In that kind of a scenario, all these banks that are quoting between 1-2 per cent can quote anywhere between 2-3 per cent. We are at the beginning of the story, we should not be worried about consensus at this point of time. It is a large pool, FIIs have been selling and I do not see us being in an overcrowded trade by any stretch of imagination.


You own this reputation of being the pharma expert on the stock market when it comes to pharma. We look up to you, we look for your thoughts, when you see an experience like Sun Pharma in 2018, it just shakes you. 


It shakes you that here is the bluest of the blue chip company where corporate governance standards have been raised for a sector and for industry where debt is not a problem, growth may be challenging. But they have never had a debt problem, what does that speak for the sector?

This does not speak for the sector per se. It is a company specific issue, the sector issues were definitely more on the FDA front and I think those are behind us. The corporate governance issues I do not think were completely unknown to the market, it is only that they are out in the public domain today.

They probably did not matter when you were a small company, but today when you are in trillions of rupees of market cap, they matter a lot more because all the global FIIs have taken an exposure to your stock. There is no choice but to get your act together, clean up the books. And you are right. They have an issue... They have a unique situation where they will have to probably get out of this mess in some way, but I do not think it reflects on the sector per se, it reflects more on the company.


We started with John Bogle, but let us go back to our favourite investor Warren Buffett. We love to quote him, we love to talk about him, I wonder if he has to start charging IPs for his quotes...

Yes, he should charge a royalty.


...he will be a richer man by a billion dollar at least.

For sure.

He is pretty much alluding to what you referred to buying good businesses when there is a temporary slowdown or news is bad. Where else do you see this kind of a thesis getting played out?

One space where three-four years of bad period is coming to an end and I believe is agri inputs side. Agri has been in a distress ant it is more because of agri prices being down than anything else. The global cycle also was on a slowdown for the last three years. 


What data are we getting from rural India?

Because there is so much distress that governments will be forced to take action. You want to be positioned for it today.


Focus on where the puck is going to move?

Correct. Because there is distress today, there is no choice but the agri prices to move up over the next 12-18 months. Finally, this is a cycle if a farmer is not getting good realisation for his crop, he will move to another crop that gives him better realisation.

That will eventually create shortage in the other crop and that will make the prices move up. Cyclically, from agri prices point of view, we are close to a bottom and we should move up in the next 12-24 months and that is the local cycle. 

Even globally also, the commentary on large chemical companies has now started being positive and they have started witnessing growth which had come down to close to zero. Now they are talking about 5-7 per cent kind of growth. The confluence of local and global cycle picking up together should play out in agri inputs and we prefer agrochemicals over other inputs.


The thesis of cyclical recovery, the thesis of attractive valuations or reasonable valuations is no longer there in consumers or retail banks or for that matter some of the other obvious names. Some of these opportunities are there in the B2B space, but the challenge with B2B space is that you will not see a huge PE expansion and you will not see a huge margin expansion. I am sure you are aware of that?

So, you are absolutely right, on the consumer front getting a good business at a reasonable valuation is the biggest challenge and even though as a theme, we are really bullish on it. On the B2B consumer side, there is a possibility, I mean I slightly disagree with you over there that PE expansion cannot happen and markets have done funnier things. It is not like it is my base case to bet on a PE rerating over there, but if an upcycle over there extends beyond what the market can imagine right now, they will move to a higher plane in terms of rating. 

So consistency and performance is the most important thing. 


We spoke about a niche pocket which you like within the finance space and that was the small finance bank (SFB). Now the RBI ruling has just acted like a sledgehammer for some names there. Are you still bullish on those names with the RBI red line?

Absolutely. See, they are small in size with Rs 2,000-3,000 crore kind of a loan book size and a similar kind of market cap that is number one. Second, we have to realise they are not NBFCs anymore, they are banks. They have gone through the pain of taking over the cost of the banks, they have started providing SLR, CRR and the cost of converting their branches into a bank branch going from a second floor to a ground floor. 

Those costs are in the numbers. MFI still remains a very-very profitable product while there is a non-MFI SFB also. I am not talking only about MFI SFB. And the SME space is the most lucrative space in terms of lending, you need to have your processes right, you need to do your lending right. 

But they have a platform available from where they can grow 20-25 per cent for a decade. That is the kind of runway available to them. Can these Rs 4,000-5,000 crore loan book become Rs 25,000, Rs 50,000 crore? Sure, it can become, there is no reason why it should not. They have a licence to do that. The ultimate aim is to become a universal bank, SFB is only a stepping stone and some of the vetting is done by RBI for us, they have given licence only to the 10 most deserving guys. 

So out of those 10, I am sure at least two or three will emerge to become far larger and much better banks.


You own the two or three obvious names there, the ones which have just got licence from becoming a microfinance to a small bank. Is that the way to approach it, buy all three, four whatever is available?

Yes, we do own a couple of those names.


Okay, that is the best way to buy them because you do not know eventually which one would be the winner?

No. You go through their history, you see which one survived the crisis best and which one is building its liability franchisee properly, which is the one that is diversifying in its product and geography and you take a call based on that. Still that does not guarantee you success, but at least you know what you are getting into.


What would you say is the outsized bet for this year?

As for outsized bet for this year, we run a concentrated portfolio and each and every bet for us is outsized. I will not say that there is any new stock that we have bet on in a big way, but I think just coming back to the earlier theme, corporate banks and within that small regional banks, there is a real good risk reward available over there.


Autos have corrected and there is a fear that there is a slowdown but if economy comes back, the rural demand comes back, Bajaj Autos and the Eichers and the Mahindra & Mahindra’s of the world will make a comeback. The way you invest, can you spot an opportunity there or this is not the alley where you want to walk? 

No, I am not very keen on looking for opportunities immediately. I believe that the EMI-led growth or leverage led growth is going to witness a slowdown over the next 6-12 months, all this growth was led by the NBFCs and the NBFCs have tightened their purse strings by choice or maybe not by choice. 

Because of that, growth will slow down over there. I would rather go to where the end consumer is buying out of his own pocket instead of taking loans for that.


The NBFCs have avoided a cannon ball, but the cruel fact is that look there was an asset liability mismatch, they were borrowing short and they were lending long. This setup has broken, this created opportunity for good players to gain market share. Are you looking at buying something in the NBFC space?

Again, no. It is not...


But that is the place you would be hunting right now, right?

No, I think the problems have just started. 


Even in HFCs?

Maybe not in HFCs. In some of the HFCs, the asset liability mismatch is not such a big issue. Even though you sell 25-year payment but those are actually seven, eight year products and some amount of ALM mismatch is necessary for you to make your ROE over there. 

I am not buying any HFCs at the moment, but I do not think the extent of problem in some of the HFCs will be as big as some of the other NBFCs that are let us say developer loans or any such thing. I think there is a decently chunky real estate developer portfolio which is coming up and it will be recognised as an NPA over the next 12 to 24 months and the conditions are not going to get any easier in terms of funding for the NBFCs. 

I would wait, it is a situation which is in flux, I would wait to see which are the players that are going to survive, which are the players that are going to get hit and I will wait for a year or so before I can say now the NBFC crisis is well and truly behind us and we can place our bets over here.


In 2013, when we met you said if I get a million dollars right now, I would invest it right away. I can see and smell that kind of an opportunity in the market. If you get a million dollars from a client after this interview, do you have the conviction to invest it right away in your set of stocks or will you wait? 

Investing is not an issue, managing the expectation is an issue... I will invest only when there is a crisis in the market or I will invest only when I get the best combination of opportunity, entrepreneur and valuation. 

For that kind of a money, there are very few opportunities in the market but if you are somebody who has a compulsion to look for opportunities and if there is no crisis, ex of crisis I think the valuations are okay, what we need is some revival in growth going forward. 

If that is the case, a reasonable expectation of return can be met. Let us not get carried away, can I make 10x return or something like that in four, five years, surely but probably I would be more comfortable maybe three months, six months down the line where more water has flown under the bridge. 

But investing and deploying in the equities is not an issue. In fact, we are fully invested, we will probably go fully invested into the elections and we will not change our strategy just because there is an event. That can have a big impact on the market, we are planning to live through it.


The way you manage money, the election would be just one of the events?

Yes, I mean, it matters a lot to a speculator and for an investor who has a longer term horizon. I have to only see whether it is going to provide an opportunity to enter or is it going to provide me an opportunity to exit."
21,2019-01-21,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Indian stocks showed up in green early Monday, in light of tepid gains in Asian markets, after China grew at 6.4 per cent in the December quarter.

The world's second-largest economy grew by about 6.6 per cent in 2018, according to official data, the slowest annual pace China has seen since 1990.

Experts said the market was expecting weak Chinese numbers and now Beijing may announce more fiscal stimulus to support its economy, which is already reeling under the Sino-US trade war.

Back home, gains in IT, bank and financial stocks amid hopes of healthy December quarter earnings helped the market stay in positive territory.

Oil's softness in the global market also spurred buying. The rupee, however, lost weight, which opened 15 paise down at 71.34 against the dollar. 

The BSE Sensex rallied 210 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 36,597 around 9.45 am. The Nifty was up 51 points, or 0.47 per cent, at 10,958. 

Market analysts see a strong opportunity in select stocks in this current market. 

Based on brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that can potentially generate gains over the next 2-3 weeks. 


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – technical research and trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Dabur India| Buy| Target price: Rs 439| Stop loss: Rs 416
This counter appears to have formed a short-term bottom as it is repeatedly attracting buying interest around Rs 417 levels. In the last couple of sessions, the bulls have gained upper hand in this counter, which traded close to Rs 418. ""Sustaining above Rs 420, it can make an attempt to test its interim top of Rs 440. Positional traders can create fresh longs with a stop below Rs 416 on a closing basis and look for an initial target of Rs 439,"" Mohammad said.


Hero MotoCorp| Buy| Target price: Rs 3,118| Stop loss: Rs 2,855
After retracing around 80 per cent of its last leg of rally from the lows of Rs 2,648, this counter appears to be making an attempt to form a base around Rs 2,856 for quite some time. If it bottoms out around these levels, it can easily retrace by a minimum of 50 per cent of the fall from the highs of Rs 3,380. ""As the risk-reward ratios looks favourable, in anticipation of a pullback move, positional traders are advised to go long for an initial target of Rs 3,118, with a stop below Rs 2,855 on a closing basis,"" Mohammad said.


Gajendra Prabu, Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities

HCL Technologies| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,060| Stop loss: Rs 918
The stock has validated the Doji candle pattern formed on a weekly chart in the previous week (moved above candle’s high), which is confirmation of bullish reversal. The stock has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms in smaller degree, which is a bullish continuation structure. This apart, breakout of falling wedge pattern has been witnessed, which is also a bullish development. In addition, price has moved above short-term key moving average of 21-day EMA; this could add strength to bulls. ""Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price and add in dips to Rs 930 for the upside target of Rs 1,060 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 918,"" said Prabu.


Godfrey Phillips India| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,050| Stop loss: Rs 890
The stock has completed internal three wave decline from Rs 1,663 to Rs 640, which is major “wave iv”, and now, it is in the progress of “wave v” up which could initially move above Rs 1,050 (which is slightly below key swing high). Falling wedge breakout has been witnessed in a bigger picture. The stock has rebounded with strong positive divergence in RSI. Also, price is trading above all key moving averages of 21-, 50- and 200-day EMA. The stock is in the process of forming an engulfing bull candle on the monthly chart (for the yet unfinished month). ""Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price and add in dips to Rs 910 for the upside target of Rs 1,050 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 890,"" Prabu said.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

Kotak Mahindra Bank| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,380| Stop loss: Rs 1,190
The stock has more or less made a higher bottom formation pattern in the daily chart to take support at near Rs 1,200, which is also where the 50-DMA lies. It has indicated a decent turnaround to make the bias positive and has strength to rise further with the same momentum in coming days. The indicators have become favourable and the RSI is also indicating a trend reversal, signalling a buy. 


HDFC| Buy| Target price: Rs 2,170| Stop loss: Rs 1,950
The stock has been consolidating for quite some time now, gathering strength, and is on the cusp of a breakout to signify fresh upward movement in coming days. The chart looks attractive and with favourable indicators supporting, the stock is poised for an upmove. ""With decent volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 2,170, keeping a stop loss of Rs 1,950,"" said Parekh.


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager, Technical Analyst, YES Securities (India) 

Coffee Day Enterprises| Buy| Target price: Rs 325-340| Stop loss: Rs 274
On the weekly chart, Coffee Day Enterprises is approaching the neckline of a falling channel pattern placed at Rs 300. A successful breakout and a sustained trade above the channel resistance can extend the upward movement to the levels of Rs 325-340. Further, it has recently witnessed volume-backed buying, confirming the trend reversal in favour of the bulls. RSI has also turned upwards after taking support at the lower end of the bull zone i.e. 40- level and has formed a positive reversal on the daily chart suggesting bullishness dominant in the stock. ""The stock can be bought in the range of Rs 292-296 for targets of Rs 325-340, keeping a stop loss below Rs 274,"" said Agarwala.


Wipro| Buy| Target price: Rs 365-380| Stop loss: Rs 330
On the daily chart, Wipro has broken out from an ascending triangle pattern neckline on good volumes, triggering the resumption of the uptrend. Further, the stock has taken support at the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level and turned higher, affirming bulls gaining momentum. A sustained trade above Rs 345 will extend the upward movement to the levels of Rs 365-380. Moreover, the RSI has turned upwards from the 50-level after forming a positive reversal affirming bullishness. ""The stock can be bought in the range of Rs 344-348 for the targets of Rs 365-380, keeping a stop loss below Rs 330,"" said Agarwala.


Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, technical & derivatives, Angel Broking

Britannia Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 3,460| Stop loss: Rs 3,060
This FMCG giant has been a steady performer for last many years. Of late, we witnessed a consolidation in this counter which can be termed as a ‘price correction’ and was overdue for a long time. In the week gone by, we saw some buying interest coming back into the stock and in the process, it has managed to surpass the ‘falling trend line’ placed around Rs 3,180. This is a sign of strength and going ahead, the stock is expected to resume its long-term uptrend soon.


SMC Global Securities

Indraprastha Gas| Buy| Target price: Rs 300-305| Stop loss: Rs 260
The 200-Day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) of the stock, on the daily chart, is at Rs 268.89. Short-term, medium-term and long-term biases are positive for the stock as it is comfortably above important moving averages such as 100-WEMA and 200-DEMA, which indicates the uptrend for the stock. Apart from this, it was forming a 'continuation triangle' on weekly charts and has given the pattern breakout in the last traded week. It has also managed to close above the same. So, follow up buying can continue. Therefore, one can buy in the range of Rs 275-277 levels for the upside target of Rs 300-305 with a stop loss below Rs 260.

22,2019-01-22,Britannia,"MUMBAI: India Inc should aim towards a representation target of improving the gender diversity on boards to 30%, something in line with the 30% Club campaign in the UK, said several eminent corporate leaders ET spoke to. Some others argued strongly for more female members in boardrooms, but said setting an immediate target would be impractical and the focus should be on gradual progression.

“There is nothing like a target for business people and I believe aspiring to have 30% representation of women will certainly add value to Indian boards, provided there is no compromise on competence,” said former Britannia managing director Vinita Bali. “If more women on boards is not happening organically or naturally while there are enough competent women in the system, a special impetus (like a representation target) in order to get focused attention is the only way in which change will happen,” added Bali, who has been a board member at several global and Indian companies.

“Initially, women were inducted to meet regulatory requirement but now chairmen and promoters have realised that women’s participation improves effectiveness of boards,” said Arun Duggal, chairman of ratings firm ICRA.

Agencies
Duggal said individual companies should set their own targets for board composition and succession planning, rather than having a common goal.

Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairperson of Biocon, however, isn’t too much concerned about the percentage. She said: “We should stress more on independence than the percentage of women. Many public boards are already looking at improving their gender balance and such companies are more successful than others in terms of governance.”

Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw feels that companies should stress more on independence than the percentage of women. 
Last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India asked India’s top 500 listed companies to appoint at least one “independent” woman director by April 1, 2019, as per new governance guidelines notification by the market regulator.

Earlier, the Companies Act of 2013 mandated a certain class of companies to have at least one woman director. Sebi, in compliance with the Act, made this compulsory from October 2014.

The 30% Club was established in the UK in 2010 to campaign for greater representation of women — a minimum of 30% — on the boards of FTSE 100 companies. The club is currently led by Brenda Trenowden.

Some champions of gender diversity, like Zia Mody, founder and managing partner of AZB & Partners, feel that India cannot jump to 30% immediately. “It has to be gradual. It is not just about setting a target but how you reach there is important,” she said. Companies should be pushing women and creating capacity, she added. “The top and middle management — largely the male — have to understand the importance of this and mentor women to reach there,” she added.


Zia Mody, founder and managing partner of AZB & Partners, feel that India cannot jump to 30% immediately. 
Harsh Mariwala, chairman of consumer products company Marico, also has a similar view. “You can't impose a target. But it will be a gradual progress. Realisation will happen depending on the quality of women directors and to what extent they add value,” he said.


Harsh Mariwala, chairman of Marico, says, “You can't impose a target. it will be a gradual progress."" 
Numbers show that there has been a consistent increase in women’s representation in corporate India over the past three years — from 25% in 2016 to 30% in 2017 and 31% in 2018 — as per the Working Mother & AVTAR Best Companies survey for women in India. This indicates an increasing intent among companies on gender inclusion, an extrapolation of which would be gender balance at leadership levels, said Saundarya Rajesh, founder-president of the AVTAR Group, a diversity strategist.

In 2008, Norway mandated 40% representation of women on corporate boards, and several European countries followed with a 30-35% target. The European Commission has a target of 40% female representation on listed company boards by 2020.

23,2019-01-22,Britannia,"Mumbai: Shares of Britannia Industries is likely to be included in the Nifty in the upcoming index review in February as its free float market cap has increased, said analysts. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation or Bharti Infratel are likely to be excluded from the Nifty with probability being higher for exit of HPCL, they added. 

The changes are likely to come into effect from the April series, with announcement likely sometime in February. 

""Considering the average free float market capitalisation since August 1, 2018, Britannia is most likely to replace Hindustan Petroleum Corporation from the Nifty 50 stocks,"" said retail brokerage ICICIdirect in a note. 

According to guidelines, a stock may be replaced from an index in case there are compulsory changes like corporate actions, delisting etc, in which case, stock having largest free float market capitalisation and satisfying other requirements related to liquidity, turnover and free float will be considered for inclusion. The second condition is if a better stock is available in the replacement pool. The stock which is to be included in the Nifty should have at least 1.5 times the free float market capitalisation of the stock that is to be included."
24,2019-01-23,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: If the overnight drop in US stocks and technical charts are any signal, domestic market is likely to open on a tepid note, with the Nifty50 facing resistance in 10,950-10,970 range. Third quarter results of index heavyweight ITC would be in focus.

Let's check out what all might matter to Dalal Street on Wednesday:


Singapore trading sets stage for flat start 
Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 6 points, or 0.05 per cent, lower at 10,926, indicating a flat-to-negative start for the Nifty50.



Nifty forms ‘Hanging Man’ candle
Nifty50 on Tuesday snapped a 5-day winning streak and ended up forming a ‘Hanging Man’ candle on the daily chart, suggesting bulls might have started losing control. The Nifty50 structure suggests that the index still has potential to stretch towards 11,000-11,070 range to complete its last leg of the Ending Diagonal pattern. But such a move is unlikely to be a smooth one, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan.

Jaitley’s statement indicated that a package to support the farm sector was likely to be announced very soon, most likely in the upcoming budget or by early March, said Nomura India in a note. This was because the election commission would announce general elections dates in the first week of March, which would trigger the model code of conduct.

Foreign brokerage CLSA said ITC should see some relief rally as Budget is unlikely to tinker with tobacco taxation.

“The tampering or the changes in the indirect tax rates would be left with the GST council. So while there is always a chance that the GST council may take that up in its next meeting, what we have seen is that over the last 12-13 months that the tobacco taxation has been quite stable. The volume growth has therefore picked up. There is a very low likelihood of the central government making any changes to the tobacco taxation in Budget,” Mahesh Nandurkar, India Strategist, CLSA, said.

31,2019-01-28,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Dalal Street has had a weak start to an extremely important week, that will see the unveiling of the Interim Budget, rollover of F&O contracts, US Fed’s rate-setting meeting and some major earnings announcements.

The Finance Minister will present the Vote on Account to Parliament on February 1, Friday, for the first three months of the new financial year before the new government presents a full-fledged Budget in July. 

The domestic stock market may have to endure bouts of volatility as January series futures & options contracts expire on Thursday. Then, earnings of some top companies like Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, HDFC, HCL Technologies, Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India are lined up. The US Fed will hold its first monetary policy meet of 2019 on January 29-30. 

Amid all the unpredictability, analysts see strong opportunities in select stocks. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that can potentially generate gains over the next 2-3 weeks. 


Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities

HCL Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,065 | Stop loss: Rs 905This stock was moving in a larger consolidation band in the last few weeks. Recently, it made a failed attempt of moving above the upper consolidation area of Rs 980-990 levels. Friday’s session saw emergence of buying interest on the counter at low levels amid volatility in the broader market. Volumes rose during the upward move and weekly the momentum oscillator showed a positive momentum. 


Havells India | Buy | Target price: Rs 775 | Stop loss: Rs 655This stock witnessed a sharp upward move last week, after showing gradual weakness in the previous few weeks. The stock is currently making an attempt to break out on the upside from previous high at Rs 716. The weekly 14-period RSI has turned up from above 60 level, which indicates that the strength in the upside momentum is increasing. 


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist, Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Deepak Fertilizers | Buy | Target price: Rs 135 | Stop loss: Rs 104This counter appears to have registered a price and volume breakout from deeply oversold levels, as it saw a vertical fall to Rs 104 level from the recent high of Rs 147. Friday’s strong comeback can be the beginning of a serious pullback. In such a scenario, a target of Rs 138 can’t be ruled out going forward. “Positional traders should adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying at current levels and shall prefer to add on lower levels further close to Rs 110 and look for a target of Rs 135 with a stop loss below Rs 104,"" Mohammad said.


Castrol India | Buy | Target price: Rs 179 | Stop loss: Rs 160Recent price behaviour on this counter looked interesting as there was a brief pause after the recent swift upward move from the low of Rs 151 to Rs 169 in just two sessions. As this move is sustaining above the 200-day moving average in this consolidation phase, one can initiate long positions and look for initial targets of Rs 179 as long as this stock stays above the Rs 162 level. Stop loss for this trade should be below Rs 160 on a closing basis.


Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Technical & Derivatives, Angel Broking

Godfrey Phillips India | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,020 | Stop loss: Rs 914Last three months have been fantastic for this high-beta stock. The daily chart shows a series of ‘higher highs and higher lows’ and in the process, the stock has finally broken out of the trend line hurdle at Rs 930 with some authority. Importantly, this move was supported by humongous volumes, providing credence to the price action. Post this, the stock saw some consolidation but this can be a good buying opportunity. 


Britannia Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,460 | Stop loss: Rs 3,060This FMCG giant has been a steady performer since last many years. “Of late, we witnessed a consolidation in this counter which can be termed as a ‘price correction’ and was overdue since a long time. Last week, we saw some buying interest coming back into the stock and in the process; it has managed to surpass the ‘falling trend line’ placed around Rs 3,180,” the analyst said. This is a sign of strength. Going ahead, the stock is expected to resume its long term upward trend soon, he said. 


Kaveri Seed Company | Buy | Target price: Rs 642 | Stop loss: Rs 564This stock has been consolidating of late and struggling to surpass its ‘falling trend line’ resistance at around Rs 580. On Friday, despite the broader market remaining under severe pressure, this stock managed to buck the trend and in the process, went on to cross this hurdle; thereby confirming a breakout from the ‘bullish cup and handle’ pattern on the daily chart. In addition, more than double the average daily volume on the same day provided credence to the move. 


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher

IRB Infrastructure Developers | Buy | Target price: Rs 166 | Stop loss: Rs 140This stock has gradually slipped and corrected to Rs 142 level from the peak of Rs 169 and formed a bullish positive candle to make the chart look attractive. The RSI has indicated a trend reversal and has signalled a buy rating to maintain the bias positive. “With rising volume, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 166, keeping a stop loss of Rs 140,” Parekh said.


Jubilant Foodworks | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,330 | Stop loss: Rs 1,150After the short erosion, this stock has taken support near the Rs 1,160 level where it had maintained a good base on previous occasions too, and has seen a bounce with a positive bias. The RSI has shown a trend reversal to signify strength. It has the potential to rise further, maintaining the same momentum in the coming days. “With good volume participation, we recommend a buy rating in this stock for an upside target of Rs 1,330, keeping a stop loss of Rs 1,150,” Parekh said.


Kkunal Parar, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking

Tata Consultancy Services | Buy | Target price: Rs 745-755 | Stop loss: Rs 690On the daily chart, this stock is on a verge of breaking out of its neckline of cup & handle formation, which is a continuation formation and indicates robust upside. Moreover, the stock has been trading with strong support from the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, which suggest a positive trend. Daily momentum indicator RSI reading of 54.45 with a positive crossover and RSI breakout of its downward sloping trend line point out for a positive breadth for the stock.

32,2019-01-29,Britannia,"A 26 per cent annual compounded return can grow your portfolio 10 times in 10 years! Sounds mouth-watering? 

Ambit Capital on Tuesday listed 30 ‘great’ stocks that it said can multiply investor wealth by 10 times in the coming years.

The list included Nilkamal, La Opala RG, Avenue Supermarts, Maruti Suzuki, Kansai Nerolac, PVR, Venky’s India, Sudarshan Chemicals, Torrent Power, Sheela Foam, Godrej Agrovet, JB Chemical, WABCO India, Heidelberg Cements, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Advanced Enzymes, Johnson Control, CCL Products, Natco Pharma and Jyothy Lab. 

Seven other stocks on the list were Timken India, Atul, Whirlpool India, Britannia Industries, Sundram Fasteners, 3M India, Kajaria Ceramics.


OthersSource: Ambit Capital
The brokerage defined ‘great’ stocks as those which have been showing incremental capex, efficiency in capital employed, pricing discipline, steady cash generation, PAT improvement, solid balance sheet and steady improvement and above-median sales.

The greatness framework includes companies that invest capital, turn investment into sales, turn sales into profit, turn profit into balance sheet strength, turn all of that into free cash flow and invest free cash flow again.

Back-tested data showed such stocks have delivered superior returns in the longer run. During 2004-19, such companies outperformed the entire stock universe by 3.5 per cent per annum (on an average) and the BSE500 index by 5.7 per cent, Ambit said.


OthersSource: Ambit  Capital
To determine whether a particular stock is cheap or not, Ambit categorises these stocks into buckets based on their relative attractiveness on valuations with respect to their own history.

“We compare these firms with respect to their five-year average valuations on three metrics – price-to-book, price-to-earnings and EV/Ebitda.”

The brokerage found only 21 of these stocks inexpensive, but said from a long-term perspective, all 30 remain potential ten-bagger candidates. 

Ambit has bottom-up coverage on Maruti Suzuki and PVR with ‘buy’ ratings.

A similar 10-bagger list published by the brokerage on January 15, 2018 slipped 9 per cent in last one year. 

Ambit also released a list of 15 smallcaps than can become ten-baggers over time. The list included Bhansali Engineering, Menon Bearings, Kennametal India, Lumax Industries, Matrimony.com, Foseco India, NR Agarwal Industries, Harita Seating, Multibase India, Valiant Organics, Orient Refractories, Shemaroo Entertainment, India Glycols, Ruchil Décor and Deccan Cement. 

As a rider, the brokerage said it is not necessary all the stocks highlighted through this process are going to be individually ten-baggers. “We ask investors to own the portfolio for 10 years. Here we churn this equally-weighted portfolio annually. The objective behind this process is to try and generate 26 per cent CAGR over a 10-year holding period by buying companies that are improving on ‘greatness’ count as well as on accounting scores,” the brokerage said."

0,2019-02-04,Britannia,"Our house view has been positive on consumption and that gets reinforced after the budget. Incrementally we are 
  
  
  more bullish on auto after a very strong correction last year, Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, MOSL, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

Do you think the Dewan Housing issue has the potential to snowball into an IL&FS kind of a situation?
It is an evolving situation and as we have seen with IL&FS crisis, markets do get nervous around it. We will have to keep watching what happens there because it has implication for the other participants in the system. It is very tough to take a call right now. As far as NBFCs are concerned, the cost of fund situation has gone up and liquidity has been tightening for last couple of months. 

Our view has been that in 2019, it is very important to be cautious on this space. We have HDFC and LIC Housing Finance in our model portfolio and that is what we will stick with. We did increase weight on LIC Housing Finance recently post budget along with increasing the weights on some of the banks and consumption stocks.

What is the outlook is on the consumption space? We did see that a major push came to the space as a whole. Purely from consumption standpoint, how do you see the overall metrics changing and spending picking up as a whole?
We have been quite positive on consumption. Leaving aside the Budget, in last 15-20 days, the results of consumption-oriented stocks have been extremely strong -- be it staples or discretionary. While valuations are expensive, these are the stocks which are going to outperform even in current year because we are going into an event which is very important from the markets point of view. Our view is that one should be a little more defensive, going into the election this year because markets wise, valuations are not very favourable. 

Secondly, the budget just reinforces the very strong consumption environment. Please remember that Rs 6,000 per annum is not a one-off kind of thing and it is going to be very difficult for any government in future to withdraw the scheme. 

Logically, one should only expect that this Rs 6,000 will just keep on increasing either in line with inflation or some such number every year. So, it plays a very strong stimulus for consumption. At Rs 75,000 crore, it is not a very big sum, but given the structural nature of this kind of handouts, these are going to help consumption even in the long run, more so, from low-ticket consumption view point. 

We have been very positive on Hindustan Lever, Titan, Britannia and Pidilite and that view stays. In fact, Titan just reported on Friday a very stellar set of numbers. Another quarter of earnings upgrade and market share gains which are continuing. Our house view has been positive on consumption and that gets reinforced after the budget. Incrementally we are more bullish on auto after a very strong correction last year. 

We like the four-wheeler space more. Given the relatively low competitive intensity and very sharp correction in Maruti that we have seen in the last 12 months, we have increased the weight on Maruti in our model portfolio on Friday.


What is your view on the broader end of the market? Do you think that when it comes to the general trend this year, it is going to be a pre-May and a post-May sort of trend given the general elections? Would you approach midcaps very differently in the first and the second half?
Absolutely. I mean this will be a story of two halves, however, clichéd this may sound. As far as midcap is concerned, I agree that in last 12 months, we have seen midcaps getting battered. It has brought down the premium that midcaps had to largecap. If you go back 12 months in January 18, the premium of midcap to largecap was roughly 50% to 60% and that has now come down to 10-15% at index level. 

While it is still at a premium and therefore slightly tricky to tackle, given the correction that we have seen, there are some interesting bottom-up opportunities in midcaps which are now available. This was not the case 12 months back, where touching midcap was very difficult given the valuations that they were trading at. 

Now that has opened up a bit of a space for any stock allocator to hunt for bottom-up midcap ideas. Secondly, as far as broader market view is concerned, this is a year which is going to be in a tight range with elevated volatility because at 10,700, 10,800, we are still trading at around 17.5 to 18.5 time one year forward band which is not very cheap. 

At the same time, it is not exorbitantly expensive. The only thing that has changed in the last one month is that the corporate earnings have been very strong whether it is on the consumption side or whether it is on the corporate bank side. Our view is that this is a year where you have to be a little more defensive, play through three-four important sectors which are consumption, private banks, select NBFCs, auto and IT to an extent. 

I am still not very positive on other sectors which are more capex driven or dependent on the economic cycle. Though we have been hearing about green shoots in capex, it is not yet reflected in numbers. My approach is to be in sectors where there is quality and earnings visibility. I am willing to make a mistake on valuation rather than on business side. 


And you think these parameters that you just talked about are all conjoining for autos right now? Within autos, while valuations have corrected off the peaks, where do you see some growth finally kicking in?
We are not going to see any big recovery in auto in a hurry. The stock price correction has given enough room now to do more detailed bottom-up analysis on a lot of these stocks which were very expensive 12 months back. What we like in that space are more four- wheelers given that the competitive intensity is relatively less intense there compared to two- wheelers. 

Secondly, for a stock like Maruti which has seen big combination of headwinds battering its margin in the third quarter, incrementally we are expecting those margins to gradually inch upward starting from fourth quarter itself. That is one stock which is our top idea in that space.

The other tactical play could be M&M given that again that stock has seen a big correction in the last 12 months and now that there are some handouts for farmers, for middle class, sentiment could be positive around M&M while valuations are very cheap. 

You may not see any big earnings upgrade in that space but there could be some re-rating there given that the broader context for the auto and farming side has changed a little bit after the budget. In two-wheelers, we are still very cautious on both Bajaj and Hero. I still think that there is very little room left for re-rating unless we see a big margin or a big volume surprise there, which is very difficult right now. 

Eicher is one name where incrementally I am now more positive. Even there, one has to keep watching the RE number on a monthly basis before getting too excited. We have seen what happens to the two-wheeler stocks in the last decade after their glory days are over. I would not be in a hurry to even buy Eicher. Right now to summarise our view on auto, we are more positive on four-wheelers."

10,2019-02-08,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities suffered heavy losses on Friday, following weak trends in most global peers, as bleak economic data from Europe and lack of any sign of a resolution to the US-China trade tussle spooked investor sentiment. 

The European Commission on Thursday slashed its growth forecast for the euro zone this year and the next, stoking concerns that a global slowdown is spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grapple with trade friction, Reuters reported. 

“The market is reacting to global cues in the absence of any significant domestic trigger,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities. Besides, investors are taking extremely calculated steps ahead of the general elections. 

Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC, said there is wariness in the market about the general elections, which may cause some volatility in the short-term. 

Sensex plunged 425 points, or 1.15 per cent, to close at 36,546, extending the losses into the second successive session. Nifty suffered a loss of 126 points, or 1.14 per cent, to close at 10,943.

Board meetings"
9,2019-02-08,Britannia,"Money in the pockets of the rural consumers certainly will trigger demand for products like ours, Varun Berry, MD, Britannia Industries, tells ET Now.Edited excepts: 
  
  

After three quarters of double-digit volume growth, why do you have relatively slower growth numbers this time? What caused it?
First of all, post Diwali there was certainly a slowdown. Plus, Diwali also shifted from October to November which set us back because the factories shut down. People after binging during Diwali, like to take a little break from eating. That’s what happened but what we have seen is that the demand seems to be coming back after going down slightly in November and December. I think, it was temporary. Money in the pockets of the rural consumers certainly will trigger demand for products like ours.


Are you of the view that the slowdown which you saw in the quarter gone by was just a one quarter phenomenon or could this be structural? Would it be difficult for you to go back to double digit growth for a couple of quarters?
I would not call that a slowdown. A double-digit growth for a company of our size in revenue terms is fairly good but yes, we did not get our volume growth in double digits, which I think was temporary. 

I do think that things will certainly get better and I am hoping that it is just the shifting of Diwali which got those volumes a little below par as far as we would say. I do think that in an election year, consumption is on an uptrend and so we are hoping that things would get back to where they were.


You are sounding confident. I do not see urgency in your voice which means that you are not worried about the decline. So, you will not cut the prices?
No, no, I do not think there is anything like that. It is fairly good. 11% growth is fairly good and even a double-digit volume growth should come through with consumption picking up as we are in an election year. So yes, I am saying that.


Let us talk about your two categories; the dairy category and the bakery category. Where are these two categories headed? Given the volatility in milk prices and since there is intense competition, where is the dairy category headed?
The dairy category is a very small part of our business but we are seeing a very good growth here. It is coming from two categories; a)milk shakes under the Winkin Cow brand which was launched about six months back and we have seen some phenomenal numbers coming through that. They are great products if you have not tried them, please try them and they are doing really well. As we get into March-April and May, we are going to launch a very high decibel advertising. We are looking forward to a very successful year with Winkin Cow. 

b) The second part of dairy is cheese where we are also seeing good demand surge. Our products are doing well in urban areas. We have not really gone rural with those products but we are seeing some good demand coming through from cheese. 

So those are the two categories which are giving us momentum as far as dairy is concerned. 

Coming to the bakery category; the YTD numbers show we have grown in double digits as far as biscuits is concerned. As far as cakes is concerned, we have really launched our value-added products. So we have launched Swiss rolls and layer cakes and we have changed the visual identity of our cake products

Our products are truly international, they are very good products and we have just launched them a month back and we are seeing a very good velocity for our products. Going beyond that, we are nearly at the end of our commercialisation journey as far as croissants is concerned. It is a little delayed because it took a little more time to stabilise the line but we are just about a month away from again a very solid, a very decibel launch of filled croissants through a joint venture with a Greek company which is going to go into the market next month. 

We have got some very exciting products as we hit the next financial year and we will get a full year benefit of launching all these products in the market.


Your gross margins they have expanded in the quarter gone by but you are also seeing signs of a moderate inflation trickling in as well. Could this be a challenge on margins going forward?
The inflation last year was fairly manageable and it was not a very high inflation. This year, it all depends on the government’s policies as we go towards the elections but we are hoping that even this year it is going to be a manageable inflation between 4% and 5%. 

Those are the numbers which we can manage. It is those surges of 8-10% inflation which worry us. If you look at the basket of products this year, we have had high inflation as far as wheat is concerned and the other areas have been fairly stable or in fact deflationary. 

As we go forward, we will have to study how it goes but according to our estimates we do not think that there is going to be a very high inflation even in the coming financial year.


You have done a lot of cost cutting and I have been tracking Britannia with a magnifying glass. Margins have expanded, cost reductions have happened, co-packing culture has changed. You have set large capacities, how much more can you go in terms of cost cutting initiatives?
Indian companies have always operated with the top line in view and hence there is always a high accumulation of fat in most companies. If you go really behind it in a structured manner, you will find fat of many years. In fact, we are looking at a 2% cost saving initiative coming up year after year. Every year, we see challenges and every year we deliver. 

I am confident that this can go on for another three to five years without any problems because the way 
 we are doing it in a scientific way, the way we are going after these cost savings is a very good way of getting the team together to find these issues and then go and address them. I do not think we are at the end of the tunnel."
7,2019-02-08,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Britannia Industries fell over 2 per cent in morning trade on Friday after it acknowledged a slowdown in market place in recent months in a BSE filing.

11,2019-02-11,Britannia,"Britannia Industries is working on initial plans to set up a separate entity and team over the next six months to invest in startups and emerging companies across categories and platforms. “We will consider looking at infusing small investments in startups across platforms; the details are being worked out,” Britannia managing director Varun Berry said. The entity could be on similar lines as other consumer goods makers Unilever Ventures and Marico, both of which have dedicated arms to invest in emerging companies.

While Unilever Ventures is the venture capital and private equity arm of Unilever, Marico Innovation Foundation invests in startups through a scale-up programme.

Over the last two years, the startups space has been a hunting ground for established consumer goods companies. While oral care giant Colgate Palmolive Asia Pacific invested in men’s grooming products maker The Bombay Shaving Company mid last year, Parachute hair oil maker Marico acquired stake in another men’s grooming brand Beardo in 2017. Emami too picked up stake in BrillareScience, an Ahmedabad-based startup that makes hair and skin care products and sells them to professional salons. Analytics and technology firm Tracxn said in a report that funding for FMCG startups went up to Rs 240 crore in 2017, fuelled by an exploding base of people shopping online and higher disposable incomes.

Berry said while the company witnessed a slowdown post Diwali, demand has returned and the slew of measures announced in the interim budget on February 1is expected to trigger rural consumption over the next two quarters. “We expect double-digit volume growth with consumption picking up as we are in an election year. We hope inflation will be under 5% as we head towards elections, but it will depend on the government’s policies.”

For the third quarter ended December 2018, Britannia announced net profit growth of 14% year-on-year at Rs 300 crore, and a 7% rise in volume growth, marginally lower than street expectations, after three quarters of double-digit volume growth. However, on a three-year average which includes the demonetisation year, growth has been higher than Dabur (6.8%) and HUL (5.7%).

Berry said expansion in rural markets, accelerating innovation, portfolio premiumisation and bridging gaps in its bakery and snacking businesses would be core focus priorities.

Industry experts said a slew of startups which have emerged in areas such as supply chain logistics, distribution and financial technology to ensure seamless transactions between trade channels, are also attractive buys for consumer goods companies. A new report by Bain & Co said India, China and South Korea are leading global online retail expansion across sectors on the back of increased consumption, with the Asian region growing at three times the global rate. The report says that between 2013-2017, India grew at a compound annual growth rate of 53%, in comparison to China’s 33% and the US which grew 12%."

15,2019-02-14,Britannia,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: American breakfast cereal giant Kellogg's — also the world’s second-largest snack foods company — is eyeing a stake in India’s leading snack maker Haldiram’s, as it seeks to diversify its local portfolio nearly 25 years after entering the market. Both sides are in talks under an exclusivity agreement that would lapse this month end, said people close to the groups as well as the talks.

Haldiram’s operates out of three hubs of Delhi, Nagpur and Kolkata, after the Agarwal family split the business geographically among themselves in the 1990s. They are all descendants of Gangabhisan ‘Bhujiawala’ Agarwal, who began his entrepreneurial journey with a sole shop in Bikaner, Rajasthan, in 1937.

The ongoing talks involve two of the three branches of the company — Delhi-based Haldiram Ethnic Foods and its affiliates, and Nagpur based Haldiram’s Food International and affiliates that cater to the western and southern markets.

The two businesses are believed to be valued at around $3 billion (Rs 20,000 crore), excluding the restaurants business.

Ashish Agarwal, MD of Haldiram Ethnic Foods, declined to comment on market speculation.

“As per our policy, we don’t comment on rumours or speculation regarding potential acquisitions, JVs or divestitures,” a spokesperson for Kellogg India said in an email reply.

Michigan-based Kellogg is believed to be pressing for a 51% stake in the two divisions while the Agarwal family is not keen to cede control and prefers a 25% dilution. Several management meetings have taken place between the top officials of both sides. The eastern faction of the family that manages Haldiram Bhujiawala from Kolkata is not part of the transaction. It is also the smallest of the three. The Delhi and Nagpur divisions, together, are expected to end FY19 with sales of Rs 4,500-5,000 crore and profit of Rs 450-550 crore.


CAPITAL-RAISING OPTIONS
There is no guarantee that a deal will fructify. Kellogg has been in negotiations intermittently with the Agarwal family for close to a year, and multiple sources said talks seemed to have picked up pace recently. But they also said several members of the family are holding out and are keen on an initial public offering to get a better valuation.

“The family elders are still very hands-on in all aspects. Plus, their father is still alive. So selling the family silver that was started by their forefathers is as much an emotional call as it is strategic,” said an official who is directly involved. He sought anonymity as the talks are still in the private domain. “Kellogg has been very keen, but they would want to consolidate the accounts by taking 51% in the company.”



Industry analysts said the biggest challenge is the ongoing dispute over the brand ownership and trademark. The estranged Kolkata faction, which operates primarily in West Bengal, has dragged the other two sides to court. The decade-long legal battle is currently in the Supreme Court.

Many others added that the group’s complex corporate structure with several subsidiaries and group entities could be challenging to grasp for a multinational company. Further, cash dealings are commonplace in the sector.

Deutsche Bank is involved in the transaction along with law firm Khaitan & Company. EY and Control Risk too are believed to be involved in diligence.

In the past, the Delhi division — the biggest of the three — and the Nagpur arm have together flirted with private equity funds to raise capital, but never actually inked a deal.

Marquee PE players such as Capital International, General Atlantic, TA Associates and Everstone had held extensive negotiations with the family even till 2016-17. Prior to that, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi had courted the Agarwals seeking a buyout, but the family had rebuffed the offers.


BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS
Kellogg’s $13-billion parent has been pushing inorganic growth, especially in emerging markets, to take its portfolio beyond breakfast to overall snacks. In 2012, Kellogg became the world’s second-largest snack food company after PepsiCo by acquiring the potato crisps brand Pringles from Procter & Gamble for $2.7 billion in a cash deal.

Over the past few years, the wholly owned subsidiary of Kellogg’s in India has done well and managed to achieve profitable growth. It reported sales of Rs 834.7 crore and net profit of Rs 64.52 crore for the year ended March 31, 2017. Its sales have grown 16% and EBITDA by 30% CAGR over the past five years.

India contributes 10% to Kellogg’s Asia-Pacific revenue and leads the Indian breakfast space with an estimated share of over 60%. However, deep-pocketed rivals like Nestle, PepsiCo, Britannia and MTR are looking to challenge that.

To chase growth, Kellogg’s new managing director in India Mohit Anand, a former Unilever hand, has been pushing localisation and on-the-go consumption, penetrating small towns and markets with smaller packs of cereal at price points of Rs 5 and Rs 10, and looking to broadbase distribution. The company was also pursuing the Horlicks deal last year for its first M&A in India."
16,2019-02-19,Britannia,"The bond market has to feel more stable and reasonable for stability to return, Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete 
   
   
   Circle Consultants, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Could there be a crisis of confidence over the next few weeks?
There are some concerns which continue to linger on. I am great believer in the bond market and the yields are the lead indicator for equity markets. When the yield curve inverted, the US market saw some correction. In India, with inflation being at 2%, a rate cut by RBI and repo rate being 6.25%, the 10-year yields are still 7.50-7.60% for the government and for quasi government and AAA issue are at 8.50%. If you do the maths, you are actually borrowing 600 bps more if you take inflation at 2% which technically means you are completely crowding out the market and it is virtually shut for the private borrowers. 

These spreads have to come down for a better sense of stability to come in. In the Asian bond market, we have seen about eight big names moving from investment to junk, one of them being Bharti. The bond market has to feel more stable and reasonable for stability to return. The earnings season was good before Tata Motors surprised with that kind of a loss but one good sign is we are seeing volume growth in a few pockets. 

We are also seeing some pockets of good earnings growth whether those are corporate banks, some of the FMCG names and some of the discretionary stuff. Those are the pockets one can look at but be overweight on fixed income for now and then gradually get into equity.


We are seeing some of the metal majors moving up. We have seen brief spurts of buying across these stocks. Why do you feel it is still best to stay away from metal stocks?
If one has to be tactical, one can take some calls on the basis of tariff announcements by the government. My hypothesis is that the global macro picture is looking weak. We are staring at another global slowdown, China is 50% of the commodity demand. With that global economic backdrop, it is difficult to maintain for a sustained rise in commodity prices, but there are a few good plays and some of them are pretty attractive. Hindalco, for example, has cash on its balance sheet and at 8 PE, it is mouth watering in terms of taking some exposures. But too many variables are at play to predict the price and so this is not a market to be very adventurous. You should be at places where there is clear earnings growth, pricing power and as little regulatory intervention as possible.


What do you do with ICICI Bank, the biggest consensus trade in the street but unfortunately the stock has not quite convincingly managed to push beyond Rs 350-360. Can it be bought afresh and accumulated even at these levels?
It did go up before the entire CBI episode happened and there were a lot of views there. The market right now gets extremely wary when there is any governance issues. Even the broader portfolios, the larger mutual fund portfolios, the PMS portfolios are seeing addition of both ICICI and Axis. 

In ICICI, the de-risking continues. The retail loan book, which was 35% of the overall loan book in 2012-13, now stands at almost 55%. I expect interest and other reversals to come in with the NCLT recoveries. 

The treasury income also should be supportive with rate cut and RBI announcing an OMO on Thursday for another Rs 12,000 crore. There is a lot of focus on CASA. I keep on meeting a lot of regional and market heads and there is a lot of focus on operating parameters and growing verticals by 20%. I am extremely positive on both ICICI Bank and Axis.


What about YES Bank? Ravneet Gill is in and there was a clean chit from the RBI on divergence as well. But would you that there is still a niggling issue because RBI is alleging that full disclosures were not made. Could it go beyond a penalty or a fine?
If you have added YES Bank at about Rs 170 odd levels, you could stay put. Fresh positions right now would be a little risky considering that there could be a regulatory action. 


RBI really pulled up YES Bank, saying reporting no divergence is not an achievement, this has to be business as usual for banks. So, that event will unfold but clearly on the leadership front, on the board-room battles, on some of the other overhangs you may see some respite on those fronts. 

Their unsecured lending book is still pretty high. Unlike other banks, their NIMs are slightly lesser. Compared to an HDFC or SBI others, their NIMs are a little lower and there is some stray rumours on round tripping of some loans and some assets going on. So, you could be a little tactical. I would be taking fresh exposure because there is a regulatory overhang here but somebody who has entered at a lower level, can stay put for now. 


On ground, what is the status? How is the real estate sector shaping up? Does this move in DLF and some of the real estate stock prices, justified?
Not really and so there could be a bit of a relief rally because of the GST council meet and talks of the GST coming down from 12% to 5% and maybe slightly lesser for affordable housing. The overall scenario is still pretty grim. 

I stay in NCR and I do not see inventory levels reducing and in fact it is at an all-time high. Also there is some mild pickup on the commercial side especially properties with are rental yielding in some pockets in Noida, Gurgaon. In areas like Connaught Place, we are seeing some leasing and some commercial property transactions happening. 

But the overhang continues and there is stress. Already, some of the NBFCs with high exposure to the developers are suffering. So this is best avoided. You can be a little tactical here but that would be a trading call. 

Some of the better names in this space which are non-Delhi could be Godrej, Oberoi Realty and Sobha with better executions, low debt ratios and lesser inventory as well as great execution track record.


When it comes to the FMCG pack, there is a lot of focus on Britannia, Dabur. Is there any rationale behind it? We have seen some margin pressure on some of these names. What is the potential return one can expect on some of these counters?
The entire space is not very homogenous and I will give you two perspectives. One is from the fundamental side, which is long term and the second from immediate earnings and volume growth. 

In India the distribution reach is very understated. Cadbury in India has a 70% market share. Nestle is the world leader in confectionaries. But since Cadbury moved in earlier and had a wider distribution reach, it continues to command. Same is the case for Lever. In China, P&G moved earlier and it is the leader but in India, HUL is clearly ahead of P&G. The deep distribution network is usually understated and because the bottom of the pyramid is so deep, it becomes very difficult to dislodge somebody who has a first-mover advantage. 

Coming to Britannia, broadly 80% of the business is basically biscuits, 15% is rusk and other cakes and the balance 5% is bakery and other products. Now biscuits is a $4-billion market which I think is too less. The market will probably become 2X to 3X over next three to five years. 

On revenue side, Britannia has a market share of 21% but Parle clearly leads on the value front. So 75% revenue comes from the premium segment which is cookies which is where the leader is. For Parle, it is other way. More than 50% comes from the plain biscuits category. In the Hindi heartland where I come from, the market share is one-fifth of Parle. 

Britannia really is doing well. Their operating margins have improved from 6% some seven-eight years back to almost 14-15%. I expect the volume growth to continue double digit and so despite expensive valuations, you will see both volume and earnings growth in Britannia and some of the other names including Bata report very good numbers which is not exactly FMCG but again is a consumption story.


What is your perspective on some of the sugar names or related ethanol stories like Praj. We have seen a big move in the entire segment. Where can one find value after the recent runup in the stocks?
The MSP hike has been recent and the ethanol story is here to stay. As I said. the portfolio has to be divided into two parts -- one is fundamental which we want to probably accumulate over next few months leading up to elections and one is tactical. 

So sugar because of the MSP in ethanol, oil marketing companies (OMCs) whenever there us a reasonable correction in crude, some of the metal names we just discussed -- in this pocket, one has to be tactical. You have to decide your entry and exit levels and accordingly devise the portfolio. It is difficult to take a fundamental view because of regulatory actions now and then."

18,2019-02-20,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Ending its longest losing streak in nearly eight years, equity barometer Sensex made an impressive comeback on Wednesday, as investors lapped up shares at relatively cheaper prices. 

A 404-point rally for the Sensex came on the back of across-the-board buying, mirroring a positive bias in overseas markets. Most Asian markets climbed higher on hopes of a US-China trade deal and expectations of the US Fed’s soft money policy stance.

The US dollar softened against its global peers ahead of the release of Fed’s January rate review minutes. A stronger rupee and a fall in Brent crude prices rekindled investors’ risk appetite.

Sensex closed 404 points, or 1.14 per cent, higher at 35,756, with only four stocks - Hero MotoCorp (down 0.56 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (down 0.30 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 0.16 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (down 0.08 per cent) - ending in the red. 

NSE’s Nifty rose 131 points, or 1.24 per cent, to 10,735. Midcaps and smallcap followed Sensex and climbed up to 1 per cent on BSE.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

22,2019-02-22,Britannia,"Salil Parekh, CEO & MD, Infosys, Rishad Premji, Chairman, Nasscom and Varun Berry, MD, Britannia Industries, in conversation with ET Now, at Nasscom Forum 2019. Edited excerpts:


How has new technologis changed business?

Salil Parekh: There is a huge change in the way large enterprises are viewing the business environment and in that change because of all the new digital technologies, there is ability to make impact which is far greater today than it was in the past. 

They are viewing their own clients or customers in different ways. There are five broad themes that are helping them to do it. There is a theme around how experience is driven for their own customers that makes the change more relevant. How people used the technology. There is a whole theme on data and because large enterprises can access and use data in different ways, they are able to make that change and there are other themes for example on cloud, on IoT, on security which are making these changes available. 

In today’s world, the way to strengthen the core is to make these digital changes, these disruptions more and more relevant to these enterprises and also public sector entities.


Things are changing and it is no longer a segment that you are serving or a segment that the product goes to. Technology has unbundled those segments to a great extent and which is why processes are not working. How are you going to qualify companies like an Uber or an Amazon today? How do corporations figure out who your client is?

Rishad Premji: I do not think fundamentally customers have changed. I do not think the expectations that customers have, either have changed. All customers want quality and service. They want functioning products. What has dramatically changed is access to those customers. With mobile penetration and data, there are young digitally native AI born companies that can then access those customers. 

What is fundamentally changing is enterprises which historically had control on those customers. Many enterprises actually did not organise themselves from the perspective of the consumer or their customer. They often organise themselves from the perspective of the organisation or the enterprise. If I think about a bank, nobody thought about an account opening process without somebody having to walk into a branch or deal with the teller.

If I thought about hospitality, digitally checking in or if I thought about a pharma company, thinking about life beyond the pill. What it is fundamentally forcing these enterprises to do is to reorganise themselves in a very human centric manner with the customer is at the centre of it. That is a profound change for a bank and for me that is in many ways the digital change.


You have got to straddle through two words; one is extremely brick and mortar that continues to survive and then there is this disruptive ecommerce and which is where you customers are. How do you straddle both words and still continue to be relevant?

Varun Berry: I am in a very simple business, we make food and fill peoples’ stomachs. You have just got to get the right products at the right price. So what are the filters that we go through? Any product that we launch has to be far enough for the consumer to be excited about, but close enough for them to be able to purchase it. 

Second is, it has got to be a part of their daily ritual, it cannot be very far away from my daily ritual because that vitiates the relationship with the consumer. And third is the Indian consumer will never change. The Indian consumer is value conscious."
24,2019-02-25,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Strong global sentiment on signs of a possible US-China trade deal helped equity indices Sensex and Nifty close with healthy gains on Monday. 

Equity benchmark Sensex opened higher and built on the gains gradually on a fresh spell of buying across sectors, led by IT, bank and auto. 

Rupee's rise against the US dollar also boosted risk appetite as investors awaited key macro numbers, including GDP and infrastructure output prints. 

The 30-share pack settled 342 points, or 0.95 per cent, higher at 36,213. Nifty rose 88 points, or 0.82 per cent, to 10,880. 

Midcaps and smallcaps rose but trailed Sensex in terms of percentage gains. The BSE Midcap index closed 0.43 per cent higher, while BSE Smallcap index gained 0.74 per cent. 


Let's take a look at the highlights of Monday's session: 


Investors get richer by Rs 96k crore
Monday's rally added Rs 96,000 crore to investor kitty as cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms jumped to Rs 1,40,42,922 crore from Rs 1,39,46,745 crore on Friday. 


215 stocks hit circuits
As many as 215 stocks hit their upper circuits on BSE even as the same number of stocks also hit lower circuits. Among those that hit upper circuits included Swan Energy, Kwality, Orient Press, Dharani Sugars & Chemicals, Magadh Sugar & Energy and SORIL Infra Resources. Atlas Jewellery India, Niyogin Fintech, Tinna Trade, Adroit Infotech, Darshan Orna and Adroit Infotech were among the stocks that hit lower circuits. 


Wipro jumps to 19-year high 
Shares of IT major Wipro closed 1.86 per cent higher at Rs 386, its highest close in 19 years. The stock rallied after the company said it had received approval for an increase in authorised share capital and issue of bonus shares from majority of its shareholders.


RCom shares crack 8%
Snapping the winning run of two days, shares of Reliance Communications closed 8.10 per cent down at Rs 6.01. The stock came under a fresh spell of selling pressure after Axis Trustee said more shares of Reliance Communications have been pledged with it, taking the total to 9.18 per cent. 


BEL gains on order win
Shares of Bharat Electronics (BEL) closed 2.73 per cent higher at Rs 80.85 after it confirmed export orders valued about $33 million from Elbit Systems ElectroOptics Elop for manufacture and supply of next-generation EOIR payloads and another variant of EOIR payload for airborne applications. 


Jet Airways stock falls 3%
Shares of Jet Airways fell 3.19 per cent to Rs 229, breaking the winning streak of three consecutive sessions. The stock fell after reports that SBI was planning to approach NCLT to recover its loan from the beleaguered airline. However, a Reuters report said SBI denied any such move and termed the reports speculative. 


Adani Ports tanks 8%
Shares of Adani Ports and SEZ plunged 8.26 per cent to Rs 324.85 after several brokerages pointed out that if company's arm Adani Logistics acquires Adani Agri Logistics from Adani Enterprises in an all-cash deal, it will weigh on the stock performance in the near term. “Historically, APSEZ has had related-party transactions involving loans and advances towards other group companies. Even good assets are getting bought out in this transaction, it would still weigh on the stock performance in the near term,” Edelweiss Securities said. 


Realty stocks lose steam
The optimism over GST rate cut on under-construction properties gave realty stocks a boost in early trade. But the rally fizzled out and most realty stocks closed the day in the red after analysts points out that the GST rate cut would only benefit customers but developers will not gain from it as the input tax credit policy remains unchanged. The BSE Realty index fell 0.86 per cent, with Oberoi Realty (down 3.21 per cent), Prestige Estates (down 1.30 per cent), Sunteck Realty (down 0.87 per cent) and DLF (down 0.68 per cent) all ending in the red. 


206 stocks signal possible rise
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed as many as 206 stocks, including Bank of Baroda, ITC, NBCC (India), SpiceJet, Hindalco, Maruti Suzuki India and Bajaj Finance, with bullish crossovers on BSE, signalling a potential rise for these stocks. On the other hand, Bharti Infratel, Anjani Synthetic, DB Corp, PTC Industries and Bombay Cycle & Motor Agency were among those 24 stocks that showed bearish crossovers on BSE. 


TCS, HDFC above 200-DMAs
TCS, HDFC, Symphony, Britannia Industries, Pidilite Industries, Delta Corp, UCO Bank and HDIL were among the stocks that witnessed positive breakouts and traded above their 200-DMAs. 


Stocks that saw spurt in OI
With a change of 63.47 per cent, Mahanagar Gas led the pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest (OI) on NSE. It was followed by Motherson Sumi Systems (61.72 per cent), Adani Ports (55.07 per cent), DCB Bank (55.01 per cent), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company (51.31 per cent), UPL (40.60 per cent) and Bharti Infratel (40.45 per cent)."
23,2019-02-25,Britannia,"Britannia Industries, India’s biggest biscuit maker, plans to enter the Rs 24,000 crore per annum salty snacks market, which is dominated by Haldiram’s and Pepsico. It plans to launch salty snacks under its existing brand Time Pass by next month as part of a strategy to expand to non-biscuit segments.

“It will be a differentiated product range and we will leverage on the fact that we have about 80 factories making our products. In snacking segment, transportation is the biggest cost but with our manufacturing footprint, our costs will remain tight and efficient,” said Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia Industries, without divulging product range or details on variants.

In India, biscuits, snacks and dairy are the three largest categories in packaged consumer products and account for a third of the nearly Rs 3.4 lakh crore market. In its effort to become a “total foods company” the maker of Good Day and Nutri Choice biscuits has identified opportunities in all three segments. In the past few months, it launched swiss rolls, layer cakes, creme wafers, croissants and milk shakes in tetra packs.

But unlike in biscuits, where large players such as Britannia, Parle and ITC control more than 80% of the market, snacking segment has seen regional and state-specific players with lower priced products eating away shares of large companies. Regional snack brands offer 30% higher volume for similar price points, especially highest selling packs of Rs 5 and Rs 10.

The Rs 10,000 crore Kolkata-headquartered company had earlier entered snacks category but exited after a few months. However, Berry said, “This time, the outlook in the segment, our capabilities and the product characteristics are completely different.”

In the past few years, the market has seen a shift towards traditional snacks as both multinationals and home-grown companies have launched namkeen products. A year ago, Haldiram’s displaced Pepsi as the country’s largest snacking firm. Britannia Industries will compete mainly against PepsiCo and ITC that operate largely in western snacking segment such as potato chips, riblon and gathia, with brands such as Kurkure and Bingo’s Tedhe Medhe, and extruded, which includes cheese balls.

“If we take three years’ average, then Britannia’s volume growth is the best in industry. The company’s journey towards becoming a total foods company is gaining flavour with entry into new categories and geographies and rising share of premium products that will keep the company in good stead,” said a recent Edelweiss report.

Berry, a former head of Pepsi Foods, took charge as Britannia Industries CEO nearly five years ago, a time when the consumer market was slowing and the company had a portfolio of mostly premium products even as many consumers were cutting back spends on discretionary items. Since then, he has more than doubled the company’s distribution reach, especially in the Hindi heartland where it was traditionally weaker, with the result that the company now directly reaches more than two million outlets."
25,2019-02-25,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The Index Maintenance Sub-committee (IMSC) of NSE Indices on Monday decided to replace oil marketing company HPCL with Britannia Industries on the flagship Nifty50.

The changes will be effective March 29.

28,2019-02-26,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Your Sensex’s PE has just surged 16 per cent in a single day, thanks to substracting of Tata Motors’ recent Q3 losses from its EPS. With Asian markets taking a pause this morning, F&O expiry due in two days and reports suggesting crossing of the LOC by multiple Indian Air Force jets, the market stares at a weak start. 

Let's check out what all may move market all through the day:


TRADE SETUP


Singapore trading sets stage for a negative startNifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 3 points, or 0.03 per cent, lower at 10,889.50, indicating a negative start for the Nifty50.

Nifty50 moves past key moving averagesNifty50 climbed for the fourth day in a row on Monday to move past its 50-day and 20-day moving averages. With a bullish candle on the daily chart and key moving averages breached, supports for the index have shifted higher. The rally is likely to have more legs if the index takes out the 10,900-10,915 range in the near future, analysts said. 


Market-wide F&O rollovers at 31%The market-wide rollovers stood at 31 per cent till Monday, which were higher than an average rollover of 26 per cent seen in the comparable period of last three series. Nifty futures rollover stood at 24 per cent against 20 per cent rollovers seen in the last three series.


Sensex PE jumps 16% in a day!The trailing PE of S&P BSE Sensex jumped from 22.92 times on Friday to 26.55 times on Monday — a surge of around 16% in a single session. The index provider said in a statement that the variation in the ratio was due to the updated EPS data for Tata Motors on account of the recently announced Q3 results. The company has reported losses for the quarter which has brought down the earnings per share, in turn impacting the index PE.

FDI falls as election looms
The flow of foreign direct investment into India is dropping and may suffer its first full-year decline since Prime Minister Modi came to power in 2014. The reversal from strong numbers in Modi's initial years may indicate that investors are being deterred by the recent protectionist policies and uncertainty about general election result. Inbound FDI dropped 7% to $33.5 billion in the nine months between April and December 2018, compared with $36 billion in the year-earlier period."
27,2019-02-26,Britannia,"Consumer-facing companies are accelerating launches over the next 4-5 months with big back-to-back events between March and June this year - the IPL T20, General Elections and ICC World Cup. The flurry of launches comes after a lull of two years that saw the roll-out of the Goods & Services Tax (GST) and demonetisation, which impacted trade channels and liquidity.

Packaged foods company Nestle plans to launch two dozen products this year, beverage maker Coca-Cola is leveraging its sponsorship rights of the ICC and IPL to launch products in the peak season for soft drinks. Britannia is entering new categories to ride the buoyant consumer sentiment in the country, while makers of televisions and air-conditioners said they have started rolling out new products and investing in advertising to leverage the upcoming season.

“We expect double-digit volume growth with consumption picking up as we are in an election year. Products launches, accelerating innovation and premiumisation of our portfolio will be our core focus,” Britannia managing director Varun Berry said. Companies are also of the view that measures announced in the interim Budget on February 1 is expected to trigger rural consumption over the next two quarters.

Chairman of Nestle, Suresh Narayanan, said at a media round table last week that his company is evaluating launching two-three dozen products across categories in 2019. The maker of Maggi instant noodles and Nescafe, which crossed the Rs 11,000-crore sales mark last year, said it is focusing on volume-led growth fuelled by over two dozen potential launches it is currently evaluating.

“We expect the consumption sentiment to improve because of multiple macro factors. We will stay focused on innovation-led volume growth. That matrix will not change for us,” Narayanan said.

Industry executives said television makers like Sony, Samsung and LG too are lining up their biggest launches this year with multiple viewing events including election. Even smartphone brands like Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo are going ahead as per plans.

“The lingering effect of demonetisation and change over to the GST regime in last two years is waning and sentiments will definitely improve after elections,” said Sony India managing director Sunil Nayyar. World cup cricket has always boosted television sales and with signs of an early summer setting in, durables will also get a boost which will improve cash flow in the market, he said. “With so many positive indicators, we would have our highest new product launches this year”.

A report by WPP-owned GroupM released two weeks ago forecast ad spends this year will be fuelled by the Cricket World Cup and Elections, and FMCG, auto, retail, e-commerce, besides tech/telecom are expected to contribute two-thirds of the ad expenditure in 2019. The report said India now tops the list of fastest growing ad markets globally, and said India's ad investment is expected to reach an estimated Rs 80,678 crore in 2019.

Tata-owned Voltas managing director Pradeep Bakshi said there might be some a brief impact in rural and semi-urban markets during elections, but there should not be much disruption if the weather remains hot.

For beverages companies which see sales peak in April-June quarter, Coca-Cola said it will leverage its 5-year global sponsorship partnership as exclusive non-alcoholic beverages partner of the ICC till 2023, and co-presenting sponsorship for IPL, with multiple campaigns backed by launches.

FMCG firm Emami director Harsha V Agarwal said the company will line up its summer launches avoiding the election days to duck any disruption. “Launches will be postponed at most by 15-20 days. Overall, purchasing capacity tends to improve in an election year,” he said.

Some companies like Sony and Godrej are also booking advertisement space and spots from now fearing rates going up during the election time and the World Cup. Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi said brands are blocking spots since it could be a challenge to get good spots later."

33,2019-02-28,Britannia,"HDFC Bank, Axis & SBI among banks and Dabur and Britannia are the top picks in banking and FMCG space, said
  
  
  Vipul Prasad, Founder & CEO, Magadh Capital LLP, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts:

Which are your favourites within the banking basket?
HDFC Bank is at the top of the list but increasingly SBI and Axis Bank are the two names that we like quite a lot. As the process of NPA resolution under the NCLT process gains pace, we will see quite a significant improvement in the loan books of these two banks and apart from that, earnings will also get a lift because it would not just be a fall in provisioning, but it will also lead to some amount of write-backs occasionally. 

On top of that, the kind of valuations that these two names are trading at indicate quite a bit of upside from here. One more thing worth highlighting is that both the companies had been going slow on corporate loan books because of obvious reasons. Their loan books had been in a very bad shape and so they were not chasing too much of credit growth. 

That is going to add a lot of visibility to their earnings in the times to come and on the retail side also, both the banks have been quite active, This kind of confidence that they are gaining on the capital structure should give a boost to that also. We are quite positive in these two names on an incremental basis and HDFC Bank has been a stock that we have been positive for quite a while.

In that case, the story is quite simple that 18-20% loan book growth and NIM consistently at around 4% or higher and at the same time, valuation is on the higher side but they are able to justify that at least at the pace at which their earnings are growing, the stock will be able to grow. 


Where exactly are you finding value within the FMCG basket? A lot of experts are talking about how barring the valuations which are not compelling, the overall volume growth, the fundamentals do seem to be intact. Financials as well seem to be steady. What do you like within the FMCG basket?
As a sector, this entire basket has done quite well and is largely driven by earnings and also by some re-rating also that has happened. That means the valuations do not look quite compelling but at the same time there are names like Britannia or Dabur, wherein you are getting very clear opportunities. Britannia is weak in the Hindi belt. If you go to some of the small towns in Hindi belt states, there will be renewed thrust from Britannia to be more visible on the shelves in the smaller towns. 

There the market shares have been very low. At the same time, Britannia has been doing quite well in terms of premiumisation of its product. They are doing all the things that are required not just to push up their top line at a decent pace but also to enhance their margins incrementally. 

This means I will be not be surprised if over the next three-four years, they are able to deliver in late teens in terms of earnings growth. That means the stock can continue to grow well, even if you assume that there is going to be some de-rating because the valuation multiples have come up to very high levels. 

Let us assume for a moment that there is minor derating, their stocks can continue to deliver 15-17% premium per annum. Similarly even in case of Dabur, in the last one-and-a-half to two years, it is apparent that they have managed to fight back the challenge from some ayurveda based challengers. They have done quite well on that front and also in other segments. 

Even in case of Dabur, the top line growth can comfortably be 13% to 15% largely driven by volumes. We like Dabur quite a lot. So these are the two stocks that we prefer in this space.


Tomorrow again we are going to start off a brand new month and all the focus will be on motown as we are going to get the monthly sales data for February. Do you think it is going to be any different than last three months’ trend of a decline across segments?
I do not really think so. This is a cyclical dip after a 3-4-year period of good growth for these companies. We are into a period of another two, three quarters before the volumes revive. But having said that, there is a clear growth path and we see very clear reasons why in two, three quarters from now, it should revive. I will be quite positive on the auto sector, not the entire sector, but some of the leaders in the space and more so if I can have patience around the sector. 


 Given the uncertainty with regards to how this entire situation between may escalate from here, do you sense that that defensive tilt of the market may come back not in pharma, but maybe in IT where people are going to find safe haven?
IT honestly has continued to surprise me positively and it has played its role as a defensive and a classic case where one can hide in terms of damage to the broader markets. But having said that, I would still think two things are worth highlighting here; one Indo-Pak standoff. I still think the base case should not be deep escalation and there is a possibility that over the next 10-15 days probably nothing happens incrementally and then we de-escalate. 

Let us say for a moment that there is another situation which has some decent probability although less probability than the first possibility that we talked about and in this case there is a low intensity conflict, but a very short lived one. In this case also, if the market comes down, it will be a V-shape kind of a recovery. 

Only the third situation wherein there is a proper escalation and a full-blown war are there deep problems for the market. In that case, defensives will get precedence over everything else. 

But I would still think that the base case should be that the first scenario that I talked about or the second scenario. And talking specifically about IT names, yes they have done very well and I would not be surprised if in the near term lets us say in the next at least three, four months they continue to do well. But let us not forget one thing that there are some signs of slowdown in the western economies which means at some point in time, the business of these companies may also slowdown. 

In any case, they had not been delivering 25% kind of earnings growth. It was more like teen earnings growth and all along as they have outperformed the market, their valuation multiples have got quite elevated. 


What are you expecting from the Zee deal? Buzz on the street is that the strategic stake sale could culminate soon. There are just two players now in the fray and we could see quite a bit of upside on the stock, what is your call?
In these situations, it becomes more of a binary call. I have been staying away from this. But yes, if they are able to get a good buyer with a good name and with good deep pockets, then it will be a very good thing for the company and at the same time for the shareholders also. 

But for me some concerns for some time has been that this is a very disruption prone industry and on top of that, if you are commanding the kind of valuations that Zee had been commanding about an year ago, t is not a very good recipe for an investor. 

Also, after Zee announced that they are going to sell out, then also I was a bit disappointed in the sense that Zee was one company that had done phenomenally well. It was one of the poster boys of the media sector. They had held on to their own despite big challenges coming in. 

When they decided to throw in the towel, it did come as a surprise. Then obviously it came out later that there were other reasons also. But coming back to your question directly, yes it will be more like a binary outcome and so for me, it is a no. I will not be interested in this stock."
0,2019-03-01,Britannia,"There is no obvious link any more between the Indian economy and the Indian stock market and that really puts 
  
  
  the onus on folks like us to stock pick intelligently for our clients, said Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

can start with the block deal as to what is the future for insurance companies. We can talk about geopolitical tensions or we can talk about a multi-bagger idea from your side.
Let us get the geopolitical tension addressed. Obviously, what is happening in the border is far more serious than my or most other people’s portfolios. We are a $3-trillion economy now. Even if matters were to escalate, the financial hit to the Indian economy is very tractable. It is the world’s sixth largest economy now and even in case of a conflict in scale of Kargil, the financial hit can be dealt with but obviously the human cost is on a different level. That is why the market is relatively sanguine about the serious matters taking place up north and let us hope the market stays that way and the matters decelerate. 

The Korea-America matter has been brewing for several years now. The global financial market has learnt to live with it and China-America tensions, if anything, seem to be settling down. So the geopolitics is not something we should have foremost in our minds. It is very interest to talk about but I am not so sure how relevant it is to your and my portfolios. 


But you also mentioned that there is a disconnect between the opportunities and the earnings expansions. Could you explain that?
It has been a good ten years now. The nominal GDP growth in India has been around 12-13% over the last decade or so. In only one out of the last 10 years, has the Nifty earnings growth been commensurate with India’s GDP growth. Overall Nifty earnings growth has been miserable for five-six years. My reckoning is this is not going to go away easily. It is not a question of the Nifty suddenly recovering one year.

What is increasingly happening as we become more affluent is that a bigger part of our consumption pie is coming from imported goods that is at the B2C level, at the B2B level, increasing spend on capital goods is imported robots, automation, mechanisation lines. So, the link of the Indian stock market as a play on the Indian economy unfortunately is getting broken. Our economic growth no longer seems to feed into stock market performance which means that stock picking, building an intelligently constructed portfolio in India is becoming ever more important. There is no obvious link any more between the Indian economy and the Indian stock market and that really puts the onus on folks like us to stock pick intelligently for our clients.


Telecom turns out to be that contra bet. Jio has really set the cat amongst the pigeons. But now it seems that Bharti is upping its game. An Africa listing is in the pipeline. There is news about a sizable fund raising. Does it seem like at least some power is coming back to the incumbents too?
Generating high earnings growth for sectors in India which have heavy regulatory construct , has always been a challenge. It is not just telecom. It also includes power, infrastructure, real estate. Wherever a sector is surrounded by regulation, the regulators basically suck the profits out. In telecom, initially it used to done through auctions. Now, it is done through rule changes. So I am not optimistic about that sector. 

If you ask me, the best chance the Indian market has of finding sectors which consistently give earnings growth better than GDP growth are sectors where there is low regulatory intervention and capital intensity is light. So, light industrials, traditional FMCG consumption type plays, IT, pharma. 

My reckoning is over the next one to two years, consumption-oriented light industrials, export-oriented IT-pharma type plays will have a decent run. Capital intensity is light in these sectors. The currency is weak. The currency is likely to weaken further over the next 12 months and those sectors give us the best chance of generating EPS growth ahead of GDP growth of say 11-12%. 

The only other area is private sector banks as the NBFCs and housing finance companies lose market share, given what is happening in the wholesale market. As NBFC and housing finance companies lose market share, the top four or five private sector banks should be able to pull away from the rest of the BFSI pack.


The closer we get to elections, everybody will have a view on it. But from the market standpoint, this is just conversation narrative and nothing more, nothing less. When election verdicts have been on expected lines, markets have moved. When election verdicts have not been on expected lines, markets have come down and then moved. Eventually what matters is earnings.
The Indian stock markets’ track record on elections is not great. It is probably as bad as the opinion pollster track record on elections. In 2004, when UPA won, the stock market went circuit down and then it had the best bull run ever in the next five years. 

In 2009, while the UPA won again, the stock market thought that it was a good result and then we had a miserable run for the next five years. So the Indian market’s ability to read political outcomes even after the election is done is fairly patchy and hence my reading is best to ignore it from a portfolio perspective. 

It is a big human interest story. Looking at powerful people jockeying for great power is always fascinating. But I am not so sure it will make me wiser and wealthier if I obsess about who will win the election. Part of the reason is there is no great ideological difference when it comes to economic policy. It is not as if politicians are sitting up late either reading Karl Marx or Adam Smith, losing sleep on matters of economic theory and economic philosophy. Their job is somewhat different in the Indian context. We leave them to do their jobs. We do ours which is to buy well run companies which generate good cash flows consistently.


When it comes to pharma space as a whole, do you believe that there are select opportunities here? There are expensive valuations as well. What exactly is driving your conviction here?
Let us us be clear. Sectors like IT and pharma do not have companies in those sectors which are akin to an Asian Paints or an HDFC Bank. An HDFC Bank and Asian Paints have core competitive advantages. It is in none of the IT or pharma sector companies. Those two sectors are far more commoditised. They are competing in a global market, with low differentiation in their products and that is why a currency tailwind is immensely helpful.

I reckon the rupee will go towards 75 over the next 12 months. The rupee sliding to that extent gives sectors like IT and pharma which are inherently commoditised sectors. It gives them a real kicker. We have seen the IT companies benefit from that, not just in terms of earnings but also in stock prices. You can see in pharma’s Q3 results the currency benefits coming through. The US numbers are turning around and whilst the FDA issues will continue, it is also clear that the leading pharma companies are getting a better grip on how to deal with the FDA issues. 

A combination of currency pulling back with further currency depreciation ahead of us, decent Q3 numbers from the pharma companies and in a way the worst of the FDA issues being behind us, my reckoning is there is a good pharma recovery ahead of us over next 12 months. I said the same about IT 18 months ago and I am sticking to my IT call. I would like to add pharma to that list of currency beneficiaries as we continue to exist in a phase where the rupee is heading downwards.


Do you stay with more of the same? Do you continue to buy the top four, five Nifty names which have performed in the recent past, or do you think the time has come to tactically move yourself and start nibbling into the small and midcap names or even some of the largecaps which have been beaten down?
The way I think about portfolio construction is I have a core in portfolio say 10 to 11 stocks which I call structural compounders. These are well-run companies with core competitive advantages, clean accounting and good corporate governance -- the Asian Paints, HDFC Bank type plays. I sit with them for very long periods of time and I will admit that I personally own these stocks. 

Then there are another eight, nine stocks where I take a tactical view. For example, my tactical view is that the housing finance companies and NBFCs will cede market share rapidly to the private sector banks. So I will add a couple of other private sector banks to my portfolio. They might not be of the quality of HDFC Bank. but they will be able to benefit from the shift in market share. 

Similarly, I am not saying IT and pharma are structural bets for me but given the extent of the rupee weakness, IT and pharma companies will tactically perform for me over the next one to two years and therefore I will have a couple of stocks from each of those sectors in my portfolio. As I try to blend the two, perhaps a little more than majority of the portfolio is in structural plays and something like 40-45% of my portfolio on tactical plays. Obviously all of these companies have to have clean accounts. If the accounts are believable, then I am whistling in the wind. But leaving that aside, on the tactical play front, there are opportunities in private sector banks, opportunities in IT and pharma, small ticket consumption which do not require borrowing money and these are in good shape in our country. We are seeing that for the last three sets of results.

Consumption will continue roaring ahead. The recent budget that the FM announced is very pro consumer. So there is plenty to play for. It is not just largecaps, there are some midcap plays, one or two smallcap plays as well, but the primary focus has to be underlying quality in the financial statements, strength in the franchise and consistently good ROCs, without which you really find it very difficult to make money in India.


Howard Marks in a Google talk said if you bought the classic blue chip stocks in 1960s which is GE, Kodak, 3M -- the 1960 classics -- you did not make money because those were fully priced. My only fear with classic compounders is that their businesses will continue to grow but in today’s market are they pricing in next three, four, five years of growth. Is that the risk for some of the A quality great moat franchises like Asian Paints or an HDFC Bank?
One fundamental difference between American investing and Indian investing is exactly this subject and that is the reason I write books in India. In America, you will find it possible to find a company. In America, you will not find companies which have return on capital massively above their cost of capital for decades on an end. You would not find companies like Asian Paints, Britannia, ITC, HDFC Bank, Marico in America. American firms that we are all familiar with say, Walmart, JP Morgan have return on capital pretty close to their cost of capital because America is a far more competitive economy. 

Ours is the only large economy in the world where a) companies continue to dominate sectors for decades on an end and b) they have return on capital well above the cost of capital. So I am sure Howard Marks is right in the American context but that message does not apply to India because unfortunately or fortunately, whichever way you look at it, an Asian Paints or a Britannia is able to maintain return on capital, way above the cost of capital for decades on an end.

Asian Paints is 1600x since their IPO in 1983 and 1600x in a pretty smooth line. It is not that Asian Paints had a good run and then suddenly stagnated. I reckon that continues. I am not saying that this is true for lots of Indian companies. I would say barely 1% of Indian companies fall in the category of Asian Paints on 99% of Indian companies Howard Marks is absolutely right. But there are 1% Indian companies, the structural compounders, the classic compounders, which are able to continue dominating their sectors for decades on an end, in a way which is not possible in the United States.

As a result, these companies give you 10x in 10 years and 100x in 20 years, 1000x in 30 years. It is a shame to not have those companies in your portfolio. It is like an ATM machine you stand in front of it and collect the Rs 2,000 notes."
1,2019-03-06,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equities extended the winning streak into a third successive session on Wednesday, thanks to gains in shares of select heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, HDFC and ITC.

Weakness in crude oil price influenced the mood of investors, while improving prospects of Modi’s return to power in the 2019 election also lifted investor mood.

The move is expected to boost its margins. Brokerage ICICIdirect said the price hike would help the firm grow margins. Bristol, Flake Excel and Capstan account for 11-13 per cent of total cigarette volumes.


DHFL jumps 11%Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) surged 11.04 per cent to Rs 148 after an auditor report found little substance in Cobrapost allegations and said the company did not create shell companies to divert funds.

7,2019-03-13,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group: After 14 years, Britannia is re-entering the benchmark Nifty index end of this month to become the third FMCG company in the index. Incidentally, it will be the lone ‘only foods’ company in the index.

The company’s turnaround under Varun Berry, who was appointed as its head in 2013, ensured that it performed well in its key food segments, creating Rs 68,000 crore of wealth for investors since.

The management drove profitable growth through launch of new food categories, growing its dairy business, foray into international markets, achieving cost efficiency, gaining distribution momentum and increasing innovation.

In the past five fiscals, Britannia’s net sales have increased at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10 per cent - higher than its other three peers. Its net profit swelled at a CAGR of 31 per cent - double the rate of increase posted by its peers Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) and Marico.



The mid-sized company outperformed its peers GCPL, Dabur and Marico in its performance on the ground as well as on the bourses to gain an entry into the Nifty.

While Britannia and GCPL are similar on some counts (similar revenues and market cap), Britannia has an edge over GCPL. It has a higher return on capital employed and a higher free float.

GCPL, on the other hand, has better operating margin profile, but lower returns on capital employed and lower valuations. Its stock remained flat over the past year even as ET FMCG Index rose 14 per cent and the Britannia stock surged 29 per cent. Little wonder then that over half of the analysts tracking Britannia’s stock are bullish on it, this proportion stands at 28 per cent in case of GCPL.

In March 2014, Britannia was the least valuable of the stocks among its peers (GCPL, Dabur, Marico and Emami) and today it is the most valuable FMCG stock. Trading at 67 times its trailing four quarter earnings, its stretched valuations have rather been a concern lately for the stock. Inclusion in Nifty will further attract buying from index funds and is a long term positive for the Britannia stock."

9,2019-03-14,Britannia,"Biscuits, snacks, beverages and telecom companies expect a spike in sales during the forthcoming general election bolstered by large gatherings and rallies that will target about 900 million Indians in the world’s largest democracy.

Voting will be held in seven phases from April 11 to May 19 with counting on May 23. Some 8,000 contestants are expected to contest 543 seats. “This is definitely an additional opportunity for out-of-home consumption,” said B Krishna Rao, senior category head at Parle Products, the country’s largest biscuit company by volume. “We expect additional growth of 4-5% during election months.”

From increasing inventory and delivering at odd hours to offering discounts and launching campaigns urging people to vote, companies will be doing their bit to leverage poll fever. “Chai pe charcha or tea party theme will also help build platforms for discussions and debate on politics over a cup of tea,” said Parag Desai, executive director of Wagh Bakri, India's third-largest tea company. In the last general election in 2014, the overall consumer goods volume shrank 2% in the April-June quarter, the worst in a decade, amid high inflation and an economy that slumped to below 5% growth two years in a row.

According to Kantar Worldpanel, the tea segment fell 2.4% while biscuits declined 7.8% in terms of household consumption during the election months of April and May. With the fast-moving consumer goods market growing in double digits, companies expect a significantly higher uptick in demand, at least in these categories, compared with 2014. “We expect small unit size packs in particular to have a large potential for pickups during this time. Our urban and and rural channels are fully stocked and ready to service any upsurge in demand in the upcoming weeks leading to elections,” said Britannia vice president, sales, Gunjan Shah.

With elections being held in peak summer, soft drink companies are expected to step up distribution and promotional activity around rallies. Coca-Cola global CEO James Quincey told ETin an interview on Monday: “People tend to spend a little more money in the run-up to the elections, which flows into the economy, but consumption tends to be ‘disruptive’ in the week of voting.” A report by market research firm Nielsen said India’s FMCG sector is expected to grow 11-12% in 2019, a tad slower than 13.8% in 2018 because of the higher base. “Historical trends around elections in the last few years suggest that FMCG industry demonstrates stable to marginally lower growth in the election year,” said the report released in January. Bisleri International, India’s largest packaged water maker, said sales have almost flattened out seasonality spikes on a national level but election rallies present an opportunity to reach concentrated consumers. “We will step up distribution according to the requirement,” said founder Ramesh Chauhan.


CONNECTING VOTERS
Telcos expect a sharp jump in voice and data consumption along with a 5% rise in mobile connection sales, which is likely to drive average revenue per user growth for the big three— Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Reliance Jio — in the April-June quarter.

Election season will translate into at least a 30-40% year-on-year upside in mobile data consumption in the June quarter, which is likely to primarily drive a 15% sequential rise in ARPU for telcos in the first quarter of FY20, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president, markets and corporate affairs, IIFL.

Analysts expect the increase in mobile data consumption to be in line with TV viewership in terms of screen time during the elections. That’s because people will be following poll trends not just on television but on 4G smartphones and also be active on social media, discussing these on Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter.

Rohan Dhamija, partner and head of India and the Middle East at Analysys Mason, also expects a definite spurt in smartphone and phone subscriptions as more people are likely to go mobile to catch the election action.

While vehicle sales dipped in the past two pre-election years, demand rose substantially during polls. “We have done an analysis of the past numbers and the conclusion is that in the last two preelection years, sales always fell. In the election years, sales always go up substantially,” Maruti chairman RC Bhargava told ET in December. Passenger vehicle sales in domestic market fell 1% in the pre-election year in FY09 but rose 25% a year later. The same was the case in FY14, when volumes fell 6% but increased 4% in FY15.

With liquidity tightening in the wake of the IL&FS default and rise in interest costs hitting passenger vehicle sales for the seventh month this financial year in February, companies now expect the local automotive market to pick up only after the election. Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) President Ashish Kale said, “Due to tight monitoring of finances by the Election Commission, we do not see a sharp spike in SUV sales during elections anymore. Some states do depict a marginal increase.”

13,2019-03-19,Britannia,"This is the time to deploy cash now. You should be looking at good quality midcaps, smallcaps and 
  
  
  there is safety there. They will fall if the Nifty falls, but the ability to handle those corrections is much easier in the longer term, said Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


Last time when we met the world was bearish, you were bullish. You got it right. Now that the world is bullish, are you getting bearish?
I am not getting bearish but we must keep in mind that on a broader macro basis, we are not out of the woods yet because there are a lot of macro headwinds in India at present. What we are seeing right now is an oversold rally and also we are part of the emerging market basket where we have lagged for quite some time in the last few months. Now we are doing a catch-up and that is flows are coming in. 

From now onwards, it is going to be a function of earnings and flows. Earnings being company specific and if emerging market flows carry on, markets would seek higher levels. More than the Nifty or market seeking higher levels, a lot of stock-specific opportunities in buying would come in and that is already happening. So, it will probably carry on. But the key issue is that on economy basis, we have still got a problem. Private sector capex has not picked up as yet. Inflation, is benign but at the same time, we may not have a 7% GDP growth rate. It is probably closer to 6.5% according to me if one does a proper calculation. 

So everything is not gung-ho but what we are seeing right now is being oversold in an under-invested situation where people are coming in to buy. 


Right now, market is working on three assumptions; one, we will get a favourable market-friendly political verdict; two, interest rates will not move up and; three, flows into emerging markets will increase. What happens to the market if the news flow turns adverse? 
That is a valid point and it links to my hypothesis at this point of time that Nifty would fall off substantially if we have some real political shocks coming in. I easily see 10% fall in Nifty in case the government that is formed is not what the market is pricing in right now. The Nifty rally is very concentrated. It is dependant on a bunch of seven-ten stocks which had a very stretched valuations at this point of time -- HDFC Bank or Kotak Bank. These are trading at phenomenal price to book, phenomenal earnings that you are factoring in. They will really come off in a big way and people would not know how to get to the exit door if any negative news flow comes in. If you want to deploy, you should be deploying cash now. You should be looking at good quality midcaps, smallcaps and there is safety there. They will fall if the Nifty falls, but the ability to handle those kind of corrections is much easier in the longer term, rather than seeing HDFC Bank correcting 10-15% and then not knowing whether to sell it or to hold on. One needs to be very cautious in case all the positives that are priced in do not fall in place in the next three-six months.


One of the top trends on twitter is how Mukesh Ambani has rescued younger brother Anil and saved him from going to jail for non-payment to Ericsson. Do you find merit in any of the ADAG Group businesses like Reliance Power, Reliance Capital?
Out of the group’s entire basket of stocks, I am positively inclined towards Reliance Capital. I would like to disclose that I have a position there. There is phenomenal value in that stock and to my understanding the focus for the next generation lies in that business at this point of time and that is one business which even Mr Anil Ambani has been very savvy right from the early days when he was part of the integrated group. 

That is one place to be but obviously volatility is your friend out there. We saw it at Rs 190 odd about a week-10 days back and suddenly we saw it at Rs 162. So, on a very bad day, that stock could definitely be bought. Within the group, there is a very small company where I have a position. It is Reliance Home Finance. It has a phenomenal franchise. It is a good business on ground but because of the negativity surrounding the group, it is trading at a pittance at this point of time. These are the two best bets in the group for the next two years.


There is growing pessimism when it comes to the auto space as a whole. Maruti yesterday talked about production cuts. Do you find selective names look appealing here?
No, not as yet. The pessimism is justified and most of the pessimism also already in the price right now but there might just be one last selloff where we see some of the stocks falling off the cliff by 5%, 10% or 20% in a few sessions when one or two of the big boys with large holdings may just decide to unload. 

But even after that, I don’t know if one can expect Maruti to suddenly bounce back 20%-30% in the next two-three months. The volumes have plateaued month on month, quarter on quarter. I have been saying for quite some time the industries have seen some kind of structural shift in product lifecycles. Whether we are moving towards EVs or new technologies, is also bothering the industries. 

Obviously, people are questioning the entire concept of owning high-end cars when you are talking about share rides of Uber and Ola. We have seen this trend in the west and I do not see the reason why this trend will not fall in place here. With improvement in urban transportation, you cannot see the kind of numbers that you have seen in Maruti, M&M over the last two-three years. These companies will have to reposition their models. Cutting a long story short, I would not really want to be overweight these stocks at this point.


What are the feelers that you are getting about the upcoming elections? Is NDA coming back to power and is that the assumption that the market is also working with which some believe to be one of the factors behind the March rally?
Yes, that is exactly what I said just now. The market is going by the assumption that Prime Minister Modi would lead the next government if that does not come through, markets are in for a huge sell-off. That will be a very rapid selloff in two-three days. Everyone who has been long will lose his short and that is the board in Delhi also. People believe that they will get the numbers in place, NDA would be back in power and that is the assumption that is priced in as far as the markets are concerned. 

If a coalition comes to power, the uncertainty around who is going to be the Prime Minister or what is going to be the shape of the government will make the market panic and it may fall. But in this fall, there will be some real buying opportunities but if you are long and then you stuck in that period, then God save me because I am also long. So God save all of us who have invested because that is going to be really a volatile period and one would not know what to do because it is priced in and the prices right now.


Everyone is of the view that cyclicals will make a comeback and corporate banks should lead the market rally. What happens to consumer names? Where are HUL, Britannia, Page Industries and ITC headed?
I should not be sending a wrong message because I am very clear and that is why I actually said I am long right now because I clearly believe that markets are headed much higher irrespective of what happens in that month or two during the election uncertainty in case we get the other outcome that is the current government does not come to power which as of now does not seem really a possibility. 

So, irrespective of election outcome, the event will be out of the way and the markets are headed much higher because the economy should pick up. It is showing first signs of coming out of that long phase of contraction and slow growth. The interest rate environment is looking benign and therefore there is no reason why the consumers would not be robust. Consumption would be good and consumer stocks would do well. 

We can debate the earnings multiples they trade at. A lot of people are hiding in them as defensives for the last many months. The question would always come where do I want to buy that ITC or a Britannia or a Dabur or a Marico? For an investor, volatility is the best friend. You get a panic, you want to be in defensives, in some of the evergreen names. These are places to be but you have to get your buying levels right because market is an animal which one doesn’t really know the way it goes, particularly in these kind of environments when the situation is clouded and there are uncertainties all over. There will be a few negative days and that is the time to come and buy your Britannia and ITC because if you have them in the portfolio for two, three years, you are going to make huge money. 

These will be absolutely safe places to be in the sense you would not have to live with the problem that one sees with banks and other companies in the sector like steel, cement etc."

15,2019-03-21,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Leading biscuit companies are seeing smaller and local players eat into their sales since the new goods and tax regime came into force, and they claim that these companies, mostly unbranded ones, offer higher retail margins and lower price points since they are not GST compliant.

With the Rs 35,000-crore biscuit market the largest category within FMCG, a single percentage drop is as big as sales loss of Rs 350 crore. “Many players are not tax-compliant and have low operating cost which helps give high margins to retailers who push brands mostly in rural areas,” said Mayank Shah, category head, Parle Products. He said they are seeking a tax reduction from 18% for biscuits below Rs 100/kg to 5% bracket.

Britannia, Parle and ITC control nearly 69% of the biscuit market in the country. In fact, the top 15 players including Mondelez, Anmol and Saj Industries put together account for 92% of the segment. While Nielsen data, sourced from officials, suggests 1% share drop for Parle and ITC each over the past two years, Parle said the market researcher doesn’t track regional brands, which are restricted to just one district.

This is in contrast on what most companies expected during the new tax regime in 2017. Analysts too anticipated an increase in market share of organised players over their unorganised rivals as the price differential of products was likely to reduce while making tax evasion incrementally difficult with a significant compliance cost burden.







“Biscuits are a staple and the most basic packaged food products in the country. Rate should be reduced to 12% so that it can be effectively passed through price-cuts, which in turn, will boost consumption and make it level playing field,"" said Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia Industries, the country's largest biscuit maker.

During last calendar year, the biscuit category grew 12%, slower compared to 14% in 2017. Companies estimate 3,500-4,000 smaller and loose biscuit firms operate in just one region or district, all nibbling away at their sales growth For years, local brands — not just in biscuits but in most segments — have eaten into share from leading consumer product companies, especially in soaps, detergents, hair oil, tea and biscuits, with more than 500 unorganised players operating in these categories.

In segments such as tea, smaller players and loose tea operators control 40% of the market, while in detergents and soaps, hundreds of local companies enter the market at a time when crude oil prices, a key ingredient for detergents, bottom out since that’s the only cost incurred in making the products."
16,2019-03-27,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Patanjali Ayurved disrupted the Indian fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector with nature-based products in various categories to challenge the dominance of companies such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in the past three-four years. 

That has forced rivals, especially the multinationals, to retool their portfolios to introduce matching products at similar price points to try and regain their market ranking, analysts said. This seems to be paying off, they said.

The homegrown upstart has been most successful in staples such as ghee, flour, ayurvedic health supplements, toothpaste, edible oil and condiments but less so in noodles, biscuits, personal care, chocolates and juices.

Its rapid growth posed a threat to mainstream FMCG companies by renewing the natural/herbal/ayurvedic theme and compelling FMCG companies to tweak their range. For instance, HUL’s personal care products faced headwinds, prompting the company to relaunch its Ayush brand and acquire ayurvedic hair oil brand Indulekha. Having sustained similar damage in the oral care segment, Colgate-Palmolive launched its own herbal toothpaste.




The Patanjali effect on Colgate-Palmolive is waning, possibly due to distribution and supply chain issues apart from the fading novelty of its products, according to JPMorgan’s report this month on the FMCG sector by Latika Chopra and Sushruta Mishra.

While hurting FMCG companies in the short term, Patanjali predominantly gained market share in commoditised categories made up of unorganised players.


‘COMPANY CAN TROUBLE UNORGANISED PLAYERS’
Competitive intensity has faded in the organised end since Patanjali’s products no longer have the unique selling proposition (USP) of being natural with other brands having entered the market at similar or lower price points, experts said.

“The threat has receded but it is more of a case of Patanjali having lost the plot,” said Milind Sarwate, former CFO of Marico and now an independent director on several boards. “They tried too many things. They have not looked at their growing in scale at the back end. They succeeded in demand creation but not in demand fulfilment. They fell short of the institutional strength to sustain the rising volume. Their threat is definitely lower because they had internal issues — supply not being on time, trade not happy with them.”

Patanjali is diversifying into new categories such as garments and education. It’s also in the fray to acquire Ruchi Soya, a large player in the commoditised industry of solvent extraction or edible oils.

Analysts say that the company is likely to pose more of a threat to the unorganised sector going forward.

“Even if Patanjali is able to overcome its recent issues on quality and supply chain, we expect it to gain market share in these commoditised categories at the expense of unorganised players, and not pose a major threat to the listed F&B companies playing in non-commoditised categories,” said the food and beverage report released by Systematix Investments earlier this month. Still, Patanjali retains the ability to create further disruption, said Sarwate.

“Patanjali cannot be ignored by the market leaders — they are capable of a surprise,” he said. “I expect them to do something dramatic like giving 30% discount on their products or so.”

The JPMorgan report says there is a downside risk for Dabur’s growth prospects due to the overlap of categories with Patanjali such as chyawanprash, honey, hair oil and toothpaste.

Based on ETIG data, Nestle and Britannia have outperformed on the ground as well as on the bourses, despite competition from Patanjali. Dabur also has managed to keep improving its performance amid competitive intensity.

HUL’s market share in soaps has been resilient even after the entry of Patanjali, according to the latest report by Reliance Securities."
17,2019-03-27,Britannia,"Smart money always gets in earlier and the local guy acts after the news, said Basant 
   
   
   Maheshwari, Co-founder & Partner, Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Bank Nifty is at a record high. Nifty is inching towards a life high. Would you call it a pre-election run-up or the beginning of a fresh run?
From a broad perspective, I will call it a post-election rally that is happening pre-election. Smart money is getting in. Once the election results are out and if this government comes back, the retailers would get in at whatever be the Nifty level at that point and whatever has been now would normally be sold to the retailers. This is an old story. Smart money always gets in earlier and the local guy acts after the news. We have always learnt this ever since we came into the market that buy at rumour and sell on news. That is what is happening right now.


We saw a similar factor at play in 2004 when smart money bought ahead of the elections but then the election verdict was not favourable.
The markets did come down at that time but if you remember there was this CPI(M) leader who suddenly said bhaar mein jai share bazaar (to hell with the share market) and that spooked the market at that time. For some people, share bazaar is life and death. I do not think any such situation would happen. But even if it does, it was just a knee-jerk reaction. What happened in 2004 was once the markets fell, they recovered in no time and CY2004 still gave a positive return. People say there is a huge risk of buying when there is no clarity. But I think there is a huge risk of buying when there is clarity. 

Six months back – there was the IL&FS issue and all the NBFCs were written off. Of course, 90% of them would never ever come back to the same price but the best one is ready to take out its all-time high. You have to buy looking at the fundamentals but we learnt an interesting lesson last year that fundamentals is not everything. There has to be something else which dictates why you buy and sell shares. It is a mix and match of everything but personally for our clients, for ourselves, we are more than fully invested and aggressively positioned.


All those naysayers on banks missed out in buying the Axis even Yes Bank. Do you think there is still money to be made in banks? Would the rally spread outside ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank to some degree and Axis? Would it spread to PSBs or is it going to be a very restrictive rally?
If you have a one-year view, we do not own it. It is not a recommendation. Axis and ICICI will outperform HDFC Bank but if you have a five-year view and you want to go back to sleep and don’t want to wake up each night thinking what is going to happen to the Nasdaq, to the Dow, to the SGX Nifty, HDFC Bank still remains a no-brainer. Again, it is not our recommendation.

Why I talk about one-year and five-year view is because ICICI and Axis are playing a valuation catch-up. It is not a growth catch-up. With the new management coming in, for Rs 2-3-4 lakh-crore asset book, how much money can one siphon off? That has already been taken care of by the market. I am talking about ICICI right now. Axis has the best of brains coming from an insurance company. He is going to try and change the bank but then this is not a five-year bet in my view. We do not own it and so I can talk about it. It is a one-year view, a six-month or maybe a nine-month view. But that is for people who want to buy and sell. Do buy and sell but if you want to still go back to sleep peacefully, HDFC Bank is there for you. 

Remember HDFC Bank did a QIP at Rs 2,200 last year and those QIP guys are still to see the price and HDFC is not another company in India which will do a QIP and never come back. They also noted that in three years they have to do another offering. So those guys have to make money and the management will ensure that the guys who bought it at Rs 2,200 last year would make money because they have to do this repetitively to make up the gap between the ROE and growth. So, HDFC Bank is also fine. All these big private banks are fine but if you want to be cute and start playing the PSU banks, that would be a very dangerous thing to do.


What has kept you away from Axis and ICICI Bank?
We were already holding the companies which we own and they were doing very well. In some cases, you do not want to sell a company just because you want to buy something else. If you have fresh cash, you go and buy it but normally you do not want to do all that tinkering unnecessarily. Also, we do not take very small positions, we normally take 10%, 15% of our portfolios. So, maybe we missed it, but we do not want to tinker around because the ones which we have, have also done quite well from the lows.


If I have to capture a 15-20% growth for next three years, which is that expensive consumer dominated stock I should go for? Or should I rather buy a cyclical/corporate bank or a beaten down NBFC where I will still get 15-18% growth at half the valuation?

About five years back, I had umpteen number of people calling and saying Corporation Bank lelo, iska dividend yield dekh lo, Dena Bank lelo iska dividend yield dekh lo (Buy Corporation Bank, Dena Bank. Look at their dividend yield). Suddenly we realised what a mess we are in. The point is consistency is the single most important factor in stock analysis and we have understood that. Sometimes you have to pay a lot of money, sometimes you pay little money to understand that. If you are sure about it, 15-18% is not good enough for a 40 PE, it has to be above or around 25%. If you are sure of 25% growth for the next 10 years or like seven years at least, not five, not three, I would pay 40-50 trailing to buy a 25% growing company for the next five, seven years. 

But if the growth is in the 15-18% range, you go and buy an Asian Paints or anything else. It is a little difficult to actually put your finger on the pie but then what decides that PE is not just growth, it is the sustainability of that growth, the ability of the company to handle its situation and still deliver the growth like out of the NBFC space where 60-80% of the companies were almost wiped off their feet last October. But still there was one company which delivered stellar results. So, why not buy more of that because once the competition weakens the market share shifting process becomes a lot more easier. 

All opinions do not make money and we have understood that we might have 200 different opinions but then you have to go and act on that. Right now, everybody has an opinion but nobody wants to act on that opinion. They are just waiting for something to happen and that something would be 11,700 taken out around the election time. That is where the new gush of money is going to come in. 

That is where everybody would find something good to talk about and something good to buy in this market, till that gets taken out, we will have our own fear about whether to buy or not to buy.


How did you insulate yourself in this entire NBFC/HFC slowdown? You have owned HFC stocks in the past. Is this an opportunity to shift your portfolio to better quality NBFCs or HFCs or are you thinking twice about where the sector is headed?
We do not own any HFC right now. We got fed up and dumped it sometime back and we bought a great consumer company which should grow 25% for the next five, seven, eight years. We just own one NBFC and it is not a recommendation again, everybody knows it. It is Bajaj Finance and we are more than fully invested into that as on the allocation perspective and they should do fine. That is about it. 

We make mistakes in life and my mistake was balance sheet is not enough so it is like unless the kanya daan happens, the baratis would not get the food to eat. The kanya daan did not happen with HFC and we got no food to eat. After two years, with stock doubling, we almost sold when it fell 30-40% from the top but that is how life is. We learn something new in life and then you move on. 


What would you buy if you had extra cash right now? Would it be cyclicals?
I do not think we should be buying cyclicals because nothing changes. It is the same country, same politicians, same politics, same policies and sometimes I get fearful of the way this country is going to polls. It seems the politicians have formed a group to auction the entire country! Somebody says I will give you Rs 6,000, somebody says I will give you Rs 1,500. People forget it is our money. The country cannot be auctioned for politics and then the Election Commission will charge somebody who distributes Rs 500 and one liquor bottle saying this is bribing. 

Somebody should file a PIL in the Supreme Court saying that this kind of pre-election dole-out should be completely banned from this country because if this happens, you will not have Bangladeshis and Burmese people coming to India. You will have Indians going into Burma and Bangladesh. I am very fearful of what politics is going to turn right now. So you better be in the best consumer and financial services names. Make 2% less, but at least protect the Rs 100 that you had brought to the market.


 A lot of companies are deleveraging and some amount of consolidation is on. What would be the outcome going forward?
First you goof up and then you go and deleverage. Look what happened to Jet. First they goofed up and then nobody wanted 200 pilots and 5,000 airhostesses going around airports protesting just before an election and so Jet was actually asked to extend its life. A company like Jet is not a recommendation. It has just been put on a ventilator. When your operating profit is less than the interest cost that you have to pay, the best you can do is survive. Even if you can survive. where is the cash flow to repay the debt? 

A lot of telecom companies are under this situation right now. Unless the big daddy of them all actually increases prices, it is like stopping the oxygen flow from your peer group. In the telecom sector, a couple of companies are standing on the brink. This deleveraging is not happening just because suddenly they have decided to let us reward the minority. It is happening out of compulsion and deleveraging happening out of compulsion is never a great thing for shareholders. Deleveraging when it happens on a discretionary basis is great because normally the valuation of a company goes up multi-fold when it starts repaying debt out of cash flow. But if you repay debt by selling off your assets, it is something different.


Would you say the same about DLF also? After the Rs 3,000-crore QIP, they are almost debt free now?
Not DLF. No recommendation again. But they do not have this problem of getting into bankruptcy. It is a different story. I am talking about the telecom companies, the airline companies where one doesn’t know how far this deleveraging is going to take them. The deleveraging only guarantees an extension of the old life. Investor should be very mindful of what they are doing right now because as Rs 200 stocks go to Rs 250, you think something has changed. I have got nothing against these companies -- neither short nor long. 


Which are some stocks which you do not own but you would like to own? If there is a crash, where will you be a buyer?
We do not own it and it is not a recommendation but Axis and ICICI are good. Please do not buy just because I am saying it. Do your own research. May be in the consumer space, something which we do not own and something which you have liked for a while -- Britannia looks okay. Companies like these are okay but again not a recommendation for the viewers. 


Those who are sitting on cash, if they find value they should put money to work even though election it could have short-term implications of 5%, 10%, 15% in midcap stocks. That should not stop you from investing.
Absolutely. It is much much easier to buy a stock and see it go down 30% than to buy a stock 10% above the price at which you first saw it. If you missed a certain stock, what are you going to do? You are going to buy the B or the C or the D names of that sector and that is what investors should not be doing. 

If you are okay buying something at 10% above after elections, then you should wait. But if you missed stock A, and then bought B or C or D, that is where the problem starts. It is okay to buy when the stock fell 10%. Finally, it is a stock market and not a fixed deposit which is going to hit an all-time high every second. You just buy it. If it falls, it falls. That’s about it."

Sebi turns heat on debt MFs’ loan deals with promotersThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is conducting a detailed probe into complex structures that debt mutual funds have entered into for loans to promoter group firms in recent years.

This capital infusion is for the current fiscal ending March 31, 2019. The Indian Overseas Bank and Central Bank were the other two recipients.



Rural consumer demand cools on poll heat, farm stressConsumer demand for daily groceries, apparel, smartphones and electronics, especially in rural markets, has eased since January due to preelection uncertainty, tighter liquidity and depressed farm incomes following a patchy monsoon. Rural consumption, which accounts for about a third of the market, saw a revival with double-digit growth in the past two years, outpacing the rate of expansion in cities.



US-China talks could drag for monthsUS trade talks with China could stretch for “months”, Donald Trump’s top economic adviser said on Thursday, offering the latest indication of a slowdown in the negotiations to end the commercial conflict between the world’s two most powerful economies. China has made unprecedented proposals in talks with the United States on a range of issues including forced technology transfer as the two sides work to overcome remaining obstacles to a deal to end their protracted trade war.



Last chance for May's Brexit DealBritish Prime Minister Theresa May hopes to bring her twice-defeated Brexit deal back to parliament for another vote. To get it through she will need to win over at least 75 lawmakers. At least 20 Conservative lawmakers have indicated since March 12 that they would now support her deal, mainly due to fears the alternative could be a closer relationship with the European Union or not leaving at all.



Third-party motor insurance rates unchanged for new fiscalIn a relief for motor insurance holders, annual premium rates increase for third party motor insurance policies have been put on hold for the next financial year for now.

23,2019-03-30,Britannia,"Global funds are making a beeline for India big time. Their growing interest, along with expectations of Narendra Modi taking power again and forecast of plentiful rains ahead, gave the bulls enough will power to stay in-charge for the sixth straight week on Dalal Street. 

The Sensex rose 1.33 per cent, or 508 points, to 38,673 for the week to March 30. NSE's Nifty jumped 1.46 per cent, or 167 points, to 11,624. 

The finance ministry said liquidity in the economy is comfortable and will improve further with the central bank’s move to infuse Rs 35,000 crore through the rupee-dollar swap auction. That was good enough to stoke investment appetite.

“Hopes of a stable government took the Sensex higher by almost 8 per cent this month. Buying has been mainly led by FIIs who have put in around Rs 45,000 core into domestic markets. We believe that any rate cuts in developed markets such as the US or Europe may result in steady inflows for emerging markets (EMs),” said Hemang Jani, Head-Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

All eyes are on national elections starting next month, which will keep domestic markets volatile in the short term. The results are due on May 23. 

In the long term, corporate earnings growth and revival in private capex remain crucial for further market upside, say experts.

How did major stocks and sectors play up the whole week? There we go.

While the industry structure remains largely duopoly, the company has emerged as a formidable challenger to leader EXIDE, with a market leadership in telecom and UPS segments, and a fast gaining share in autos, said the brokerage. 

• SBICAP Securities recommend hold rating on Dabur with a target price of ₹500. We like Dabur as diversification not only makes it safe and less vulnerable to sudden competitive, regulatory, inflationary and growth issues in any category but also ensures stable growth, said the brokerage.

• Reliance Securities has recommended buy rating on Maruti Suzuki with target price of ₹7,750, valuing the stock at 21 times FY21 estimated EPS. Maruti has been banking on success of its new launches and the brokerage expects increase in first time buyers from healthy rural demand post election amid government’s rural focus.

3,2019-04-05,Britannia,"Forecast of a below-normal monsoon this year by Skymet Weather Services could reverse the positive consumption outlook for the next two quarters and estimates may have to be lowered, consumer goods and auto companies said.

“Weak monsoons will impact the India consumption story,” Britannia managing director Varun Berry said. “A setback to the agricultural economy will certainly impact disposable incomes of the 100 million farmers in the country. We hope Skymet has got it wrong this time.”

Rural markets contribute 25% of revenue for the maker of Good Day and Nutrichoice biscuits and Britannia cheese.

“A below-normal monsoon could impact discretionary spending and we expect some consumption stress in May and June if that happens,” Dabur India chief executive Sunil Duggal said. Rural India accounts for close to half of Dabur’s domestic sales.

In the auto sector, a below-normal monsoon would compound the problem of passenger vehicle and two-wheeler sales growth that would be in lower single digits, companies said. The hinterland and rural areas have made up for falling sales in the major metropolitan cities and any impact on these areas may mean a further lowering of growth rates in the current financial year.

“We have forecast growth of 6-8% for passenger vehicles and two-wheelers due to pre-buying ahead of BSVI (emission standards). We may have to revise it downwards in case of a weak monsoon,” said Subrata Ray, senior group vice president at rating company ICRA.

Skymet said on Wednesday that it expects the monsoon to be ‘below normal’ at 93% of the long-period average of 887 mm for the four-month period from June to September. Normal rainfall would be 96-104% of the long-period average.


Hyundai Motor India national sales head Vikas Jain said that while a healthy monsoon is critical for good growth in rural areas, the spread of rainfall across the country is also important.

“If the monsoon is below normal, car buying takes second priority. I think need-based buying will continue. However, it is the discretionary purchases which will be hit due to weak rains,” Jain said.

N Raja, deputy MD at Toyota Kirloskar, said a below-normal monsoon may impact the festive season this year.

“We were forecasting 3-4% growth in FY20 on the optimistic side, but if the fears of a weak monsoon come true, we will be happy to match FY19 sales,” said Raja.

According to analysts, macroeconomic headwinds such as slower GDP growth, soft consumer price indices and prolonged winters have already impacted the consumption of summer products.

“If the monsoon is below normal, it will hurt an already stressed agrarian economy,” said Anil Chugh, president (consumer ca6re) at Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting, the maker of Santoor soap. “However, Skymet is slightly early in its forecasting and we will wait and watch.”

For Wipro, the rural markets account for 30-35% of annual sales.

An ITC spokesperson said: “The currently buoyant rural demand would naturally be impacted if subnormal monsoon results in lower productivity of the rain-dependant kharif crops. But actual productivity depends on distribution of rainfall during the growing season.”

She added that since farm incomes are supplemented by a number of other sources in the rural economy such as livestock, the company is optimistic, but will keep a close watch on the situation.

Some were of the view that rural areas are no longer vulnerable to weak monsoons.

According to Rajan Wadhera, president for the automotive sector at Mahindra & Mahindra, while the rural economy was previously largely dependent on agri-business, now with other sources of income generation in the hinterland, the impact of a weak monsoon has eased."

10,2019-04-22,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: A strong across-the-board selling, triggered by a sharp rise in crude oil prices and a drop in the rupee made equity benchmark Sensex suffer its biggest fall of Calendar 2019 in absolute terms on Monday.

""The market fell on worries of a sharp rise in crude oil prices. The US is soon likely to ask all importers of Iranian oil to end their purchases or face sanctions,"" said Pankaj Pandey, Head Research at ICICI Securities. India being the world’s third biggest oil importer, elevated oil prices distort its fiscal maths, widen current account deficit, weaken its currency and stoke inflation.

A 495 points, or 1.26 per cent, fall dragged Sensex to 38,645, while Nifty finished at 11,594, down 158 points or 1.35 per cent.


Let's take a look at the top highlights of Monday's session:

Nearly Rs 2 lakh crore wiped outThe selloff dragged the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,51,58,835.28 crore from Rs 1,53,53,416.71 crore on Thursday, making equity investors poorer by Rs 1.94 lakh crore.


176 stocks hit lower circuitsAs many as 176 stocks, including Reliance Communications, 8K Miles Software Services, ARSS Infrastructure Projects, Delta Magnets and Darshan Orna, hit lower circuits on BSE. Jaiprakash Power Ventures, Salora International and Jaypee Infratech were among the 139 stocks that hit upper circuits.


YES Bank, Tata Steel below 200-DMAsYES Bank, Tata Steel, HDFC Life, DLF, NMDC, BPCL, Reliance Nippon, Ashoka Buildcon, L&T Finance and Cummins India were among the stocks that witnessed negative breakouts and traded below their 200-DMAs. On the other hand, Mastek, FCS Software and Gujarat Heavy Chemicals were among the stocks that traded above their 200-DMAs.


179 stocks signal potential fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 179 counters on BSE, signalling imminent fall in these stocks. Among them were DHFL, IDBI Bank, BHEL, Tata Steel, Wockhardt and Omaxe. Meanwhile, 47 stocks, including L&T Infotech, Britannia Industries, Timex Group India and Alicon Castalloy, witnessed bullish crossovers.


RIL shares fall 3%Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 2.76 per cent to Rs 1,344.80 even after the company on Thursday reported March quarter profit in line with estimates. Some market participants said while the better-than-expected March quarter profit numbers were already in the price, lower average revenue per user (Arpu) of RIL’s telecom business Jio disappointed investors.


HDFC Bank slips despite good Q4 showShares of HDFC Bank closed 0.96 per cent lower at Rs 2,268, falling prey to a broader selloff as most bank stocks bled. The fall was capped as brokerages gave a thumbs up to the lender's March quarter numbers. The bank's Rs 5,885 crore quarterly profit was highest ever for any quarter and it marked the third straight quarter of Rs 5,000 crore-plus profit for the bank.


Jet shares fall 6%Shares of Jet Airways closed 5.67 per cent down at Rs 154.60, extending the losses into the third consecutive session. In last three sessions, the scrip has come off 41 per cent. After the closure of operations, the airline is now facing the risk of landing at NCLT as one of its service providers shot a notice under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of 2016 to pay up its dues within 10 days.


DHFL shares crack 11%Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) closed 10.91 per cent down at Rs 140.05 after rating agency Crisil downgraded the company's commercial papers worth Rs 850 crore from A2+ to A3+ and continued on watch negative. In a BSE filing, the company said Crisil's belief that liquidity levels remain subdued and low visibility in raising funds were the reasons for downgrading the stock.


SpiceJet breaks 5-day winning streakShares of SpiceJet cracked as much as 8.15 per cent to Rs 125.15 after five consecutive days of gains. In the last five sessions, the stock had jumped 44 per cent. A surge in crude oil prices is seen as a reason for the fall in the stock price.


Oil & gas top sectoral loserThe BSE oil & gas index settled 3.20 per cent lower at 14,528.31, leading the pack of sectoral losers. All components of the index suffered losses in the light of a sharp rise in global crude oil prices."

Though charts are suggesting an uptrend for the Nifty, markets are cautiously optimistic and there is an increased risk awareness among options participants, said technical analysts. Britannia, HUL, Hero Motocorp, Apollo Tyres, Balkrishna Ind and GSK Consumers are some of the stocks that look promising on the charts, they said.

Where we are: The holidaycurtailed week gone by was dull yet eventful with the Nifty marking an all-time high of 11,856 amidst the on-going Lok Sabha elections and macro uncertainty. Nifty closed the week at 11,752.


What is in store: Expect rangebound trade on the Nifty as we head into the expiry week. Levels wise, 11,820-11,890 target zones and 11,600-11,720 support zones. Nifty’s 200 DMA is at 10,980.


What could investors do: Investors can look at accumulating quality scrips from a long term point of view. Stock-specific, FMCG majors Britannia and HUL show good chart structures and can be accumulated at current levels for higher targets of 3,600 and 1,852, respectively. Two-wheeler major Hero Motors has been long consolidating in the current range and can be accumulated for short to medium term target of 2,900-3,400. Apollo Tyres and Balkrishna Industries also look good on charts and are expected to head towards 235, 1,052 in short to medium term. Among midcap counters, GSK Consumers, L&T Technology are showing promising charts and can be accumulated for higher targets of 7,900 and 1,850."
11,2019-04-23,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: It took just two sessions for Nifty50 to test the sub-10,600 level on Monday from an all-time high of 11,856 hit last Thursday. Friday was a public holiday.

While trading kicked off on a positive note on Tuesday, back-to-back selloffs seen in the previous two sessions made analysts believe the breakout signal triggered by the reclamation of the previous peak of 11,761 was probably false. If that’s so, outlook for over a hundred stocks would look weak, as suggested by various technical indicators.

Among them one is the momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD charts, which is already signalling a bearish bias for 127 stocks on NSE.

The indicator showed bearish crossovers – a negative undertone – on these counters, hinting at possible downsides in the days ahead. 

Many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The stocks on the list are from across sectors like financials, drug makers and consumers as well as firms due to unveil their earnings. 

The list included Suzlon Energy, Dewan Housing (DHFL), Reliance Infrastructure, BHEL, IDBI Bank, Tata Steel, Wockhardt, Strides Pharma, Future Consumer and JK Paper, among others.

Marksans Pharma, Dhanlakshmi Bank, J&K Bank, Tata Chemicals, SBI Life Insurance, CEAT, Dr Reddy’s Labs, JSW Energy, CESC and The Ramco Cement, too, are a part of the list.











Tata Global Beverages and ACC, which are scheduled to announce their quarterly numbers later on Tuesday, too, are part of this list. 

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa. 

Data showed 18 stocks made bullish crossovers on Monday. The list included Gati, Quick Heal Technologies, Britannia Industries, L&T Infotech and Monsanto India.





The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio. 

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

“At this juncture, the ideal strategy would be to stay light on positions. It’s better not to pre-empt any kind of moves. Instead, one should try to adopt a confirmatory approach for a while,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

He expects Nifty50 to find resistance at 11,653 and then 11,705 levels.

Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan believes the swing low of 11,550 holds the key for further move. “A breach of this level on a closing basis shall entail a deeper correction in Nifty50,” he said.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Suzlon Energy shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has shown a downward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 2.90 per cent lower at Rs 6.60 on NSE."
12,2019-04-23,Britannia,"When it comes to investing in Indian stocks, consumption is a theme one can ill-afford to ignore.

While rising incomes and an ever-growing younger population make consumption a sure-shot bet, newer trends in the market are throwing up definitive cues on where money is waiting to be made.

Indian policymakers’ increased focus on financially empowering the poor, and rapid spread of mobile and internet are working as an icing on the cake for investors looking to cash in on India’s consumption boom.

India Inc is taking note.

Billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani last month acquired ITC’s mid-segment menswear brand John Players to strengthen Reliance Retail’s readymade garments and accessories portfolio in the fashion and lifestyle retail space.

In another development, Aditya Birla-led Grasim Industries acquired Soktas India for Rs 135.12 crore. Soktas India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Soktas Tekstil Sanayi ve Ticaret AS, a world-renowned producer and marketer of premium shirting fabrics with its main facilities at Soke in Turkey.

The growth potential of India’s consumption sector can also be gauged from the fact that India emerged as the only big market to clock FMCG growth of 13.8 per cent in 2018 while global growth stood at 2-2.50 per cent, according to AC Nielson.

That high base may result in a slowdown in consumption this year, but it still remains a solid bet for faster growth.

“This sector is in a long-term bull market,” says Atul Suri, CEO, Marathon Trends PMS. “I have been overweight on consumption on a longer timeframe,” he told ETNow in an interview.

Divergent trends have emerged in this space of late; some stocks are faltering while others are touching lifetime highs. 

“There are divergent trends emerging across the sector. We like to identify stocks and watch their behaviour in a falling market, because stocks that go up or hold up well in a falling market usually emerge as leaders in the next bull market,” Suri said.

Analysts say lifestyle changes among individuals, especially millennials, is the hottest theme, as this is what is increasingly driving India’s consumption story.

There are expectations that India will become the largest country globally in terms of population size at 1.60 billion by 2030. It currently has around 1.05 billion citizens in the age group of 15-60 against China’s 0.98 billion.

Going with market experts, FMCG, e-commerce, smartphone manufacturers, auto, telecom, education, and services are some of the industries that are likely to benefit, given the spending behaviour of these consumers. 

In the offline space, the salience of food products is increasing in every retail outlet as witnessed in rising throughput per store, says Elara Capital.

The brokerage believes the food space is expected to perform better than home and personal care (HPC) products in calendar 2019. 

Elara recommends Britannia with a price target of Rs 3,478 and Nestle with a target price of Rs 11,716 as these companies have been growing direct reach every year.

In the online space, health (juices), organic, babycare products (diapers, skincare and wipes), ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook products and children & school-oriented foods were among the fastest-growing categories in Calendar 2018. 
At present, eCommerce contributes around 2 per cent of total FMCG sales in India. With the rise of smartphone us, the figure is likely to multiply in the days ahead.

India is projected to have around 1,200 million smartphone users by 2030 against 300 million in 2016. It may touch 440 million by the end of next year, according to a research done by AC Nielsen and Elara Securities.

Select companies are already doing profitable business riding the eCommerce boom.

Bata India’s Ram Kumar Gupta says its eCommerce business is quite profitable and the contribution from the medium is almost 6 per cent. 

Brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Bata India with a target price of Rs 1,479.

Organised players engaged in production and distribution of health food drinks as well as milk and milk products are the others to watch.

India’s per capita milk consumption stood at 110 gm until 1970s and was declining. It now stands at 370-380 gm and is expected to reach 800-850 gm a day (equivalent to that of Europe and the US today) by 2030. In the dairy space, Elara is bullish on Heritage Foods and Parag Milk Foods with price targets of Rs 825 and Rs 366, respectively.

Despite a 12.50 per cent rally, the BSE FMCG index underperformed Sensex (up 15 per cent) in FY19. Stocks like Balrampur Chini Mills, Dalmia Bharat, United Breweries, Godfrey Phillips, Dabur, Nestle, HUL and Britannia Industries advanced 25-77 per cent during the financial year, while Kwality, Manpasand Beverages, LT Foods and Ruchi Soya tanked over 50 per cent."
14,2019-04-24,Britannia,"The growth baton has shifted from global cyclicals to the domestic cyclicals and domestic cyclicals is nothing but banks, said Gautam Duggad, Head - Research, Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Will the outperformance this earnings season remain with the financials or do you think there is a fair chance that there could be some other dark horses too?
Absolutely. This is a quarter of financials. We are expecting a 15% Nifty earnings growth but you take out the three corporate banks and the growth is a decline of 3% for the Nifty. 

For our broader universe under Motilal Oswal coverage, we are expecting a 29% growth but again if you take out PSU banks where we are seeing a swing from a loss of Rs 24,000 crore odd in the base quarter to a profit of Rs 5,000-crore odd, the growth is absolutely flat. So this is a quarter of financials. Last quarter was also the same. 

In the third quarter FY19 also, the Nifty earnings growth was somewhere around 8-9% and ex of those three banks, the growth is 0%. So clearly, FY20 is going to be led by financials. For whatever reason, if there are big changes in the financials’ numbers -- either on the upside or on the downside -- it will have a disproportionate impact on the broader market earnings. 

It is a very crucial part of FY20 earnings recovery because ex of those banks, Nifty earnings growth for FY20 is just 13-14% which in itself is a very healthy number if you compare with the trend in the last four or five years, but the expected reported growth of 24% is by and large been driven by the corporate banks which is where our portfolio is overweight.


You are looking at PSUs closely. What you are anticipating there and why do you feel that earnings growth could be led by that pocket?
As far as PSUs are concerned, we just have SBI in our portfolio where we have actually increased the weightage by 100 bps this quarter. Other than SBI, rest of the PSU banks are going to see extreme volatility, specifically pertaining to the quarter you are sitting on. For one, the base will be extremely benign. In the base quarter, SBI had reported a Rs 7,000-8,000-crore loss, PNB had reported Rs 13,000 crore of loss and BOB had also reported a loss of Rs 3,000 crore. So, in Q4 this year, our estimate is around Rs 5,000 crore of profit amongst these three, four banks which is sequentially flat, but the year-on-year comparison looks very good. 

Going forward, we will still have to be very watchful on the asset quality trends plus the capitalisation levels and how the growth on the credit side that we are getting because the fact remains that post the NBFC crisis in September, we have seen market share shifting away from NBFCs to the banks and the early results which have come in from the private banks side -- be it HDFC Bank of DCB, AU, RBL. The numbers were very fantastic for all the four banks -- be it credit quality, top line growth or margins. Clearly, the market share shift from NBFC incrementally towards the banks is underway. 

The early beneficiary obviously will be the private banks given the capitalisation levels which are there and overall liquidity situation in the market. From a PSU bank point of view, we are clearly more biased towards SBI. 

From a trade perspective, last quarter we had added PNB which still remains a part of the portfolio but that was more a valuation call. As far as fundamental, structural earnings trajectory is concerned, one will have to see how the overall asset quality trends pans out for the next two or three quarters because incrementally new issues keep coming to the fore. 


Which are the sectors you would avoid? 
In FY17-18 and a large part of FY19, the earnings growth was by and large led by two metals and oil and gas. Incrementally, since the second quarter of FY19, the growth baton has shifted from global cyclicals to the domestic cyclicals and domestic cyclicals is nothing but banks which we discussed a minute back. 

As far as global cyclicals are concerned, in the second half of FY19, the earnings trajectory of metals started moderating and in FY20, we will get the first year of earnings decline vis-à-vis the performance of last three years. 

Similarly, for oil and gas, for the quarter we are expecting a very flat growth, largely because of the decline that we are expecting in OMCs. Last quarter, OMCs had completely gone down the drain with a 90% YoY profit decline. This quarter, while YoY comparison looks sequentially slightly better, at a 25-30% decline, it is still a meaningful decline.

The other stocks where we are seeing growth are Reliance or ONGC. But there the valuations remain crippled because of the various policy related issues as far as the upstream oil companies are concerned and now with crude at $74-75, there is always a cap on the valuation expansion that one can expect. So they remain a value pack. Their PE ratios are not very expensive but that is the band that they have traded in the past and incrementally the earnings trajectory is moderating. That is where we have been underweight for some time now.

Pharma is a sector which has not seen any earnings growth for last four-five years. While a few companies may have done well here and there in that broader pack of 25 stocks that we cover will have good quarter especially the midcaps. But for largecaps, the earnings fortune remains very subdued even on a low base. 

Five years back, the earnings pool for our pharma universe was at around Rs 17,000-18,000 crore. After five years, it is at Rs 21,000 crore. We have had hardly seen any growth and incrementally the return ratios for these companies in the pharma sector have been in the 14-15% band. So while their call is defensive, but the return ratios are not defensives. Earning predictability is not there and at the margin, we are not seeing any meaningful improvement. While the decline has stemmed, you are not seeing any catalyst for an upside right now. 


Your top picks include Titan, Pidilite. Also some of the banks have had a really good run of late. What you would do with some of these names?
Some of these names have done exceedingly well. When you look at consumption companies -- Titan, Pidilite, Hindustan Lever or Britannia -- you cannot take a view on them from a one-year perspective because these are very solid franchises with underlying trends in their favour. 

For example, Titan is the biggest beneficiary of unorganised to organised move following GST. We have been liking the stock since 2016. It was expensive even then, it is more expensive today. But the fact remains that in the Rs 2 lakh-crore jewellery market, the composition of the organised trade is still sub-20%. 

So, the growth horizon for companies like Titan is a multi-year growth story. So, do you want to take a one-year forward PE call and sell it today and then regret later? It is obviously a “no”. But these stocks can have a substantial period of time correction -- be it 6, 12 months -- nobody knows. 

But the strategy on such long-term structural story is to buy and hold. Pidilite has always looked expensive at any given point of time in the last five years. The stock has still compounded pretty well. Same is the case with Hindustan Lever also, Britannia. I recognised that the valuations are expensive on one year forward basis. These stocks could have a time correction and if monsoon is not favourable, maybe there could be a decline. 

But timing the stock is something very difficult in the consumption space. We will have our four or five preferred bets and that we will keep on holding. That is the call on consumption and on private banks. We still see that the new cycle has just begun and there is a possibility of earnings upgrade happening in the next one or two years for a lot of these well managed private corporate banks. 

In fact, in the last quarter, we had seen earnings upgrade for ICICI and Axis after a long time. We have not seen any earnings change in these banks and incrementally the credit quality is improving, the guidance for our ROE is far stronger. We have seen the results of some of the midcap private sector banks also. Right now the cycle has just begun. While they have done well, in a new upcycle, valuations do tend to overshoot just like in a down cycle. We have seen valuations undershoot for a fairly long period of time in 2016, 17 and 18. We will remain biased towards private corporate banks at this stage. 

Within the retail space in the private banks, our preference still remains with HDFC Bank. That is how we are positioned on consumption and private banks."

16,2019-04-26,Britannia,"Domestic stocks have been witnessing choppiness over the past week after a strong rally since mid-February. Yet, market-wide rollover of derivative contracts to May series suggests traders are paying little heed to the weakening macro-economic indicators and are gung ho on market prospects, as they price in a favourable election outcome.

Yet, macros are increasingly turning unfavourable. Brent crude rules near $75 and is poised for more gains when the US tightens its sanctions on Iran early May. 

The rupee has been witnessing a lot of pressure; it slumped 39 paise to close at a six-week low of 70.25 against the US dollar on Thursday. And some key indicators of the economy like auto sales numbers are showing signs of an imminent slowdown.

That does not look like a strong foundation for a market rally to build on. Analysts say 3Es – election, economy and earnings – will decide market direction from here on, and only one of them is looking somewhat comfortable at this stage.

Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty scaled all-time high levels earlier this month, rallying some 10 per cent since their February 2019 lows amid unabated inflows from foreign institutional investors and hopes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi returning to power.

On an average, overseas investors have poured more than Rs 1,300 crore a day into Indian equities since February 1, which was deployed largely in largecap stocks and front-running names from across sectors. Even beaten-down midcaps and smallcaps have gained momentum in the past two months.

Analysts say this is a pre-election rally, driven entirely by increased liquidity. It has nothing to do with select sectors at this point. An adverse verdict in the elections can bring about major changes in the market.

“Investors should remain cautious. They should pick stocks wisely. There is no exceptional theme to play at this point of time. Most sectors are up and one must wait till the election results are out to put their money in quality names,” said Shyam Sekhar, co-founder, iThought.

Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity & Portfolio Advisory, Anand Rathi Financial Services, said the market would be a little volatile and nervous till elections and earnings season get over.

“However, stock-specific momentum will continue and we can see strong performance in midcaps where the business momentum is intact,” he said.

After falling up to 40 per cent between January 1, 2018 and February 19, 2019, all the sectoral indices on BSE have moved northward. Realty, Consumer Durables, Power, Metal, Capital Goods and Oil indices and Bankex have climbed over 10 per cent since February 19. Others like Healthcare, Auto, IT, FMCG, Teck and telecom indices gained between 3 per cent and 9 per cent during this period.

“After about eight disappointing quarters, we could see about 13 per cent to 15 per cent PAT growth in Q4 earnings, largely boosted by private financial and metal firms. OMCs are not expected to do well because of cyclical oil price movement,” he said.

Mehta advised investors to bet on select capital goods, private financials and banking names. He said HDFC Bank can do well in the short run. Other retail banks such as RBL Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank too can do well.

Among defensive bets, consumer stocks like Britannia Industries and HUL look good as does capital goods major L&T, he said. 

Smallcap and midcap players like Tara Jewels, Kwality, KSK Energy Ventures, Jyoti Structures, Rolta India, ABG Shipyard, which have lost over 90 per cent of their value since January 2018, have risen up to 275 per cent from their February lows.

Others like BIL Energy System, Jai Balaji Industries, PC Jewellers, Suzlon Energy, E-Land Apparel, Nu Teck India and MPS Infotechnics have rallied between 100 per cent and 330 per cent during the same period.

RBI recently lowered the GDP growth forecast for this financial year to 7.2 per cent from an earlier estimate of 7.4 per cent amid the probability of El Nino affecting monsoon rains and uncertain global economic outlook.

In its February monetary policy statement, RBI projected the GDP growth for 2019-20 at 7.4 per cent, with growth for the first half (April-September) estimated at 7.2-7.4 per cent.

“Our growth trajectory is very high. Post elections, we will have a better picture of the economy. This will decide the fate of the market,” said Mehta."
17,2019-04-28,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Election-related jitters, crude oil prices, heightened VIX, rupee movement and April F&O expiry swayed sentiment in the domestic market last week. 

Benchmarks Sensex and Nifty swung between gains and losses through the week.

Eventually, on a weekly basis, Sensex slipped 73 points, or 0.2 per cent, while Nifty added 2 points. 

Going into a week, crude oil, rupee, March quarter earnings and macroeconomic data will be among the important factors steering the market. 

It is going to be a truncated week as the market will remain closed on Monday for voting in the general election and on Wednesday on account of Maharashtra Day.


Let's take a look at the factors that are likely to influence market movement in the coming week.

Key March quarter earnings
The earnings season is at its peak and hundreds of companies will release their numbers during the coming week. Ambuja Cements, Can Fin Homes and Kotak Mahindra Bank will release their March quarter numbers on Tuesday, while Britannia Industries will come out with its numbers on Wednesday. Bandhan Bank, Dabur India, MRF and Tata Power will release their earnings numbers on Thursday, and Hindustan Unilever will announce its results on Friday. The numbers of these sectoral majors are expected to have a significant impact on market sentiment.


Investors to watch data prints
India's infrastructure output and fiscal deficit numbers for March will be out next week and the market is going to keenly observe those numbers. Both data are expected to be released on Tuesday. Nikkei Markit Manufacturing PMI for April is another important number, scheduled to be released on Thursday.


US Fed’s rate review
The interest rate decision of the US Fed will be out on Wednesday night (India time). While a rate pause looks almost certain, investors are speculating about the tone of the Fed when Wall Street is near record highs, recession worries are ebbing and the health of the US economy looks brighter after it grew at 3.2 per cent in the first quarter. As per a Reuters poll, it is unlikely that the Fed will hike rates as inflation is below the Fed’s threshold and unemployment is the lowest in generations.


Global macro data to watch 
The market is also expected to react to global sentiment as a number of important macroeconomic prints, including China NBS Manufacturing PMI data and Caixin Manufacturing PMI data for April, US ISM Manufacturing PMI data and nonfarm payrolls data for April and eurozone's GDP and inflation numbers will be released during the week. 


Election politics
Analysts are of the view that the market will keep experiencing occasional jitters until the results of the general election are out on May 23. ""One needs to remember we are entering the final few phases of voting and this is the month India will have its new government. So volatility is in the wind, and that will be blowing throughout the month,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.


Crude oil price 
During the week gone by, the market reacted sharply to the fluctuation in crude oil prices and it will remain an important immediate trigger for market movement even during the coming week. Crude oil prices fell 3 per cent on Friday after the US President asked Opec to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. The market may see some gains if oil prices remain in the lower orbit.


Rupee movement
The rupee rebounded by 23 paise to close at 70.02 against the US dollar on Friday, supported by a drop in crude oil prices and the greenback's weakness against key rivals overseas. The health of the domestic currency will have a strong impact on the mood of the equity market.


Technical readings
Nifty50 breached a previous swing high of 11,761 on Friday and closed a tad below that level. Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said Nifty trends remain positive and chances are that it may move towards the 10,850-870 range by next week. The 11,800 level could act as a strong resistance, a break of which may push the index to a record high."

18,2019-04-30,Britannia,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: The Wadia Group said Ness Wadia’s position as a director on the boards of its companies won’t be affected by his conviction in Japan on drug charges because the sentence had been suspended. Investors appeared to disagree, with stocks of Bombay Dyeing and other group companies dropping sharply before recouping some of their losses.

A Japanese court sentenced the elder son of industrialist Nusli Wadia to two years in jail for possession of 25 gm of cannabis resin last month. The Sapporo court suspended the sentence for five years, which typically means that it won’t be implemented unless he breaks the law again in Japan. Indian courts don’t suspend sentences. The Financial Times was the first to report the matter.

“Ness Wadia is in India. The judgment is clear,” said a Wadia Group spokesperson in an email. “It is a suspended sentence. Hence it will not impact Ness Wadia in the discharge of any of his responsibilities and he will continue to play the role that he has done hitherto, both within the group and outside.”

Wadia is the MD of Bombay Burmah and a director of Bombay Dyeing, Britannia Industries and National Peroxide. Bombay Dyeing fell 17.6% intraday while Bombay Burmah dropped 6.4%. National Peroxide fell 6.7% and Britannia by 3.1%.

INTERPRETATION OF RULES
Wadia, according to sources, spent a period in detention before and after his indictment on March 20, pending the court hearing. Drug laws in Japan are strict and offenders can face jail of up to seven years. However, first-time offenders are usually given a suspended sentence, diplomatic sources said. Wadia had admitted to possession of cannabis and said that it was for his own use, they said. He said he was traveling to Hokkaido for a skiing holiday.

The issue will likely be discussed at Britannia’s annual results board meeting on Wednesday, a top executive close to the development said.

“Tough questions will hopefully be asked. The fact is it is a conviction and he has not been absolved from any crime whatsoever,” he said. “Ness may not be conducting any major executive roles in the companies that he has a berth on but it is a serious corporate governance issue to ignore.”

Another top official said Ness Wadia should step down and the Wadia Group companies should seek approval from shareholders on whether he should be reinstated.

Lawyers said Wadia’s business role will depend on the interpretation of the rules, especially as it pertains to fulfilling the “fit and proper” criteria as applied to board members, given that the conviction took place overseas.

The view of the Securities and Exchange Board of India on the matter isn’t known. Stock exchanges have sought clarifications from all listed Wadia companies.

Section 164 and 167 of the Companies Act covers the conditions that disqualify a person from being a director. Anyone sentenced by a court to jail for six months or more is ineligible for five years.

“Under the Companies Act, any person convicted of an offence and sentenced to not less than six months cannot be a director for five years after his or her release,” said a corporate lawyer. “The Act clearly restricts filing of an appeal as not being a ground for not leaving office. However, the bar starts only from the date of the sentencing and not from the date of the conviction.”

According to Ashish Kumar Singh, founder of law firm Capstone Legal, the definition of ‘court’ in the Companies Act doesn’t include those overseas.

“In the present case, the order of conviction has been passed by a Japanese court,” Singh said. “It will not be a bar for Ness Wadia to continue as director of an Indian company.”

“Only the sentence has been suspended, however, the conviction remains,” a top criminal lawyer told ET.

Another lawyer said he doesn’t see any barrier to Wadia’s continuation as director since the sentence has been suspended. The group’s units include Bombay Dyeing, Bombay Burmah Trading, Britannia Industries and GoAir. It also has a stake in IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab.

According to Japan’s Narcotics Control Department, “No person shall import or export any forms of cannabis. Any person who intends to enter Japan carrying narcotics for his/her own medical use is required to obtain an advance permission from the Director-General of one of the eight Regional Bureaus of Health and Welfare, JAPAN based on the Narcotics and Psychotropic Control Act, the NCD website states."
2,2019-05-01,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Britannia Industries Wednesday reported an 11.82 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 294.27 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2019.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 263.16 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, Britannia Industries said in a regulatory filing.

Total income during the period under review stood at Rs 2,860.75 crore as against Rs 2,581.93 crore in the year-ago quarter, it added.

Commenting on the performance, Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry said, ""We continued the momentum in the base business through distribution expansion, heightened innovation and cost-efficiency programmes.""

He further said that in line with its goal to become a 'Total Foods Company', Britannia has launched new categories.

For the fiscal ended March 2019, the company's net profit was at Rs 1,155.46 crore as against Rs 1,003.96 crore, up 15 per cent.

Total income from operations for FY19 was at Rs 11,261.12 crore as against Rs 10,156.47 crore in FY18.

The company said its board of directors has recommended a dividend of 1,500 per cent (Rs 15 per share of face value Re 1 each).

On the outlook, Berry said, ""We have witnessed slowdown in market place in the recent months, however, this should get neutralised with a favourable monsoon forecast and stable government post elections.""

In the coming quarters, he said, ""the priority will be to scale up the new categories launched to ensure we stay ahead of market and achieve profitable growth"".

In line with the organisation goals, the company has also set up strategic business units for Adjacent Bakery, dairy and international business, he added."
0,2019-05-01,Britannia,"MUMBAI: The Wadia Group said on Tuesday that its director Ness Wadia will “continue to play the role” in the enterprise despite him being sentenced to a two-year suspended jail term in Japan for possession of drugs.

“It is a suspended sentence (for five years). Hence it will not impact Ness in discharging any of his responsibilities, both within the group and outside,” said a Wadia group spokesperson. Ness, the elder son of Nusli Wadia, is on the board of four listed Wadia group companies, which together has a market capitalisation of $12 billion. Ness is the managing director of Bombay Burmah and is a director of Britannia, Bombay Dyeing and National Peroxide.



On Tuesday, Ness went about with his work as usual at the Wadia International Centre, the group’s HQ in south Mumbai. A suspended sentence for five years means that Ness will not have to serve jail term unless he commits any other offence during the five-year period of suspension. The news of Ness’s imprisonment made the Wadia Group companies’ shares tank by up to 10% with flagship Bombay Dyeing plunging the most in Tuesday’s volatile market. Stock exchanges have sought clarifications from the four Wadia companies following the news reports on Ness’s jail term. National Peroxide’s scrip fell nearly 6%, while shares of Bombay Burmah and Britannia went down by over 2% each.


Most legal experts TOI spoke to said the Japanese court order will not impact Ness’s directorship in listed Indian companies. Under Indian securities law, a person will be disqualified as a director of a company if he has been convicted for any offence by a court and has been sentenced for a minimum six-month jail term. However, former Sebi executive director J N Gupta, said, “Court, according to Indian Companies Act, is limited to domestic jurisdiction.” Since Ness has been convicted by a foreign court, he may not face disqualification as a director in India. 

One lawyer, however, said it is unclear what stand Sebi would take regarding the continuation of Ness’s directorship in the four listed Wadia companies even though there is no dispute over his conviction by a Japanese court. 

Ness, 47, first joined the board of Bombay Dyeing in 2001 and later other Wadia companies. He is also the co-owner of Kings XI Punjab cricket team in the popular Indian Premier League (IPL). Ness gave way to his younger brother Jeh to take charge of Bombay Dyeing, a company chaired by Nusli Wadia, who has a net worth of nearly $7 billion."
1,2019-05-01,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Unlike others in his illustrious family, headlines tend to chase Ness Wadia for the wrong reasons. The elder son of Wadia Group chairman Nusli Wadia, and great-grandson of Pakistan’s founding father Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the 47-year-old had previously courted trouble when his former girlfriend actor Preity Zinta lodged an FIR against him for allegedly abusing and molesting her five years ago. 

The incident had occurred at Wankhede Stadium in 2014, during an IPL match. Preity and Ness had broken off their five-year-long relationship a couple of years earlier, but remained business partners as co-owners of Kings XI Punjab IPL team until things went awry. In October, 2018, the Bombay HC quashed the criminal case. Zinta said the dispute between them was “settled” and she wanted to ""move on in life"".

There was further trouble in 2016 when a non-cognisable offence was registered after his driver alleged that the industrialist was forcing him to drive fast and when he did not comply, Ness assaulted and abused him.



The Wadia group — perhaps India’s oldest conglomerate, with interests in plantations, foods, textiles, chemicals, electronics, health care and real estate with Bombay Burmah, Bombay Dyeing, Britannia and GoAir being their flagship companies — steered clear of these controversies all along.



The group traces its roots back to 1736 when Lovji Nusserwanji Wadia, founder of the shipping industry in Mumbai, set up a marine company and went on to build the first ships constructed for the British Navy outside England. He also constructed the Bombay dry-dock, the first dry-dock in Asia. Some of the Parsi residential baugs were built by Bai Jerbai Wadia, the great-great-grandmother of Ness Wadia. She conceived plans to build low-cost housing colonies for Parsi families migrating from villages in Gujarat to Mumbai.

Ness’s grandfather, Neville, served as chairman of the Bombay Dyeing textile company until 1977, after which Nusli Wadia assumed the position. His mother, Maureen Wadia was a flight attendant before she started a fashion magazine and is president of a beauty pageant. His brother, Jehangir, is the head of the GoAir airline. Ness who was born in Liverpool studied at The Cathedral & John Connon School and Lawrence School in Himachal Pradesh, and then at Millfield School in the UK. With degrees in international relations from Tufts University in the US and engineering management from the University of Warwick in England he became joint managing director of Bombay Dyeing until 2011 when he resigned. After stepping down, he has been managing director of their Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation and on the board of directors of several family-owned companies. 

The two-year suspended sentence for possession of drugs in Japan “will not impact Ness Wadia,” said a statement issued by the group but the public nature of Ness’s mess is likely to stay in focus."

6,2019-05-02,Britannia,"ITC, Nestle, Marico and United Spirits are the four consumer stocks that can emerge as value creators, said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

Which two-wheeler or four-wheeler stock would you buy in this decline? 
We are very optimistic on three names: a) Ashok Leyland. Given that they are enlarging their market share in both LCV and MHV segments; their new intermediate commercial vehicle (ICV) launch has taken off brilliantly and that they would be manufacturing 50% of the buses and out of that, a large share would be in Gujarat on the EV side. They are now looking at CIS countries to improve their content on the export side. So Ashok Leyland is no brainer at these prices. 

b) Eicher, given that we know there were ten days of manpower hours lost because of the strike in the Enfield factory but now it is up and running. Their franchise is growing strongly and at 20,000, there is an extremely good risk reward for a 20% upside. 

c) Bajaj Auto. Again their pan sub-continent sales and margins which they sacrificed for gaining market share has played out well and Bajaj Auto is now going to take on Enfield head on. 

These three stocks would stand out. But as a whole, if you are looking for the best wealth creator in the last seven-eight years and you are getting a price opportunity, then you should be buying some mutual funds or a SIP in some of the largecaps which could stand to gain out. Tata Motor would be a dark horse but the price performance has played out well. We still think if it comes closer to Rs 180-190, it will again become a very good value play.


The larger picture continues to be that while numbers in itself were fine, but even with Britannia, we are seeing the management talking about weak macros going ahead as well. Would you look at value when it comes to this segment of the market?
Britannia numbers are slightly disappointing but otherwise this stock has been on a tear and it has been gaining market share. The time margins have been slightly skewed.

But if you want to play that segment, there is ITC. A disclosure -- ITC has been one of our top picks and relatively has done nothing -- but on the downside it does not break Rs 265 and now it is finding strength close to Rs 305-310. 

ITC has gained a huge market share in the biscuit market and they have sacrificed margins to gain market share. Now those businesses are stabilising. I would expect ITC to be a dark horse to give you at least a 50% upside in the next two years. So ITC, Nestle, Marico would be standouts. Britannia on corrections I would avoid at this price. The other three are going to be outperformers. You can add United Spirits given the ascent and the numbers which their franchise model has turned out. A large part of the consumption market is now raring to go with the hot summer. These could be relative value creators in the next six to nine months. 


Two years ago, nobody thought there could be such a pronounced slowdown in the entire HFC space. If HFC disbursements are slowing down, what does that mean for consumer durables, for discretionary and other allied sectors?
Look at the performance of cement majors. UltraTech numbers were the best ever you heard. 104 million tonnes of capacity and utilisation playing out. Margins are much better than expected in a lean season, which tell you a) cement and steel demand is up and running. b) A large number of men from the boys have been sifted out in the NBFC/IL&FS fiasco; and c) Low-cost housing as a theme continues to remain robust given the numbers, if you compare it with an HDFC. Gruh Finance has been in the eye of the storm after that merger and in the small ticket Rs 10 to 15 lakh, it has been an outperformer as far as numbers and earnings go. At 15% growth rate for quarter on quarter, I do not know how many 10-12 quarters I have seen but yes there is evidence of that. 

The three catalysts – one, low interest rates globally; two, bond yields touching new lows and three, the transmission effect -- a large part of PSU and other retail banks are now taking the market share away from NBFCs. The second half could be fairly robust and the numbers from quality names like Godrej and Oberoi, both are showing a lot of traction on the upside. 

You will have to take it with a pinch of salt, if you want to be , in the names which have shown a pedigree management and outperformance in this fiasco. I could name UltraTech, Shree Cement, ACC on the cement side, HDFC, LIC Housing and maybe a dark horse in L&T Finance on the second side and thirdly it would be some of the building companies – NBCC and dark horse called Shankara Building Products which has weathered a lot of storm and could outperform in the next one year.


There is no linearity in Federal Bank’s numbers; Q2 was good, Q3 was not that interesting. The management believes the worst of the NPA cycle is behind them but I do not see any evidence of growth. Why should one buy an old private bank , when growth is slowing down? 
The simple answer is that if Kotak is seeing a gain in market share on the largecaps, then surely Federal Bank, DCB are going to take a prime part of the problem which have been plaguing the NBFCs and we see more of plateauing over there. Stick with pedigree names. The worst of the eye of the storm was during the Kerala floods. You had mouthwatering valuations at that time. There is a lot of froth now. But on a valuation basis and given that a lot of money comes in through the NRI route in Kerala and their franchise, all the three banks would stand out in that order. We want to be here growth is going to be an outperformer because of the NBFCs and credible management, which all three have displayed over the last one year."

Analyst calls

 • Equirus has downgraded Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company to add from long and lowered target price to ₹1,495 from ₹1,500, citing limited upside. Cholamandalam Finance’s consistent performance continued in the fourth quarter of FY19, with a 21% year-on-year PPOP growth, 16% sequential growth in disbursements and asset quality improvement. 

 • CLSA has retained outperform rating on Ambuja Cements with a target price of ₹250. Ambuja’s first quarter results largely mirrored its 50%- subsidiary ACC, as realisations missed forecasts, driving an earnings miss, although it managed costs better, said CLSA. The perils of going slow on capacity expansions came to the fore once again, as volume growth was just 3% year-on-year, it said.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Quess Corp with a target price of ₹1,000. The brokerage expects Quess Corp to end FY19 on a strong note with quarter-on-quarter organic revenue growth of 6% led by strong momentum in staffing and facilities business. EBITDA margins are likely to improve further in Q4 by 15 bps led by strong growth and improving business mix. 

• Emkay Global has maintained hold rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of ₹1,470. The brokerage estimates the bank’s standalone RoA/RoE to improve to 1.8%/15% from 1.7%/12% in FY19, driven by margin expansion and a moderation in cost ratios. The brokerage likes the bank due to superior asset quality, conservative risk management practices, and improving return ratios. Promoter’s ongoing tussle with the RBI remains an overhang, the brokerage said. 

• IDBI Capital has maintained reduce rating on TVS Motor Company and revised target price to ₹430 from ₹480 earlier. TVS Motor fourth quarter results were below estimates on operating level, said IDBI Capital. The brokerage cut volume and revenue estimates by 1.5% each for FY20, factoring slower growth for twowheelers in first half of FY20 and introduced FY21 estimates and reduced target multiple on higher exposure towards scooter segment.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
8,2019-05-03,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Wadia group company Britannia Industries has sought external legal opinion over the continuation of Ness Wadia as director at the insistence of independent members of the board, following his conviction in Japan for possession of cannabis. The board has tapped retired Supreme Court chief justice TS Thakur for the opinion, said people with knowledge of the matter.

The move by the independent directors came despite chairman Nusli Wadia presenting the board with an opinion from top jurist Fali S Nariman that had endorsed his son staying on as director, they said. The elder Wadia, however, backed the move for another opinion, it is learnt.

The independent board members also spoke separately with Ness Wadia, said the people cited above. The younger Wadia wasn’t present when the board conferred on the issue but attended the rest of the meeting, which had been called to discuss earnings.

A Japanese court gave Wadia two years in jail last month for possessing 25 gm of cannabis resin but suspended the sentence for five years, allowing him to return to India.


Lawyers Differ on Impact of Ruling
A suspended sentence means he remains free for the period unless he breaks the law again in Japan.

There’s no consensus on the effect this will have on Ness Wadia’s role in the family-run Wadia Group. Stocks in the group’s companies, after plunging on April 30 when the news became public, have recovered. Wadia is managing director of Bombay Burmah and a director of Bombay Dyeing, Britannia Industries and National Peroxide.

Nusli Wadia didn’t respond to queries.

Ness Wadia’s future will hinge on whether his remaining a board member harms the spirit of corporate governance, said one of the persons cited above.

“We will take a call based on the view offered by Justice Thakur,” he said. “His offence in Japan does not fall under the serious category. So, a director on the board of a listed company will also not be disqualified for this offence.”

Lawyers differed on the impact of the court’s decision.

Ravi Singhania, managing partner of law firm Singhania & Partners, made the point that the conviction wasn’t by an Indian court. “Thus, under corporate governance provisions or other provisions of Companies Act, the Japanese court’s decision would not affect his position as a director,” he said.



He added that possession of a small quantity of cannabis for personal use may be considered in a different light by Indian courts, leading to a lighter punishment or fine. That the Japanese court suspended the sentence for five years implies that it’s not considered a serious offence in that country either, he said. “Thus, under corporate governance provisions or other provisions of the Companies Act, the Japanese court decision would not affect his position as a director,” Singhania said.

Other experts said that the jurisdiction where the offence occurred shouldn’t matter.

The Wadia Group had earlier said that the conviction would not prevent Ness Wadia from discharging his responsibilities, while some experts were of the view that he may have to fulfill the ‘fit and proper’ criteria as it applies to company directors.

“Ness Wadia is in India. The judgement is clear,” a Wadia Group spokesperson had said on April 30 after the news became public. “It is a suspended sentence. Hence it will not impact Ness Wadia in the discharge of any of his responsibilities and he will continue to play the role that he has done hitherto, both within the group and outside.”

Britannia Industries reported an 11.8% increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 294.27 crore for the March quarter from the year earlier.

Total income rose to Rs 2,860.75 crore from Rs 2,581.93 crore. For the fiscal year ended March, net profit rose 15% to Rs 1,155.46 crore.

Justice TS Thakur became an additional judge of the Jammu & Kashmir High Court in 1994 and chief justice of India in December 2015, retiring in January 2017. He had ordered the dismissal of the top management of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for failing to implement reforms recommended by the Justice Lodha committee in 2017."

Nifty continued to consolidate between 11,700 and 11,800 levels for most part of the session on Friday and managed to close above 11,700 level. It formed an Inside Bar on the daily scale and a small Bearish Candle on the weekly scale. 

The index got stuck between 11,550 and 11800/11850 levels from last 22 sessions, as every dip got bought into while followup was missing at higher levels. As long as it holds above 11,666 level, Nifty can witness an upward move towards 11,800 and then 11,850 levels, while on the downside, major support is seen at 11,550 level. 

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 level while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,500 levels. Minor Call and Put writing was seen at 11,800. The option band signified a broader trading range in between 11,500 and 12,000 levels. 

India VIX moved up 4.35 per cent to 23.98 level. A higher VIX meant volatile swings could continue in the market ahead of the election outcome. 

Bank Nifty opened positive and gradually extended its gains towards 30,100 level but failed to do the same and drifted towards the 29,950 level. It formed a small Bullish Candle on daily scale and a Doji Candle on the weekly scale. As long as it holds above 29,750 level, the index can extend the gains towards 30,250, while on the downside, major support exists at 29,500 level. 

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,762 level with a marginal loss of 0.03 per cent. Long buildup was seen in IndiGo, DHFL, Godrej Industries and CEAT while shorts were seen in Chola Finance, L&T Finance, Britannia and NIIT Tech."

11,2019-05-03,Britannia,"Election result is the key driver for the next move of the market and the reason there is a calm is because the market has built in the belief that the incumbent government is going to return to power, said Sunil Subramaniam, MD & CEO, Sundaram Mutual, in an interview with ETNOW. Pick up quality stocks in undervalued sectors like cyclicals, building materials, capital good suppliers and EPC contractors, says Subramaniam. Edited excerpts: 


Is this as worse as it gets or is this just the calm before the storm?
The storm can be both ways. A positive storm can also build up. It is a calm before the storm because the election result is the key driver for the next move of the market and the reason there is a calm is because the market has built in the belief that the incumbent government is going to return to power. If they do come back with majority, then there could be a strong upside from the market perspective and the opposite if it is a surprise result.


In last five years, the present government has managed to achieve mediocre growth when global growth was benign, nothing great in terms of policy action and the bottom line from market standpoint is that despite hope and belief, earnings are not great. S,o if the current administration comes back, we could be in for more of the same and that is not good news!
Yes but where I like to look at is that this term of the government was spent in a lot of investing in the core parts of the economy, doing fundamental changes. I look at it as a process. You make inputs and there are certain outputs and outcomes. The output-input ratio has been fairly decent. Fundamentally game changing move like demonetisation did not work because everybody got their black money out. 

GST, is fundamentally a game changer but it took time for getting a coalition of all the states together for implementing that. Now we are seeing the effects. To me, a continuance of this government means that a lot of the outcomes of the hard decisions taken in the previous five years should come through, number one. 

Number two, though private consumption has slightly faltered in the last few months, it has by and large been the strength of the Indian economy. But the ultimate end result of private consumption is capex building as capacity utilisation goes up. In the next five years, that is definitely a big story. The inputs were properly at about 70-75%. The outputs came out at about 50-60% but in the next five years, we will see the outcomes go to 80-90% and that is the strength of the Indian economy which will reflect. The continuation of this government will give a fillip to those good inputs and not fritter away through giveaways to the general population. 


 You are sounding quite positive when it comes to the growth potential about which there have been several questions marks in the near term. Are you ignoring what we are currently seeing with slowdown in consumption and even allround slowdown?
It is just a slowdown, nowhere close to a recession. Number two, our outlook remains strong in consumption and discretionary consumption. Over the last six months, calendar year to date, FIIs with this growing confidence that the NDA will come back, have poured money into the Indian markets. The domestic mutual funds, by and large, have stayed cautious through this period. 

Whichever sectors the FIIs have pumped money into, have gone up. So in terms of allocation while remaining confident on the economy, the valuations which FIIs have pushed up in certain sectors, make us cautious in terms of adding on. But bear in mind that all these sectors where the FIIs have invested or as domestic mutual funds we have been investing in over the last 2-3 years, we already have significant positions there and we will be holding on to that. 

We are not going and selling them. My perspective is that the incremental gains are not going to come from the consumption space where valuations are already discounting a growth and the recent growth is perhaps not living up to that. But in the undervalued sectors of the economy, the cyclicals, the building materials, the capital good suppliers, the EPC contractors, the valuations have a long way to go and it is a very good time to keep picking up good quality stocks within that space.

Consumption is ultimately going to drive the capital goods cycle and that will not be seen in the current earnings reports as they come out but will have more of a bearing on the future.


You have a large exposure to auto ancillaries. Are you still convinced on auto?
Yes, we are overweight on the auto pack as a fund house and we are bullish on it. That being said, the recent numbers have been disappointing but we believe that it is a combination of the fact that there was a slight slowdown, a build up of inventory and the market was also acting as if there could never be a slowdown! So, the valuations reflect a slight richness at this point of time. While we remain overweight, we are not adding to our current overweight but we are not reducing that overweight either. We are sticking to that. 

So yes, our conviction remains high. Valuations are looking a bit rich but we believe that the numbers in another two quarters to come would ultimately justify these valuations. We are holding on to our position.


How exactly do you think the consumer discretionary slowdown should be viewed? It is like saying that Indians have stopped consuming soaps, shampoo and toothpaste! It is a clear example of people not consuming consumer durable goods?
Yes, but part of it is also that suddenly the NBFCs have gone out of the financing space. You have to bear in mind the NBFC crisis and ultimately if you look at last year’s GDP growth and the year before NBFCs played a crucial role in helping finance the discretionary consumption part of it. The crisis led to them shutting down fresh lending and the banks have not yet been ready to fully step in. Banks initially tried to only buy the books from the NBFCs. There is a gap in lending availability out in the market which led to this slowdown. 

As things ease up and the monsoon forecast is also looking good, the second half from Ganesh Chaturthi onwards, you will see a bounce back in consumption and banks also with their lesser concerns on NPAs and they are clean-up is progressing fairly well. We will see them step in and lend and good NBFCs are now back in the market raising good quality money. Good parentage and less of asset liability mismatch is something to be looked at. We have slightly changed our position from underweight to neutral because now we find good quality NBFCs attractive enough to buy. 

They are a key driver of the consumption story. You have to bear in mind that ultimately it is rate sensitive and in the second half of the year, consumption will bounce back.


What are you seeing across the consumption space ? Dabur, Britannia in the quarter gone by, have faced some margin pressure. They are getting hit largely by this consumption slowdown per se but do you think one should buy on dips?
I do not think the stock prices are fully reflecting that decline yet. FIIs are pumping in money. So, while the numbers are disappointing, the stock price correction has not yet happened to that extent. I would not yet say that it is the time to go in and buy. If you are holding to a current position already, just stick to it. This is not the time because the valuations are still not attractive enough. The corrections are not there in the valuations yet.


The growth in consumers is slowing down. The PE multiple has not come down in line with the growth is. It was expensive, it is expensive and it has not become cheap?
Yes, absolutely. Perfect, you have got it bang on.


Some fund managers are also thinking that one should right now avoid buying into PSUs. Why is that even though PSU stocks are cheap?
See the disinvestment programme versus the divestment programme. Ultimately, PSU stocks will turn a good buy the day the government is willing to let go of control and truly privatise them, because they are sitting on huge amount of assets which are not properly exploited due to the inefficiencies of public sector management. 

The process so far is that the government is just keen to encash them and take money out. It is like selling family jewels. For example, we launched a PSU Opportunities Fund in 2009-10 and then we shut it down a year and a half ago because PSU stocks will become a good buy in those companies where there is a genuine private sector coming in and those efficiencies and operational management issues or the PSU managements are given the freedom to behave like the private sector. That is the fundamental issue overhang which will always cause a discount to them in comparison with the rest.

They are still not value buys from that perspective because the government will suddenly go and take a huge dividend to meet their revenue target shortfall. All these concerns are going to be a hangover. Unless there is a clear path to dilution of government stake and handing over control to or at least a PPP path, I do not think it is a blind buy."

Analyst calls• Investec Securities has maintained buy rating on Exide Industries and revised target price to ₹295 from ₹270. Exide’s fourth quarter performance is encouraging, especially in the backdrop of subdued OEM production, likely increased participation from unorganised sector and restricted offtake from subdealers due to NBFC liquidity squeeze, said Investec. Resilient performance, coupled with expected margin expansion should help Exide deliver EPS CAGR of 20% over FY19-21, said Investec. 

• Jefferies has initiated coverage on Kajaria Ceramics with a target price of ₹730. Kajaria is the leader in Indian ceramic tiles and has bounced from its September 2018 lows, aided by improving profit, said Jefferies. The brokerage believes that the company is poised to benefit the most from a fillip to organised volumes, courtesy tightening complianceand the recent ban on coal gasifiers in Gujarat, which should shrink the price differential with unbranded players. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained sell rating on Carborundum Universal and lowered fair value to ₹310 from ₹315. The fourth quarter result suggests challenges on demand, pricing and costing, which are dictated by market forces, the brokerage said. Improved market access in EMD and GST-driven support to operating price in abrasives are key to boosting growth prospects. 

• Nomura has maintained buy rating on Torrent Pharmaceuticals with a target price of ₹2,144. Recent developments related to the USFDA inspection at the company’s Indrad facility and Losartan recall have emerged as areas of concern, said Nomura. If the recent inspection is classified as an Official Action Indicated, it could result in a delay in product approvals, it added.

• IndiaNivesh has retained its sell rating on TVS Motors and reduce their target price from ₹460 to ₹420 as the company disappoint in its March 2019 numbers. The firm had already given a pass to its timeline of achieving its margin guidance of 10% EBITDA. With lower demand growth, rising input cost pressures and higher discounts, the brokerage expect revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGRs over FY19-21of, respectively 11%, 15% and 19%.

9,2019-05-03,Britannia,"After five consecutive quarters of doubledigit volume growth, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) the fast-moving consumer goods bellwether is expected to report subdued performance for the March quarter on back of weak consumer demand. With valuations stretching at 64 times its earnings, the Street would welcome a correction in the stock price following the Q4 results.

The Street seems to have picked up the earliest signs of the impending weakness soon after company posted its December quarter performance. The HUL stock price has remained range bound despite the company posting a strong performance in the December quarter.

As per the data from Bloomberg, half of the 42 analysts tracking the HUL stock have a ‘buy’ recommendation on it.

This is lower than the 64 per cent of the analysts that were bullish on the stock a year ago.

In the quarter to March, volumes are expected to grow at 8 per cent — the lowest growth rate in the past six quarters. This despite the estimated high expenditure (of around 12.5 per cent of revenues) towards advertising & marketing to augur volumes. Net sales are expected to cross the level of Rs 10,000 crore a quarter for the first time — growing by around 11 per cent over the year ago level. Operating profit margin is likely to be maintained at above 22 per cent — thanks to the price increases taken by the company.

Some of the key factors to watch out for in the management commentary following the results would be: overall outlook on demand, impact of a subdued monsoon on the agrarian crisis and rural demand, discretionary consumer spending after the election results, impact of premiumisation of portfolio and nature of competitive intensity. For FMCG companies Britannia and Dabur who posted their fourth quarter results on Thursday, it has been a similar story of subdued demand due to a slowdown in the rural economy.



Stocks of both the companies closed nearly 4 per cent lower. The sector leader’s performance may throw further insights on the state of consumer demand and the FMCG market at a time when overall consumption growth has slowed down."
15,2019-05-06,Britannia,"New Delhi: Proxy advisory and corporate governance firm InGovern Monday alleged that Britannia Industries violated listing regulations in not reporting arrest of its promoter and director Ness Wadia, while demanding his resignation.

InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian also said the directors on the board of Britannia Industries should also ask themselves whether the continuance of Wadia, who was given a two-year suspended sentence by a court in Japan for drug possession, was good for corporate governance.

Citing Sebi's listing obligations and disclosure requirements (LODR), he said a company has to report any fraud, default by promoter or arrest of key managerial persons or promoters as it is a material event.

""The arrest of promoter was a material event and that was to be disclosed to the stock exchanges. That was not done by Britannia,"" Subramanian told PTI.

This is a violation of LODR by the company, he said, adding Wadia must step down in the interest of larger corporate governance.

He further pointed out as ""incorrect"" Britannia Industries' assertion in a regulatory filing on May 2 that neither was the company aware of Wadia's arrest, ""nor did the underlying facts and events, warrants any disclosure under SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015, which deals with detention and arrests connected with offences involving corporate and financial fraud"".

Subramanian also said, ""in the interest of larger corporate governance and character, the board should ask themselves whether such a director is good for the company"".
Comments from Britannia Industries and Wadia Group could not be obtained as query remained unanswered.

However, on May 2 Britannia Industries' submitted to BSE a letter written by Ness Wadia to its company secretary on April 30 regarding the suspended sentence he was given saying it was clear judgement.

""Hence I have been suitably advised that it will not impact nor impair me in the discharge of my responsibilities and I will be able to continue to play the role that I have done hitherto, both in the company and the group as also my other activities,"" Wadia said.

He is director in major firms of the Wadia group, including Bombay Dyeing and Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd.

According to media report last week, Wadia, who was on a skiing holiday was arrested in early March at New Chitose Airport in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido after customs officials found 25g of ""what appeared to be cannabis resin in his trouser pocket"".

The Sapporo district court handed Wadia a two-year prison sentence, which was suspended for five years."
14,2019-05-06,Britannia,"Overall, the banking space looks pretty attractive and we see a valuation catchup largely on the corporate bank side. Plus we have seen a good set of numbers in mid-sized banks, said Pankaj Pandey, Head Research, ICICIdirect.com, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 


In FMCG sector, it was not the best set of numbers from HUL. The volume growth of nearly 7% saved the day but the trend that we have been monitoring for some of the other FMCG majors like Dabur, GCPL, Britannia etc. has been very unfavourable in terms of volume growth. Are worse days to come if other factors in terms of monsoon are not favourable?
We were expecting the overall FMCG numbers to be slightly softer because of the higher base effect. Post GST implementation, we had a series of GST rate cuts across categories and as a result of that, most of the companies were delivering good volume growth in lower double digits including HUL. 

On that high base, we were expecting softer volume growth, which is going to largely pan out except for a few cases where the impact is far more. From that perspective, the softer numbers do not come as a surprise. Going forward, we would expect things to improve because we do not expect the monsoon to have that kind of a profound impact on the overall rural slowdown and in fact, election-led spending can improve the volume growth going forward. 

Overall, we would expect the numbers to remain slightly in the higher single digits in terms of volumes and that is more of a normal growth that we had seen earlier. From that perspective, the higher base effect impacting current numbers do not make our views change. From that perspective, on a stock specific basis we would be selective on the stocks but in general we are not particularly negative on the FMCG space.


How you are placing your bets within the telecom space particularly in light of Airtel’s numbers? We understand there could be a loss this time around?
I cannot comment on Bharti because we have an investment banking relationship. On Idea, we expect the company to make a loss of about Rs 4,500-crore-odd while the fundraising of Rs 25,000-crore-odd and further through stake sale of another Rs 5,000-crore- odd is positive from a shorter term perspective. 

That means they will survive or maintain capex for the next four-five quarters but the overall challenge in the telecom space is that people are expecting that you will see a rebound in prices but the way a Reliance is shaping up, it looks largely like voice and data being free and revenues are going to be made beyond that. The current incumbents are really not thinking on those lines or at least they have not spread themselves in that way. 
Which is why, the overall telecom sector looks challenging, We are not chasing any of the players in the telecom space at this point in time.


Within the NBFC space, are any numbers indicating that it is time to buy something like a Cholamandal or AB Capital?
We do not have the companies which you have mentioned but in some of the cases like M&M Finance, the numbers were better. The challenge is on the growth side because the auto exposure for them is quite large . Compared to that, we like something like Bajaj Finance where we expect NII growth of more than 50% odd and bottom line growth also could be healthy, It is something which has been performing well and which we continue to like. 

NBFCs which have got some exposure towards IL&FS or on the real estate side are still under pressure and there are very few names to bank on the NBFC side. The banking space, on the other hand, looks pretty attractive.

The retail banks have come out with an extremely good set of numbers. The mid-sized banks - Federal Bank, DCB or Bandhan Bank -- are quite better and then even the corporate banks are also doing extremely well. Something like Axis Bank looks far better compared to the NBFCs but within NBFCs, we continue to prefer Bajaj Finance.


What the outlook is on ICICI Bank? What sort of management commentary would you be watching out for?

I cannot comment on ICICI Bank because I am part of the same group, but on the corporate bank side, we are expecting good set of numbers. What we have seen in case of Axis Bank and even for SBI, we are expecting that the bank will make a profit of about Rs 2,900 crore odd. Overall, the banking space looks pretty attractive and we see a valuation catchup largely on the corporate bank side. Plus we have seen a good set of numbers in mid-sized banks.

Banking clearly looks very attractive to us. Overall, we expect that the entire banking as a pack should deliver about 36% kind of a CAGR growth. Again some of the banks are delivering on a lower base, That is why we believe that the overall market will remain in good shape given the fact that the banks are expected to do well and now the numbers have been sort of positive in that direction .

Also, the banks are one of the biggest beneficiaries of better FII inflows because banks are sort of good proxy for the overall economic consumption. Despite the recent performance, we expect the performance to sustain."
20,2019-05-07,Britannia,"On any correction over the next few days, one should be buying into HUL, Britannia or for that matter Marico where the growth has been about 7% to 8%. Also Maruti and some of the stocks can be accimulated on dips, said Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


How much more to go for ICICI Bank and can we see a further 15% to 20% push coming in anytime soon?
Post the numbers, the sense that we are getting is that the company is on an upcycle on most parameters, particularly given the strong CASA franchise that they have and the kind of growth that we are seeing on the loan book etc. There is a case for another 10%-12% uptick and one will have to watch over the next couple of quarters how the entire slippages pan out. Broadly speaking, the trajectory for ICICI Bank is positive and the market is looking out for companies which are reasonably valued and where clean-up exercises are almost done and hence a strong franchise. We are extremely positive for a while and post the numbers, we put our target price at about Rs 450 which will give you a 10% uptick from current levels.


My only fear is everyone likes ICICI Bank. Everyone is of the view that ICICI Bank will only go one way. This is a stock where the number of buy calls are the highest in Asia! Some would argue that all the good news is in the price?
What you are saying is that sometimes when there is a consensus, when the company disappoints there could be a major underperformance. But the way we look at this is that it is coming out of extended face of underperformance and clean-up exercise. With the way things are looking for the next two to three years and this kind of a CASA franchise and businesses that they have built around the ICICI franchise, whether it is the securities part or AMC insurance, there is going to be a lot of value attached to that. Also, when your loan book is growing, the scope for disappointment looks much less. I agree that consensus is a buy but given the strong growth visibility that we are seeing, we will continue to remain with consensus.


Do you think the slowdown in autos is going to be a prolonged one or would you say that this is temporary and decision-making has got stalled because of liquidity and election, that demand will come back the way it did in 2014?
Clearly the entire market was extremely positive on auto sector and what we have seen over the last about four to five months in terms of the numbers has been quite disappointing. How long this entire difficult phase is going to last is difficult to say but if you have a decent amount of revival in the economy and in the earnings over the next two to three years, then auto being a leading sector would also participate. 

I do not see a reason why there is not going to be a moderate growth. But the growth expectations that people had for Maruti at about 12-14%, looks extremely challenging but 6-10% growth for Maruti and some of the two-wheeler is possible. 

I do not think there is a case for a substantial lull for companies, given the growth revival that we are looking at. On any significant correction in a stock like Maruti or some of the two- wheeler names which have underperformed, one should be looking at accumulating those.


What about Bharti Airtel? Is this a good time to buy into Bharti? The rights issue should help clean the leverage part of the balance sheet.
I definitely think that Bharti is also on a revival path. If you look at the last three quarters, the operating profit per subscriber and the revenue part are seeing a definite amount of revival though because of the competitive intensity, one is not really sure how strong the improvement in ARPU would be over the next two or three quarters. The way we look at this entire space is that you have a Rel Jio which has actually tried to gain the market share and is trying to unlock the value. 

I definitely think that at some point of time they will do a price hike and try to show the operating profit and the ARPU which would also have a major positive impact on some of the incumbent companies and definitely Bharti would do extremely well from that perspective though the timing is something that we are not sure about. 

Also we are seeing a lot of improvement in the wireless business, If they manage to sell off some part of their African business, that would help their balance sheets. Overall, at this point of time, Bharti continues to be a bit of a contrarian bet but is on a revival path.


What is going on with Zee Entertainment? Investors have been very patient on the back of the fact that something very crucial will culminate as part of the strategic stake sale. Why are they just staying put?
The market has been keenly waiting for the outcome of the deal and the fact that it has been delayed means that probably the valuations that the company was looking at, it has not able to convince the investors. Also, though in an election year, typically media stocks do well but the fact that it has been a capital intensive business and particularly the kind of investment which is acquired digital foray etc. would mean that the overall growth would not be that significant.

The entire thing depends on how the company is able to complete this restructuring, getting the new investors and focus on the core media play in India. Overall, it has been a great franchise. The ad revenue growth has been good and we have been liking it for a while. Before taking a long call on that, one should wait for the clarity of the valuations.


How would you approach FMCG because the slowdown is for real? What we thought is going to be restricted to auto, is now being faced by other consumption themes including FMCG. Are we likely to see a rebound after elections?
Clearly the market was expecting a bit of a slowdown because of the kind of commentary that was coming from the management and the extended winter etc. To a certain extent, the market was bracing for a slowdown in terms of volume growth from the FMCG companies. 

Godrej Consumer, to some extent Britannia and Dabur have really disappointed but HUL was pretty much in line, given the high growth rate despite a high base. Typically if these companies, deliver about 5%-7% kind of growth, the market would definitely like it. I do not think there is going to be a significant derating or a correction in these names.

If you see some correction over the next few days because of any reasons, I definitely think that one should be buying into these names whether it is HUL or Britannia or for that matter Marico where the growth has been about 7% to 8%."

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
21,2019-05-07,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: After suffering losses in the last ten successive sessions, shares of Britannia Industries climbed 2 per cent in morning trade on Tuesday.

In the last ten sessions, the stock had retreated 12 per cent. 

The scrip climbed despite negative news related to its promoter and director Ness Wadia. 

As per a PTI report, proxy advisory and corporate governance firm InGovern on Monday alleged that Britannia Industries violated listing regulations by not reporting the sentencing of its promoter and director Ness Wadia to two years of imprisonment by a Japanese court in March for possession of drugs, and demanded his resignation.

InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian also said the directors on the board of Britannia Industries should ask themselves whether the continuation of Wadia on board is good for corporate governance.

Citing Sebi's listing obligations and disclosure requirements (LODR), he said a company has to report any fraud, default by promoter or arrest of key managerial persons or promoters as it is a material event.

Britannia had reported an 11.82 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 294.27 crore for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2019 against a net profit of Rs 263.16 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. 

The results failed to excite the market and several brokerages, including CLSA and Credit Suisse cut the target price of the stock. 

Shares of Britannia Industries closed 0.46 per cent lower at Rs 2,652.60 on BSE."
22,2019-05-07,Britannia,"Consumption is weak but this time, commodities are doing well. Similarly, banks continue to do well in the midcap space, said Nischal Maheshwari, CEO- Institutional Equities, Centrum, said in an interview with ETNOW. Federal Bank, DCB and Bandhan Bank are clear stand-outs.  Edited excerpts: 


The FMCG sector barring the outlier Marico, has come out with a disappointing set of numbers. Do you think this volume trend is going to continue? Was it a surprise?
Not a surprise, actually. Most of the managements were guiding that they would be showing a lower volume growth, given that they added some issues as far as the rural was concerned. They have more or less delivered on that. The outliers have been Marico and Britannia as they have shown much better volume growth. Bajaj Consumers also showed 7.5% volume growth, Marico showed 8% and Britannia showed another 7% volume growth. Those were the outliers. Going ahead, you are seeing pressure on the volume front, especially on the rural side. For the next two quarters, I do not see much changes happening out there.


Let us also talk about some of the banking earnings, particularly in the midcap space. So far, what has been your take? How are you viewing strategy going ahead in this pocket?
There has been this trade going on in the market. The corporate banks are going to do pretty well and that is getting a big debunk after Yes Bank declared results and ICICI Bank also showed a bit of a slippage. That seems to be getting off the line as far as the corporate bank improvement is concerned.

Otherwise, on the whole, midcap banks have done pretty well and so have the retail banks.

Results of HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank both came out pretty well. On the midcap side, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank and DCB Bank did pretty well. So, there is a good amount of growth that is happening. Secondly, the asset qualities are also improving/ Midcaps on the whole seems to be doing better on the banking front, rather than on the largecap side.


What about the associated space with autos? Would Castrol, MRF be hits for you? How are you assessing their performance?
Given that they are mostly consumables for the auto sector and that sector itself is not doing well, you are going to see stress there also. Volumes would be dropping for both MRF as well as Castrol going ahead.

Auto or may be consumption as a whole space, after a long period of time, is seeing demand dropping and we have seen it very pronounced in autos. Yesterday, what the Lever Chairman was saying basically was that FMCG is not recession-proof. That also indicates there is pressure even in the fair-weather plays of FMCG. Demand across the sectors on the ground seems to be pretty slow and even MRF and Castrol in the coming quarters should be subdued.


Within the midcap metal spaces, we have seen a fairly decent performance. Vedanta results are coming out today. Anything that you would be particularly watching out for?
In metals space, a couple of the stocks have done well. Tata Metallic, Kirloskar Ferrous, were the stocks basically which have come out with good results. Tata Sponge was okay but Tata Steel had done quite well. Overall, metals space seems to be doing well. Similarly, if you move on to cement, there also, across both midcap and largecap space, we are seeing strong revival in terms of growth as well as prices. That is why you are seeing good margins as far as cement is concerned. 


If you had to summarise the earnings season so far for only midcaps, which would be your top three performers where you would recommend a buy on the stock?
Banks clearly stand out. Federal Bank, DCB Bank or a Bandhan Bank are stand-outs. Similarly, the cement midcaps seem to be in a pretty good shape as are metals. 

You are saying the consumption story seems to be pretty weak across both largecaps and midcaps. Consumption is weak but this time, commodities are doing well. Similarly, banks continue to do well in the midcap space.


How have read into the Reliance Industries numbers? What is the general trend in oil and gas?
Oil and gas GRMs were weaker than what we had expected and similarly we had seen some pressures as far as the petrochemicals were concerned. On both these fronts, it was weaker than expected numbers out there but what really drove was the numbers on the retail side as well as on the telecom side. Those numbers were pretty robust. Overall, numbers seem to be going as expected but Reliance is slowly moving away from being a oil and gas play to more of a consumption play.

I would want to see it in those terms basically because three years’ down the line, maybe the revenues would be 50-50 consumption and oil though majority of EBITDA will still come from oil because oil is a big cash cow for them. But the valuations will be driven by the consumption sector now.


What stood out to you from the midcap IT pack? Are you looking at IT more favourably now?
Out of the five top IT names, three have delivered till now. So Infosys was clearly a miss, TCS a surprise and Cognizant was a big miss and the rest two; HCL Tech and Tech M are yet to declare. It has been a mixed bag in the largecaps. 

Midcaps performed more or less as expected - be it LTI, LTTS - a bit disappointment there but MindTree was a good number. In the smaller caps, Zensar was pretty good, Birla Soft was good. It has been a mixed bag but more or less, it has been on expected lines. 

What is interesting is going ahead they are still indicating that the demand is still good in the US. We continue to believe that in this kind of a volatile environment, it is good to hold on to IT and basically at least have a neutral stance."
23,2019-05-07,Britannia,"The maker of CRAX snack is doing wonderfully well in terms of growth rate. Their Q4 results were quite excellent, said Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 
Markets are looking a little choppy. How have you viewed the latest events this week?
The events this week have definitely pulled the markets down. But the surprising thing to note here is that we are still seeing FII interest in Indian stocks. There has been a surge of inflow in stock markets. That was the case in March, continued in April and even as we have traded for just three odd days so far in May, we are seeing interest among FIIs. So developments are weak. Markets are trending down but FII interest is what we are noting right now.


Irrespective of what we have seen from Unilever or Britannia or Dabur, Marico has actually managed to beat the industry average in terms of volumes by a good percentage -- 8% as opposed to the industry average of 6.25%. Would Marico also see a slowdown?
First, let me admit this slowdown, that we have seen in terms of consumption getting reflected in the management commentary post results by some of the FMCG names, has come as a surprise to us. In our earlier conversations, we have been anticipating a good story coming in from the FMCG side as well as on the consumer durable side, given the fact that the budget was focussed on the rural economy. 

A lot of dole-outs were being given particularly in the form of the PM Kisan Yojana. But that does not seem to have carried its weight in terms of FMCG consumption. Coming to Marico, while the volume growth has been strong, it has come after price discounts. 

So discounting levels from Marico have actually gone up and consequently, from the December to the March quarter, the EBITDA margin has shrunk quite appreciably. While the volume growth story does appear good, I do not think it is sustainable for Marico because the moment discounts are withdrawn, there will be a volume slowdown. 


Let us talk about energy. Crude is currently retreating. It is still too early to tell possibly and given where the US stands on Iran, anything could happen. What would you be doing with some of the energy majors right now?
The view is shifting as you will have the oil marketing companies reporting weaker set of results because the refining margins are likely to be lower than what it was in the previous year’s March quarter. So, you will see weaker results coming in but within the space of energy and marketing, one should focus towards the city gas distribution companies because here you are going to see substantial growth in volumes. There is price pass on mechanism that exists and quite frankly, some of these city gas distribution companies are really doing well in terms of their efficiencies and on the capital side. 

Right now, our focus would be moving away from the oil marketing companies within the energy space towards the gas distribution companies. We do not recommend any stock in the exploration upstream oil and gas companies.


Titan is set to declare its numbers tomorrow. Is there anything in particular that you think that the Street will be watching out for?
We do not have any projections on Titan. But general expectations that we have from the company is that as we go forward, the upcoming marriage season will work out well for Titan. We have had seen weaknesses in the past for the company because they are unable to maintain their margin growth. The margin lever is something which remains to be touched by the company. 

Coming in at a time where gold prices are either weak or likely to be weak going ahead, it does not augur really well for Titan. The make-or-break kind of quarter will be the upcoming quarter where the marriage season will determine what is likely ahead.


What about the media space? We are seeing a sharp knock today on some of the media names, making investors nervous. What would you advice there? 
From a fundamental perspective in terms of the developments for the media company, we have been seeing that the flow in terms of revenues and growth ahead seems to be particularly good. There is no problem from a fundamental perspective. The only issue that we are seeing and which Zee particularly is grappling with is on the M&A side. Leaving aside the M&A activity build up and the news associated to that, it is very difficult to call a stock like Zee at this present junction, our advice to investors is that given the weakness in the stock, it is better to stay away. Do not invest fresh money into such stocks.


How do you think the auto slowdown story is going to impact M&M?
Small diesel engine will cost roughly about 15-20% more than a petrol variant. You already have a gap between the petrol and the diesel variant within the same model family and that cost will now further widen because the Euro VI norms will mean that you will have to get in a separate exhaust system. It could be an SCR kind of technology combined with particulate filter etc. So these technologies will have their own costs and that cost will be passed on. That will mean that you will not get the buyer putting in money for a diesel car. The breakeven cost or the typical way we look at it is the breakeven kilometres that you have to run per annum to recover the additional diesel price coming to roughly about 20,000 kms. 

With the new Euro VI engines, probably that will go further up to 30,000-35,000 kms per annum and that is not what a typical customer drives per year. So, small diesel cars are not going to survive any more. I would not be surprised if other automobile majors announce dropping plans for making any upgradation in the 1-1.2 litre kind of diesel engines that they have.


What did the street not like about ICICI Bank’s performance because if I pick up any brokerage note that has got an outperform rating and they have upped their price targets, then why this downtick?
Firstly a disclaimer, I hold ICICI Bank stock. Most of the analysts on the street are getting concerned about the fact that there is sequential slippages acceleration. Some of them are one time, which is what the management has explained but the other aspect is that because of the continuation of such slippages, it is anticipated that the growth one may see for ICICI Bank’s advances, may become delayed. It will no longer grow faster in this upcoming year of FY20.

In FY15, they had an exit rate of 14-14.5% in terms of growth on the advances side. We may not see a similar growth happening in FY20 if these problems persist and that is what is concerning the street right now. Otherwise, the bank has been doing wonderfully well in reducing its NPAs over a period of time, targeting lowering of credit cost as they go forward. 

They have been consistently growing their retail book by roughly 20% odd year-on-year and those things are steady and possibly improving but this aspect of slippages may continue to bog their growth rate ahead. That is bothering analysts on the street.


What are some of your top picks? I would like to look at a very small company for which we had initiated coverage sometime back -- DFM Foods -- which is the maker of the CRAX snack. It is doing wonderfully well in terms of growth rate. Their quarter four results were quite excellent, they delivered superlative profit growth and the growth trend continues to remain strong because the market is in a way kind of expanding. They are also looking to deepen their distribution reach so that is one stock we would look at this juncture."

We walk you through the key highlights of Tuesday's session:

Investors lose Rs 1.24 lakh crore in a day!Tuesday's losses made investors poorer by Rs 1.24 lakh crore, as overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 1,49,13,994 crore from Rs 1,50,37,619 crore on Monday. In the last five sessions, investors lost nearly Rs 4 lakh crore. 


Bharti Airtel stock loses steamShares of Bharti Airtel closed 3.10 per cent down at Rs 323.05, breaking the winning streak of three successive sessions despite better-than-expected March quarter numbers. Shares of the company slipped amid speculations over the company's operational details as the telecom major did not disclose them because of its ongoing rights issue.


ICICI Bank falls 4% on Q4Extending the losses into the second session in a row, shares of ICICI Bank closed 3.77 per cent lower at Rs 386.25, a day after it posted lower-than-expected financial results for March quarter.

24,2019-05-07,Britannia,"I would be a buyer in Bajaj Auto in two-wheeler space and something like Minda Industries in ancillaries space, said Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

How are looking at current investments in the auto pack? 
I will be a little contrarian. Although the lead indicators are suggesting a bit of consumption slowdown, my view is that the two-wheelers should start looking better. If you see the Bajaj and TVS numbers, although the growth was less, they did have some volume growth.

 For example, Bajaj Auto started the year with 15% market share. It has ended the year at about 22-23% market share. There have been a lot of new launches. The export markets are doing very well for them. They also get assisted by the three-wheeler sales. Plus, there is cash in the balance sheet. Last I checked, it was about close to Rs 16,000-17,000 crore.

I would be probably be a buyer on dips starting with two-wheelers and also in some of the auto components and auto ancillaries. The rising content per vehicle is more a structural trend. You will see airbags becoming compulsory from 1st of October. There is ABS which is getting introduced in the two-wheelers. Obviously one expects maximum value per model. You will see more value-added features whether those are alloy wheels or infotainment systems. So, you will see the ancillary makers also. There has been a reasonable price correction there as well because of the overall slowdown. 

So, I would be a buyer in something like Minda Industries and some of the others in this space.


If that decline were to come in the next few days, we may fall all the way to 11,300. Would you be in a rush to buy this decline?
Not exactly. One should only look at where there is earning support. I do not think a smart beta play is a great strategy. But if you look at the numbers which have come in, there are pockets which probably will give you some good opportunities. For example, although we saw a jump in the provisioning in ICICI Bank, it was a more a case of upfronting of the credit cost. 

The overall parameters which is your net interest income, NIMs, their provisioning coverage ratio is almost at 80%, an industry high. The overall bank credit growth is about 13% plus and we know that ICICI and HDFC can grow 20% plus. 

So that looks attractive to me and also with this NBFC liquidity crisis, you will see more and more gain on market share both on the retail side as well as on the SME side. That is one pocket to buy on dips. 

Telecom looks very interesting to me. I was actually impressed with Airtel’s numbers. For the first time, the India mobility business grew more than 4%. Their margins expanded about 150 bps. They have also been shedding a lot of flab by cutting the low ARPU customers and deactivating them. 

Also with this rights issue, the debt to EBITDA could probably come down from 4.1-4.2 to maybe sub-3 which could reduce their finance cost. Last quarter, their finance cost was almost Rs 2,500 crore. A reduction there could also pave way and a consolidation due now. It is a matter of time before ARPU starts rising. 

But as I said, don’t be in a rush, just be a little more calibrated, more patient and put the cash to good use. In India, the best part is that by staying on cash, you make 7-8%. It is not a bad strategy to deploy cash cautiously.


In this consumption slowdown, would there be opportunities to buy because when was the last time we actually see Britannia even move? It only moves upwards. Do you think another few percentage points of a correction and one could look to buy these names?
Marico had a very good set of numbers. It is the largest coconut oil producer in the world and the copra prices look benign. I do not think there will be a raw material cost pressure which we have been seeing in some of the other FMCG names. Marico looks good and even Saffola did quite well. HUL yes. In Britannia, there was some concern on those ICDs.


What about India’s first renewable InvIT set up by Piramal Enterprises in partnership with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ?
This is in fact, a very positive development. Also, Mr Piramal highlighted the use of InvIT as a vehicle instead of a private placement or the IPO route because here the investors come with long-term orientation, the underlying assets are cash generating ones. You are looking at more a double-digit steady returns. 

Even in the REIT space, Blackstone get a very good response. The more the market opens up ro InvITs and REITs, the better it is. 

Also heartening was the fact that they expect the exposure to the Lodha Group to come down. I think one area which we need to track more for the interest of the entire market breadth and the movement is the credit spreads. We saw REC borrowing money at 8.5% two three days back. The spreads have to come down for normalcy for return in equity markets. 

Also the NBFCs with better parentage, which are more retail funded, which have better access to funds are likely to gain market share. In fact, I was reviewing some of the NBFC numbers of the earnings have come by and he is right the NIMs have not really come down, it is the growth of disbursals which has taken a hit. 

If the stronger ones probably can maintain NIM or probably higher NIMs and gain market share, we could be looking at some good opportunities in some of these NBFCs with better parentage."

Producers of household items have been India’s best stock market bets for years. But the consumption slowdown in the world’s fastest-growing major economy is rubbing the sheen off these shares.

The 74-member S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Index, which has had only one down year since 2006, has bucked the gains in the nation’s benchmark measure. And some of the biggest names in the gauge have accumulated double-digit losses five months into the year.

India’s consumption engine is sputtering as the cash crunch caused by the crisis in the shadow-banking sector has curbed spending even on staples after hurting demand for cars and homes. Hindustan Unilever Ltd., whose soaps and detergents are used by nine out of 10 Indian households, in an analysts call Friday pinned the deceleration on weak rural demand and said it is unable to say when the buoyancy of the past would return.


Bloomberg
“When a generally-measured management like Hindustan Unilever’s uses the term ‘recession’ in its comments in the post-result presser, it generally isn’t a one-quarter blip,” analysts led by Rohit Chordia at Kotak Institutional Equity Research wrote in a note on the weekend.

The company’s volume growth slowed to 7 percent in the March quarter after five straight quarters of double-digit expansion. Growth for Dabur India Ltd. during the period was 4.3 percent compared with about 8 percent a year earlier. Britannia Industries Ltd. grew 7 percent, versus 11 percent, and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. posted a 1 percent increase in its domestic branded-business volumes.

The market is repricing the growth outlook. Hindustan Unilever has declined 5.8 percent in 2019, Godrej Consumer 21 percent, Britannia 15 percent and Dabur 11 percent. The S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Index trades at a 12-month blended forward price-to-earning of 32, higher than its five-year average, signaling potential for further contraction in values.

“The sector isn’t a bad place to be in but the high price-earnings ratios are a challenge,” Pashupati Advani, president of Advani Group, said by phone. “The explosive growth we saw in the past has disappeared. It is difficult to say when the economy will revive.”

The slowdown may not be cyclical, according to a separate report by Kotak Institutional Equities, which cites insufficient income growth as the reason for the weak demand. Lower property purchases by households from fiscal 2013 through 2018 helped sustain consumption, which is cooling off now as incomes fall, according to the note co-authored by Sanjeev Prasad.

As India’s on-going general elections enter the last stretch, the task for the new government is cut out -- take steps to revive economic growth. Prasad has three suggestions:



Reform land and labor laws 
Review pricing policies to boost FDI in key infrastructure sectors 
Raise foreign ownership limits in government bonds to boost inflows
“In our view, a combination of the three -- not just one or two -- can kick-start economic growth,” Prasad wrote."

Companies are offering help from gensets to drill out water, infrastructure to restore electrical poles, essential supplies like dry food ration, free mobile connectivity and potable water. The two most damaged cities are Bhubaneswar and Puri with electricity and water being the commodities in short supply.Coal India Limited, through its subsidiary-Mahanadi Coalfields in Sambalpur (Odisha), is sending gensets to drill out underground water while companies like 
Coca-Cola are braced to supply potable water. Mahanadi Coalfields is also ready to support the installation of about 10,000 electric poles that were uprooted in the cyclone.

“The immediate requirements in these areas are water and electricity with a shortage of generators. We are also ready to support the installation of electrical poles,” said Dikken Mehra, head of PR, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited.

Google Pay has activated a donation drive for the CM fund to aid the rescue and relief operation. Google’s crisis team has been active since the cyclone hit the state, and through the last few days, sending out SOS alerts, shared a company spokesperson.

Airtel has set up war rooms with dedicated teams in the state to monitor impact of operations and coordinate quick recovery. These war rooms are also coordinating with government authorities such as National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). SMS has been made free in three affected states for five days by Airtel, said a company spokesperson.

One of the largest public sector enterprises in the country, IndianOil has a strong presence in the state that is home to its biggest refinery, Paradip Refinery. The corporation has ensured uninterrupted fuel supply from its locations in Odisha and West Bengal on the east coast.

IndianOil’s administrative buildings in Odisha and Aviation Fuelling Station (AFS) at Bhubaneswar have faced damages. “Adequate stocks of products such as petrol, diesel, LPG, kerosene and aviation fuel have been made available. The Corporation is also actively assisting the district administration in evacuation, rescue and relief activities,” said a spokesperson for IndianOil.

The PSU is still assessing the damages to its fuel stations at Odisha, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.

Coca-Cola has provided dry ration in the affected areas near its plant in Khurda district of Odisha and provided water to its employees in Bhubaneshwar where there is no water and electricity.


Britannia is working closely with the ministry of food processing Industries and CII to ensure timely delivery of relief products to people affected by the cyclone, said a Britannia spokesperson.

Cyclone Fani made landfall last Friday causing severe destruction making some regions out of bounds for the rest of the country."

31,2019-05-09,Britannia,"If somebody has Reliance share in the portfolio, it is a hold. But it is a difficult call to take whether it is a buy at this point of time, said Devang Mehta, Head-Equity Advisory, Centrum India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 


The largecaps have taken quite a beating and Reliance Industries definitely merits a mention given the selling pressure. Now, Morgan Stanley is also rather circumspect and have downgraded the stock saying that the upside is going to be limited. What are you advising on RIL?
The markets have been extremely polarised in the last few months and the rally has been led by five or six businesses including Reliance, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and TCS. Unless the broader market starts participating in the rally, a crack in stocks which were doing extremely well, would cap the rally. 

The correction that we are seeing is more FII driven and that is clearly notable. They have overweight positions in the stocks which I have mentioned earlier. Reliance also is getting a bit of its correction because it has been a dream rally for the stock. I do not see a big challenge in the business as such people knew the earnings of petchem as well as the core business of oil and gas has been slowing down in the last two-three quarters.




But still, the stock was making new highs and this can be a natural correction -- probably 5% more from here as the market ,corrects led by heavyweights. I do not see a big problem emerging. If somebody has it in the portfolio, it is a hold. Whether it is a buy, it is a difficult call to take at this point but it is a good hold in the portfolio.


 The world is migrating towards corporate banks but looking at Yes Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank numbers, would you say the long crowded trade in corporate banks is getting challenged?
There were different set of numbers from different banks. Yes Bank faces a typically different type of problem. There was a kitchen-sinking done after the stock performed very well in the earlier couple of quarter. One quarter is mirroring what Axis Bank or a Yes Bank, ICICI Bank did two-three four quarters back, but there are not many compelling trades in the market in the banking sector. Of course, HDFC Bank commands a premium as a retail bank but clearly if somebody still needs to buy on dips, a better candidate where ROE expansion is going to happen is Axis Bank. The management is talking about 8% ROE getting into an 18% league in another three years.

After the clean-up, there is a lot of scope for these banks to give if not 25-30%, at least 15, 18, 20% type of return CAGR for the next two-three years, particularly for Axis Bank. 

So, yes the cream is out of the rally. The 40-50% return has already been made but it is back to 15-18% boring returns that can be made out of Axis or ICICI.


What is going on with some of these pledged share scenarios like the Essel Group? The fact that Reliance Mutual Fund sold it had created a lot of nervousness in the markets. What is your take?
It is better to avoid the space, where there is a lot of pledged share issue. In last two-three months, there has been bouts of volatility. A lot of these companies have good businesses and good pipeline as well. The numbers also are good for a lot of these companies, but the overhang on these type of stocks have always been the promoter pledge or the debt on the books which is very difficult to manage, during these types of market where on one side, there is polarisation and on the other, market breadth has been very weak. 

So, fundamental has taken a back stage for this type of businesses. It is better to stay away from these types of businesses. If you have to buy at all, go for a screaming buy or place your bet on the valuation side. That way, you do not suffer in the shorter term but over a longer period, you make good returns but yes, refrain from buying into companies where there are pledged shares.


We are gathering that there is going to be a steep hike in cement prices, the second one in the last two months. Your view?
In the last couple of quarters, we have started hunting for such businesses. Generally we refrain from buying more cyclical businesses as we are more into high market share or market leading businesses where there is pricing power. But cement in the last couple of quarters, have been showing a bit of traction. The last quarterly numbers of a lot of companies like UltraTech also see that the demand scenario coming back plus a bit of pricing power with price hikes. 

After a long time, probably the demand for cement is coming back and may be monsoon would be subdued. But for somebody with a one-one-and-a-half-year type of a view, cement presents a good opportunity. Cyclicals is one space where with select capital goods or cement, you can start constructing a portfolio and post election results, if a stable government is in place, the construction demand, infra demand and a bit of housing demand could come back. Cement can act as a proxy play for this type of construction activity.


Do you think one should just get more realistic rather than following a predefined template of buying good companies and great businesses? One should acknowledge that these companies are nowhere available at levels at which they warrant a buy?
There is a clear distinction between a great business, a good business and also a third category which IS classified by Warren Buffett as gruesome business. You do not want to buy any gruesome business in the portfolio at any type of valuation. May be it is a value or a value trap. We do not know any business so gruesome you have to stay away. A good business is probably about some cyclicals you have to time as and when you feel that this is the right price or the cycle is changing. Of course it is very difficult to say but cement and capital goods probably qualify as some of these companies have good business. 

Great businesses are some of the businesses like a Britannia or may be Dabur or HUL. These are types of businesses you do not want to sell or either you want to buy in distress. These are distressed times and probably after a 5% or 10% correction, the price may be right. But Page Industries from Rs 35,000 to Rs 32,000 or Rs 28,000 was probably overvalued. A couple of bad numbers brought it to Rs 22,000 right. Probably you need to time your bets -- that this is a time when you buy some consumption businesses like Page Industries or take a contra call like Eicher Motors which people will not find favour with right now at Rs 20,000. But at Rs 18,000 it would a screaming buy.

So, rather than adventuring into companies which you do not know, get into plain vanilla businesses where you know that the high market share and market leadership would come and help you in good times and which would not shatter you in bad times. So keep your bets ready, keep your list ready and these are the businesses in India which you need to buy. There are 100-150 good businesses where you can make money in a simpler way rather than adventuring out of the 500 stocks that present itself."
32,2019-05-09,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity barometer Sensex suffered losses for the seventh consecutive session on Thursday as worsening US-China trade relations continued to haunt major markets around the world. 

In the absence of any positive trigger, the domestic market failed to break the multi-day losing spell, as it saw strong selling in energy, telecom, metal, oil & gas and power sectors. 

Participants said other than the gloomy global cues, the ongoing elections have added to cautiousness. March quarter earnings have been mixed so far and they have failed to boost market sentiment.

Sensex closed 230 points, or 0.61 per cent, down at 37,558 while Nifty finished at 11,301, down 58 points or 0.51 per cent. In last seven days, both Sensex and Nifty have come off nearly 4 per cent. 


Let's take a look at highlights of Thursday's session:

RIL loses Rs 28,000 cr in m-capShares of Reliance Industries (RIL) declined 3.41 per cent to settle at Rs 1,255.15 after global brokerage Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from ‘overweight’ to ‘equal-weight’ with a price target of Rs 1,349. The stock has come off nearly 11 per cent after falling for four consecutive sessions, which eroded its market capitalisation by Rs 96,288 crore. On Thursday alone, the company lost Rs 28,081 crore in m-cap. 


Investors poorer & poorerIn last seven sessions, investors have lost over Rs 6.16 lakh crore, as the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 1,46,92,788.80 crore from Rs 1,53,08,828.49 crore on Friday, April 26. On Thursday, equity investors lost Rs 55,000 crore.


229 stocks hit 52-week lows As many as 229 stocks, including Cyient, Amara Raja Batteries, Apollo Tyres, Biocon, Bosch, Cadila Healthcare, Graphite India and Jubilant Life Sciences, hit 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, GKP Printing & Packaging, Gaurav Mercantiles, Halder Venture and Stephanotis Finance were among 19 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


YES Bank surprisesSnapping the losing streak of three consecutive sessions, shares of YES Bank surged 5.94 per cent to close at Rs 170.30 despite reports of rating downgrades. Days after Icra downgraded YES Bank, India Ratings has also scaled down the bank's long-term rating to 'IND AA-' with a negative outlook. Analysts said short-covering at cheaper price might have given the stock a boost. 


Asian Paints down 2%Shares of Asian Paints finished 2.29 per cent lower at Rs 1,355 after the company reported a 1.6 per cent year-on-year fall in consolidated profit after minority interest at Rs 473.11 crore, falling short of Rs 595 crore that analysts had projected in an ETNOW poll. 


Zee shares surge 7%Shares of Zee Entertainment jumped 7.31 per cent to Rs 357.65, a day after it denied rumours of concerns over the audit of its financial statements. Besides, the stock gained after the company told stock exchanges that the stake sale process, undertaken by Essel Group, is at an advanced stage.

36,2019-05-13,Britannia,"MUMBAI: If there’s one company that has created successful brands from scratch after a late start, it’s ITC.

A late entrant in FMCG and packaged foods, ITC challenged domestic and multinational companies alike, following a clear vision of its legendary former chairman Yogi C Deveshwar, to quickly scale the non-cigarette businesses of the company.

How does a company create an impact in a sector dominated by multinational companies? ITC stuck to the classic textbook approach to build the FMCG business, which today boasts of a portfolio of Rs 1,000-crore plus brands, Aashirvaad being the biggest with a turnover of over Rs 4,000 crore.

“ITC did in foods, what HUL (Hindustan Unilever) did in personal care,” said an FMCG industry expert. Because foods is largely a local subject, ITC managed to create a bigger disruption in foods where consumer trial is high, something that HUL couldn’t do in decades. ITC tapped into those categories where the share of the unorganised market was high, such as atta, where there was a need for consumer branding. “ITC mastered this art in foods. In personal care, however, there is less of unorganised play and brand loyalty is a big factor. This has been a challenge for ITC,” said the expert.

Devendra Chawla, another FMCG expert who heads Spencer’s Retail, said: “It can take years to build a distribution network in towns and villages. It takes time to learn sourcing right in food and not everyone gets consumer insights right. On all these counts, ITC has excelled. It’s this very consumer understanding that has helped ITC grow its food business on local tastes. In foods, a local company has a better understanding of the consumer behaviour. A true farm-to-fork strategy with recent acquisitions has helped ITC grow nascent categories by leveraging on these strengths.” When ITC forayed into foods in 2002 with the launch of the ready-to-eat range ‘Kitchens of India’, followed by Aashirvaad atta, the industry was bereft of major technological disruptions. ITC put in concerted efforts to build each category it entered while ticking every box in the marketing book. 

Marico CEO & MD Saugata Gupta, said: “ITC did everything right because they believe in doing everything in the classical copybook way. They invested in backrooms, supply chain and innovation. They managed to create a disruption through quality products created in India, which were then rapidly scaled up.”

Every year was marked by a significant brand/category launch, leading to a non-cigarette FMCG business of Rs 11,000 crore today. The company has set a target to achieve a turnover of Rs 1 lakh crore from non-cigarette FMCG and foods business by 2030. ITC did not shy away from leveraging capabilities from its existing businesses. It used its hotels network, and based on insights from chefs, arrived at the right flavours to woo consumers. Its agri sourcing network and e-choupal helped build an end-to-end network. It also outspent other FMCG companies when it came to advertising, according to Abneesh Roy, senior VP, Edelweiss Financial Services. “ITC had the ability to plough profits it earned from other businesses like cigarettes into growing the FMCG/foods portfolios. While earlier they focused on the mass segments, in the last 5-6 years there was a clear departure from this strategy to focus on mid-to-premium end of the market to earn higher gross margins. For about 5-6 years they did not make a profit in FMCG. Now they make decent margins. This strategy was important to take on players that were already well entrenched in the market.”

Whether it is Dark Fantasy Choco Fills cookies or innovations like a pocket deo in Engage, investing in product innovation has helped ITC garner significant share of certain categories. ITC is a market leader in atta, stationary, cream biscuits, bridges segment and it’s the second leading player in deodorants, shower gels, noodles and agarbatti.

In different categories, ITC competes with PepsiCo, Nestle, HUL, Britannia and Parle, among others."

Where We Are: Sell in May & go away, an adage that is being discussed across all the major markets seems to be having a rub-off effect on Indian markets, too. In the midst of the rising volatility, the benchmark index staged a sharp correction with both Nifty & Nifty Bank remaining under pressure since the start of the month. A neckline breakout at 11,550 of H&S (daily) pattern triggered the short-term trend reversal. Additionally, broader market — Nifty Midcap & Nifty SmallCap — staged a follow-up correction. What is in Store: A successive gap-down opening and follow-up correction is likely to weigh more toward downside. The index also failed to stay above its short-term averages of 20 & 50 SMA. One silver lining/ point of respite could be that as price is near to its key Fibonacci ratio of 50 per cent which is placed at 11,220 (reference range is 10,586-11,856), a successive close above the mentioned level may result in the consolidation phase. Level of 11,550 remains a key resistance in the short term.


What Could the Investor Do: A rising India VIX remains a worrying point for the market participants. However, it’s likely to be the normal course of action given that a major event is lined up in the month itself. Also, we have observed a significant rise & fall to the tune of 40 per cent and above in India VIX in April & May 2014 as well. Stock-specific action shall continue. We like ITC, Britannia & SBIN and expect a potential upside to tune of over 5 per cent. A follow-up correction is likely for Indusind Bank, Jindal Steel & HCL Tech."

The company’s revenue grew by a healthy 10%, helped by 3% increase in product prices and 7% increase in volume. However, its net profit grew just 12% due to a 29% jump in ‘other expenses’.

Though Britannia’s market share gain in the biscuits space continues, the company has been impacted by increased competition in its core biscuits portfolio and the ongoing rural slowdown. Traditionally, rural markets grow much faster than urban ones and, therefore, the sharp fall in rural growth is impacting all FMCG companies, including Britannia. This explains why Britannia’s overall volume growth in the biscuits segment now is lower than in the previous quarters.

Britannia, however, plans to overcome this slow growth in its biscuits segment by diversifying its product portfolio. The idea is to maintain its overall growth rate with contribution from new products. Most new launches—cakes, milk shakes, cheese, salty snacks, wafers, etc.—have generated a good response. These products are expected to help Britannia fulfil its dream of becoming a total foods company. Britannia enjoys strong brand equity and its pan-India distribution network has been helping with these new products. Due to these innovative launches, analysts feel that Britannia’s combined revenue share from new launches will double in 2019-20. New launches currently contribute around 4.5% to the company’s revenue.

The company’s recent underperformance is another reason why analysts are getting bullish on this counter. Britannia lost 14% during the past three months, while the ET FMCG Index lost just about 1% and Sensex gained 3%. Pressure on margins due to new launches is the main reason for Britannia’s underperformance. The company has traditionally kept its margin stable by increasing or decreasing prices, depending on changes in the cost of raw materials, and by efficient cost management. 

However, cost management may take a backseat in the short term because of a series of new product launches, which will warrant additional advertisement spending. Commissioning of new manufacturing facilities also means higher depreciations. So, investors looking to get into this counter now should be ready to stay put for the long haul. The earnings jump may happen only after a few years.




Selection Methodology

40,2019-05-18,Britannia,"Startup bosses are leading the charge among corporate highf liers travelling to England to cheer for team India at the Cricket World Cup starting on May 30. And one match most of them will watch is the India-Pakistan clash at Old Trafford on June 16.

At least two unicorn founders — Naveen Tewari of mobile marketing platform InMobi and Byju Raveendran of learning app Byju’s — are among the many startup honchos who have confirmed they are going to catch the cricketing action up close. Others in the list include InMobi cofounder Abhay Singhal, Byju’s chief operating officer Mrinal Mohit, coworking space provider GoWork CEO Sudeep Singh, healthcare technology company Care24 founder Vipin Pathak, and augmented reality app Scanta founder Chaitanya Hiremath.

While most corporate honchos plan to travel with family and friends, some are sending their top performers on all expenses-paid trip to England, using the World Cup to build loyalty and team spirit.

Byju’s, for example, is taking a group of 100 top performers on a four-day fully funded trip to London and Manchester that will include watching the India-Pakistan match at Old Trafford.

Almost 70% of the employees headed for London are under 25, said Pravin Prakash, chief people officer at Byju’s - The Learning App. “So far we have organised three international trips for our top performers as it has a long-term and strong impact on their motivation,” he said. Rival learning app Toppr is also sending its top performer to the World Cup. Hiremath of Scanta, an avid cricket fan, said he too is mulling the idea of sending employees for matches. “I am super excited to watch the semi-finals and finals,” he said. “If India gets to the finals it will be worth it.”

Tewari of InMobi, whose love for cricket is well known, will travel with his wife Aditi and company cofounder Singhal. Besides the high-stakes India–Pakistan match, they have also booked tickets for the semi-finals and the finals.

Singh of GoWork will also be at Old Trafford on June 16 along with his family as an extension of their annual summer break.


CONSUMER COMPANIES ACTIVE
Consumer companies, especially those associated with the event as sponsors, too, will continue to send high performers to the World Cup. Coca Cola, Nissan, Britannia and Bira 91 are among firms that will send their top performers on fully funded trip to the World Cup as part of their rewards and recognition initiatives.

Such incentive trips are used to not just reward high performers, but also to promote loyalty, reduce attrition and motivate employees, company insiders said.

At craft beer brand Bira 91, for instance, employees exhibiting high performance in first quarter will get an all-expense paid trip to watch one key match in England. “This programme is being run across sales, central functions and our plants,” said Swayampriya Shah, vice-president, HR and administration, at Bira 91.

Biscuits maker Britannia is organising a contest for its sales team, winners of which will travel on an all-expenses paid trip to the World Cup.

Three employees at carmaker Nissan, too, will win tickets for the final match with a fully-paid three day-two night package tour of London as part of the company’s global partnership with ICC. Coca Cola has gone a step further, and will f ly all 200 employees in its business unit to England to watch the various teams battle it out in the cricketing arena.

Shiv Agrawal, managing director at recruitment service firm ABC Consultants, and R Suresh, founder of boutique search and consulting firm INSIST Executive Search, too are headed for the World Cup.


TRAVEL COMPANIES UPBEAT
Travel companies are reporting a surge in bookings, with the India-Pakistan match being a mandatory inclusion. Other sought-after matches include India-South Africa at Southampton, India-England at Birmingham, India-Australia at the Oval, London, and India-Sri Lanka at Leeds.

“For most Indians, cricket is a passion, if not a religion,” said Rajeev Kale, president at Thomas Cook (India). “Cricket has always been a significantly powerful driver across our travel businesses. This year, too, we have seen a strong growth, with our sales teams reporting a 36% increase in demand in comparison to the previous year.”

Corporate India is contributing over 50% of the bookings, Kale said."
41,2019-05-18,Britannia,"It is lunchtime on a weekday and there’s a hubbub of hungry customers around the counter at Cannon food stall, opposite south Mumbai’s iconic Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station. Employees at the 46-year-old establishment are doing double-speed, rush-hour duty, against the clang of steel plates and swirl of shouted orders, to serve its most popular dish — pav bhaji.

It is definitely not for the calorie-conscious. The pav (bread) glistens with golden butter and a generous slab of butter, the size of a small soap bar, slowly melts into the hot bhaji. That only seems to boost the demand for “Amul Pav Bhaji”, advertised prominently on the menu board for Rs 100. Appa Dandekar, who runs Cannon, says the stall has always used Amul and there is no question of using any other butter brand. “People can tell the difference between Amul and others.”

This kind of devotion to Amul Butter is what makes it the undisputed market leader, accounting for around 85% of the Rs 3,500 crore butter market in India, according to industry sources. More than six decades after it was launched, Amul Butter has managed to hold onto its dominance.

In the hyper competitive world of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) — a low-margin, distribution and marketing-focused universe where customer loyalties tend to be fickle — a handful of legacy brands such as Amul Butter has managed to retain their market leadership over decades, fending off rivals, rapidly changing tastes and shifting market structures.

 In some cases, the dominance is such that the category is defined by the brand. Instant noodles brand Maggi, Dabur Chyawanprash, Parle G, Rooh Afza and Diary Milk among food and drinks and Pidilite’s Fevicol, an adhesive, are among these logic-defying brands. 

All of them have been around for a while, making it clear that customer loyalty is earned slowly, but surely. But apart from longevity and the consistent nurturing of the brand itself, there is little that’s discernibly common among them. Each product has had its own journey and challenges. So what lessons in success and leadership can be gleaned from the journey of these powerhouse brands?


Recall Value
 For one, being a strong brand does not guarantee safety. Amul, for example, has to fight for market share with Parag Milk Foods and Britannia in cheese, and Nestle and Mother Dairy battle Amul in the packaged milk category. Amul’s market share in the cheese and milk segments are pegged at 40-50% and 30%, respectively.

Research firms such as Nielsen and Euromonitor do not share market share figures with the media, and some market segments, such as butter, are not extensively tracked. ET Magazine has relied on data from industry sources, including figures from syndicated reports by market research firms.

But why do people invariably think of Amul while buying butter? Shirish Upadhyay, a dairy industry veteran who has worked in the private sector and with the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which owns the brand Amul, says Amul had a head start in butter.

The dairy sector was delicensed in 1991 but the brand had been launched in the 1950s and its famous “Utterly Butterly” slogan and the Amul girl created in 1966. “And it is very competitively priced so it doesn’t make sense for others to take on Amul.”



Amul ButterCompany: Amul, Market share of Amul Butter: 85%, Competitors: Heritage, Mother Dairy, Britannia
 “There is a conscious effort to talk to younger people through Amul ads” Rahul da Cunha, ad man behind Amul
Another reason is the distinct salty taste that Amul Butter had developed to take on then-market leader, Polson’s Butter, in the 1950s.

Butter, which helped Amul build a national distribution network, has the highest cross-country penetration among all its products, says RS Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF. The company also sells ghee, buttermilk, ice cream and chocolates. GCMMF earned a revenue of Rs 33,150 crore in 2018-19. “People have blind faith in the Amul Butter brand, like they have on their religion.”

Rahul da Cunha, one of the brains behind the Amul girl advertisements, says one of the reasons for the endurance of the brand is its attempt to talk to younger people. “We are commenting not just on topics of national importance but also on topics of internet importance.”


Riding on Nostalgia
Another popular brand that also used a little girl for branding is Parle-G biscuits. The packaging of the product launched in 1939 uses a picture of a little girl. Owned by Parle Products, the biscuit is a daily fixture in the lives of many Indians who like dunking it in their tea.

 “You might try different biscuits. But when you want to have something every day, it is Parle-G,” says Mayank Shah, category head at Parle Products. The biscuit accounts for fourfifths of the Rs 8,750 crore glucose biscuit market and operates at staggering scale. Available at 10 different price points from Rs 2 (with eight biscuits) to Rs 65 (with 160 biscuits), Parle-G is sold through 6.5 million outlets. A billion packets are sold every month. In 2011, Nieslen called it the world’s largest-selling biscuit. The brand’s chief competitors are Britannia’s Tiger and ITC’s Sunfeast Glucose, which account for a tenth of the market.

To take on the competition, Parle-G reinvented the brand and termed the “G” in the name “genius”. Shah says Tiger and Sunfeast only ate into the market share of the smaller players. Parle-G’s share has grown from 68% to 80% in the past two decades, he adds.



Parle-G Company: Parle Products Market share of Parle-G in glucose biscuits: 80%, Competitors: Tiger, Sunfeast Glucose
Britannia declined to comment for the story and ITC did not respond to queries. These two companies are no less aggressive when it comes to pricing and distribution, but Tiger and Sunfeast Glucose, launched in 1997 and 2003, respectively, do not — at least not yet — have Parle-G’s biggest selling point — a multi-generational connection with the brand.

Nostalgia certainly helps a brand, says Siddharth Shekhar Singh, associate professor of marketing at the Indian School of Business. “But if customers don’t find value in it, then (future) generations may remember the brand but not use it.”

Anil Viswanathan, director of marketing (chocolates), Mondelez India, concurs. “Nostalgia is a dangerous thing. The moment you are rooted in the past, there is only one direction you are going to go.”

Mondelez accounts for twothirds of the Rs 10,430 crore chocolate market in India, according to Nielsen data shared by industry insiders. Their flagship brand Cadbury Dairy Milk, launched in India in 1948, alone has a 41% market share.

There was a time most Indians did not have access to have premium chocolates and made do with whatever was available. But, Viswanathan says, that started changing around a decade ago when people realised there were no good premium chocolates in India. That was when the company launched Dairy Milk Silk, which starts at Rs 70. The company’s premium range of chocolates like Silk and Bournville necessitated an increase in the number of coolers in stores.



Dairy Milk has also been helped in no small measure by some of India’s most memorable commercials and taglines since the 1990s, created by Ogilvy & Mather (O&M), including “Asli swad zindagi ka (The real taste of life)” and “Kuchh meetha ho jaaye (Let’s have something sweet)”.

 “Nostalgia is a dangerous thing for brands. The moment you are rooted in the past, there is only one direction you are going to go” Anil Viswanathan, director of marketing (chocolates), Mondelez
Smart advertising, also by O&M, has also built Fevicol and its associate brands like Fevikwik and M-Seal. Owned by Pidilite Industries, the brands are said to control around 70% of the adhesives market. In a largely unorganised industry, Fevicol has the stickiness its competitors would kill for. A June 2017 research report by Credit Suisse on Pidilite says the incentive for carpenters to switch to another brand was low, as adhesives make up only 1-2% of the cost of making furniture.






Fevicol Company: Pidilite Market share of Fevicol 70% & Associate Brands like Fevikwik: Competitors: Jivanjor, Araldite

One of the secrets to the brand’s success was that unlike its competitors, it did not go just to distributors, but also engaged the end-users, in this case carpenters, masons and plumbers. In 2002, it even started a club for carpenters, the first of its kind, through which it conducts training programmes and cultural events for carpenters’ families. This club, which now has 1 lakh members in 600 towns, allows them to showcase new products to carpenters, a luxury Pidilite’s competitors do not have.

Just like Fevicol is used to refer to adhesives in general, rose-flavoured sherbets are in some quarters referred to as Rooh Afza. The Hamdard Laboratories’ brand, which reportedly accounts for nearly half of the Rs 1,000 crore syrup and concentrate market, was in the news recently because there was a shortage of the product during Ramzan. A large section of people break their iftar fast with Rooh Afza.

The market leader faces no real competition in some product categories. But there are also segments where newer players have given the top brand a serious scare. One such segment is chyawanprash. The product was long synonymous with Dabur, which has a nearly 60% share in the Rs 540 crore market. Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali has within a few years of its launch become the third largest player in the market, after Dabur and Baidyanath. But the sheen has started wearing off Patanjali due to increasing competition and distribution woes.

While Dabur and Baidyanath saw their market shares by volume rise in 2018-19 from 2017-18, Patanjali’s declined. Prashant Agarwal, marketing head-health supplements, Dabur, says Patanjali had a short-term impact and Dabur has made up for the loss in market share. “While people associate chyawanprash with winters, we are trying to get them to also buy it during other seasons, like monsoons.”

Dabur Chyawanprash, launched in 1949, for a long time enjoyed the benefits of being India’s first branded chyawanprash. But with increasing competition, the company has made a concerted attempt to reach out to a younger consumer base through brand ambassadors like cricketer MS Dhoni and Bhojpuri film star Ravi Kishan, who is quite popular in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and make chyawanprash more palatable to kids by launching it in flavors like mango and chocolate.

Unlike in chyawanprash, it was not competition that posed a threat to Nestle in instant noodles. Maggi was synonymous instant noodles. But the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India’s decision in June 2015 to recall Maggi noodles over the presence of lead beyond the permissible limit and due to misleading labelling related to monosodium glutamate gave the brand a severe beating. Six months later, Maggi was back on the shelves, though the market share had nearly halved from 80% in 2014, according to Nestle data.



“While people associate chyawanprash with winters, we are trying to get them to also buy it during other seasons, like monsoons” Prashant Agarwal marketing head, health supplements, Dabur

However, the power of the brand and the company’s outreach saw Maggi through those trying times. The product’s market share is now almost 60%, according to Nestle. “It was quite telling who consumers were willing to trust, the government or Maggi,” says Alpana Parida, MD of DY Works, a brand consultancy.



Maggi, Company: Nestle Market share of Maggi: 59% Competitors: Wai Wai, Top Ramen,adequate

Brand Trap Nestle India did not respond to ET Magazine's specific questions, except to say Maggi has a strong resonance among consumers. Maggi's competitors include Sunfeast Yippee, Wai Wai and Top Ramen. Yippee, launched in 2010, has become the second largest brand, with a fifth of the market, riding ITC's distribution muscle, but it still does not immediately bring to mind noodles the way Maggi does.

Being a well-known brand of a big company can be a trap in itself. ""These companies are usually large-sized and due to their sheer size, it is challenging for them to be agile and provide a quick response to innovations and changing consumer needs,"" says Ina Dawer, research manager at Euromonitor International.

Staying relevant is a constant battle. The numerous onceubiquitous brands that have fallen by the wayside stand testimony to this brutal market truth."

47,2019-05-23,Britannia,"The Narendra Modi-led government’s victory in 2014 triggered a bull run in Indian stock market that has led to the Nifty gaining 63% in the last five years. Financials, auto and consumer companies led the outperformance during this period. With the outcome of the national polls due today, ET takes a look at some of the top performers during the NDA regime from the BSE 100 index and details their outlook going ahead.


BAJAJ FINANCE
CMP: Rs 3,447.70 Change in last 5 years: 1,852%

Bajaj Finance has been the biggest wealth creator among BSE 100 constituents over the last five years due to consistent earnings performance. “The company has grown at a 35-40% CAGR for eight-nine-years in a low and its liability management has been strong. Profit has grown 10-12 times in the last eight-nine years,” said Digant Haria, AVP-research at Antique Stock Broking. Haria believes premium valuation of can sustain going forward till business execution stays strong


BRITANNIA INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 2,851.25 Change in last 5 years: 560%

Britannia did well in the last five years since new CEO Varun Berry was appointed in March 2014, just before the NDA was elected, said analysts. “He implemented a lot of strategy changes that resulted in margin expansion and return ratio expansion. The stock was adequately rewarded for this,” said Deepak Jasani, head of research at HDFC Securities. Jasani said the stock may not repeat its strong show in the next five years due to stretched valuations and a high base.


TITAN COMPANY
CMP: Rs 1,240.45 Change in last 5 years: 304%

The implementation of GST and lower corporate governance levels in other listed jewellery stocks made investors shift to Titan, said independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga. “Titan’s corporate governance was never under any question. Financial performance should sustain but stock may not outperform. The stock is not cheap, it will perform in line with the consumer space,” said Baliga.


HAVELLS INDIA
CMP: Rs 756.35 Change in last 5 years (%): 302%

Jasani of HDFC Securities said Havells has transformed itself from an industrial to a consumer facing company with strong focus on brands, mass premium markets, innovation and strong distribution across the country. “Investors recognised the moat in their business and pushed up the stock prices,” said Jasani. He believes the stock may not repeat its superlative performance in the next five years as valuations are high.


PIDILITE INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 1,212.30 Change in last 5 years: 289%

Demand revival, entry in new markets and adjacent categories, and anticipated demand shift from unorganised to organised players are likely to boost Pidilite’s revenue and earnings, said Abneesh Roy, senior vicepresident-institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities. Roy is optimistic on Pidilite Industries – which is a market leader in the adhesives segment, due to anticipated demand recovery and market leadership.


PAGE INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 22,526.8 Change in last 5 years: 280%

Page has underperformed in the last one-and-a-half years because of expensive valuation, consumer slowdown and margin pressure, it is one of the outperformers in the last five years, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets and corporate affairs at IIFL. “The management is very competent and the brand value of Jockey is immense. It is one of the best consumer companies in the midcap space,” said Bhasin.


BIOCON
CMP: Rs 519.6 Change in last 5 years: 263%

India’s largest bio-pharma company Biocon is expected to perform well going ahead as well, said analysts. HSBC expects biosimilars momentum to continue for Biocon on gradual launches, pick up in the US and the EU, and ongoing traction in emerging markets. “...progress on the biosimilars regulatory front in developed markets and launches in the developed as well as emerging markets are likely to be key levers for the company.”


HDFC BANK
CMP: Rs 2405.1 Change in last 5 years: 199%

Investor favourite HDFC Bank’s profit has grown at a compounded rate of 20.6% over the last five years. “Considering the healthy balance sheet growth, superior asset quality and management, the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. It remains a portfolio stock with premium valuations,” said ICICIdirect, which sees the stock at Rs 2,700 in the next one year.


KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK
CMP: Rs 1495.50 Change in last 5 years: 230%

Another consistent performer from the banking space over the last five years is Kotak Mahindra Bank which Antique Stock Broking recently called ‘stock of all seasons’.”Kotak Mahindra Bank is currently trading at a P/B multiple of 5.7 times/4.9 times on FY20/ FY21 book value and we expect the premium valuation of the bank to continue on back of its superior asset quality, high ROE and balance sheet growth well supported by strong performance of its


EICHER MOTORS
CMP: Rs 21,221.85 Change in last 5 years: 233%

After rallying sharply over the years, the stock may face headwinds going ahead. There seems to be brand fatigue for Royal Enfield in metro cities which is visible in sharp moderation in same store sales, said HSBC. “The stock is facing sector headwinds as well as product headwinds. It could underperform going forward,” said independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga.


ASIAN PAINTS
CMP: Rs 1,366.75 Change in last 5 years: 155%

Although the stock trades at 50.2 times one-year forward earnings, having gained over 150% in the last five years, analysts are still bullish on the stock. “Given strong volume growth visibility for paints in the medium term and the competitive advantages of Asian Paints, we believe the current valuations present a good buying opportunity,” said UBS in a note recently."
50,2019-05-25,Britannia,"Amisha Vora of Prabhudas Liladher tries to second-guess the agenda for Modi government 2.0 in its first 100 days and talks about possible midcap bets and infrastructure as a theme to invest in. Edited excerpts from an interview with ET Now.

ET Now: What do you make of the market movements on Friday? Many technical analysts have pointed out that today's movement is different because L&T is up 4 per cent. PSUs, among others, look as if they are seeing delivery buying. What is the sense you are getting? 

Amisha Vora: With this thumping majority, whatever is part of the manifesto and the ongoing action plan there is where the focus of the market and portfolio selection will be. One key focus in the last five years, which will be pursued in the next five, seems to be infrastructure. If the last five years were roads, I think the next five years will be defense-related, where a lot of work has happened. But fructification in terms of corporate balance sheets and profit and loss spending should happen. Much more aggression on execution for airports will take place. Similarly, I think there will be a lot of action for power and infrastructure. One could play the infra theme through stocks like L&T. One could also play through cement on the back of infrastructure and housing. From the broader market perspective, people would like to see the ministry portfolio allocation and what stance RBI is taking on rate and liquidity after meeting the new government. This will give the market a new direction. 


ET Now: What is your take on the consumption stocks? Will you be very selective or do you see a broader trend for this space on the back of maybe a move on rates?


Amisha Vora: Right now, consumption is a piece which has really slowed down, be it auto or other types of consumption -- tiles, plywood, paints, etc. Everywhere we are seeing signs of a slowdown. Now, the steps being taken to revive consumption growth are what will be watched out for. We have included some of the largecaps in the consumption basket -- like Britannia -- but overall if one takes a slightly medium-term view, not the first three to six months, then I think midcaps and smallcaps will perform much better in the next 12 to 18 months compared to largecaps.


ET Now: When you talk of midcaps and smallcap, do you feel that there will be a revival in terms of the sort of flows that are coming to the domestic funds? Is that something which will trigger a midcap valuation re-rating?


Amisha Vora: Absolutely, there is an evident shift. Net fresh inflows into large cap have reduced and in midcaps they have gone up substantially. Almost Rs 4,500 crore net inflows have come into midcap funds as compared to Rs 2,500 crore in largecaps. The trend is there from a mutual fund perspective as well as normal pocket and HNI perspective. People will view stability very strongly and that is how then they will a take call. This is a government which in the last five years did not tamper with fiscal deficit, so they will continue to walk the same path and will continue to be cautious on inflation and both these are a good combination for better inflation and better interest rate outlook. When the liquidity and interest rates are slow, it's the midcaps and smallcaps that start performing.



ET Now: How do you anticipate Modi govt will get things going in the first 100 days?


Amisha Vora: I think that interest rates will be the first that will be taken care of. Overall, there are a lot of decisions which are on hold or which are pending, be it related to some of the IBC matters, to IL&FS, or actual government spending and government tenders and orders. So, a lot of work which from the last two and a half months was under some kind of a freeze would now start rolling and the economy which was feeling immense constraint on liquidity will start doing better. 

The second I feel would be the GST. Now, the GST has almost stabilised but now the focus could be on the e-way bill. As the GST collections start increasing, the GST rates can further come down. I think, that would also be part of the ongoing agenda to do the needful, which will bring a lot of consumption side back, increasing liquidity into the system. 

And the pending tendering processes or pending finalisation processes of infrastructure projects will start rolling out.


ET Now: Do you think in terms of PSU banks one needs to be selective?


Amisha Vora: One will have to be very selective in PSUs also because PSU banks' requirement for capital and technology will continue to be very huge. IT will lead to further consolidation. But then having said that, SBI particularly is very well placed to explore both with its technological edge as well as its size and capital and liability side. I would like to bet on such well-placed player than some of the smaller ones where I think technology will continue to be a challenge."

Mumbai is a wonderful city for eating out. There’s history. There’s tradition. There’s luxury hotels with cool international cuisine and icy air-conditioning. And there’s also street food, though some foreign visitors are wary.

But where do Indian chefs like to eat? We asked some of the biggest names in Indian gastronomy for their favorite places and dishes, from cheap snacks to fine gastronomy.

Here are their picks.


Americano
This is the new restaurant of chef Alex Sanchez, who previously won countless fans and a large following at the Table in Mumbai. Here, in a cool bar with a high ceiling, he serves an eclectic menu of things he likes to cook. Those things include great pizzas and a quirky dish of corn “ribs,” dusted with spices and served with green garlic aioli. “I went there twice in the opening week and the simplicity blew me away,” says Hussain Shahzad of O Pedro restaurant in Mumbai. “The corn ribs are an amazing bar snack.”123 Nagindas Master Road, Kala Ghoda, Fort; +91 22226 47700; www.americanobombay.com

Bademiya
This street-food stall behind the Taj Mahal Palace hotel traces its history to 1946. It’s a destination and late at night Tulloch Road is jammed with people lining up for the seekh kebabs, many with the food laid out on their car bonnets. Popular dishes include mutton seekh kabab. “It’s very good: It’s an institution,” says Vivek Singh, of London’s Cinnamon Club. “The kebabs are awesome,” says Surender Mohan, of London’s Jamavar. A third London-based chef, Sriram Aylur of Quilon, visits whenever he is in Mumbai.Tulloch Road, Behind Hotel Taj Mahal, Apollo Bandar, Colaba, 400039; +91 99671 14179


Bombay Canteen
This fashionable restaurant and bar is a favorite of many chefs, who enjoy the modern cooking of traditional regional dishes as well as the buzz. (The culinary director and co-founder is Floyd Cardoz, who worked for Danny Meyer in New York, and learned much about hospitality along the way.) “I like the rustic way they serve the food: It’s a modern take and it’s a cool place,” says Rohit Ghai of Kutir, in London. “I love it: They are so innovative,” says Ravinder Bhogal of Jikoni, whose favorite dish is Beetroot & Topli Paneer. Quilon’s Aylur says, “They take a simple dish and give it a twist. I find it very exciting.”Kamala Mills, SB Road, Lower Parel, 400013; +91 22 4966 6666; thebombaycanteen.com


Britannia & Co
This grand old Parsi cafe was an inspiration for Dishoom restaurant in London. “It was built in the early twenties by George Wittet, the architect who also built the Gateway of India,” according to Dishoom. Jamavar’s Mohan, whose other London restaurant is Bombay Bustle, recommends the berry pulao (spiced rice with currant-like dried berries) and “a fine rendition of Bombay duck.” Harneet Baweja, of Gunpowder, London, is another fan: “It’s a place you go to every day.”16 Wakefield House, Sprott Road, Ballard Estate, Fort, 400038; +91 22 2261 5264

Jai Hind Lunch Home
This inexpensive seafood restaurant is a favorite of chef Cyrus Todiwala of Cafe Spice Namaste in London, who particularly enjoys the Clam Sukka with coconut; and the Bombay Duck at the Bandra West outlet. “I love the way they do their seafood,” he says. “It’s very fresh and light, with the right amount of pungency, and amazing flavors. It’s super casual and very busy. You might have to queue.” Gunpowder’s Baweja is another fan of the Clam Sukka, enjoying the dry masala style.

Mahesh Lunch Home
This seafood restaurant, founded in 1977, serves the Mangalorean cuisine of South India, known for its fish curries and the use of coconut and curry leaves. (There are now four outlets in Mumbai alone.) “It’s a seafood place for locals, an institution,” says Cinnamon Club’s Singh. “It’s informal and not too expensive, and the food is very acceptable.” Jikoni’s Bhogal says: “It’s really good coastal food.” Chef Karam Sethi of Gymkhana and other JKS Restaurants in London, is a fan of the “classic” cooking.8-B, Cawasji Patel Street, Fort, 400001; +91 22 2287 0938; www.maheshlunchhome.com


O Pedro
This Goan bar and restaurant in northern Mumbai is fashionable and buzzy, with creative cocktails and cooking. Bar snacks such as burrata salad with slow-roasted winter carrots, pumpkin-seed granola & toasted chilli oil set the standard. O Pedro is the pick of the restaurateur and writer Camellia Panjabi, who says, “It’s a playful restaurant from the founders of Bombay Canteen.” She enjoys the modern Goan cooking and the cocktails. Panjabi’s restaurants include Chutney Mary and Masala Zone in London.Unit No. 2, Plot No. C-68 Jet Airways - Godrej BKC, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (E), 400051; +91 22 2653 4700; opedromumbai.com


Sea Lounge at the Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal Palace opened in 1903 and is a beautiful landmark in Mumbai. The afternoon tea at the Sea Lounge is not to be missed, according to Quilon’s Sriram, who particularly recommends the Bhel Puri (puffed rice, crispies, potatoes, onion and chillies) and the Pani Puri. “It is a whole great experience,” he says, recommending the breakfast, too.Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Apollo Bunder, 400001; +91 22 6665 3285; bit.ly/2X1tP5c

Shree Thaker Bhojanalay
This marvelous and inexpensive vegetarian restaurant is difficult to find. My driver had no clue (But it might become considerably easier soon as chef David Chang and actor Aziz Ansari filmed there recently.) You are served a tray of small Gujarati dishes and freshly made breads. The food is delicious and there are endless refills for about $7. Chef Mohan is a fan: He describes it as Mumbai’s “most decadent thali,” and particularly enjoys the bread and the “ghee-laden, vegetarian cooking.”31 Dadiseth Agiyari Lane, Kalbadevi, 400002; +91 22 2208 8035


Swati Snacks
Some visitors worry about the hygiene of street food in India. Swati takes that food and serves it on bright yellow plates in the cleanest of rooms. You enjoy a number of plates, such as the pani puri, crispy pastry balls that you fill with lentils and tangy sauces. Asma Khan, recently featured on Netflix’s Chef’s Table, is a particular fan of the Bhel Puri (chaat Indian snack.) “It is just incredible,” she says. “I am very fussy. There is a classic amount of chutney-to-crunch ratio and they get it exactly right. But those yellow plates are terrible. The owner must have lost a bet.” (Khan’s London restaurant is Darjeeling Express.) Chef Atul Kochhar of Kanishka restaurant in London is another fan. Chefs Ghai, Mohan and Sethi all name Swati among their favorite restaurants.

The Table
This eclectic restaurant has many fans for its modern global cuisine. “They set a trend to do really, really good continental food,” says Ravinder Bhogal, who recommends zucchini spaghetti with almonds and Parmesan; and boneless chicken wings fashioned into cubes with with a ginger glaze. “I love the atmosphere, too,” she says. (I went recently, after the departure of chef Alex Sanchez to Americano, and enjoyed an heirloom-tomato and grilled-strawberry salad with Belper Knolle cheese, basil and sunflower seeds.)

Trishna
This small restaurant in the Fort area of south Mumbai is arguably the most famous in the city, particularly for its garlic butter crab. “When you mention Bombay to anyone, the restaurant they will talk about is Trishna,” says Karam Sethi, who likes it so much he went into partnership to open a Trishna in London. “It’s the freshest seafood from the Arabian sea cooked simply but full of flavor and punch,” he says. Other chefs agree: “It’s not chi-chi but everyone goes there and you’ll always see someone there you know,” says Ravinder Bhogal, who is a particular fan of the neer dosa.

4,2019-06-04,Britannia,"Probably the worst is factored into the prices of both Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. I could see an additional amount of growth coming in for investors, if they have a horizon of at least one and a half to two years from now, making a good amount of alpha performance in their portfolios, said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


With the RBI revising norms on the exposure framework for banks, restricting it to just about 15% of their eligible capital base, how are you reading into this move for the overall NBFC sector? Do you have any favourites within the NBFC pocket?We continue to read some of the announcements coming in from the RBI and try to understand the implications because one would probably see higher possibilities for some of the quality NBFCs to understand the needs of the borrowers and then lend judiciously. In such a situation, a NBFC like Bajaj Finance definitely remains in the favourite list. It is an expensive one but the fact remains that they have proven themselves in the area of lending judiciously. From that perspective, this company should do comparatively better. 

I am not too sure but I think the favourite within our list also remains in the housing finance space -- both HDFC and Bajaj Housing Finance Company, which is part of Bajaj Finance. They remain relatively stable from the perspective of seeing a growth of 20% to 25% on a CAGR basis. 

We remain selective, we are over-boarding ourselves on to the NBFC story and at the same time, I do believe that there are regulatory measures which are likely to come up and would probably discipline some of the NBFCs at the same time. 

Stay with quality names that could be the mantra.


What exactly are you pencilling in by way of move by MPC on Thursday? The 10-year bond yields are sub 7% now. It seems the bond market is already pricing in a 50 bps rate cut. Is the equity market also working with the same assumption?I guess, 25 bps cut in the equities market is definitely pencilled in and discounted for, The way the FIIs swung into action yesterday and also the view of the bond market makes one think that there is the possibility of a little larger rate cut as well. However, my most important observation would be what are the measures the RBI is taking in order to ensure that the transmission of the interest rate cut happens in the system. 

In the last few attempts in the last two years, we have not seen enough repo rate cut by RBI and that is also not getting transmitted or passed on to the borrowers. So, the key would be to keep an eye on how the transmission takes place on the rate cut side. Should that happen, my gut feel says that in the following three months or so, you should be seeing a strong revival in the economy because the credit offtake would probably start improving from the current levels and that should result into higher amount of growth in the banking and consumption spaces.


Talking about consumption, some of these names like Nestle or Britannia are trading at close to high levels. Are they looking a little too expensive given the current outlook?On one side, you definitely want to buy these companies because probably they have created such a strong brand presence in the minds of the consumers and obviously the size, the distribution reach also suggest that these companies would be more solid on the ground as far as the growth aspect is concerned. 

We assume a growth of around 12 to 15% in these particular businesses on the FMCG side. However, the most important part out here would be that if these valuations have to turn reasonable, then one will have to see how the improvement in liquidity takes place. Currently, to a greater extent higher valuations can also be attributed to larger shareholding that these companies have from their parent side and relatively smaller amount in the market place with shareholders. That is an area which is factored well into the higher amount of earnings outlook. 

We do tell people that if you end up buying these particular companies, at least you are buying two or three years in advance before which, you will not start getting the actual value back into your books. That is a premium that you end up paying. Normally you end up paying a premium for around six months to one year whereas in this FMCG companies’ portfolio, you end up paying a premium of close to around two and a half to three years forward. That is where they become expensive. Yes, a meaningful correction would be a welcome opportunity to buy into quality FMCG names. 


How would you justify yesterday’s move and would you say that one can begin to bottom fish anywhere within autos?
I will keep an eye on two aspects; one a rate cut by the RBI and resultant transmission of this rate cut into the economy which could result into improvement in the demand in the auto space; to begin with, the areas where I feel more comfortable would be commercial vehicles and two-wheelers, largely because of the amount of money getting in the hands of the rural masses. That would probably lead to faster revival in the demand for two-wheelers.

As for commercial vehicles, the growth programme could accelerate going forward due to two reasons; one of course, is the BS-VI related demand generating higher amount of volume for most of the commercial vehicle companies including Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, scrappage policy which is definitely on the cards. Implementation of the same could result into additional demand for the commercial vehicles. 

Not to forget. as the project gets completed, currently many of the infrastructure projects are under completion or maybe advanced stage of completion and we would see higher amount of demand getting generated because of the network of roads, railways, airports and seaports getting connected on the Bharatmala project. All these put together could result in better demand for commercial vehicles. My take is, it could be a good buying opportunity. Probably the worst is factored into the prices of both Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. I could see an additional amount of growth coming in for investors, if they have a horizon of at least one and a half to two years from now, making a good amount of alpha performance in their portfolios."

Group companies have also replied to queries by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on the matter, they said.

The group’s independent directors are said to have accepted the legal view. “We voiced our opinion on the issue and now that it has been legally given a green signal, the subject is closed,” a group director said.

The son of group chairman Nusli Wadia is the managing director of Bombay Burmah and a director of Britannia and other group companies, including National Peroxide and Bombay Dyeing. Independent directors had sought an external legal opinion after the elder Wadia had initially obtained one from top jurist Fali S Nariman, ET reported on May 3.

“Nusli himself suggested that the board could seek an external view to ensure impartiality on the subject,” said a director seeking anonymity.

“This was agreed to by board members. Ness is now extremely repentant about the issue and has promised to be more responsible about his official duties and roles.”

Ness Wadia’s sentence was suspended by the Japanese court for five years.

The group had approached retired Supreme Court chief Justice TS Thakur, who recused himself, it is learnt. It then sought out the retired SC Court justice cited above."

18,2019-06-11,Britannia,"Better to focus on sectors and companies with decent performances and less corporate governance issues, said Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

First on our radar is going to be DHFL. After the part payment over the weekend, the stock already went up by about 7% yesterday, but now they have paid off another Rs 45 crore and they have completed the stake sale in Aadhaar Housing. Is that a big relief and has a big overhang lifted off from the stock?
Given the carnage in certain NBFC names, now that there is a bit of a relief and DHFL has been able to clear off certain amount of dues, it may give them a bit of a pullback but the larger issue in terms of the comfort that a lot of investors may not have towards the entire bunch of stocks is something that would keep them away from investing, just because they have fallen and retail investors in particular, tend to look out for the companies where there is a larger correction.

But given the overhang of uncertainty about how this is going to pan out, the questions on at what price the deal will take place etc would remain. There may be a little bit of a pullback here and there, but in the overall context, we would stay away from companies where there are issues of corporate governance and ALM mismatch. We would definitely not venture into buying any of these companies. 


Do you feel that markets at this point are moving apart? Are markets moving past NBFC concerns or do they continue to be very vulnerable to any news?
It is a broad trend in the market that there are certain pockets where there are issues over liquidity, pledged shares, deal taking longer to fructify etc. These are the ones which are not participating. They are going down whereas a large part of the Nifty, about 35 odd companies out of 50 are pretty much okay. We are at all-time high level. Even if you look at the larger universe of BSE 200, the quarterly performances of 35-36 odd companies show there is an upgrade both in the OPM and earnings picture. 

The takeaway from this entire movement is that there are a few companies and sectors where there is a performance. They are making new highs and it makes more sense to stay with those companies, rather than trying to buy some of these companies where there is an issue and where there is a sharp correction. 

That is something that will continue for a while. Let us stay focussed on the sectors and companies where you are seeing a decent performance with less corporate governance issues.


What do you make of the buying in Britannia yesterday and could one wait it out for lower levels or would you think that all the bad news is now in the price and this is the best that you could get around the Rs 3,000 levels?
What is really happening is that for some of the consumer companies, they have actually not performed for a while because there was a bit of slowdown because of the rural issues etc but what is really playing to their advantage is the fact that the raw material prices, particularly the oil and certain other categories of items, we have seen some kind of a correction. That would lead to a bit of an improvement in the operating profit margin for some of these companies. 

So, there is both a possibility of revival in the rural space over a period of time because of the policy initiatives and the improvement in the margins leading to some kind of buying interest. We have been quite positive on Britannia, Dabur, HUL, Marico and though consumption as a space is showing a bit of weakness, I do not think there is a case for a structural slowdown there. We continue to be buyers in these names from an investment perspective. 


What about tech? Have you been taking a look at the strength that we have been seeing there, especially in TCS? 
Tech has been a performer over the last few months and despite the weakness that we are seeing in the dollar over the last two or three weeks, we have seen that most of the companies, particularly TCS and to some extent Infosys, are doing pretty well. In terms of result expectations, because Infosys disappointed last quarter, there is a feeling that there might be a little bit of range-bound movement there but the overall growth picture for TCS continues to look good and particularly in the digital part, a decent amount of momentum can be expected. Definitely for investors, who are looking for a 12-15% kind of a return with low risk, both TCS and Infosys present a great opportunity. 


How are you approaching pharma because it does not seem to be finding favour in this decline? Do you see a buying opportunity there?
It has been a laggard for a while and most of the companies are not delivering good performance. Sun, Lupin, Cadila, for almost four to five years, have been grappling to resolve their USFDA related issues. Despite the pricing pressure not being there in the US, you do not see any performances come through. It makes more sense to stay away from the sector. If one has to really buy, then may be a Cipla could be a good bet but in the current scenario, I would not venture out to buy aggressively into pharma names."

23,2019-06-17,Britannia,"Anything related to consumption which could be services, which could be food, which could be items of daily consumption that will see significant increases and the companies which can capture that markets will do well in the next 10 years, says Sandip Sabharwal, founder, asksandipsabharwal.com, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


Just conceptually, where do you think money can be made in the next 10 years?Conceptually, if we were in some other country where innovation got listed on the stock markets, then we would be playing for technologies which could change people lives. But those are more available in markets like the US or possibly Israel. In the Indian context, if we look at the way the GDP will shape out, it has to be consumption. Anything related to consumption which could be services which could be food, which could be items of daily consumption are where, there will be significant increases and the companies which can capture that markets will do well.


 Two consumption stories that you have liked for a while now are PVR and Britannia. If someone is looking at investing for the next 10 years, do you believe these businesses will make you those fabulous returns as they have in the last 10 years?I remember, I used to work with SBI mutual fund and that was the first time any fund actually bought into PVR. I do not know how many splits the stock had but the stock used to be Rs 120-130 at that time. It was the first time we bought into it because the view was that the business is going to be a hugely scalable and the management knows what it is doing. In between they had some hits and misses. They went into movie production where they lost some money. They got out so they have done all those kind of things also. 

But then without taking too much capital out of the business, I think the entire entertainment business will continue to do well, even on the consumption side. You have to look at companies which have got products which more and more people will consume and they can come out with newer products which fall into in the consumption basket of the new millenniums. To that extent, Britannia will continue to do well. All these companies will continue to do very well.

They might not generate the kind of returns they have done over the last 10 years but once you come into the blue-chip category, then the return expectations come down because the risk category also comes down.


You constantly said that even though you are bullish on the long term story and are looking at growth picking up, in the near term, we have been tracking cautiousness in the markets. How concerned are you?If you look at what is leading to this cautiousness or the market not doing well subsequent to the elections, we are almost exactly at the same levels where we closed on the election day. It was mainly because of factors which have no long-term fundamental impact which could be the DHFL crisis, the problems in ADAG Group, rumours around the Indiabulls Group and Yes Bank. But all those things will eventually not have such a great impact. 

Overall India seems to be well positioned for economic revival and the government will obviously take a lot of initiatives and there will be a supportive monetary policy. Things will play out. The consumption companies in December said that growth is going to be very strong and then suddenly it dipped and by the time they realised, the dip was already there. Similarly, once the revival starts, by the time the companies start talking about it, it will be two-three months into the revival. So, that will happen over the next two-three months."

25,2019-06-17,Britannia,"The biggest mistake we make is looking for the next fad sector. These sectors come up from time to time and make money but never write off the bread and butter space because that is something that cannot be disrupted easily, said Bharat Iyer, Head, India Equity Research, JPMorgan India, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Let us talk about the last 10 days and the next 10 days. The markets are worried about Yes Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Dewan Housing. These stocks do not even represent 5-7% of the market cap but are occupying 90% of the mind space. Why is that?The key concern of the market is whether there will be collateral damage because of contagion and that is what the market is choosing to focus on right now.


Is that a good idea?It is valid. The market should always be worried. Is the concern completely valid and should one be taking one’s eyes away from everything else that is happening on the positive side? No I do not agree with that. But yes, the market should be cognisant of these risks.


A year from now, would June 2019 be remembered by long-term investors as a month which gave great entry points in some private banks and NBFCs or as a month when those who were able to understand risk and were cognisant of global new trade war, turned bearish and got it right? There is obviously going to be many moving parts but if we were to look at it purely from an India perspective, it is a great time to be looking at the broad market. I still remain constructive and there is upside. One can make about 10% to 12% on an annualised basis. One does not know about the unique opportunities. It depends on how managements deal with them.


But in the near term, there are so many economic challenges. Apart from the distressed assets and the business groups that we are looking at, do you also feel the structural challenges are a big concern right now? Should one expect the government to make some key reforms that could help to ease the way?There are three aspects when one is looking at the economy. There are some segments of the economy which are facing distress, particularly the farm sector and the rural sector. I guess you need to seek that out and that requires structural reforms and market reforms be it labour, land, etc.


 Is there a deeper issue here than what we talk about?There is a deeper issue here because this is a malice that has been going on for a long time. You have a segment which has sub-optimal economies of scale and you have not seen sufficient investment going into that. It is one segment where I would focus on what requires structural initiatives. Apart from that, there are some cyclical problems that is basically because you always have the economy slowing in the run-up to an election and picking up subsequently and then there are some unique situations. 

I see a lot of people looking at the broad economy through the prism of the auto sector and saying that because the auto sector is slowing, the entire economy is in shambles. We completely disagree with that. We have articulated this is in the past that this is a segment that is seeing a very substantial price increase because of various factors in a compressed timeframe and one should not be looking at the entire economy. I guess the structural part needs attention. The cyclical part will take care of itself.


So as an investor, what do you do? Do you cut the noise and say that let us buy this scepticism in the market or would you say that hang on? The four-five stocks which have led the Nifty up they are pricing in the best.The way I would look at it is that valuations are not cheap. We are trading at almost 20 times forward earnings. I do not think valuation is going to do the hard work for you from here onwards. I guess you will have to focus on sectors and stocks which will deliver earnings growth. But for stocks and sectors which deliver earnings growth, I still see upside.


Those stocks and sectors will come from the Nifty names. Would they come from the broader markets which have been beaten down?If you look at Nifty itself, banks will still do very well in an environment like this. You have meaningful tailwinds -- be it a pickup in credit growth, peaking of credit cost or supportive policy. Sectors which are beneficiaries of the government’s infrastructure thrust will do well. Utilities will do well, cement will do well and steel will do well. There are quite a few areas which should continue to do well.


Economy growth depends on consumption and investment. Consumption could go through a bad patch. It will come back. But consumption stocks are expensive. There is a problem with the investment cycle. Corporates which have balance sheet strength, are levered and corporates which do not have balance sheet strength, want to invest but do not have the ability to invest. How will things get sorted out?I guess initially the heavy lifting will have to be done by the government. 


How can they do that because is fiscal deficit a problem for them?There are fiscal issues but this is where you need them to be innovative. You need them to raise resources through divestment, sale of assets, etc., and you need them to get the economy going because as you rightly pointed out, the private sector is not going to invest in a hurry. That said, I would not completely write off private sector investments because utilisation levels even for the manufacturing sector on the private side, have been creeping up gradually. We are now in the 75-80% band and the minute you see it going past 80%, people will start looking at investments because it takes a couple of years for new projects to start delivering.


You have always shared this wonderful example with us which is when demand comes back, it will surprise everyone. So demand will come back. It is nature. It is cyclical. Particularly given our demographics.


Exactly, demand is large. How would you maximise on a demand recovery? Would you buy banks, industrials, cyclicals?Banks and infrastructure is where a lot of the juice is because as you rightly pointed out, we do not write off consumption. But we should stop looking at consumption purely through the prism of the auto sector. There are parts which are doing very well and one cannot write it off given the demographics and the urbanisation trend. 

That said, as you pointed out, valuations are a tad demanding and you got to be selective there. But if you look at the banks, particularly the non-private sector retail oriented banks and stocks in terms of the infrastructure segment, a lot of them are trading at multi-year lows in terms of valuations. They may have given you a little bit of price performance over the last six months or so, but I still think there is a lot of value there.


Is your view on auto still moderate or would you be bearish?We have been underweight auto for some time now and we will continue for a period of time because between September last year and March next year, you have a 20% increase in the selling price of a vehicle because of increased insurance cost, increased safety norms, improved emission norms and this was a sector that was already in mid to late cycle. In that cycle, if you have such a heavy burden in terms of price increases, the sector is going to take 18 to 24 months.


Where in the consumption basket do you still see scope?There is a lot of value in the new age consumption spaces, particularly in services and here I include things like insurance, financial services, aviation and jewellery. There are lots of areas where there is good growth happening.


In last 10 years if you would have bought NBFCs? 20 years ago, if you bought an HDFC or for that matter a Kotak Bank, can you retire at 40 or 50? In next 10 years, will the same stocks make money?They may make money, let us not write them off. Some of the private sector banks have been compounding for 25 years now. Some of the consumer names have been compounding for 40-50 years now.


They may be compounders but there has to be something else which can give you better compounding in next 10 years?The biggest mistake we make is looking for the next fad sector. These sectors come up from time to time and make money but never write off the bread and butter space because that is something that cannot be disrupted easily.


So next 10 years, should one put in more money in HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance?The biggest theme in markets right now is that many areas are being disrupted because of technology and forget sectors, what you want to really see is companies which can be at the forefront of this disruption. People are still going to need banking and financial services products, people are still going to need consumption products. It is not about the sector not doing well. You will need company managements which can see through the rate of change and be the disruptors themselves.


That is exactly my point you know because in China, you swipe a card for everything and that card holds everything, your identity, banking and what have you. Can our banks transition along with those around the globe?A lot of Indian companies are actually doing a great job. Some of the leading private sector banks or NBFCs are doing a great job in terms of using digital, using data and doing an excellent job in terms of disrupting the markets themselves. They use data very well. They have access to the best technology. Some of them are doing a very good job.


Where else, apart from financials do you see the leadership coming in from on the index a Reliance, an L&T, what is it?If I were to look at the next two to three years, the sectors linked to infrastructure, particularly the government’s priority areas, is where I see a fair bit of money being made because the government is committed to investing substantive amounts we have seen the manifesto. There is a commitment to making available the resources and we have already seen it in some areas right. 

Look at the last five years, look at the progress on roads. No one would have thought of this kind of activity happening there. If they get four or five areas right, any and every segment that caters to the should do very well. 


In those pockets, do you see higher returns -- more than 10-12% annualised?You can make about 12% to 15% or even higher effects in a smaller company because the leverage tends to be very high, both operating as well as financial.


If I take the index 10 years back, the face of the index was different and that is how natural progression happens. The index changes, it changes colours, components and right now -- financial services or banks or banks plus NBFC plus financial services -- account for 35% to 40%. How would the face of Nifty be after 10 years?Do not be surprised if financial services continue to account for about 30%. We are in emerging markets with a long way to go in terms of our revolution but within the composition of financials, there could be meaningful changes. You could see insurance having a bigger weight; you could have wealth managers having a bigger weight; you could have the services coming to the fore and at the expense of conventional banking. 

Areas where we are underrepresented as a market is consumption. You have very few companies out there and you will have a lot of new age services coming in areas like aviation or hotels or insurance. 

The other thing to watch out for is technology because we have very few internet-related companies in the indices, whereas globally they typically tend to be a large part and that is one area where you would want policy makers to be a little more proactive. 

All these companies have grown largely through private equity capital and you do not want the next stage for them to be to go and list overseas in some exchange. You want the listing to be captured here so that Indian investors can participate in their growth.


The last 10 years have been about creation of Amazon, Facebook, Instagram. Back home, it has been Patanjali, Titan, Britannia has only grown further, Parle-G the glucose biscuit is there but you graduated from that. Brand-wise, within consumption, do you see that big disruption coming there?The internet space is very interesting. What is going to happen is a lot of companies were basically surviving because they had a very good distribution moat around them and these companies are going to disrupt that moat. I guess, a lot of value is going to be discovered here and which is the reason this is one area, where Indian entrepreneurs have done very well. 


 In the times of internet, distribution can happen?It is not about the distribution mode being important anymore. Now we are back to having product, having flexibility on product and having a brand.


Are you surprised that the IT index is up 3x in 10 years? Why has everybody gone wrong in predicting IT?I do not think anyone has gone wrong, Basically what happened was IT was the poster boy of the previous bull market and the return expectations were very high from this sector. There was this natural bias, saying that they have done well, but can they continue to do as well?

They have not done as well in terms of even the period between 1996 and 2009. But I guess the returns over the last 10 years have been driven largely by valuations because of easy money that was put out by central banks in developed markets. 

In best performing stocks, a bulk of return came because of valuation rerating, not necessarily because of earnings growth. In the next 10 years, what you need is earnings growth because valuations for most asset classes including equities across the world are trading at very meaningful premia to their long term averages. Here onwards, it is very difficult to call for more rerating in valuations.


In the next 10 years are we in for a gut wrenching fall -- a fall which the Ray Dalios and the Howard Marks of the world have been warning for the last three years? Are we in for a repeat of 2008? If not this year, next year?
I do not know if you are in for a repeat of the 2008 because every crisis has its own characteristic which is quite different from the prior one. But could there be a fall in equity markets sometime between 2020 and 2022? Given the increasing calls for a recession sometime in that timeframe, I would not rule it out and I would be prepared for it.


But if everybody is prepared and if folks like you are officially using the word recession in their communication, it is like saying that markets are secretly getting prepared for it?
Not necessarily. What happens is money has been flowing into equities very consistently over the last three or four years and what you really need to see is money being pulled back. When you see capitulation, that is when markets actually start falling off. I do not have the competence nor am I calling for a recession but one increasingly keeps hearing about the possibility of it and which is the reason I would be careful over a two-year period. If what we hear pans out, one needs to be prepared for it.


Here in India, how much more of a room for a rate cut is there?There is room another 25 to 50 bps cut. Inflation is remarkably well behaved and I guess and there are limitations in terms of easing fiscal policy further. Perhaps monetary policy has to do a bit of the heavy lifting and there is scope for 25 to 50 bps cut."

-Warren Buffett
This pearl of wisdom, by extension, means the best time is to invest stocks was several years ago and the second-best is today. That, even when the market is looking all bleak and depressing.

On Monday, as business news channel ETNOW celebrated 10 years of its existence, some of India’s top stock pickers liked Basant Maheshwari, Porinju Veliyath, Vijay Kedia, Sandip Sabharwal, Samit Vartak and others named one stock each for a ‘Power of 10’ portfolio.

These stocks, they say, can deliver fabulous return to investors over next 10 years. The list included diverse stocks right from the consumption sector to a life insurance company. 

Sandip Sabharwal of asksandipsabharwal recommended Britannia. “On the consumption side, you have to look at companies that have got products which more and more people will consume. Plus, these company can also come out with new products that can fit into the consumption basket of the new millennium. In this segment, I think Britannia will continue to do well,” he told ETNOW. 

Shares of Britannia Industries have rallied 1,791 per cent in last 10 years to trade at Rs 2,959.70 on June 14, 2019 from Rs 156.50 on June 12, 2009. However, the scrip is down 1 per cent for past one year. On Monday, the stock had 7 ‘buy’, 11 ‘outperform’, 9 ‘hold’, 6 ‘underperform’ and 1 ‘sell’ ratings, according to Reuters.

Basant Maheshwari, Co-founder of Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisors and Vinay Khattar, Head, Edelweiss Investment Research, both recommended Titan for the long term.


#PowerOf10 | Find out why these 10 market gurus are betting on these 10 stocks- Power of 10. Coming Soon... https://t.co/0qEKFth8Tj&mdash; ET NOW (@ETNOWlive) 1560743176000
Shares of the jeweller-to-watch maker have jumped over 2,000 per cent in last 10 years and 250 per cent in last three. Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his wife together held over 7 per cent stake in the company as of March 31, 2019. 

Brokerage firm Stewart & Mackertich believes Titan deserves higher valuation due to the visibility of double-digit top-line growth in the largecap FMCG/retail space and Ebitda margin expansion backed by high SSSG contribution, an increase in exchange sales, increasing demand for high margin studded jewellery and sustained ROE and ROCE improvement from 25 per cent and 23 per cent in FY19 to 27 per cent and 26 per cent in FY21, respectively.

Samit Vartak, Partner, SageOne Investment, is bullish on Edelweiss Financial Services, while Kochi-based investor Porinju Veliyath, founder Equity Intelligence, recommended Tata Global Beverages.

Shares of Tata Global and Edelweiss Financial Services have rallied 225 per cent and 275 per cent, respectively, in last 10 years. The stocks are, however, down up to 44 per cent in last one year.

Tata Global Beverages is aspiring to be a consumer products company and looking to gain scale by adding more products to its portfolio. 

“In the FMCG segment, we need a large portfolio. We cannot just be a single tea player and depend on it to attain scale. Tea, water are good, but they are not going to give scale. The company has to gain scale by a wide range of products,” TGBL Chairman N Chandrasekaran told shareholders at the company’s recent annual general meeting.

Vijay Kedia of Kedia Securities suggested Repro India, Rakesh Arora of Go India Advisors picked Grasim Industries and Atul Suri of Marathon Trends-PMS named HDFC Life. Grasim Industries advanced 90 per cent in last 10 years, but is down 13 per cent in last one year.

HDFC Life Insurance reported a 5 per cent rise in March quarter profit with healthy growth in premium income. The company’s net profit for March quarter increased 4.90 per cent to Rs 364.01 crore from Rs 346.84 crore in the same period a year ago.

Repro India is a provider of content, print and fulfilment solutions. It is engaged in printing of magazines and other periodicals, books and brochures, maps, atlases, posters and others. The company posted 17.55 per cent YoY dip in Q4 net profit on a 21 per cent YoY rise in net sales.

Pankaj Murarka, Founder, Renaissance Investment Managers, is bullish on Syngene, while Manish Sonthalia, Associate Director and Head Portfolio Management Services, Motilal Oswal Asset Management recommended DCB Bank.

DCB Bank has delivered 30 per cent return to investors in the last one year and 485 per cent in past 10 years.

		}Stock recommendations for the coming week of 6NextPrevPlay SlideshowWeekly recommendations  16 Jun, 2019Dalal Street continued to trade on a sluggish note last week as higher valuations weighed on the market amid lack of triggers. Analysts say investors will struggle to figure out a strategy to play. Milan Vaishnav picked the following stocks based on their technical charts, which can potentially help investors make the most of this lacklustre market.NextMaruti |Sell | Target : Rs 655016 Jun, 2019The stock is presently in a descending triangle formation which has resulted out of the structure of a similar bottom in the range of 6480-6500 and with sharply falling tops. The daily MACD is in continuing sell mode. The price has slipped below its 50 and 100DMA which is bearish. The RSI has marked a fresh 14-period low. The weekly RSI, too, is seen making lower highs upon visual inspection. The levels of 6950 should be used as a stop-loss.NextBEML | Sell | Target: Rs 82016 Jun, 2019This stock has shown a couple of signs which point towards possible weakness over the coming days. After failing to clear a double top resistance, the stock retracted. It breached its 50-DMA and presently sits on its 100- DMA. The RS line against the broader CNX500 index is seen inching lower and has also fallen below its 50-DMA. The daily MACD remains in continuing sell mode. On the weekly charts, the weekly RSI has shown a bearish divergence against the price, and it is seen making lower tops. A fresh sell signal also emerged on the weekly Stochastic. Any close above 1025 should be used as a stop-loss.NextNCC | Buy | Target: Rs 10816 Jun, 2019The stock suffered a sharp set back due to negative news flow over previous days. It has taken support over its multi-month upward rising trend line which also coincides with the 200-DMA, and another multiple pattern supports. The daily MACD is about to show a positive crossover over the coming days. The daily Stochastic remains negative. The stock moved past the levels of 100 and as per the options data, if it stays above 100, it can potentially test 105 and 108 levels. Any close below 95 should be treated as a strict stop-loss.
Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services. NextSBIN | Sell | Target: Rs 328 16 Jun, 2019The stock cleared its significant double top resistance that was formed in the 326-334 range and tested highs near 364 levels. However, it witnessed some corrective moves after that. Based on a couple of signals that have emerged, the stock may see some weakness and may complete its throwback. The stock has slipped below its short term 20-DMA, and this can infuse some short term weakness. The daily MACD stays in continuing sell mode. The RSI remains neutral against the price, but it is seen marking lower tops. Similar formation in RSI is also observed on the weekly charts. Any close above 355 should be used as a stop-loss. Next"
29,2019-06-18,Britannia,"Avanti Feeds was a microcap company in a niche business in 2009, but the stock traded at Rs 1.30. Investors who spotted the potential and invested Rs 1,00,000 in this stock back in June, 2009 would be sitting at a cool sum of Rs 2.70 crore this June.

The stock has delivered nearly 270 times return to investors in these 10 years, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 75 per cent.

“The stock changed life for many investors and liberated them early. I was fortunate to be one of them,” says Soumya Malani, a young Kolkata-based investor, who made 71 times return on the stock. 

Last year, the company faced double whammy of a spike in input cost and softening output prices, which squeezed margins.

“Things seem to have stabilised now and better numbers are expected from here on. It is a phenomenal company with one of the best pedigrees in place,” Malani said.

There are many stocks like Avanti Feeds that have delivered multibagger returns to investors even when the market navigated many headwinds amid intermittent bull runs.

NBFC major Bajaj Finance is another such stock. Had you invested Rs 1,00,000 on this counter in June 12, 2009, it would have become Rs 2.33 crore today, growing at a CAGR of 72 per cent annually. A similar investment in cooler maker Symphony would have become Rs 2.11 crore. 

While past performance does not guarantee future returns on Dalal Street, brokerages say there is more steam left in these stocks. 

Edelweiss Professional Investor Research is bullish on Avanti Feeds with a price target of Rs 480. The scrip traded at Rs 335 on Tuesday. The company saw substantial improvement in bottomline during FY2009-2018 and posted Rs 465.40 crore profit for FY2018 against a net loss of Rs 7 crore in FY2009. In FY19, the profit figure swelled to Rs 306 crore, but it was down 34 per cent YoY.

“Avanti reported weak numbers for FY19 mainly because of a crash in global shrimp prices and farm gate prices, as farmers moved away from aquaculture, impacting demand for feed. However, the processing business is doing well and seeing healthy growth,” Edelweiss said in a report.

Bajaj Finance is among the alpha pick of Indiabulls Ventures with a price target of Rs 4,000. A subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance has transformed itself from a captive auto loan provider for Bajaj Auto to one of the most successful and diversified NBFCs.

It had leadership position in the consumer durables segment with a large customer franchise of 34.48 million and loan cross-sell franchise of 20.67 million as on FY19.

“Bajaj Finance has constantly grown its market share even in challenging times. It has a track record of maintaining healthy financials and sound returns ratio. We believe the company will be able to grow at a CAGR of 40 per cent on the bottom-line over next two years,” Indiabulls Ventures said in a report.

Symphony is one of the largest players in the air cooler market with an organised market share of around 48 per cent. In order to explore new opportunities in the industrial and residential cooling segment, the company has made acquisitions in different geographies including Mexico, China and Australia.

At present, India business contributes around 57 per cent to the topline while the rest of the world brings in 43 per cent. ICICIdirect.com is bullish on Symphony with a price target of Rs 1,530. “With rising temperature in a major parts of the country coupled with low dealer-level inventory, Symphony is likely to record robust performance in the FY20E. With a lower base and revival in air cooler demand, we model standalone volume CAGR of around 18 per cent in FY19-21E and topline growth of 20 per cent during this period,” the brokerage said.

Two other companies that turned investors millionaires are Relaxo Footwear and plastic products maker Astral Poly Technik. Both stocks rallied over 1,000 per cent in last 10 years. 

Relaxo Footwears surged to Rs 825.80 as of June 14, 2019 from Rs 5.10 on June 12, 2009. Astral Poly Technik has risen to Rs 1,350 from Rs 11.40.

Brokerage Anand Rathi Financial Services likes Astral for its consistent focus on growth and profitability, supported by innovative product launches, vigorous brand-building and successful product diversification.

With over 50 times rally, La Opala RG, Ajanta Pharma, Vinati Organics, Atul Ltd, Eicher Motors, TTK Prestige and Cera Sanitaryware have been some of the other top wealth creators from the BSE500 index in last 10 years.

Domestic equity benchmark Sensex has rallied over 150 per cent since June 2009.

The pecking order will surely change for next 10 years and Dalal Street will throw up a new set of wealth creators.

Malani says what can possibly help spot potential wealth creators early are a combination of visionary management and a business with scalability, pricing power, tailwinds, high growth, higher incremental ROCE, low equity, under ownership and leadership in a niche areas.

On its 10th birthday this Monday, business news channel ETNOW invited 10 renowned stock pickers from Dalal Street – including Basant Maheshwari, Porinju Veliyath, Vijay Kedia, Sandip Sabharwal and Manish Sonthalia – to build a Power Portfolio of 10 stocks for next 10 years. They picked Titan, Britannia, Tata Global Beverages, Repro India, Britannia and DCB Bank, Edelweiss Financial Services, HDFC Life and Syngene, among others."

27,2019-06-18,Britannia,"LONDON: The International Cricket Council has quashed all claims that brands and sponsors of the on-going cricket world cup in England are unhappy with the washed out games due to the rains.

ICC's general manager-commercial Campbell Jamieson said all the feedback which the global cricket governing body is getting from the brands with which it has partnered is that they are satisfied with what’s taken place so far. “The brands are happy about the reach and engagement with audiences of the world cup so that explains,” he said, addressing agroup of journalists at Nottingham.

There have been reports that several brands, which are either sponsoring the event or associated with it as advertisers, are unhappy with four cricket matches getting abandoned due to rains and couple of them getting curtailed. This includes the India versus New Zealand game which was called-off, while even Sunday’s high-stake India versus Pakistan game had curtailed overs due to rains at Manchester.


The India-New Zealand match in Nottingham on June 13 was called off due to rain
Brands such as Bira, Coca-Cola, MRF Tyres, Uber, Oppo and Britannia are ICC’s commercial partners for the world cup, while several others are running special promotions and advertisements around the event in the country with several hundred crores of marketing spent getting invested. The wash-out games have also been criticised on social media.

Jamieson said ICC never ever had reserve days in any cricket tournament except for the knock out finals. “Historically, not more than two games have been washed out in any cricket World Cup. If we were to have reserve days for every game, it will extend the event by probably another one month,” he said.

However, a senior official with a leading brand associated with the World Cup said while the company has taken a long-term view of the tournament, still it is a potential hit on the return on investment if high eye-ball games like those of India get washed out or curtailed.

35,2019-06-20,Britannia,"Nifty50 will remain in the range of plus-minus 300 points, as largecap companies are still on their feet and not showing any sign of correction, says Yogesh Mehta of Motilal Oswal Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 


ET Now: Overall market sentiment continues to be cautious. What would be your strategy in this market and what are you looking at in the near term ?


Yogesh Mehta: We have already corrected by almost 3.5% from the all time high scaled on 3rd June. The GDP numbers which are being revised by Fitch Rating and even RBI rate cut for the third straight time shows some cautious stance ahead for the rest part of 2019. And the Fed move which is now likely to have 25-50 bps rate cut in the later part of the calendar year, together with the slowdown in FIIs and automobile, consumption and the NBFC haunting does not paint a rosy picture.

Markets are likely to be cautious on the higher side but on the lower side, we do not foresee much negative trigger that market will crash. So the Nifty50 will remain in the range of almost plus minus 300 points because large cap companies are still holding on to their feet and not showing any sign of correction. We will have Budget in the first week of July so that may set the tone for the market going ahead.


ET Now: There has been a clear sense of the market sticking to some key names or defensive plays such as for TCS, ICICI or ITC. The market seems to be just holding on to a basket there. What else are you looking at even within the heavyweights?


Yogesh Mehta: Tech Mahindra can be looked at from here on as it looks very sound. Apart from ICICI Bank, RBL Bank would be the one where a significant correction has happened and therefore it looks promising with 30-35% growth rate in AUM for FY20 as well as FY21. This provides a good opportunity again at 2.6-2.7 times price to book. 

Even Titan, where the commentary from the management hints at a 20% growth rate in the jewellery segment as well as the overall revenue, gives confidence to the investors. This could be a good opportunity to lap up the stock though no correction has happened there. In the consumer segment, Hindustan Unilever or Britannia will be the two names one can clearly look at for the next six to 12 months. In the short term, Hindustan Unilever would be a better opportunity because the volume growth around 8-9% and higher ROEs will take care of the growth rate.


ET Now: As a house, Motilal Oswal always has been a fan of telecom. Is this a good time to revisit Bharti Airtel, because whatever could go wrong perhaps has gone wrong?

Yogesh Mehta: Yes, definitely. We like Bharti per se on the telecom side and now the ARPU has fallen to almost average of Rs 119 to 130 range from all time highs and this shows that the bottom is now in nearby vicinity because the tariff war with Jio may come to end by say next two-three months because they are also having an ARPU of around the same level. 

Secondly, the 5G auction which is taking place will be on the lower price tariff and that will be a positive for them. 

Third, the Africa IPO which has taken place, though it is at a 15-30% discount to the estimated price, it will take care of the good transition and balance sheet would be in better shape. And we believe that the data is taking over voice since the last two years and Bharti will continue to penetrate more. 


ET Now: In June, which has been the most popular trade at Motilal Oswal Private Advisory Group on the long side or on the short side. Which is the one stock where activity has been the highest?


Yogesh Mehta: The activity been the highest in three top rated stocks -- ICICI Bank, Axis Bank Bajaj Finance. These are the names where the highest comfort level was there during the June month even when the market was at all-time high and even the market has corrected.


ET Now: Three stocks where your firm has just been executing sell orders?


Yogesh Mehta: Sell orders were partially for booking profits into auto names where we were not so comfortable with the ongoing numbers one to three months down the line. So auto was majorly on the selling side with two wheelers as well as the four wheelers names. Apart from that, it was select NBFCs companies where we were not comfortable because of the slowdown and NBFC crunch, apart from Bajaj Finance. L&T Housing Finance was on the top side of the short side and we were booking profits on some of the pharma names as well.


ET Now: Would you have a view on metals? Are they a good investment proposition now?


Yogesh Mehta: Metals have always been cyclical, so we never like it as an investment proposition. The trade war is again hurting them on the production side or the capacity they are running like in the like European region or may be on the US side. So all this arbitrage opportunity for JSW Steel is now on the negative side so it is slowing down. Even Hindalco, the ramp-up of other minings are now on a slower side and the demand is not picking much. Tata Steel in the European region because of the Brexit is also facing issues, which does not give much of a comfort level to us on the metal side. I would not suggest anything on the investment for metals from here."

32,2019-06-20,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Around 343 stocks fell to touch their 52-week lows on NSE in Thursday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows were Aban Offshore, Artemis Global Life, Amara Raja Batteries, Andhra Bank, Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Bayer Cropscience, Bosch, CEAT and Central Bank of India. 

DHFL, Emami, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, HEG, Hindustan Zinc, Indiabulls Integrated Services, Jet Airways, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Muthoot Capital Services, Piramal Enterprises, TV Today Network and Yes Bank also featured among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows on NSE.

33,2019-06-20,Britannia,"Every major correction in the stock market throws up opportunities for investors. BSE benchmark Sensex is down 3 per cent from its all-time high of 40,312, scaled on June 4, 2019, while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices are down up to 30 per cent from their respective high points hit in January, 2018.

More than 85 per cent of stocks on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) have eroded investors’ wealth since January 2018.

This year, the market is trading widely polarised: the best performer of the Nifty500 index, Aavas Financiers, is up 74 per cent year to date, while the worst performer, Reliance Communications, is down 90 per cent.

That being the case, it would be tough to decide if you had Rs 1 lakh to invest today. Beyond equities, NCDs and debt funds are looking risky but yields on select debentures have risen sharply, while gold has just had a good run and is in pause mode though analysts say it is only a matter of time before it starts the next big leap.

“If you have to invest the corpus for the near term (say, three years), then the asset allocation can be 65 per cent in debt, 30 per cent in equities, 5 per cent in gold. But if the investment is for the long term (over 3 years), then the asset mix can be 60 per cent in equities and 40 per cent in debt,” said Jharna Agarwal, Head of Products, Anand Rathi Preferred.

Be it equity, debt, real estate and commodities, asset classes go through their own return cycles and bull or bear phases. That is why it is of paramount importance to maintain proper asset allocation and have a diversified portfolio.

Meanwhile, the younger one is, the better placed she is to go for a risky bet. “A young investor with no financial responsibilities, no debt and low on capital can pour 70-80 per cent of the corpus in equities (smallcaps and midcaps), 10-20 per cent in gold and the remaining in debt instruments,” says Anshul Saigal, Portfolio Manager & Head- PMS, Kotak Mahindra AMC.

Besides age, it also depends on other factors such as financial status, leverage and time horizon of investment, he said.

Each asset class has different risk-reward matrix. For instance, bank fixed deposit is for capital preservation where the ultimate goal is to maintain its real value, ensuring that the return matches inflation. Whereas an asset class like equities is for increasing the real value by earning returns much above the rate of inflation. But that is possible if one is ready to take risks.

Analysts say one should invest in complementary instruments to build an all-weather portfolio.

“The 100 minus age thumb rule always works,” says Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.

That rule says what portion of a corpus should go into equity should be calculated by deducting one’s age from the number 100. And, 60 per cent of remaining amount should go into bond or debt funds and the rest to commodities.

For Nadeem, Titan and SBI should be a part of any investor’s equity portfolio for next five years.

Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and CEO, Trading Bells, recommended Pidilite Industries, Havells, Axis Bank and PVR for next five years.

This Monday, its 10th birthday, business news channel ETNOW invited 10 renowned stock pickers from Dalal Street – including Basant Maheshwari, Porinju Veliyath, Vijay Kedia, Sandip Sabharwal and Manish Sonthalia – to build a Power Portfolio of 10 stocks for next 10 years.

They picked Titan, Britannia, Tata Global Beverages, Repro India, Britannia and DCB Bank, Edelweiss Financial Services, HDFC Life and Syngene for long-term play."
37,2019-06-21,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Good image is fetching a premium in Indian stock market this season.

As Dalal Street struggles to separate the chaff from the grains amid widespread corporate governance issues and crippling rating downgrades at reputed corporate groups, MNC firms and some small foreign promoter-backed stocks are seeing an extended good run. A few of them have rallied as much as 74 per cent year to date.

MNCs and foreign promoter-backed firms are traditionally known for strong parentage, technological proficiency and asset-light business models. They are usually well-capitalised, have low debt exposures and good dividend policies. 

While half the NBFCs are down in the dumps amid debt and liquidity challenges, foreign promoter-backed players Aavas Financiers (up 72 per cent) and CreditAccess Grameen (up 52 per cent) have kept on rallying to be counted among the best performers of the market this year.

Aavas Financiers is backed by private equity players Lake District and Partners Group, while CreditAccess is promoted by Netherlands-based CreditAccess Asia.

Shares of Black Rose Industries, where foreign ownership stood at 74.5 per cent as of March 31, are up 41 per cent year to date. This company deals in chemicals, textiles and owns India’s first acrylamide manufacturing plant.

Among other foreign promoter-backed companies, Hexaware Technologies, Xchanging Solutions and Sobha are all having a dream run on the bourses.

Among Indian arms of MNCs, Astrazeneca Pharma is up 31 per cent this year. Huhtamaki PPL, Procter & Gamble Health, Bata India, Heidelberg Cement India and Siemens have gained 20-30 per cent. Others such as Esab India, ABB India, Timken India, Honeywell Automation India, Abbott India and Pfizer are up 10-17 per cent. This compares with a 5-7 per cent slump in BSE Midcap and the BSE Smallcap indices during the same period.

Many of these stocks have delivered multibagger returns in last three years, while the later half of this period was quite a harsh for the broader market.

“MNC stocks, including those in consumer and NBFC segments, have been seeing a rerating over the past 2-3 years even though many of them were neither seeing either strong volume or earnings growth. If you map price multiples to actual earnings growth, you will see many MNCs got much better rerating of price multiples despite having slower earnings growth,” said Raunak Onkar, Head of Research at PPFAS.

While Aavas and CreditAccess are recent debutants, shares of Black Rose Industries have risen 244 per cent in last three years, 1,075 per cent in five and 2,950 per cent in last 10 years. Astrazeneca has doubled investor wealth in last two years, having risen 73 per cent in three years. 

In all, 14 of the 139-odd BSE-listed MNCs have delivered 100-500 per cent returns in three years. As many as 36 stocks have rallied over 50 per cent during the period.


Not-so-transparent
Onkar said MNCs might have lesser corporate governance issues, but they are not as transparent as perceived.

“Most MNCs do not even hold conference calls or analyst meetings. They only have AGMs. Analysts can’t access the managements. Very few of them offer public disclosures with quality that matches those of their domestic counterparts. But somehow the market believes these companies are better governed than their local counterparts,” he said. 


Consistent performers, high on valuations
Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities said brand and technology leaders in consumer staples, discretionary, chemicals and industrials have consistently outperformed within the MNC space. These benefits, he said, have translated into high RoE, low leverage and better asset turnover. 

That said, high valuations and slowdown in earnings growth have hit quite a few stocks. 

To name a few, largecap MNC stocks such as Hindustan Unilever (flat), Maruti Suzuki (down 14 per cent), Nestle India (up 5 per cent), Britannia Industries (down 8 per cent), Vedanta (down 17 per cent) and Bosch (down 17 per cent) have taken a hit in recent times. 

Jasani said while none of the MNCs are available at cheap or fair valuations, one should watch this space for sudden selloffs which is when they would offer good entry points.


Top picks
Antique Stock Broking prefers stocks that rank high on quality quotient, have made FY19- 21 earnings growth projections in the upwards of 15 per cent and command reasonable valuations on the bourses.

“Among the 15 largecap MNC stocks we cover, staples rank high on quality parameter. Industrials are another set of stocks which meet all parameters given the likely recovery in investment cycle. Stocks that meet all the three parameters include HUL, Nestle India, Bosch, Colgate, Siemens, ABB India, P&G Hygiene, Gillette India, Honeywell Automation, Glaxosmithkline Pharma and Cummins,” the brokerage said.

In the midcap space, Antique likes Bata, Whirlpool, Abbott India, Pfizer, Wabco India, SKF India and Thomas Cook. Grindwell Norton, Timken India, Johnson Controls, Linde, Federal Mogul, GE T&D, ICRA and Kennametal are smallcap MNCs the brokerage is positive on."
38,2019-06-21,Britannia,"While the domestic equity market is looking intact optically at the benchmark level, a selloff below the surface has nudged 75 per cent of the NSE-listed stocks below their 200-day moving averages; meaning they have entered a bearish phase. 

The 50-share Nifty is up over 7 per cent this year at 11,691 till June 19, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap250 indices have declined up to 5 per cent in the same period. 

On Friday, as much as 42 per cent of Nifty components traded below their 200-day moving averages (DMAs). The list included Britannia Industries, Cipla, Eicher Motors, Gail India, Hindalco, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, ITC, YES Bank, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel and Tata Motors.



“A stock trading below 200 DMA means it is in the corrective zone. The benchmark index looks well placed currently, but individual stocks have been beaten down badly. Ideally, one should focus on stocks that are sustaining above their 50-DMAs,” said Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher.

“I do not see Nifty going down below 11,550,” she said, adding that market participants can consider pharma and capital goods stocks at this point. 

Even in the Nifty500 pack, 60 per cent or 300 stocks are trading below 200-DMAs in clear signs of selling pressure across sectors. 





Stocks trading below this crucial support line included 3M India, ACC, Adani Green, Avenue Supermarts, Bank of Baroda, Deepak Fertilisers, Crisil, Cochin Shipyard, ICICI Securities, Jaiprakash Associates, Jain Irrigation, among others. 

Moving averages (MA) are a tool for analysing trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance levels. 

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major MAs, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is considered a continuous uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks test 50-DMAs or 100-DMAs, while serious corrections may cause a stock slip below 200-DMA. 

The 200-day average, also known as a long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for an index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. The 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks. 

On Thursday, stocks like Wipro, Voltas, UPL, Va Tech Wabag, Symphony, Sunteck Realty, SRF and Sonata Software traded above their 200-DMA, while SAIL, Sterling Tools, Tata Chemicals, Tata Motors, Videocon Industries, VIP Industries and Wonderla Holidays are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs. 

Around 300 stocks, including Aarti Industries, DCM Shriram, BPCL, Bata India, Info Edge, Infosys, Inox Leisure, HDFC, Redington and PNC Infratech, were above all the three DMAs, signalling a bullish trend. 

“Available data clearly shows the market has begun a sideways secondary trend after a long primary uptrend. In the secondary phase, the market first consolidates and takes a fresh call either on the upside or downside depending on the technical setup at that point of time. PSE and infrastructure stocks, including L&T and NCC, should remain resilient in the coming days,” said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst for Technicals and Derivatives at Angel Broking, said the primary uptrend is expected to resume soon.

“However till then traders are advised to keep positions light and avoid bottom fishing in stocks that have run into the abyss through this volatile period,” Chavan said."
39,2019-06-24,Britannia,"After the initial euphoria over the return of the BJP government, the equity market is looking uncertain again. There are several reasons why investors are shorn of confidence. The domestic economy is facing a consumption slowdown. NBFCs are reeling under a liquidity squeeze, forcing many to scale back operations. Market breadth remains very narrow.The trade war between an increasingly bellicose US and an equally unyielding China threatens to escalate further. Crude oil prices remain vulnerable to tensions erupting afresh in the Middle East. Bond markets across the globe have been flashing warning signs in recent months.Yet, there are some positive signs too. Domestic inflation remains low and interest rates are on the decline. With several conflicting indicators and mixed trends, investors can’t be faulted for their diffidence.How should investors navigate this maze of information which can help them make better investment decisions? Firstly, it is critical that investors interpret this news flow correctly. ET Wealth identified six critical signals that are defining the market sentiment. In the pages ahead, we examine each of these trends in detail and interpret the same for readers. Hopefully, this will help them take timely decisions to adjust their investment portfolios to improve their returns.Market breadth continues to be narrowIn the past year or so, only a handful of stocks have actually gone up, while the broader market has been listless. The market breadth, which is the ratio of stocks that are advancing or declining, has turned decidedly negative in the past three months. The ratio of advances-to-declines on the NSE has dropped from 1.08 in March to 0.59 in June. So, more stocks are losing value than seeing an uptick.More stocks declining than advancingThe market breadth has further narrowed in the past few months.

Experts say this is an outcome of a highly polarised corporate earnings growth. “Only a handful of companies are delivering double-digit earnings growth sustainably. Money is chasing this select set of stocks,” says Kunj Bansal, CIO and Partner, Acepro Advisors. When the market breadth narrows, the markets typically gravitate towards this creamy top layer of ‘quality’ stocks.5 scrips gave 97% of BSE 100 gains in a yearWhen the breadth narrows, markets gravitate towards quality stocks.

Analysts expect this phenomenon to continue for some time. The corporate showing in the coming months will give a clearer picture. The festival season will be in full swing and the impact of government spending during the election season will seep through by then. Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market expert, feels broader market participation is not expected in next few months. “I doubt the market will react positively to announcements in the Budget. Investors are more likely to wait for green shoots to be clearly visible.”Mid-cap valuations revert to discountWhen Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, mid-caps were trading at a significant discount to large-caps. But Modi’s election sparked a multi-year uptick in mid-caps. Expectations of faster growth in mid-caps on the back of a business-friendly government sent valuations soaring to stratospheric levels. However, with earnings not keeping pace with the rise in stock prices, the sentiment has now soured against midcaps. With frontline indices delivering healthy return on the back of a select few bellwether stocks, the valuation differential to mid-cap index is now reverting to near pre-2014 levels. The Nifty Midcap 100 index now trades at a PE of 31.5 compared to 61 barely a year ago. With this sharp correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has now become attractive, say experts. Many are suggesting that investors use this window to hike mid-cap exposure.Mid-cap valuation premium almost erodedAfter the correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has become more attractive.

The PE multiples of several mid-cap stocks have slid sharply. However, investors should not jump in because the mid-cap segment remains vulnerable to the slowdown and any liquidity crunch in the system. As the market focus shifts back to earnings growth and economic realities, any disappointments will push share prices further down.Valuations of some mid-caps have declined sharplyDespite the correction, some mid-caps are still not cheap.     Company Current PE 1 year ago PE   Indian Hotels Co  61.1 156.2   Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail  51.7 90.9   Jubilant Foodworks  54.2 85.4   Dilip Buildcon  30.3 57.4   Quess Corp  35.3 58.7   Bharat Forge  20.0 43.1   Godrej Agrovet  29.2 50.3   Sterlite Technologies  13.3 33.3   Sun TV Network  15.0 33.6   Escorts  14.7 32.6 Experts say that investors should stick to quality mid-caps. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital insists the valuations in mid-caps seem cheap on a relative basis. “These were overvalued earlier, and have not really become cheap now. Good quality mid-caps are still expensive,” he says. Sankaran Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, insists that investors should only take exposure to mid-caps through the SIP route with a longer investing horizon.Consumption demand is moderatingFor years, India’s consumption story powered the economy even when private investment flagged or global demand waned. In recent months, however, this consumption engine has developed a snag. Weak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a slowdown in demand. “Even structural trends are subject to cycles and there is little doubt that consumption is now showing signs of strain,” says Vetri Subramaniam, Group President & Head-Equity, UTI Mutual Fund. Automobile sales have steadily dwindled since October 2018. Nearly all major carmakers have revised sales projections downward citing weak consumer demand. Vehicle makers are cutting back production to clear the piling inventory at dealers. There is also a visible slump in demand for discretionary items like refrigerators, washing machines and other appliances. Even low-ticket essentials like toothpaste, shampoo and hair oil are reporting weak volumes.Consumer stocks have had a tough time on the bourses. However, barring a few exceptions, valuations have not softened much from earlier levels. On the contrary, several consumer stocks have seen multiples expand. Britannia Industries, Dabur India, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Voltas, Havells India and Titan Company are now significantly more expensive than before. Most consumer stocks will be vulnerable if earnings growth does not match up to market expectations.Many consumer stocks have tankedWeak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a demand slowdown.      Company CMP (Rs) PE  1 year price change (%)   Zee Entertainment Enterprises   338  20.7 -39.72   Mahindra & Mahindra   624  24.2 -31.61   Hero MotoCorp   2,648  15.6 -27.83   Maruti Suzuki India   6,582  26.5 -26.82   Page Industries   20,039  56.7 -25.36   TVS Motor Company   458  32.5 -22.98   United Spirits   539  59.5 -19.07   Godrej Consumer Products   658  28.7 -15.01   Avenue Supermarts   1,298  253.9 -14.67   Tata Power Company   65  8.0 -14.16 The ongoing monsoon will play a key role in how the consumption story pans out. An abundant monsoon is a crucial driver of rural sentiment and discretionary consumption. A week’s delay in onset of rains in the country lends no relief. Further, the India Meteorological Department has suggested that the strong El Nino weather pattern, which will keep rains muted, will likely only fade by August. This doesn’t bode well for consumer discretionary stocks, as lower disposable incomes will keep demand for high-value items subdued. Says Gupta, “Much of the slack is actually pent-up demand that is bound to come through in the coming months. But things could get worse before improving.”NBFCs facing severe liquidity crunchExperts say the consumption slowdown has been precipitated by tight liquidity conditions— particularly the cash crunch that has crippled NBFCs. With banks and mutual funds refraining from lending money to many such shadow banks since the IL&FS blowout, these have had to scale down their operations. This has shackled growth as NBFCs accounted for nearly a quarter of the credit growth in the past financial year. Much of this lending was for purchase of vehicles, appliances and other items. The revival of consumption partly hinges on the time it takes for liquidity conditions to normalise going ahead.NBFCs are now reworking their business models to tide over the liquidity crunch. The central bank has also proposed norms that will introduce liquidity buffers for NBFCs. As part of the new rules, NBFCs may have to set aside 60% of their net cash flows in government securities starting next year and gradually step it up in a phased manner. This is to ensure that the lenders have enough liquidity to fall back on in case of liquidity stress. But analysts point out these tougher norms could further crimp NBFCs that do not have a well-managed asset-liability situation. “The financially better placed NBFCs with strong sponsor support and well-established positioning in the ecosystem may be able to withstand it better than others,” says Jinay Gala, Senior Analyst, India Ratings and Research.Shares of several NBFCs have taken quite a beating over the past year. The fear of a contagion has led many to dump NBFC shares. Equity mutual funds have also cut their NBFC exposure sharply in recent months. Analysts suggest that investors should stick to NBFCs with strong parentage and healthy asset-liability positions.Several NBFC shares have taken a beatingFear of a contagion from IL&FS episode has led many to dump NBFC shares.      Company CMP (Rs) PBV 1 year price change (%)   Dewan Housing Finance Corp   77  0.3 -87.7   Reliance Capital   71  0.1 -83.2   SREI Infrastructure Finance   21  0.2 -71.6   Centrum Capital   27  3.3 -51.1   IIFL Finance   161  1.0 -50.9   IFCI   8  0.3 -48.9   Indiabulls Housing Finance   655  2.1 -45.4   Edelweiss Financial Services   176  2.5 -44.8   Indiabulls Ventures   273  8.6 -42.9   Shriram City Union Finance   1,422  1.6 -37.9 Entities like Bajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Manappuram Finance, LIC Housing Finance, L&T Finance, among others are better positioned. Other analysts, such as Gupta, suggest investors stay away from NBFCs for now. “Several NBFCs have very opaque structures. These firms have a problem and we don’t know the full extent of it yet.”Deleveraging by Indian companies continuesIn the last few years, several highly indebted firms had consciously embarked on reducing their debt burden. India Inc continues on this deleveraging trend. For the third straight year in 2018-19, domestic companies’ net debt-equity ratio showed improvement. In 2013-14, 61 BSE200 index companies had a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one, while 24 firms exhibited leverage in excess of three times. According to latest available data for these companies, 57 companies have a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one and only 20 companies reported a ratio higher than three. Further, the solvency position of these companies has also improved. Bansal argues, “The deleveraging exercise will separate the men from the boys. Stronger names will emerge leaner and fitter.”Many companies deleveraged in recent yearsThe solvency positions of these companies have also improved.        Debt-equity ratio Interest coverage ratio   Company Mar-14 Mar-18 Mar-14 Mar-18   Interglobe Aviation  5.5 0.5 4.3 7.7   Tata Power Company  2.9 1.3 1.3 1.2   Balkrishna Industries  1.4 0.3 26.7 76.3   Century Textiles & Industries  3.0 1.9 1.1 2.3   HEG  1.3 0.3 2.6 29.3   Ashok Leyland  3.0 2.1 0.0 3.1   The Ramco Cements  1.2 0.3 1.7 14.0   Indian Hotels Co  1.3 0.6 1.9 3.1   Jubilant Life Sciences  1.7 1.0 2.2 4.0   Tata Chemicals  1.3 0.7 0.9 5.7 Source: Capitaline. Data as on 17 JuneMajor corporations including Reliance Industries and Tata Group have also kickstarted a deleveraging exercise. RIL has partially reduced its debt by transferring Jio’s fibre and telecom tower assets and liabilities to two Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). The conglomerate is also planning stake sales in its refining and telecom businesses. Tata Steel, which accounts for nearly 90% of the Tata Group’s debt, plans to bring down its Rs 1 lakh crore debt burden to Rs 70,000 crore over the next few years. This process of deleveraging will improve profitability, but will take some time to seep through, reckon analysts. Gupta asserts, “Deleveraging is a lengthy process. It is best to stay away from highly leveraged companies even if they take steps to repair the balance sheet.”Inverted yield curve indicates recessionIn recent months, a prominent indicator of economic health has been flashing red across countries. The yields on long-term bonds are now lower than on short-term bonds. The yield is the return an investor gets on a bond. Typically, investors demand higher yields from longer-term bonds to compensate for the higher risk of keeping their money tied up for a longer period. But when yields on shorter term bonds rise above longer term bonds, it signals that the bond market is expecting trouble ahead. Such yield inversions have preceded several recessions in the past. The recent inversion in the US yield curve is the first since 2007, when the subprime crisis sent the economy into recession.Some nations are witnessing an inverted yield curveCountries not showing inversion now have done so in the recent past.     Country 2 year bond yield (%) 10 year bond yield (%)   Lebanon 11.88 11.04   Mexico 7.86 7.64   Canada 1.38 1.43   Japan -0.21 -0.13   Czech Republic 1.45 1.54   South Korea 1.49 1.60   Taiwan 0.49 0.70   United States 1.87 2.11   Singapore 1.70 1.96   Philippines 4.94 5.23   Norway 1.10 1.41 Apart from the US, several countries are witnessing the inverted yield curve. The phenomenon is not limited to developed countries. Even developing economies like Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Philippines have all flashed red at some point. Indian bond markets have not ventured into this territory yet. Also, experts maintain that the yield curve inversion is merely a transient phase and bond yields should normalise in the coming months."

44,2019-06-26,Britannia,"FMCG major Britannia Industries Wednesday dispelled speculations over the resignation of its Managing Director Varun Berry from the company.

Terming the speculations as ""false"" as well as ""incorrect and baseless"", Britannia Industries said, Berry was re-appointed as the Managing Director for five years effectively from April 1, 2019, following his six years stint in the company from 2013.

""There have been false speculations over the last few days on Varun Berry's resignation from the company. We would like to clarify that these rumours are incorrect and baseless,"" Britannia Industries said in a statement.

According to the company, Britannia Industries has seen strong results in Berry's tenure and is trying to be a ""global total foods company"".

Berry had joined Britannia Industries, which owns popular brands as Good Day, Tiger, Milk Bikis and Marie Gold, from food and beverage firm PepsiCo in 2013.

In FY2018-19, Britannia Industries, which operates in segments as biscuits, bread, cakes, rusk, and dairy products, had revenue of Rs 10,482.45 crore."
45,2019-06-26,Britannia,"Mumbai: Fonterra Future Dairy, the equal joint venture between Future Consumer, a part of the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, and the New Zealand-based dairy major Fonterra, is expecting a revenue of Rs 6,000 crore and become one of top four players over the four-five years.

The companies had announced the joint venture last year and on Wednesday launched their consumer brand Dreamery that will be launched in the western states initially and then rolled out in other states over the next 24 months.

The company has launched toned milk, milkshakes and curd and will be launching a new product every quarter.

""If you look at our retail business, 8-10 percent sales come from dairy products. It is a very important category for us. We've target of selling 60-70 percent volume from our own brands and without dairy we can't achieve that,"" Future Group founder Kishore Biyani told reporters.

Noting that there is a unmet demand for dairy products, he said this joint venture will be the most valuable asset we create for us in the long term wherein we will be creating niche products which cannot be compared with Amul.

Fonterra Future Dairy would be focusing more on the value added segment that is expected to grow 50 percent faster than the dairy sector and so is milk intake which is expected to rise 42 percent from 196 billion litres now to 278 billion litres over the next seven years.

Fonterra had entered India through a joint venture with Britannia in 2001 but exited it in 2007 and entered into an agreement with Future Group last August."
49,2019-06-27,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Rainfall deficit remained high at 38 per cent of long-term averages on Wednesday, but analysts say slow progress of the season rain-bearing winds is unlikely to push food prices high enough to trim expectations of an August rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 

Consumption-linked sectors, however, may stay under pressure due to rural distress, unless the government announces relief measures in the forthcoming Budget, they said. 

The monsoon usually covers two-thirds of the country by mid-June. This year, it has covered only about half of it till June 25. Kharif crop sowing is down 12.5 per cent YoY, as rainfall deficit fell to 38 per cent from 45 per cent earlier this month. 

Kharif crop outout accounts for 50 per cent of India’s total foodgrain production and contributes nearly 5 per cent to India’s GDP. These crops depend largely on monsoon rainfall.

Good rainfall helps boost rural sentiment and helps lift rural spending, though not necessarily backed by any sharp improvement in rural incomes, said foreign brokerage UBS.

According to Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the El Nino phenomenon, which dries up the weather in India, has waned and the positive changes in temperature in the Indian Ocean are likely to support rainfall. 

“If monsoon picks up, then it should be a positive for market sentiment in general and consumer-focused stocks in particular. We are overweight on the consumer discretionary sector and neutral on consumer staples,” UBS said.

The brokerage, which has a December-end base target of 12,000 for Nifty, said the correlation between monsoon and inflation has broken of late due to factors such as increased global and domestic supplies and improved supply-chain management. 

Besides, while food has a weightage of 46 per cent in CPI, only 22 per cent of the CPI basket is estimated to be directly impacted by monsoon rains.

Analysts said foodgrain stock remains high with the government, with wheat and rice stock at nearly 4 times the buffer norms. This stock can be liquidated to manage any supply shortage that might arise on account of rainfall deficit. 


Rural stress needs a quick fix
But rural distress remains a cause of concern. Goldman Sachs said January-March quarter was the first period in 10 years when year-on-year domestic revenue growth decelerated vis-à-vis December quarter for all of 17 companies that it tracks.

It expects the trend to continue for at least next two quarters, as benefits of likely government measures to revive rural demand will take time to reflect in demand.

Prabhudas Lilladher said while rainfall has spread across various parts of the country in last 5-6 days and spurred crop sowing and agri-input sales, it will remain watchful on monsoon progress and quantum of pest infestation over the next three months, as it would critical for the agrochemical companies like Bayer Cropscience, Dhanuka Agritech, Insecticides India and Rallis India.

Centrum Broking said rural agrarian distress due to lower food prices and near stagnant wage growth clearly highlight the necessity for rural income supplement from the government.

“A minor increase in rural income can benefit FMCG stocks like HUL, Dabur, Britannia and Nestle, while any significant improvement in rural income can lead to demand growth in the auto sector, especially tractors and two-wheelers helping stocks like Escorts, M&M, Hero Moto and TVS,” said Parth Nyati, COO & Co-Founder, Trading Bells."

47,2019-06-27,Britannia,"PM’s address to the Parliament clearly shows that he wants to maintain continuity. The very fact that the NITI Aayog head has been given an extension puts the onus on continuity, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.

There is no hype, no expectation about the budget which is just a week away?The market is already at 11800-11900. We had seen a very short lived correction at 11600 levels. Typically the last one month, post the landslide mandate, the market is flat. We are waiting in anticipation. You cannot say that there is no expectation built in because after a big mandate, people are waiting for the fine print on the policy action, the political capital that the new government is willing to put at stake to make a larger difference to the people.

Those are things that people want to see because growth has to be really kick started now because next week you will have the June quarter ending, auto numbers, monsoon progress. These are the things that the market wants to digest to figure out if there is a sense of normalcy or a sense of earnings coming back. Those are key variables going forward.


But what can the government do to obviate economic stress?There are small things. They are really going after compliance in a big way. All the databases talk among themselves and that means it becomes more difficult for businesses to remain outside the formal set up. So there has to be some amount of buoyancy that should creep up in the tax collections any which way. In case, there is no demand resurgence, you can try and ensure that the compliance levels are kept in check. You have to fix what is fixable at the moment. It is true no big bang developments can be expected but the direction and the trend that one sets for the next five years would give you an idea. 

Going by the Prime Minister addresses to the Parliament houses, it clearly shows that he wants to maintain continuity. The very fact that the NITI Aayog head has been given an extension is a clear onus on maintaining continuity. One would assume that the small fixes are likely to be addressed in this budget. There does not seem to be enough room to manoeuvre now for big bang reforms.


If we have normal monsoon, how much of a positive would it be especially for sectors like consumption?Monsoon works more from the sentiment aspect. People consume when there is a better sense of earnings visibility in the immediate future. A large part of the workforce today is still employed in agriculture sector and that is why it gives a larger sentimental fillip. 


Will this be a rerating moment for Café Coffee day enterprise shareholders?Sameer Narayan: Well honestly CCD has had a lot of history now it has been addressed but is that good enough? One does not know and so the way capital is being raised, people would want to know how much of the stress has been taken care of by what has been raised as of now.

For that, you first need to figure out what is the actual stress and you need disclosures. That brings us back to the entire thing as today even auditors are shying away if one needs to figure out how investors need to get some sense of the numbers which are believable. That is where one needs to be forthcoming with disclosures upfront and that is where people want more clarity first.


Will you buy a Café Coffee Day or Tata Global because these are two businesses with scope of expansion and the whole bet on demographics and per capita is visible.Consumption will grow in pockets. Trent is a great example. It is a company where promoters are showing confidence and putting in money. There is preferential investment going in and it is a well run business.


 It is a PE of 70.The problem is that today we have to view it in a very different context. They are running, they are partners with the franchise of Zara that they are running in India. There The same store sales growth for Trent on the Westside portfolio is still at a 9% and they are doing interesting things. For example, today the studio stores have no apparel at less than Rs 1,000. So India consumption will flourish but at a price point. 

I do not know whether will there be enough people who will buy a coffee at Rs 250 but there are lots of people even from small towns who want to look like movie stars buy clothes which is available for a Rs 1000. So, that is where you need to make your product position and that is where it will sell.


Is there anything that stands out with the way the story has unfolded with Zee? Similarly, the ADAG group has not been all that lucky but how do you really see this from a shareholder perspective?Shareholders are quite an aggrieved lot because they are facing the brunt of the entire market balancing act. Today I need to be sure about the promoter I back. Basically I am valuing his entrepreneurship multiple, the fact that he has some capital which he will deploy sensibly and which will generate better than cost of capital returns over a period of time. 

If that thesis does not play out well, that is a risk I am playing but having said that, I also need to know at what level the promoter will be able to pull back and say may be this is wrong. Unfortunately nobody does so and that is where the re-correction of market is happening. That’s why investors have seen such a large erosion in value.


It is not that IndusInd Bank has defaulted, it is not that they have a huge problem in terms of growth or capital or CASA, but markets are giving it a stepmotherly treatment. On the other hand SBI has not done anything wonderful. They have not kept all the promises they have made in the last 2-3 years and yet markets are rewarding the stock? Markets typically tend to reward the most improved performer, not the best performer. IndusInd Bank has always been a good performer, but in case of SBI, last two year’s loan book growth is actually higher than that of Axis and ICICI Bank!


That is base because they did not lend two years ago and now as the lending has started, the numbers automatically look decent.Yes, but the factors today are getting a size and you are getting a sense that today the incremental risk is more contained than what it was.


I am also getting a PSU management.Well I think SBI has done enough to tell you that they are not exactly a classical PSU management. Although IndusInd Bank is a very different quality but SBI, for the size that it has, for the compulsions of being the largest lender in the country, has done fairly well in trying to turnaround from where they were two years back.

In terms of market performance, the most improved performer always tends to get a better thumbs up from the market rather than the best performer. That is where one could probably attribute the divergence in performance.


Where do you stand when it comes to the midcap consumption pocket because we have been hearing about consumption slowdown. In case of a company like Dabur, the extended winter, high input costs all affected the company. Are you fairly selective in this space? Do you see a turnaround?Staples consumption is not at a price at which one would want to take a serious look at them. Yes the growth thesis pretty much remains. India is a young country. I think it is honestly the price that you want to pay today and unfortunately most of them will start looking more expensive the moment you start seeing emergence of growth pockets somewhere else. Typically, that is the way the money tends to flow. 

If I suddenly see a green shoot of recovery in domestic cyclicals, I start getting worried about the valuations that I am paying for safety in the so-called defensives.


Tata Global Beverages has been more like a sleepy stock. They have got global as well local businesses and great brands but those brands do not give them enough ROI?Today the management of Tata Sons is clearly looking at consumer facing businesses in a very different light. They want to invest in it and that is good tidings for Tata Global as a company, but clearly the man at the top makes a lot of difference. The change of guards needs to be watched and then look at the evolving strategy.


What about Britannia? It is a long-haul play and more importantly how critical is Varun Berry to Britannia after Vinita Bali? Is Britannia a good investment proposition and is it the time to buy right now?It is a great business available at a slightly expensive price. People will do better to hold their horses and wait for a better price of entry because at this point, there is just no margin of safety. It might not be person dependent because it is more of an institutional business considering. When Vinita took over, she revamped the whole franchise. 

Post that, the amount of product categories that they have got into very clearly shows that they have actually got the segment and hence the margins have clearly moved from say long single digits to high or mid teens. The company has definitely undergone changes but yes, the man at the top does make a difference. That space needs to be watched."

51,2019-06-28,Britannia,"There are lots of NBFC and infra companies like Magma Fincorp and PNC Infra that have corrected 50% and have also managed to clean up their books, says Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC. Excerpts from his interview with ETNOW.


Where do you see opportunity as the distress sale goes on?There are across-the-board opportunities right from NBFCs to infra. Among NBFCs, several companies like Magma Fincorp have corrected 50% from the top and are trading at about 1.1 time book. Magma has cleaned up well and the book is fairly clean. 

Similarly, lots of infra companies have also cleaned up their balance sheets from the last cycle to the current cycle. PNC Infra is trading at 10 times, 12 times and it has hardly any debt on its balance sheet. You can also find lots of companies which have corrected themselves and are stronger today.


But why go for something which is bombed out and not stick to good quality stocks like HDFC and HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance or Titan? You may get one right but you will end up getting two wrong! You will be jumping in the same place in terms of a portfolio return?Indeed, but it is not just a question of buying out the bombed out stocks because if you look at the last five years, it is not just the midcaps, even largecaps have been equally dangerous. Stocks comprising about 40% of the Nifty five years ago, are no longer on Nifty today. Companies like DLF, NMDC have lost 70-80% of their market cap and therefore got deleted. From that perspective, you are absolutely right in terms of sticking to the HDFCs of the world where you continue to see growth and which will continue to pay off. 


The latest to join the default bandwagon is Cox & Kings. Some of the companies are managing to do well but the rest are not and that leaves the shareholders in a precarious spot?Indeed, that is a trend which we will see going up in the coming months and that is something which the market will learn to deal with. The market does have a fair degree of sense of which is a highly leveraged company and that trend will continue where you will see a movement away from such companies which have no clear action plan in place.


Indian retailers are complaining about the disruptive force of the e-retail space but two Indian retailers are commanding valuations which no retailer in the world commands. D-Mart and Trent are at different ends of the value chain. Your view?Both are at different ends of the spectrum and while the online threat has been around for the longest time, still brick and mortars continue to exist and continue to take market share around the world including the developed markets. India is a country where in spite of all the broadband connectivity, a good chunk of the population wants to go and touch and feel before they buy something. From that perspective, the same store sales growth rates and per square foot growth rates have shown an immense amount of growth given India’s youth population. Majority of the population is young and it is partly reflected in the valuation.


Britannia is an established business. The company is bigger than the management. Do you see an opportunity to enter that?There are a number of companies out there if you are talking about consumers. Havell’s trades at about 40-50 times. Crompton Consumer, a similar kind of business, trades at half the multiple. They have had their own issues in the past. They have been cleaning up their business and there is sufficient room for a rerating to happen over time. 


How are you looking at the commentary given by some of the IT majors in the quarter gone by? Did something stand out within the tech space in the large or midcaps?TCS and Infosys said the first half will continue to be strong whereas in the traditional IT companies, usually the second half of the calendar year is stronger because in December, budgets are revised for the following year. Against that backdrop, if the first half is actually strong, the second half would be even stronger. IT companies have traditionally been very bad at hedging their currencies. So that does not really matter, the end demand is what matters and that is exceptionally strong."

1,2019-07-02,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: India’s five richest billionaires added a whopping $15 billion, or roughly Rs 1,00,000 crore, to their wealth in the first six months of 2019.

The top seven gainers in terms of wealth creation earned $20 billion, or Rs 1,40,000 crore. This is nearly one-fifth of the increase in market value of the entire listed universe during this period.

Except for steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, each of the five richest billionaires added at least $1.7 billion, or Rs 12,000 crore, to their kitty, publicly available data with Bloomberg suggests.

Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian who runs oil-to-telecom giant Reliance Industries (RIL), has added $7.41 billion to his fortunes so far this year, which stood at $51.7 billion as of June 28, 2019. The addition of this nearly Rs 50,000 crore made him the 12th richest person on the planet.

Shares of India’s second most-valued company, RIL, have climbed 14 per cent so far this year against Sensex’s 9 per cent gain.

Second on the list is philanthropist Azim H Premji, who retired as executive chairman and managing director (MD) of IT giant Wipro last month, has added $4.73 billion to his wealth in six months. At $21.7 billion, he was the 44th richest man on earth. Premji, who transformed a small hydrogenated cooking fat company into a $8.5 billion global IT powerhouse, and also ventured into FMCG, infrastructure engineering and medical devices, now aims to focus on philanthropy.

Wipro shares have beaten Sensex returns so far this year, gaining 13.6 per cent.

Uday Kotak, who leads India’s fourth largest private lender, has seen his wealth swell to $13.6 billion, a jump of $2.08 billion so far this year, riding on a 20 per cent surge in share price of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

HCL Technologies promoter Shiv Nadar saw his wealth rise by $1.5 billion as HCL’s share price advanced 11 per cent.

The market value of all the BSE companies jumped by Rs 7.5 lakh crore to Rs 152 lakh crore during the same period.

Among others, Adani group promoter Gautam Adani, Sree Cement owner Benu Gopal Bangur and Vedanta group promoter Anil Agarwal saw their wealth rise by $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.

Lakshmi Mittal, the owner of ArcelorMittal, meanwhile, saw a $881 million wealth erosion to $12.91 billion.

Besides Mittal, other top losers included Sun Pharma’s Dilip Shanghvi and Wadia Group's Nusli Wadia.

Wadia, who leads Britannia Industries, Bombay Dyeing and budget airline GoAir, lost $1.04 billion in wealth. Shanghvi’s wealth eroded by $1.07 billion as Sun Pharma stock has fallen 7 per cent. The drug major recently received four observations from the US health regulator for its Halol facility in Gujarat."

7,2019-07-03,Britannia,"The Indian economy is showing clear signs of a major slowdown and any effort to revive the same in the Union Budget will not be complete, unless the issues in the hinterland are resolved. 

With indirect taxes out of the ambit of the Union Budget, the government’s annual fiscal roadmap has largely ceased to be material for stock investors. They now only look for policies and schemes that can have trickle-down effect on any sector or stock.

And the rural theme, with implications for a number of sectors, is in focus this time around.

The agriculture sector contributes about 17 per cent of India’s GDP but employs over 50 per cent of the total workforce, and thus has a key place in the demand-supply equation.

Economists point out that despite various efforts by the government, gross value addition of the agriculture (agri-GVA) sector has been declining in recent times and the share of investment to agri-GVA has been falling consistently (See chart).

Therefore, there is a need to make some structural changes in agriculture starting from marketing to exports to double farmers’ income by 2022.

An over 30 per cent slump in BSE Auto index since the Union Budget, unveiled on February 1, 2018 against a 10 per cent rise in benchmark Sensex has been partially attributed to a rural distress, which has also dented demand for FMCG goods. The BSE FMCG Index is up just 5 per cent. 

The gap between rural and urban growth came down to 10 per cent in FY19 from the historical median of 30 per cent.

Addressing rural distress and boosting consumption in the economy are expected to be a key focus of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s full Budget on July 5, and should that happen, it may give FMCG and consumer sector stocks an easy lift. 


Agencies
The rural economy is facing the heat of the slowdown due to a heady mix of lower realisations for farm output and slowing demand, says Mayuresh Joshi, Portfolio Manager Angel Broking.

“Management commentaries of consumer staples/FMCG specifically hinted at moderation and sluggishness in rural consumption,” he said. 

The agriculture sector has been one of the focus areas since the first tenure of the NDA government. Some of the steps taken by the government included introduction of a crop insurance scheme, a mission to improve farm productivity, a scheme to plug holes in the procurement system and hiking of minimum support prices for crops to 1.5 times the cost of production besides a revolutionary income support scheme. 

There are hopes that the forthcoming Budget will have a plethora of measures for the agriculture sector which can boost consumption-linked stocks. 

Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities, believes the government may look at providing interest-free credit cards to farmers, as mentioned in its election manifesto, for short-term new agriculture loans up to Rs 1 lakh at 0 per cent interest rate with tenures of 1-5 years on the condition of prompt repayment of the principal amount. He expects the Budget to have schemes that would benefit pharma, banking, FMCG and housing finance stocks.

SBI ‘Ecowrap’ report said financial institutions and the government should lend their helping hands to farmers by providing market support right from cultivation to sales.

The report also highlighted that capital formation in the agriculture sector has stagnated significantly. A trend reversal there can help achieve the objective of doubling farm income by 2022. 

“This can be achieved by providing an incentive to agri-term loans for investment purpose through an enabling mechanism of either interest subvention or credit guarantee fund,” it said.

At present, the crop insurance scheme called PM’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) covers three types of crops, namely food crops (cereals, millets, and pulses), oilseeds, annual commercial or horticulture crops, which account for only 30 per cent of the total crop loans of banks. 

“Government should cover all types of crops under PMFBY, which will help banks manage risks and also make a statement of intent in the Budget to increase income support from Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 over next five years. This will create a feel-good factor and boost consumer sentiments,” the SBI Economic Research said.

Consumption-related stocks like Emami, LT Foods, Bajaj Hindusthan, Vadilal Industries, Prataap Snacks and Future Consumer are down over 20 per cent since Union Budget, 2018. However, stocks like Nestle, HUL, Marico, Britannia and Dabur are up between 12 per cent and 60 per cent in the same period.

None of the stocks in the BSE Auto index has delivered positive return to investors since February last year. Tata Motors, TVS Motor, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland and M&M are down between 20 per cent and 60 per cent.

“Two factors can help improve rural demand. First, the monsoon and schemes or measures that the government is expected to announce in Budget to stem deteriorating rural demand. Any revival in rural sector will boost stocks like Colgate and ITC,” said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.

The two stocks have delivered a meagre 1 per cent return to investors since February 1, 2018.

Parth Nyati, COO & Co-Founder, TradingBells said even a minor increase in rural income can benefit FMCG stocks like HUL, Dabur, Britannia, Nestle, while any significant improvement in rural income can lead to demand growth in auto sector, especially for tractors and two-wheelers, which can be a positive for Escorts, M&M, Heromoto, TVS Motor."

Technical Analyst Institutional Desk, Ashika Stock Broking

Where we are: The Nifty snapped its winning streak and traded lower on Friday, Union Budget remained a key trigger for the intraday whipsaws. Market breadth indicates a change in the stance of the market participants since advance-decline ratio skewed toward the decline. On the sectoral front barring Nifty Bank, FMCG, financial services and PSU bank, all the other sectors were key underperformers as they staged a correction up to 4 per cent in Friday’s session. Mid- and Small Cap indices also failed to sustain at the intermediate highs and traded lower.

What is in store: Since the breakout near the election outcome day index continues to trade within the range of 11,590-12,040 band, Nifty is trading direction neutral with mixed bias. On the daily chart, formation of bearish engulfing candlestick near the upper end of the range indicates the above-mentioned range still remains valid. We expect follow-up correction while a major trend reversal to take place only in the event of a close below the level of 11590, it remains a make-or-break level in the near term.

What could traders do:

Sideways trending market is always tricky to play, as a failed breakout of the range keep resulting in the unusual rise in the volatility. On the option front, Call writing is seen at 12,000 strike for both weekly and monthly expiries — thus a level of 12,000 remains a key hurdle. We expect auto stocks to continue to remain underperformers. On the stock front, we recommend long in Britannia and Colgate Palmolive while we expect a follow-up correction in Maruti, Wipro and Infosys."

A slowdown in economic growth amid the trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies has put Indian corporate earnings at risk, analysts say.

“It’s the confluence of headwinds -- weak global demand, fading impact of rupee depreciation, non-bank finance company crisis and scale-back of government spending -- which is deepening the slowdown,” Edelweiss Securities Ltd. analysts led by Prateek Parekh said in a note.

The country’s economic growth slumped to a five-year low of 5.8 per cent in January-March. The absence of any substantial fiscal stimulus for companies in the federal budget last week puts the onus back on the government to spur growth. The Reserve Bank of India has already cut interest rates three times this year and signaled more easing to come.

Edelweiss expects profits for companies in the NSE Nifty 50 Index rose 7 per cent year-on-year in the April-June period. The broker sees profit expansion concentrated in just a few sectors, namely financials, airlines, pharmaceuticals and cement.

Here’s what analysts expect from the results season that kicks off Tuesday with Asia’s top software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.


Reliance Securities (Naveen Kulkarni)



Expect “uninspiring” 1Q earnings. Nifty company profits are likely to grow by just 6 per cent, led by banks and financial services stocks.
Autos will be the major drag on earnings.
Inventory losses at oil marketing companies will hurt profits for the oil and gas sector.
Consumer sector will see growth challenges. Price growth is critical as volume growth tapers. Titan Co. Ltd., ITC Ltd., Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and Marico Ltd. top picks.
Building materials, infrastructure and capital goods will see healthy earnings. Top results picks are Ultratech, JK Cement, KEC International and Larsen & Toubro.


Dolat Capital



Agrochemicals and specialty chemicals are potential winners.
Auto companies are expected to report sharp drops in profits. Bajaj Auto Ltd. and TVS Motor Co Ltd are likely to report relatively better performance.
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd are likely to perform above par, but improvement in net interest margins is expected to remain marginal as funding costs are unlikely to taper materially.
Expect revenue growth to remain muted for consumer companies due to the liquidity crunch in the first half of the quarter.
Expect revenue momentum to continue for software exporters due to strong deal signings in 4Q. Cross-currency movement will have a negative impact of 10-50 bps on the dollar revenue of Indian IT vendors.


Edelweiss Securities (Prateek Parekh)



Auto margins are expected to be range-bound due to poor volumes. The benefits of relatively lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by company efforts to reduce inventories. Ashok Leyland, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Eicher Motors are top picks.
Tight liquidity, risk aversion and slower growth dent the earnings outlook for shadow lenders. Their overall assets under management likely grew 2.1 per cent q/q and 12.8 per cent y/y.
Among banks, those with robust deposits, pricing flexibility and ability to aggressively raise deposits have an edge. Edelweiss prefers ICICI Bank, SBI and Kotak Mahindra Bank; among NBFCs, the picks are Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Frinancial Services Ltd.
Sharp price hikes and easing fuel costs will offset impact of low demand for cement companies. Top picks are Shree Cement and JK Cement Ltd.
Consumer goods companies will post weak volume growth overall. Sees Britannia and Marico posting strongest growth, at over 6 per cent.
Positive on software exporters on basis of demand; prefer large caps due to execution capabilities, investment ability and better valuations. Buy on Infosys Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd. and HCL Technologies Ltd., Hold on Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Wipro Ltd.


Kotak Institutional Equities (Sanjeev Prasad)


The outlook is positive for corporate banks ICICI Bank and SBI given their inexpensive valuations and visibility of steady progress toward RoE “normalization.” Yes Bank will face one of its most challenging quarters. There is more focus on asset quality for IndusInd Bank Ltd. and RBL Bank Ltd.
Expect sharp improvement in profits for Indigo on higher yields and after Jet Airways stopped functioning.
Reliance Industries is likely to report a marginal q/q increase in standalone Ebitda led by higher refining margins, an increase in crude throughput and petchem volumes."

MUMBAI: Shares of Titan Company plunged 12.3 per cent on Tuesday — the highest single day fall in three years on worries about the slowdown in its jewellery business — a unit that contributes almost 82 per cent to the firm’s revenues.

The weakness in the share price could persist till demand for jewellery revives led by softer gold prices or stock valuations become cheaper, said analysts.

“Till the time jewellery growth comes back or maybe when the company gives you some guidance how the demand is going to be, the stock may remain under pressure or continue to languish,” said Amnish Aggarwal, head of research at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher.

Titan’s jewellery segment posted a 13 per cent growth in revenues in the June quarter, below its full year guidance of 22 per cent, said Credit Suisse. The jewellery retailer said higher gold prices impacted demand.

Analysts said the extent of the fall in revenue growth in the company’s main business in April-June was one of the highest in recent years, disappointing investors who have been used to its consistent performance.

“The company was doing extremely well in the sense that numbers were beating estimates. But it always remained an over-owned and a high–priced stock,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president, IIFL Securities.

Titan, considered one of the flagbearers of India’s famed consumption story, has been among the top performers on the bourses in recent years. In last five years, Titan returned 336 per cent, while the Nifty gained 153 per cent.

The run-up in the share price had made Titan’s valuations expensive, leaving little room for disappointments. Credit Suisse, which downgraded the stock to neutral after the first quarter earnings, said its priceto-earnings ratio — a key valuation measure — at almost 48 times 2021estimated earnings is even higher than that of other large consumer staples and discretionary companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Britannia and Asian Paints.

A revival in demand for jewellery will be critical for investor interest to return to Titan. “The stock can only do well only if there are significant earnings upgrades, which now look unlikely given the near-term softness in growth,” said Credit Suisse.

Bhasin said a fall in the stock closer to Rs 1,000 would be a buying opportunity. The stock closed at Rs 1,099.10 after touching a low of Rs 1,072. “We think that in 1-2 months there should be a revival in consumption. By the festival season Titan will be regaining its form and heading back to where it was,” he said.


Navin Kulkarni, head of research, Reliance Securities expects the slump to last for three to six months.

“It’s a quality company and it should soon bottom out between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,050,” he said."
16,2019-07-10,Britannia,"With a $7-billion digital slice, 21x valuations, you should buy TCS on dip, buy the little softness in the reporting, says Dipen Sheth, Head, Institutional research, HDFC Securities. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.

Let us talk about IndiGo first. Yes, there are corporate governance issues, long drawn out battle, the impact on the stock regardless of the fact that it is a company that has great valuations, doing well and has had no complaints till now. How would you digest this news?We will be watching this space closely. Any kind of spat at the ownership or sponsor or promoter level is a problem. God knows MindTree is going through some such thing right now. Internal management quality is wonderful. The quality of the business is beyond question. But there is an ownership issue and who is really going to drive this ship is the question. The sena (army) is good but if I am not sure about the senapati (General), then I do not know what this army is going to do. 

Somewhere down the line, both realised that they will destroy value if the spat continues. I hate to take sides here or suggest a way out. It is not my mandate of brief but if one of the litigants withdraws respectfully and decides to let the value remain intact and maybe agree to encash the value, it may be solved. I do not know which one it should be and there are various schools of thought around that. Frankly we need to get into the details. But anything that disturbs the mood of two senapatis will rattle the sena. That is the fear we have in MindTree, that is the fear we should have in IndiGo and we should wait for the news bites to die down and for them to put their heads together and work a way out.


Aviation is becoming so interesting because we have seen what has happened with Jet. At Air India, they are talking divestment but anyway let us keep that aside for the moment. There is the growth potential.There is SpiceJet, another wonderful management, let us not forget Ajay Singh.


Yes so then, it is the only beneficiary in this game?It is not that your loss is my gain, first of all. It played out that way with Jet because in that case, there were horrible operating cost structures and they were overleveraged and there were reckless expansions, coupled with some well founded concerns on corporate governance. 

 I do not think we have a similar problem in say SpiceJet at all. In fact, I see a money spinner in IndiGo and I am willing to go out on a limb and say Air India’s franchise, its slot, its multi-location advantage across India and the world, makes it a great case for divestment and efficient management which it is not right now. 


The sector needs to grow, if there is so much untapped potential….It is not about the growth needs of the sector, the bigger deal is that the sector can grow. This is one of those sectors for India from a five or ten-year perspective where anywhere between 5% and 15% volume growth every year is feasible. Something like a 10% to 12% volume CAGR is easily achievable for a decade.


After the strong performance in Q4, TCS has started off on a fairly slow pitch. How have you read into the numbers and experts are saying that there are going to be more headwinds for the stock ahead? You can tick all the negative boxes if you are pessimist on TCS. The US has had a great three-year run on micros. TCS has had an even better run if you look at it that way. It is now a $20-plus billion company. You are looking at hopefully India’s currency not continuously depreciating in the foreseeable future although the jury is out on that. You are looking at digital disruption hitting the sector continuously over the last two years and a lot of people getting it and not getting it and all that kind of thing. 

If that is the lens you want to look at TCS through and of course the upcoming talent crunch and shortage for onsite talent in the US, you can keep finding gaps and the fact that TCS continues to be a services play rather than a product play like the glam dogs in the innovation space within IT. However, you got a $20-billion pure services company with an interesting layer of consulting which is highly respected in the US. When we travelled through the US less than a year ago and spoke with stakeholders across the industry value chain -- customers or competitors, consultants, global innovators companies and so on -- there was uniform respect for the management quality and the delivery efficiency and the reliability of TCS. 

Within India’s software space, TCS is the Mercedes Benz of delivery. I do not see that changing. Now they have got a $7-billion digital practice as well. Yes legacy has slowed down and in fact it is just about flat year on year and you will crib about the headline growth not being 3% and 2 point something, the margin slipping from the 26% band to somewhere around 24% and all of that, but with a $7-billion digital slice, 21x valuations, you should buy the dip, you should buy the little softness in the reporting. 


It is just around the Rs 2100 mark...Yes so who is selling? Nobody. You can crib all you want on TCS but a great company with slightly higher or little higher than industry valuations is not to be sold. There is no sign that the greatness is going away. Once you see greatness going away, you may not want to give a premium valuations. It has played out in Eicher. It has played out in Page. But it is not playing out for TCS because they continue to deliver within a certain range. It will always be a half or a one per cent up or below what you think it should have been, but there is no breakdown of the thesis at all.


 Is it playing out for Bajaj Finance?There is a contradictory thing coming through. First of all, the disclaimer that we do not have them under coverage and we have been trying to figure them out and this is a company that ticks all the boxes just like TCS and while we do not have them under coverage, and we do not have a formal recommendation. There is nothing to my mind which suggests that a little bit of caution reported by Mr Bajaj should be taken as a five-year commentary. He will go through ups and downs, the business will go through ups and downs but look at that growth and look at the sustainability of that growth and look at that growth coming without spoiling the quality of the balance sheet.


 Well there is a thought that came in from one of our other market participants saying that the risk of default would filter down to small ticket loans also. Yes of course, so they just do not want expectations to run ahead of reality and if you have smaller ticket size loan, remember the risk is granular and mostly manageable there out of process rather than solid person to person underwriting skills, the thing that happens in a Rs 500-crore corporate loan. The kind of risk management skills needed there are completely different from the risk management skills which are needed in a Rs 10,000 mobile loan. 

The Rs 10,000 mobile loan can actually be automated and be powered with artificial intelligence and risk analytics in a way that the Rs 500-crore corporate loan cannot be. I am much more bullish on the prospects for Bajaj Finance than on the prospects for many of the corporate banks which are now healing very fast.


Financials is really what everyone is betting on in terms of a certain segment within the broader pack, hoping that some of the monetary stimulus will start to kick in, that the cleanup is behind us. Would you agree or would you still be a little cautious?No at one-third or so of the lead index, financial is where you must be focussing very closely but as this market has taught us for the last few years, it is not going to be broad- based move and you will see divergence in performance, you will see divergence in valuations and you will be puzzled to see even more divergence in their commentary and in the way the stock eventually performs. You will continue to be puzzled by the relative outperformance of what is good but you feel it is too costly and that has played out for Bajaj Finance. 

It will continue to play out for some of the bigger banks and it is time that Axis and ICICI Bank got back to their old premium valuations. Axis has many more miles to cover on the valuation front although some brokers have recently said that is the big valuation re-rating game ever. There are many levers at Axis and of course at ICICI Bank. Whether it is growth, balance sheet healing, sharpening of core metric as you move forward, Axis after the big blowout on asset quality has got less than 2% of their loan book to BB and below quality. We see even here for the next two years, provisioning or credit costs falling appreciably over the next two-three years. , Now you have an inspirational leader in charge who is being able to attract talent from HDFC Bank and that is inspiring as an observer.


What about an IndusInd?IndusInd is a very interesting case. There is no question on management quality there. They have had that accident with IL&FS but they have been running a brilliant operation for more than a decade now. They are reasonably valued. This is a very good opportunity to look at IndusInd all over again because with by adding the Bharat Financial slice to their loan book one, gives them diversification and a ROA higher than their average ROA kind of loan book with relatively lower consumption of capital. 

Are they buying more risk? I think they are getting more opportunity. There are two ways again to look at this, they are getting far more reach into up-country India. The opportunity for eventual cross-sell may not be there right now, but eventual cross-sell of a whole lot of financial products down that channel is tremendous. They have been punished God knows enough for their accidents with IL&FS and as they transitioned to Ind-AS, some of their bloated fee income reporting might get a little averaged out, but I wouldn’t be worried on that. 

The big deal here is can they keep a tight grip here on the slight shake up that has happened in asset quality and Bharat Financial can continue to deliver on what is clearly a very high opportunity lending slice, lending vertical in microfinance. I suspect there is going to be serious value creation all over again in IndusInd Bank.


 What is the view on FMCG space? Do you believe this is an opportunity to enter, is there more pain?It is fashionable to beat FMCG saying that oh! valuations are at 40, 45, 50 and all of that. Rural India is going through a slowdown so FMCG will underperform. God knows it has not underperformed in the last five or 50 years, so long as we remain the broader comment on FMCG so long as we remain a consumption up skilling driven economy any consumer business is set for a good time that said some consumer businesses have more cyclicality or vulnerability. Let us say so a business like Symphony. I am going outside FMCG to illustrate my point. A business like Symphony has more vulnerability to reported weather, a business like Voltas has more vulnerability to consumer sentiment because after all it is discretionary spend. 

On FMCG the big deal is that you need to look at quality of portfolio. Hindustan Lever stands out as there is just no comparison with Hindustan Lever and Nestle, though we do not have Nestle under coverage. These two companies completely stand out but and niche stories like Marico, the vulnerability on Marico has been that they have not had a single a very large product success or brand success for sometime, but they are a very gifted management and the advantage that they got over the last 6 to 12 months was the gradual falling off of the copra price cycle which they play to advantage and delivered alpha for investors.

I do not think we should look at it purely from a copra cycle perspective either. You do have high quality businesses. I must confess like Marico, like Britannia and Lever, you have to take your pick in terms of where you find the valuations comforting. 

I must confess that ITC at 40-45% discount to the sector is alluring even though it is a sin industry and the stock has gone nowhere. 

If I can round up my views on the entire consumer space and not just FMCG, I must confess that despite the headline high valuations, I also like Jubilant Foodworks for the sheer management quality and the reinvention of the business model over the last year and a half or so. Much of that is still to deliver, especially in terms of their digital evolution and you have no idea what you can do. They are a food tech company and a consumer company combined into one and you have no idea of the addressable opportunity that they are looking at, the kind of levers they are pulling in terms of internal efficiencies getting revamped and getting driven by digitalisation. The 37-38x kind of valuation multiples are not too scary. The stock has gone nowhere over the last few months and this is a good time to pick it up.


What are you making of the higher tax on FPIs? In your notes you have said that it may not be a bad thing?That is again a slightly higher level comment. I have always been personally uncomfortable about the fact that I can invest in my markets at a tax rate which is different from foreigners level playing field. Mutual funds are not taxed for the simple reason that they are pass through instruments. As an investor in a mutual fund, I am liable to pay short term or long term whatever the case might be. Long-term capital gains of 10% may be regressive but it is not significant enough to kill the sentiment for investing. Long-term investment in the stock market should be incentivised. Given the very low penetration that equities have in our household savings pie, may be the thing to do is perhaps to take up the holding period to two years or even three! Why not and say we will tax you at zero rates for that. This is one suggestion I have for the government. 

The second thing is on the FPI bit. I want simplification and I want FPIs to be treated the same way as let us say Indian corporates would be treated if they were to invest in the stock markets and in fact FPI should be treated at par with mutual funds in so far as that if mutual funds are pass through instruments, the eventual beneficiaries of FPI holdings. If you cannot pass through the tax impact, then you need to tax them as and when they book those profits in the stock market and I am okay with that. 

I do not think there is much to crib there. Having said that, overall on taxation front, the budget has been a little harsher than it could have been and I am not complaining about the 42 or 43% effective on the higher tax slabs. A lot of the rich folks will crib on that I think it is okay, I do not think it is a big deal. For me the bigger deal is the taxability, getting more people in the tax net. The good work that was started by Aadhaar by digitalising or digitising the IT or Income Tax.

Digitising IT infrastructure was a good idea, Aadhaar was a good idea and the DeMon was a good idea in terms of trying to get more people in the tax net, putting up withholding tax on large cash withdrawals is a good idea. But there are a whole lot of people who are still outside the tax net and who are taxable. I wish the government would do something tight and something strong to get them into the tax net maybe then we can let go of the 45% or 43% tax rates."
17,2019-07-11,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Future Group, India’s largest listed retailer, plans to cut shelf space of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Procter & Gamble (P&G) by nearly a third in the laundry segment to make space for its own line of detergent liquid and powder products.

To begin with, Future Consumer, the retailer’s consumer goods arm, has launched liquid detergent and will add powder format in next two weeks. The new brand will take disproportionate space to help build visibility at the cost of rival brands, said two officials at Future Group.

The retailer has about 1,500 stores across supermarket chains such as Big Bazaar, HyperCity, Easyday and Nilgiris, and accounts for nearly 4-5%, or about Rs 4,000 crore, of HUL and P&G's annual sales. 

Laundry is the biggest category for both these firms, and Future Group’s latest move could directly hurt their business, especially at the premium end. “While their (HUL, P&G) detergent brands have a strong pull, we have to build our portfolio since we aim to get 70% of our sales from own brands in the next few years,” said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group. “Consumers will finally decide which brands to pick but we have to push our own brands on shelves too,” he said, declining to comment on shelf space reduction for the rival brands.

HUL and P&G declined to comment. Globally, consumer companies share a love-hate relationship with retailers, who use their bargaining power to beat down prices or introduce their own cut-price versions or private labels.

Future Consumer’s products started as own brands or private labels nearly a decade ago before Biyani restructured the portfolio into a separate fast-moving consumer goods company.

Within home and personal care space, laundry is the biggest segment, and HUL and P&G together controls more than half the market with brands such as Surf, Rin, Ariel and Tide. Analysts feel it is difficult for newer entrants to enter this highly penetrated category worth about Rs 24,000 crore.




“There may be a short term impact on laundry makers due to such disruption in shelf allocation and pricing. But companies have been investing heavily on research and development and marketing to build their products and it is not easy to influence purchase decision of such well entrenched brands overnight,” said Abhijeet Kundu, analyst with Antique Stock Broking Ltd.

While FCL was largely restricted to staples and packaged food to cash on to the under branded category, it has been launching products in mainstream segments. Within their stores, FCL’s Tasty Treat has 20% share and is the third largest player after Britannia and Parle in biscuit segments. The company is also the biggest in the body wash segment and has over a quarter share in snacks in their outlets.

“The fabric wash category has to evolve from whiteness and stain removal proposition to caring for clothes. We are also the country's largest garments maker selling about 300 million pieces each year that gives us data and insight to democratise the segment with better pricing and positioning,” said Ashni Biyani, managing director of FCL, adding that the laundry brand Voom will also be sold across fashion stores such as FBB, Brand Factory and Central.

In 2018-19, the company launched more than 400 new products and stock keeping units and reported revenue of Rs 3,880 crore. Three-fourth of its sales comes from Future Group’s retail outlets. The company has also outsourced production of key products to national consumer goods companies. For instance, Jyothy Labs that sells Henko detergent, will make the new laundry product for FCL while their biscuits are being manufactured by United Biscuits, which owns McVitie’s."

Technical Analyst, Ashika Stock Broking
Where we are: No sign of respite is being seen, Index continues its phase of correction for the week gone by. Post the steep correction, even bargain-hunting trade near the intermediate low of 11,460 also failed to materialise in any short covering. The correlation between Indian VIX and Nifty50 is typically negative however it turned positive since both fallen by 8 per cent and 2 per cent respectively for a week-on-week basis. This divergence is not a good sign. In the prevailing phase of correction typically all the major sectoral indices failed to provide any solace to the bulls the defensive set of an index such as Nifty IT also has fallen by 4.50 per cent since the beginning of the month.


What is in store: Index continues to trade below its make-or-break level of 11,590 and 50 DMA, in absence of any sign of reversal we expect weakness to continue. Major support pivots are placed at 11,426 and 11,115 (200 DMA) levels. Whereas Nifty Bank continues to languish near the key support of 30,110 which is a confluence of 50 DMA and Breakaway Gap, we anticipate major weakness only in the event of a close below 30,110 level.


What could traders do: The prevailing divergence between Indian and US indices is likely to continue since technical setup for both indicates trend continuation. Thus, all the contra/bargain hunting trade by looking at global peers not likely to yield any meaningful return in the short term. On the stock front, we recommend long in Berger Paint, Britannia and Colgate Palmolive and expect upside in tune of 5 per cent and more, while follow up correction is in Wipro and Bajaj Finance."
19,2019-07-16,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Healthy gains in shares of heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, L&T, Axis Bank and Infosys helped equity barometer Sensex close in the positive territory for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.

Other than the support from the heavyweight stocks, market observers attributed the gains to lower domestic yield in the hope of further rate cuts.

""A slew of positive vibes from heavyweights ahead of June quarter earnings and lower domestic yield supported the market. A sharp drop in India’s 10-year yield to 6.34 per cent and expectation of RBI’s accommodative stance offered hope of further monetary easing,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The 30-share Sensex ended 234 points, or 0.60 per cent, higher at 39,131 with 21 stocks ending in the green. Nifty closed 73 points, or 0.63 per cent, up at 11,661 with 38 stocks advancing and 12 declining.

DHFL logs gains

Breaking the losing spree of the last two sessions, shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) closed 4.33 per cent higher at Rs 50.60 after it rejected reports that raised concerns on the company's viability as non-factual.

27,2019-07-19,Britannia,"Positive on Britannia and Bharti Airtel among largecaps and KEC International and Kalpataru among midcaps, says Sandip Sabharwal, investment adviser & founder, asksandipsabharwal.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Do you expect Reliance to maintain the same tone which is that the core business is slowing down, the new business is growing and we are excited about it? That is what they told us last time.Yes, that is what they will continue to maintain. What investors will be looking at is the net debt position, given the fact that they still have been investing significantly in telecom. My guess is petrochemical margins could be under a decent amount of pressure because most petrochemical prices actually cracked and the input prices did not crack as much. So, that will also be interesting to watch because that is a big cash cow for Reliance. 


Whether it is a stupid market or a nervous market or a skittish market, we are in a market where a little bit of selling is having a large impact on stocks. Traders and investors are acting first and analysing later. How long will this continue?Looking at things, fundamentally I do not see a very huge downside in the markets. However, as we have been talking since the Budget that the risk of the Indian markets underperforming remains high because of the entire taxation regime etc where the government has refused to budge. It puts a significant pressure and people talk of incremental 2-3% impact but when you have to analyse it from last year, till the last year, long term capital gains tax in India was zero. From zero, it went to 10% and on that you have a surcharge of 37% on the overall. So, the effective tax rate has gone from zero to 14-15%. 

That is going to impact some foreign investors who are looking to invest. On a post tax return basis, India might not be as attractive unless growth picks up significantly. Then no one looks at what taxes they are paying. That is something which could happen but it is not happening as on today. That is the reason we are seeing a disproportionate pull out from equities in India although bonds are getting flows.


For a foreign institutional investor who is coming via a fund based out of Singapore or the US, you can come via the trust route. Individual FPIs who are investing in their individual name will have to pay higher surcharge but the bulk of the money from institutional investors is coming by the company route. So, some would argue nothing changes?Yes, 60% is via company route. It does not change for them but for 40% which is coming via individual and trust route, the tax goes up. Now the government and the finance secretary have been continuously saying that you can convert yourself into a company but then you know how the tax authorities in India are. If they decide to change, then they will come under GAAR and then they will say you are changing just to avoid tax. 

So, it is not such a clean thing in India. The government should have actually said that we give you an open window for the next three months. Whoever converts into a company will face no action from tax authorities. If they just did that. then people could have taken their call. But if they leave it open ended and the tax authorities as it is are under pressure to collect more taxes because the government has aggressive tax revenue targets and the economy is not doing well enough to support that revenue projection. 

These are the issues. Otherwise, given the hugely improved liquidity in the system, given the fact that interest rates are going down, that the government is actually working on other fronts and small strategic disinvestments have been announced, IBC has been tweaked to make it more effective and they have moved very fast on that. There are a lot of things they are doing positively but unfortunately the sentiments are getting impacted by these events. 


What about IndiGo?The result should be pretty good because the ticket rates in the festival season were quite high, especially because Jet went down suddenly and all the advance bookings which people had to do, had happened at a very high rate and to that extent, the first quarter will be pretty good for most of the airlines. Whether the stock reacts to that or not, I am not very sure because one, there is a promoter tussle and second, the second quarter pricing is under quite a bit of pressure.


There is a point of view that once promoters enter into such a public spat, it is unlikely to be resolved, that there will have to be some kind of culmination of this spat with perhaps one of them giving way on their stake or in some way. What do you think the markets would want to hear in terms of commentary on that front?Historically, when such things start, they do not get resolved so fast. To that extent, investors should be wary of that impacting the operations. At this point of time, what the company, the management has been maintaining is that it has no impact on the operations of the company. And if that gets proven over a period of time, then this could go into the background. But given the fact that regulators are also looking into it and this spat is still simmering quite significantly, people need to be wary because hypothetically if one of the promoters which is Mr Gangwal decides to exit, then that exit will have to be at a market price or at a control premium. It involves a huge amount. So, who will fund that? 


We have seen good growth in ACC. Is cement something now to keep on the watch list?Cement is something which we have held more in our portfolios relative to what the weightages are, because my view has been that pricing is back with the companies and demand will be more than supply going forward. However, at this stage, what is happening is the demand has got curtailed because demand growth is not as good. So, demand growth has to pick up for the entire thesis to play as strongly as we think it should so that is something which will need to be monitored over the next few months. Overall, cement is a good space to be in.


What within cement?Among largecaps, we hold UltraTech Cement because it has operations all over and sufficient capacity which can be utilised further because of the acquisitions they have done. We also hold a cheap midcap, India Cements. 


Any thoughts on volatility? How are you reading the fact that the India volatility index is near one-year low? What is it signalling?I would think it is signalling very little trader interest in the markets and people are totally unconvinced about which side the market is going to go. So if VIX is very high, people are convinced are that market is going to fall. Normally VIX is very low if people believe markets are going to rise. But I guess is this time there is a lack of interest and that is leading to this sort of volatility.

I have always maintained that when we look at volatility, it is important to look at global volatility rather than India volatility because that actually determines the trends in global equity markets and there also, volatility has been reasonably suppressed.


We did see sharp selling across some of the PSU names, a lot of them in the energy basket. But it could have been more about the fact that they are all PSUs.Whenever the CPSE ETF comes in, prior to that, we see this sort of selloff in the PSU stocks because people think that they can get in there cheaper and I believe, there is a discount built in for retail investors in that ETF. People try to play that percentage arbitrage. 

I think that CPSE ETF is not a successful product. They have raised Rs 40,000 odd crore till now and the current size is just Rs 8,000-9,000 crore. It has been used as an arbitrage product by the market and this time also the government will collect whatever on disinvestment but then whether that will last in the ETF or not, we do not know.


What are markets pricing? Are markets telling you that Yes Bank is going to go belly up? Will Yes Bank create a systemic risk? If not, how should one understand a)this meltdown in Yes Bank stock; b) their business; c) the growth and d) the capital?Yes Bank is unlikely to go belly up given the fact that banks tend to have retail deposits which are normally sticky. We have not seen a run on bank deposits even in the 2008 crisis. There were rumours, but it never happened because there is some inherent conviction in the minds of depositors that a bank will not be allowed to fail. 

Second, what is most concerning and from the point of view of investors who are looking for returns from Yes Bank, is that their advances are more than their deposits. If your advances are more than the deposits, When the liquidity is ample, then there is no issue and when their rating was top rated, there was no issue. They could borrow in the wholesale markets and fund their retail growth and make much more margins as they did not have the deposits. 

Now it is a different scenario. For them. to get wholesale funding is tougher. It is more expensive and a lot of depositors might actually think that for 1-2% higher rates why should we go for Yes Bank? Why not put it in HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, SBI? So, the larger banks tend to benefit today because they get more deposits. That is a bigger risk because what that does now is that the growth will need to be compromised. I think Yes Bank growth will fall significantly. It is difficult for them to grow at all in my view.


Do you think that the fund raise would be a crucial but a significant amount?Yes, the fund raise has to be crucial but today for them to raise $1-1.5 billion at the current market capitalisation is very tough. It is a vicious cycle. They should have done the fundraising much earlier which they did not do, thankfully for the investors who would have come in at that time, they could not do it. It is a tough space they are in. It is very difficult to put an equity value on that stock today because we do not know what the growth is going to be. 

If people are projecting 10% and growth actually is zero, then what happens to the balance sheet because in banks, the NPAs are calculated as a percentage? If your denominator does not grow, then your NPAs as a percentage also might not improve as much. There are a lot of things going on there. 


Some of the names in the auto ancillary space are seeing a little bit of traction coming in. Is there any trend that you are thinking of? Is this very stock specific? Bharat Forge is a case in point. What do you make of the move that we have seen in the account?Bharat Forge has been hit on two sides -- the slowing trucks market in the US and the slowdown in autos in India. But it has been growing its other businesses quite well. It has been getting orders in defence. It has done well in aero space. 

I believe it is a very interesting company at this stage. It is almost half from the top and there are no triggers per se which should take the stock up. But then it is a high quality cheap stock with a very clean balance sheet. I would think that these levels are good for long-term investors. 


Give a few more names that you will be looking at currently. I know you are looking at cement very favourably, any specific names or anything else in the market?There are specific companies across the industries. On the consumer side, given the correction, Britannia is in a good zone today. On the telecom side, if someone wants to play contrarian then Bharti Airtel is ripe for 15 odd per cent kind of returns. 

On the midcap side, we are holding the transmission companies KEC International and Kalpataru, I believe they are reasonably cheap. They have got a good outlook and they benefit from reduction in interest rates because they have reasonable working capital which get re-priced lower. These could be some of the stocks.


What exactly is your take on the IT space?There is a lag in the catch up to digital and I have also observed in the results which have come out till now, that although the larger companies are still coping up with this transformation, ome of the smaller fancied companies are finding it difficult. So the smaller companies are not reporting as good results but the larger ones are reporting good results. My guess is that there will be a derating in the smaller second tier IT companies. 

We have seen MindTree results were not great, Tata Elxsi was not great, yesterday Cyient was not great and I think those companies are now facing the pressure but the larger companies they are still able to cope up and they are growing the digital business significantly."

32,2019-07-26,Britannia,"NEW DELHI | KOLKATA: Consumer goods companies said the October-December festive quarter will be crucial for a revival in demand that would halt the slowdown of the past three quarters.

“The third quarter will be critical for a turnaround in the consumption trajectory. A lot will also depend on the monsoon, which has improved but is still below normal,” said Britannia Industries MD Varun Berry. “We hope overall agricultural conditions improve enough to cause a revenue uptick. With 44% of Indian workforce employed in agriculture, this will also be a critical requirement for the consumption turnaround.” Berry leads the country’s largest biscuit maker.

Consumption in rural India, which accounts for about a third of the market, has been under stress for the past three quarters. Its rate of expansion is now at par with that in cities, compared with nearly double two years ago. Companies said urban growth has also tapered off in the June quarter.

In the past decade, sales of branded daily needs goods in the nation of 1.3 billion people have increasingly relied on growth in the rural hinterland, home to more than 800 million people, whose purchase behaviour is largely linked to farm output.

“But how will the money come to the rural market is the big question,” said Dabur India chairman Amit Burman, who was elevated to the post of the Rs 8,533-crore consumer goods company last week. “So far, one instalment of the PM-KISAN scheme has come in, the second part is yet to come. Besides, the monsoon seems deficient.”

The government recently expanded the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) income support scheme to all farmers. It provides Rs 6,000 annually to beneficiaries in three equal instalments.



Monsoon will be key
Earlier, the PM-KISAN scheme was limited to farmers with a land holding of less than two hectares; now about 145 million farmers will be included. This could help the farm economy. Hindustan Unilever Ltd said it expects the second half of the fiscal to be better than the first.

“If the rains are good, it will give a boost to confidence — festive season is also a trigger. You feel good and the whole atmosphere around the country changes,” HUL chairman Sanjiv Mehta said. “I would also believe that all the steps the government has taken could result in kick-starting higher growth of the economy.”

Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its annual growth forecast for India, expecting the economy to expand 7% in FY20, 30 basis points slower than its April projection. This “reflects a weaker-than-expected outlook for domestic demand”, it said.

Market researcher Nielsen revised its growth forecast for the FMCG sector to 9-10% in 2019 from its previous outlook of 11-12%, citing a sharp rural slowdown. Nielsen said value growth in the sector in the June quarter slowed to 10% from the corresponding year ago period when it was 10.6%. It said this was due to rural growth losing steam and the fading advantage of small manufacturers.

A spokesperson for ITC said any uptick would depend on the monsoon. “While it is too early to predict how the festival season commencing in October would pan out, a lot would depend on the monsoons as it has a significant impact on the rural economy,” the spokesperson said. “We however remain optimistic about demand picking up over time given the government’s strong policy direction.”

Consumption in rural India, which accounts for about a third of the market, has been under stress over the past three quarters on account of macroeconomic factors including declining liquidity and slower wage growth. So far, the monsoon rain deficit stands at 18%.

“Rural consumers have fewer avenues to spend, so there’s less competition for the rupee. They end up spending more on daily household essentials, unlike urban consumers who spend on movies, eating out, travel and so on,” said Deloitte consulting partner Rajat Wahi. “For firms, the rural growth opportunity is more because they are opening up new markets, and many categories are under-penetrated.”

For discretionary and large-ticket purchases such as durables and mobiles, the festive season is critical and accounts for almost 40% of annual sales. While companies are still unsure of a revival, they hope lower goods and services tax (GST) rates could help perk up in demand.

“The industry expects the GST Council to consider a lower rate, not only to put demand on track this festive season but also for the long term. Otherwise this festive season, similar to last two years, may continue to be sluggish on growth,” said Panasonic India chief executive Manish Sharma.

Refrigerators, washing machines and small-screen televisions attract 18% GST while air-conditioners, microwave ovens and large screen televisions are subjected to 28% GST. Historically, most companies offer full-priced merchandise during festive occasions, but discounts, cashbacks, financing options and buyback schemes have been deployed to boost demand over the past few years. “Last year, the smartphone market witnessed 47.3% growth year-on-year in the fourth quarter due to Diwali sales, primarily fuelled by online,” said Raghu Reddy, head, categories and online sales, Xiaomi India."
35,2019-07-27,Britannia,"NEW DELHI|MUMBAI: IndiGo has sounded out five prominent personalities to join the board as the airline’s first independent woman director.

The carrier has approached former PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations chairperson Isher Judge Ahluwalia, ex-MD of Britannia Vinita Bali, former HP India head Neelam Dhawan and ex-HSBC India head Naina Lal Kidwai.

“The airline board will decide on the candidate very soon,” said a person familiar with the development, who did not want to be identified.

The appointment of an independent woman member on the airline’s board is part of an agreement reached after co-promoter Rakesh Gangwal complained to the market regulator that IndiGo was not following corporate governance norms.

“We would like to fill this position with a person of high integrity,” the person said, adding that the individuals shortlisted individuals reflect the airline’s endeavour to have independent and professional members on the board. To address the concerns raised by Gangwal, IndiGo is expanding the composition of its board to 10 from six. The board will include four independent directors including a woman, five nominees of co-founder Rahul Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises, including the CEO, and one from the Gangwal group.

After Gangwal had red-flagged the issue of related-party transactions between IndiGo and Bhatia’s IGE, the airline has decided to change the practice. Indigo will now follow a competitive bidding process for all such transactions over a certain value, a person aware of the development said. External consultants will be hired to deal with technical issues and transactions. While the Bhatia family and IGE together own 38.23% of the airline, Gangwal, his wife and a trust own 36.65%."

41,2019-07-31,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Underpinned by gains in bank, metal and auto shares, equity indices Sensex and Nifty settled in the green on Wednesday, snapping the losing run of last two sessions. 

Analysts attributed the gains to the short covering in the recently beaten-down stocks amid hopes of a rate cut by the US Fed, as there was no explicit fresh positive trigger at home.

“The market reversed after testing the psychological level of 11,000 mark supported by short covering in bank and auto stocks after recent fall and prospects of a dovish Fed policy. However, investor appetite for midcaps and smallcaps is yet to grow even after a long consolidation,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

3,2019-08-06,Britannia,"A wave of uncertainty has engulfed markets due to weak demand and earnings uncertainty. In such a situation, it makes sense to stay with bluechip companies as they provide a better shield in times of economic slowdown given their dominant market share, pricing power and low debt. 

This serves well for conservative investors looking for safer options that deliver returns greater than fixed deposits. 

Among schemes that have very high exposure to blue chips and have been consistently beating the benchmark index and peers by a fair margin is Axis Bluechip. The scheme invests close to 87% of its portfolio in bluechip companies. Of these, the top six companies make up 61% of the scheme’s portfolio.

 A large part of the portfolio (45%) is invested in financials which include private sector banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Given their better asset quality and retail focus than PSU banks, this strategy works in generating higher or providing stable returns in the longterm. 

This element of spotting companies which have high asset quality is one of the themes of the scheme’s portfolio. And it has paid off. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 12.6% and 11.3% returns, respectively, while its peers have given average returns of 8.4% and 8.7%, respectively, in the same periods.

The company had last year announced issuance of secured redeemable non-convertible debentures as bonus debentures of Rs 60 in the ratio of one such debenture for every equity share at an interest rate not exceeding 8 per cent to be paid annually for a period of three years.

The Kolkata bench of the NCLT in its August 2 order had approved the scheme of arrangement for issuance of the debenture bonus to its shareholders.

According to the company, it had proposed issuing 12,01,59,147 bonus debentures and the same would be listed on BSE and NSE.

6,2019-08-07,Britannia,"Growth in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector has slumped in the past four quarters in a row since July-September 2018, both by value and volume, as consumers shifted to cheaper daily essential brands in the urban markets and rural growth slowed.

Value growth, or revenue earned, fell from 16.5% in July-September 2018 to 10% in the June quarter this year, according to industry officials quoting market researcher Nielsen. Growth by volume, or the number of packs sold, dropped from 13.4% to 6.2% in the same period.

Britannia Industries managing director Varun Berry attributed the current slowdown to a combination of reasons that have persuaded consumers to turn thrifty.

“Apart from a slowdown in rural markets, all wealth-creating factors are looking negative,” he said. “The real estate market has been considerably down and now the stock market as well. Consumers are feeling that they have lost net worth and seem to be going easy on consumption.”


‘Definite Signs of a Slowdown’
The economic slowdown has been hurting demand in Asia’s third-largest economy, with weakened domestic investments and risks to global economic growth impacting growth forecasts.

In recent weeks, both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have lowered India’s growth forecast, citing headwinds in domestic and global markets. The IMF estimated the Indian economy will grow at 7% this year, down from an earlier forecast of 7.3% on a weaker-thanexpected outlook for domestic demand. The ADB lowered growth forecast to 7% for this year, on the back of fiscal shortfall concerns.

“The economy is showing definite signs of a slowdown, and it is being witnessed across industries,” said Dabur chairman Amit Burman. “FMCG industry growth rates have, in fact, hit a near two-year low, and this is being felt across urban and rural markets.”

Industry representatives said core inflation at its lowest level in almost two years also translates to weakness in consumption demand, with lower rural wage growth and a delayed monsoon further dampening sentiment. Some are looking forward to a revival in the next few months.

“We are witnessing a consumption and liquidity challenge across multiple channels over the past few quarters,” Marico managing director Saugata Gupta said. “However, we expect things to turn around in the festive quarter.”

A report by ratings agency CRISIL released last week forecast growth at 6.9% this fiscal, or 20 basis points lower than its earlier estimate. It attributed the lowering of the projection to an inadequate monsoon, slowing global growth and sluggish highfrequency economic data. The report said the second half will find support from monetary easing, consumption and a statistical low-base effect.


The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to cut the benchmark policy rate by another quarter percentage point on Wednesday, amid growth concerns across various consumption pockets, according to most respondents in an ET Survey.

Last month, Nielsen revised its growth forecast for the FMCG sector to 9-10% in 2019 from its previous outlook of 11-12%, citing a sharp rural slowdown.

“At the beginning of the year, we saw a softening, driven by essential and impulse food categories,” Sunil Khiani, head of retail measurement services, Nielsen South Asia, had said at the time of releasing the report. “However, the second quarter witnessed a slowdown across all food as well as non-food categories with salty snacks, biscuits, spices, toilet soaps and packaged tea leading the slowdown.”

Berry, who heads the country’s largest biscuits company, is looking to the government to help revive demand. “We are hoping the government will take requisite steps to bring liquidity in the market and bring back the optimism to get consumption to grow once again,” he said."
8,2019-08-07,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Around 93 stocks fell to touch their 52-week lows on NSE in Wednesday's session.

9,2019-08-07,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: RBI’s unconventional 35 bps rate cut failed to give any boost to investor sentiment and equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended Wednesday’s session with strong losses.

The market was hoping for some measures to address liquidity concerns for the shadow banks.

“The NBFC crisis is still plaguing the market, and there is a need to fix it. Developments in the global economy are also not favourable for growth,” said Deepthi Mathews, Economist at Geojit Financial Services. 

Global sentiment remained fragile while investors back home sought clues as to when and how the economy will start a bounceback and what measures the government may take to check FII exits from domestic stocks. 

“A downside risk to the lowered GDP forecast at 6.9 per cent in FY20 due to global growth headwinds and slowdown in domestic consumption hurt investor sentiment,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. 

The 30-share Sensex ended the day 286 points, or 0.77 per cent, lower at 36,690, with 22 stocks ending in the red. Nifty closed the day at 10,855, down 93 points, or 0.85 per cent.

Path ahead: The company’s priority now is to scale up recent product launches and achieve profitable growth.


Higher costs: On the cost front, the company witnessed moderate inflation in prices of key raw materials for the bakery business. However, an inordinate increase in milk prices impacted profitability of its dairy business adversely.

12,2019-08-09,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Britannia Industries is likely to report a 12-15 per cent YoY rise in June quarter profit on a 9-10 per cent rise in sales on Friday. Volumes are seen growing 5-6 per cent. All eyes would be on commentary on new launches, completion of a plant and change in competitiveness post GST, especially after the rise in taxes in the value segment, said analysts.

HDFC Securities expects Britannia to report a 12.1 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 290 crore on a 9.1 per cent YoY rise in net sales at Rs 2,780 crore. It sees volume growing at 6 per cent compared with 7 per cent in March quarter and 12.5 per cent in the year-ago quarter. 

“Benign input inflation and cost-control initiatives would result in 20 bps expansion in Ebitda margin to 15.5 per cent. Ebitda will grow by 10.5 per cent,” the brokerage said.

IIFL Institutional Equities is expecting Britannia Industries to report a volume growth of 6.5 per cent and sales growth of 10.5 per cent for the quarter, which would be similar to March quarter results.

“Gross margin expansion should moderate to 65 bps from 266 bps in the previous quarter, as the input commodity basket for Britannia is witnessed inflationary pressure. This along with lower employee costs would offset higher other expenses, resulting in flattish Ebitda margin. Higher other income would result in PAT growth of 13 per cent,” the brokerage said.

Nirmal Bang Securities sees 15.3 per cent profit and 13.1 per cent sales growth. It sees Ebitda margin at 15.8 per cent compared with 15.6 per cent in March quarter and 15.3 per cent in the year-ago quarter."

13,2019-08-09,Britannia,"Britannia Industries on Friday said its consolidated net profit dropped 2.78 per cent on year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 251.03 crore for the June quarter compared with Rs 258.22 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. 

Analysts in an ET Now poll had projected the profit at Rs 282 crore. 

Adjusted net profit was up 3 per cent YoY at Rs 267 crore.

The consolidated revenue rose 6 per cent YoY to Rs Rs 2,677 crore for the quarter ended June 2019, the company said in a BSE filing.

The consolidated margin came in at 14.6 per cent against ET Now poll estimate of 15.1 per cent.

“We outpaced the market and strengthened our position during this phase of sluggish demand. Our priority is to scale up the recent product launches and achieve profitable growth,” said Managing Director Varun Berry. 

On the cost front, Berry said, the company witnessed moderate inflation in the prices of key raw materials for the bakery business. 

“However, the inordinate increase in milk prices impacted profitability of our dairy business adversely. We strengthened our brand equity through focused campaigns and invested in building capabilities & structures for both our base business & strategic business units to drive future growth,” Berry said.

With a focus on tightening our belt in this phase of low growths, Britannia said, it has accelerated the cost efficiency initiatives to maintain the shape of business. 

It expects the government to take measures to boost the economy and get it back on a high growth trajectory."

22,2019-08-13,Britannia,"The July to September quarter is a challenging period for most of the auto ancillaries. We will have to wait and see the demand revival somewhere in the festive season to get a view on the particular subject, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


On Friday, the Motherson Sumi stock was buzzing about 9%. The numbers are a little mixed with the big profit dip coming in. What next is in store for some of these ancillary plays with global exposure?After having listened to the commentary of most of the ancillary companies, two things come out very clearly. Everybody is expecting some kind of a revival in the business, during the festive season in September and October. That is the first take and till now, most of the companies are running low on capacity utilisation and in some cases, the cut is as high as 25% on the capacity utilisation.

From that perspective, it is clear that the July to September quarter is not going to be a very encouraging one for many of the ancillary companies. At the same time, those with export business to bank upon, are relatively better off because the order book continues to flow for them as far as the execution is concerned. 

Also, as raw material prices are down, that would have a breather effect for many of the companies as far as the margins are concerned. Even though the output would be less, the margins are expected to be protected at the lower levels. They are not likely to be worse off from that point of view. The July to September quarter is a challenging period for most of the ancillaries. We will have to wait and see the demand revival somewhere in the festive season to get a view on the particular subject.


A meeting with the finance minister took place. A lot of issues were spelt out whether it was on FPIs but even particularly on the concerns within the banking space as a whole. What did you make of that?Well, I guess, they have appraised the finance minister and the government about the situation on the ground and it has been taken very positively by the people who have met the delegation. From that perspective, one has got a reasonable good hope right now that the government is on to the action mode and probably in the next few days or a couple of weeks, you should be seeing actions coming in. 

Prime Minister himself is on record saying that he wants to take some of the policy measures to beat this particular slowdown and revive the economy. So, certainly one could be really hopeful at this point of time. Whatever representation had to take place from industry captains as well as from the financial market player, I guess it has been done and probably we will have to wait and see the announcement coming from their side. 


The fact is the numbers have disappointed this time. There was weak volume growth. Ten quarter low margins. Having said that, this is one of those keep kind of stocks. Would you want to use the decline in Britannia as a buying opportunity or wait for volume uptick?The current dip in the volume is probably temporary and there is a relatively stable demand coming in. You should be seeing better times going forward for many of the food companies, FMCG companies in the system. Certainly the argument should be in favour of buying the stock. However, the question remains at what valuation? This company has never been cheap and currently despite correcting prices, it is still not cheap. 

It will not become very cheap but one will have to buy at least 1.5 to 2 years in advance as far as the valuations are concerned and start fetching the return out of this kind of investment over a longer period of time. Unless you see a meaningful correction in the price, then you are very lucky to buy at lower levels. 

We will have to follow this approach of buying expensive and stay put on this particular investment for some time as far as looking at the valuation, the value of the portfolio and allow it to appreciate after two years’ time from the investments.


Where do you see oil prices headed?The global demand for oil is growing at less than 1% rate of growth and given that kind of situation, the oil prices cannot be stronger. That is something very obvious and clear. At the same time, most of the oil producing countries are today managing the oil prices with the kind of supply cut and as a result, they are stabilised. 

Otherwise, this kind of oil prices could probably go down further in my view point. Given that situation, I would not advocate that it will crash but my reading says that somewhere depending on the source of production and the rate of production, you would be seeing the mark up over about 10% or so on that particular production. So, safely assume that the $55-65 range for the oil would be a more stable range, wherein the producer also will be profitable and at the same time, the consumer also would not face much pain buying oil at such levels. That should be the price trajectory going forward for oil in coming quarters.


Are markets too optimistic about festival demand revival? Nothing magical is going to happen between August 15 and end or middle of October. Last year, the festive season demand was a complete dampener. But markets are very optimistic about revival. Maybe they are not realistic?The first point is that we are not expecting any kind of a V-shape recovery at least as far as the demand revival is concerned. We are hoping that there would be support from consumer demand after the good rains and also the festive season. Counting one more additional variable which is going to be a little more positive is the public sector spending on infrastructure projects. 

That should ultimately leave more money in the hands of the masses and that could possibly stabilise the demand at the lower levels. Certainly, one is not arguing for a V-shaped recovery in the demand. The demand recovery would probably take some time. In auto sector, I guess the demand would probably remain tight till the BS VI vehicles are launched and the pricing on that is fully absorbed in the market. That is the challenge one will have to face in the second half of the financial year. Let us wait and see. The market sentiment could be arrested with some stability in demand coming in from the rural markets.


The more I look at it the more I realise that the selloff in July and early August had nothing to do with fundamentals. It had to do a lot with sentiment. If the sentiment revives because of FPI, LTCG roll back, and there is a relief on that front, could markets go back to pre-budget levels?A few things are responsible for the nervousness in the market. On one side, the regulatory framework is very unfriendly towards the investors. The series of margin increase which has happened is basically asking people to stay away from the market and only allowing the large traders in the system to trade and operate and manipulate the market. So, that is one area of nervousness as far as the market technicals are concerned which is hardly talked about but it is a reality. 

On the other side, the market definitely wants a positive commentary from the government side on various measures that they have taken and are reluctant to accept. Some of the mistakes which may probably have happened in the budget, particularly in the area of collection of the tax and management of taxes, are definitely affecting the market mood and sentiment. 

The hard reality on the ground is that the circulation of money is definitely affected and most of the traders and the markets are finding it difficult to collect the money from the data. So, this is a reality and that is where people want some amount of help as far as the lending institutions are concerned. 

Other than that, there are other issues, particularly the reluctance in banks and NBFCs to lend money and the cost at which they are lending. There are very few buyers at this point of time. But on the corporate side, they probably are more reluctant to borrow money from the banking system today and putting their house in order. All of this has cumulatively affected the sentiments and the moods of the people in the markets. 

The fundamentals have not got affected as badly as the sentiment. A revival of sentiment is possible through the measures which are required to be taken."
23,2019-08-13,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Britannia Industries fell nearly 4 per cent in Tuesday’s trade after tepid June quarter results made several foreign brokerages cut target price on the counter.

The FMCG major on Friday reported a tepid 2.78 per cent YoY drop in profit at Rs 251.03 crore for the June quarter. It clocked 3 per cent YoY growth in volumes, which was soft considering the company’s past track record. With Tuesday's fall, the scrip is down 21 per cent in last one year, but analysts do not expect the near-term weakness to go away as yet.

CLSA has cut its target to Rs 2,665 from Rs 3,125, as it reduced earnings estimate for the biscuit maker by 7-9 per cent. The brokerage also lowered its rating on the stock to 'underperform' from 'outperform' earlier. 

JP Morgan has cut its target on the stock to Rs 3,000 per share from Rs 3,200 per share as it expects muted demand scenario to weigh on the near-term growth, even as the company’s focus on market share gain and innovation stays, it said. 

Domestic brokerages also have cut their targets on the counter. 

Nirmal bang Institutional Equities has a buy rating on the stock but has revised downward its target on the stock to Rs 3,380 from Rs 3,500.

“Britannia has driven profitable growth in the last few years. However, weak macros and consumer sentiment pose challenges. Also, inter-corporate deposit exposures raise corporate governance concerns, even as they have declined in a quarter by 30 per cent to Rs 500 crore,” said HDFC Institutional Equities. 

This brokerage admires the brand equity, strategy and management execution skills and is positive of the management’s focus on expanding the addressable market but wants to await concrete evidence for an upgrade. For now, it has a neutral rating on the stock with a target of Rs 2,674.

The shares of the company closed 2.96 per cent lower at 2510.55 on BSE."

25,2019-08-16,Britannia,"By Pradipta Mukherjee and P R Sanjai

Indians are cutting back on spending from hair oils to motorcycles in a fresh sign that the slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy is becoming more entrenched.

That is likely to add pressure on policymakers to ease both fiscal and monetary policy in the coming months at a time when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tours the country to meet various stakeholders and lobby groups. The Reserve Bank of India has lowered interest rates to a nine-year low, but that impact is yet to be felt due to tardy monetary policy transmission and subdued demand for loans.

On Friday, Hero MotoCorp Ltd., the country’s largest two-wheeler maker, said it had shut its manufacturing facility for three days until Aug. 18 in response partly to “the market demand scenario” and inventory management. The same day, Sundaram-Clayton Ltd., an auto parts supplier, said it will shut its factory in Padi in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu for two days until Aug. 17, citing “business slowdown across sectors.”

Mirroring the sentiment about weak consumption, Emami Ltd., a cosmetics to healthcare conglomerate, said that the company was witnessing lower demand for its hair care products.

“We are doing some cost optimization,” Priti A. Sureka, a director at Emami said in an interview in Kolkata.

Earlier this month, the company reported earnings that missed estimates as revenues took a hit, highlighting similar struggles among consumer good makers including Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and Britannia Industries Ltd. This does not bode well for India’s overall growth rate, which has been hit by slowing public spending and a cutback in private consumption.

Official gross domestic numbers for the June quarter are due Aug. 30 and analysts forecast the economy to have expanded 6.1% from a year ago, which is higher than the five-year low of 5.8% seen in the January to March quarter, but well below the 7-8% pace seen in the past few years.

A shadow-banking crisis for the past one year has weighed on private consumption which contributes nearly 60% to the GDP. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the central bank highlighted worries about job losses with a subdued economy keeping many from spending."

28,2019-08-17,Britannia,"Sample gift boxes and wicker baskets are stacked in a corner of the conference room of Candor Foods’ offices in an industrial cluster of Navi Mumbai. The weeks leading up to Diwali in October will be the company’s busiest, as demand for its products - dried fruits and nuts - soars.

In a 30,000-sq ft facility on the same premises, Candor Foods will process around 8,000 kg of almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, dates, etc, to meet that demand, up from a current average of 4,500 kg now. “We expect business this Diwali to be around the same as last year,” says chief executive Yash Gawdi. Bags of raw nuts, fresh off a truck, await their turn to be taken in. A young man puts a lid on a plastic jar of trail mix, seals it with a machine and repeats the process with speed and precision.

Candor also makes cereal bars and flavoured peanuts. Gawdi’s forecast for Diwali may come as a surprise to many in the backdrop of the steady drumbeat of reports about a slowing economy and job losses. Plummeting vehicle sales, a rise in unsold apartments and a troubled shadow banking sector have caused the likes of Bajaj’s Rahul Bajaj, L&T’s AM Naik and HDFC’s Deepak Parekh to speak out about the gravity of the economic crisis over the past few weeks. The Indian economy grew at 6.8% in 2018-19 — its lowest in five years.

Their concerns were backed by more troubling data recently when industrial output in 11 of the 23 manufacturing segments contracted in April-June 2019, compared with the same period last year. But there were also sectors that bucked the trend, such as food production, apparel and steel, which grew at a faster clip than in 2018.


Source: Central Statistics Office (CSO)
This is a clear sign that the slowdown narrative is not uniform across the manufacturing spectrum. Manufacturing accounts for over 16% of the Indian economy and employs 13% of the country’s workforce. The pockets of growth in manufacturing may disappear if some of the struggling sectors, which are also big employers, do not recover in the next few months. Companies like Candor might start feeling the pinch and Gawdi knows it. “The repercussions of the slowdown are definitely going to be there in other sectors, too. Since food is a basic commodity, it will be hit last.”


Source: Central Statistics Office (CSO)
Candor, which supplies to the likes of Amazon, Grofers and Future Retail, reported revenues of over Rs 50 crore in 2018-19 and Gawdi’s target is Rs 100 crore this fiscal. What works in Candor’s favour, according to Gawdi, is that dried fruits and nuts are increasingly becoming a part of the monthly shopping list for consumers. Candor sells under its own label and also produces for retailers’ private labels. Manufacturing of food products saw an annual growth of around 15% in April-June 2019 in the index of industrial production (IIP). The growth in the corresponding period last year was 12%. Food processing contributes around 9% to India’s manufacturing output, as per government data.

Amit Kumat, CEO of Indore-based Prataap Snacks, which makes the Yellow Diamond brand of chips, says more expensive foods like Candor’s will feel the effects of a consumption slump before his company, most of whose products are priced at Rs 5. DK Joshi, chief economist at rating agency Crisil, concurs. “Our sense is that companies which produce small-ticket items have a better chance in this environment.” But biscuit-maker Britannia Industries’ managing director Varun Berry was recently quoted as saying that consumers are thinking twice before buying even Rs 5 packs. Britannia saw its annual volume growth in the first quarter of 2018-19 halve to 6%, compared with the year-ago period. Hindustan Unilever, too, saw its volume growth slip to 5% from 12%. But Joshi cautions against jumping to conclusions from the performance of a few companies.

Another sector that clocked a similar growth rate was apparel— it had contracted 5% in the first quarter of last fiscal. Apparel exports stood at around $4.2 billon, or Rs 29,000 crore, in April-June 2019 — a 7% rise in rupee terms and a 3% increase in dollar terms, though there was a dip in June, according to commerce ministry data. But India still has a long way to go, with its share of the global apparel market at just 4% in 2017, compared with China’s 35%, Bangladesh’s 6.5% and Vietnam’s 6%, as per the World Trade Organization.

“The government should encourage exports of readymade garments instead of raw cotton and yarn. That’s where Bangladesh and Vietnam have an advantage,” says Raja M Shanmugam, president of Tirupur Exporters Association. He adds that there is also a growing domestic market, which is five times bigger than the export market. “The fact that many global brands are coming to India is an indication. Also, now people wear different clothes through the day— fitness wear, formal wear, social wear and nightwear.” Moreover, the rising number of people shopping online could also spur demand for apparel since the segment accounts for around 30% of e-commerce transactions, second only to electronics, which comprise half the total, according to the commerce ministry. But the threat India faces from other countries in the export market could hurt it in the domestic market too, according to Vijay Kumar, a garment-maker in Tirupur. “Indian retailers are increasingly sourcing from countries like Bangladesh because it is cheaper.” The primary reason for that, he says, is Bangladesh’s wages are a third of what it is in India. When discretionary spends start to go down during a downturn, what could be affected before apparel are mobile phones and consumer durables, as these have much higher price tags and are often linked to financing by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which have been staring at a severe liquidity crunch. But smartphone sales continue to be strong. Indians bought around 37 million smartphones in April-June, a 10% rise from last year, according to IDC, a research firm. IDC expects growth to continue in the rest of 2019. But it is a mixed bag in consumer durables, which reported a 2% growth in manufacturing output in April-June over last year.

Air-conditioners and refrigerators saw their sales rise 20% and 15%, respectively, in the same period, thanks to an unusually hot summer, according to Kamal Nandi, president of the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association. AC sales had declined 5% and TV sales had risen 3% in the first quarter of 2018-19. India had a heat wave for 32 straight days this year, the longest since 1988, according to Skymet Weather Services.

Television sales, however, did not grow despite the Cricket World Cup. Various reasons are being ascribed to it, including the shift of discretionary spending from TVs to ACs and the attraction of mobile phones over TVs as the primary media consumption device for the young. Nandi, who is also the business head of Godrej Appliances, believes the overall sentiment in the economy might impact consumer purchase behaviour. “But with interest rates going down, EMIs will also reduce.” The Reserve Bank of India earlier this month cut the benchmark interest rate for the fourth time this year. The rate is now the lowest since 2010. While consumer-led sectors like apparel and consumer durables bet big on Diwali, there are some manufacturing segments like steel, which rely on government spending for growth. Steel output grew 14% annually in April-June, compared with a 2% growth in the same period in 2018.

Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings, says the government’s infrastructure creation and affordable housing programme could be driving the demand for steel. The government plans to spend Rs 100 trillion on infrastructure in the next five years and build nearly 20 million affordable homes in the next three years. “We are cautious about the automotive space… but optimistic about infrastructure, solar power and appliances,” Jayant Acharya, director, commercial and marketing, JSW Steel, told ET last month.

Passenger vehicle sales saw their worst annual decline in 19 years in July and India intends to more than triple its installed solar capacity to 100 GW by March 2022. Auto contributes less than a tenth of the steel consumption in India, with more than 60% coming from construction and infrastructure. The affordable housing push and the Smart Cities Mission will also drive demand for commodities such as copper and aluminium, notes Sabnavis. The output of basic metals rose 16% in April-June. Cement output, on the other hand, grew only 1.2%. Real estate, which consumes two-thirds of India’s cement production, is ailing, in part due to lack of funds in light of the NBFC crisis. Around 1.74 lakh apartments across seven cities are stalled due to lack of financing or litigation, as per Anarock Property Consultants. “The muted growth in cement could also be because of the double-digit growth in April-June 2018,” says Sabnavis.

Another sector heavily dependent on real estate is furniture, whose output saw a 10% decline in the first three months of this fiscal. But the manufacture of wood, which is also used in packing and construction, saw an 18% jump. It could also have been helped by an 8% rise in exports in that period.

Tobacco products’ output also grew by 6% in April-June compared with an 18% decline a year ago. It is hard to look for corroboration in cigarettes, since they account for just a tenth of total tobacco consumption, and two-thirds of tobacco industry is unorganised. “Therefore, IIP numbers in the tobacco segment are not necessarily representative of the cigarette sector trends,” says a spokesperson for ITC. Legal cigarette volumes have been declining at an annual rate of 4% since 2010-11, even as illicit cigarettes sales have grown 5%, according to ITC.

Unlike the sectors dependent on consumption demand or government spending, pharma is relatively immune to a slowdown. Having medicines prescribed to you for an illness is not a choice like buying a phone or a pair of jeans.

Siddhant Khandekar, an analyst with ICICI Securities, expects the sector to grow at around 10% in 2019-20 — the same rate as last fiscal. The output of pharma products rose 7% in April-June. In addition to domestic demand for medicines, the easing of the pricing pressure caused by increased competition in the US, which accounts for a third of India’s exports, could also help. There is no looking away from troubling signs about the economy. But for now, some sectors within manufacturing are still growing, a few even at a higher rate than last year. But if consumers decide to hold back their spending further, fearing worse days to come, it could make a bad situation much worse."
27,2019-08-17,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the red, following mixed macroeconomic data amid fears of a global economic slowdown. 

The 30-share Sensex shed 231 points, or 0.62 per cent, to end at 37,350 for the week ended August 16. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty lost 61.85 points, or 0.56 per cent, to end at 11,047.

The market kicked off the week on a bleak note on Tuesday as sentiment got hit after government data showed that India’s factory output growth, as measured by IIP, slowed down for the second straight month to 2 per cent in June compared with 7 per cent in June, 2018 and 3.1 per cent in May, 2019. 

However, the market pared some of the losses in the remaining two days of trade amid hope of a stimulus package for the economy from the government. Investors also took comfort as India’s retail inflation based on CPI eased to 3.15 per cent in July, 2019 from 3.18 per cent in June, 2019 and 4.17 per cent in July, 2018. WPI inflation also eased to a multi-year low of 1.08 per cent in the month of July, on account of cheaper fuel and food items. 

Meanwhile, trade deficit, the gap between imports and exports, narrowed to $13.43 billion in July from $18.63 billion a year ago, helped by a lower oil import bill.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the week. 


Stars of the week
Reliance Industries (RIL) advanced 10 per cent after Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) with Saudi Aramco to sell a 20 per cent stake in the oil-to-chemicals business. Besides, he also unveiled plans for launch of Reliance Jio Infocomm’s broadband services and a partnership with Microsoft to accelerate digital transformation of the Indian economy. Shares of the company jumped to Rs 1,278 as of August 16 from Rs 1,162 on August 9.

Indiabulls Housing Finance (up 9 per cent), Zee Entertainment (up 5.64 per cent), GAIL (up 4.68 per cent) and Power Grid (up 4.53 per cent) were among other top gainers in the Nifty index for the week ended August 16.

With a fall of 5.61 per cent, Eicher Motors finished as top index loser for the week. Wipro, Adani Ports, HDFC, NTPC, TCS, Britannia and YES Bank declined between 3 and 5 per cent. Auto majors came under pressure after SIAM reported that automobile sales in the country witnessed sharpest decline in nearly 19 years in July, dropping 18.71 per cent, which currently also led to almost 15,000 job losses over the past three months. Maruti Suzuki shares slipped around 2 per cent to Rs 5,975 from Rs 6,100.

IDBI Bank

Shares of IDBI Bank tumbled over 9 per cent to Rs 24.90 on August 16 from Rs 27.40 on August 9. Life Insurance of Corporation of India (LIC)-owned IDBI Bank net losses widen to Rs 3,801 crore in the quarter ended June on higher provision for NPAs. The lender had posted a net loss of Rs 2,410 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.


HEG slipped over 4%

26,2019-08-17,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: An ad war has begun between two consumer goods majors — Amul and Britannia — and the bone of contention is the good old butter in cookies.

Amul recently released an ad, claiming that other biscuit manufacturers used just 0.3-3% butter and 20-22% vegetable oil in their cookies. Even though the creative did not name Britannia’s Good Day, the picture used was indicative of the brand. The ad also claimed that Amul’s own Butter Cookie had 25% butter and no vegetable oil.

In an apparent response, Britannia released an ad which posed a question to the consumer: “How much cholesterol does a 25% butter cookie have? Approximately 7 times cholesterol.” Britannia too did not name any competitors.

Amul managing director RS Sodhi said Britannia’s was a misleading claim. “If vegetable oil is as healthy as they claim, then why do they call their biscuit ‘Butter Cookie’ on the packet. Why not refer to them as palm oil cookie? As a brand we operate in a pure category and from Mr V Kurien, we have learnt never to cheat customers,” Sodhi said, referring to father of the white revolution who played a key role in the formation of Amul.

Britannia did not respond to an email seeking comment.



The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a self-regulatory voluntary organisation of the advertising industry, said comparative advertising was permissible. “Brands, from beverages to detergents, have been doing comparative advertising for a long time. However, the claims they make have to be factually correct and truthful,” said Shweta Purandare, its secretary-general. She did not reveal if ASCI had received complaints over the ads.

Debate over the advertisements has spilled over onto social media platform Twitter.

User @alibehzaad tweeted: “Amul has taken its long traditional route of emphasising on butter. Amul has a loyal and vociferous consumer base. With high cholesterol pitch Britannia has just differentiated itself, and may fight for market share in space which is overlapping. Amul has a higher emotional pitch.”

One @ghuubear tweeted: “Cholesterol from butter has no negative impact on health but these guys are perpetuating the same myth. Either they haven't read up enough or know it but still chose to go with the narrative of ‘cholesterol is bad for you’. Dishonest marketing either way.”"

But three stocks – Nestle, Marico and Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare – have stood apart and hovered around their new peaks on the bourses on Wednesday.

The country’s largest biscuit maker, Parle Products, on Tuesday said it may let go of 8,000-10,000 people if the ongoing consumption slowdown persists. 

Nestle India Chairman & Managing Director Suresh Narayanan told PTI earlier that the FMCG sector is unlikely to touch double-digit growth, but will not see de-growth as witnessed by some other sectors, like auto.

Shares of Nestle and GlaxoSmithklne Consumer hit all-time highs at Rs 12,523 and Rs 8,010 on Wednesday, while Marico scaled its record high of Rs 401 on August 19.

Nestle shares advanced as much as 5 per cent on hopes that the stock may be in the reckoning for inclusion in the Nifty50 index after NSE tweaked the qualification norms on Tuesday. 

GlaxoSmithklne Consumer posted strong operating profit performance for June quarter driven by some cost-saving initiatives. 

“We are also overweight on the FMCG pack,” said Dhananjay Sinha, Head of Strategy Research and Chief Economist, IDFC Securities.

“HUL, Dabur and Marico besides electric consumer durables firm Crompton Consumers are the four stocks we have chosen to bet on,” he said in an interaction with ETNow.

Marico on August 1 reported a 21.6 per cent growth in June quarter profit at Rs 315 crore compared with Rs 250 crore in the year-on period.

Shares of other FMCG firms such as McLeod Russel, Kwality, LT Foods, Heritage Foods, Parag Milk Foods, Prabhat Dairy, Future Consumer, Bajaj Consumer Care, Tata Coffee, Godrej Consumer Products and Britannia are down 20-90 per cent so far this year.

Last month, market researcher Nielsen revised its growth forecast for the FMCG sector to 9-10 per cent for 2019 from its previous outlook of 11-12 per cent, citing a sharp rural slowdown. Nielsen said the slowdown was significant across all food as well as non-food categories, with salty snacks, biscuits, spices, soaps and packaged tea categories showing major slowdown in consumption. 

Citing Nielsen data, industry officials said growth in the FMCG sector has declined in last four quarters since July-September 2018 – both in value and volume terms – as consumers down-traded to lower-priced daily use products in urban markets while rural growth slowed."

35,2019-08-21,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The country’s largest biscuit maker Parle Products said on Tuesday that it may have to let go of 8,000-10,000 people if the ongoing consumption slowdown persists, indicating that all’s probably not well with the economy.

“We have sought reduction in the goods and services tax (GST) on biscuits priced at Rs 100 per kg or below, which are typically sold in packs of Rs 5 and below, but if the government doesn’t provide that stimulus, then we have no choice but to let go of 8,000-10,000 people from our workforce across factories as slowing sales are severely impacting us,” said Mayank Shah, category head of Parle Products.

With sales of over Rs 10,000 crore, Parle, which makes the popular Parle-G, Monaco and Marie brand of biscuits, employs 1 lakh people, and operates 10 company-owned plants, in addition to 125 third party manufacturing facilities. More than half of Parle’s sales come from rural markets.

The sub-below Rs 100 per kg biscuits were taxed at 12% under the previous tax regime, and firms had expected the GST rate to be fixed at 12% for premium biscuits and 5% for the lower-priced ones. But after the government introduced the GST two years back, all biscuits were brought under the 18% tax structure, forcing companies to increase prices which affected sales. Parle, too, had increased prices by about 5%, which led to sales declining significantly, Shah said.

Another biscuit and dairy products giant Britannia managing director Varun Berry had voiced similar concerns last week when he had said consumers are even hesitating to buy Rs 5 packs of biscuits. At a post-earnings conference call, Berry had said that consumers are thinking twice before buying even a Rs 5 worth of product, indicating a “serious issue in the economy”.

“We’ve only grown 6% and the market is growing slower than that,” Berry said in the call. The Nusli Wadia-promoted company’s net profit fell 3.5% year-on-year to Rs 249 crore for the quarter ended April-June 2019.

Parle’s Shah said with consumers downgrading over the past two quarters, offtake from retailers is getting severely impacted. “Weakening consumer demand is because of increased GST on biscuits and worsened by the absence of adequate government stimulus. We have multiple biscuit brands that are aimed at mid- and low-income consumers which form the core consumer base of a category such as ours, and we are hoping the GST increase will be rolled back if the government wants to revive demand,” he said. Low-priced biscuits anyway operate on low margins.

Last month, market researcher Nielsen had revised its growth forecast for the FMCG sector to 9-10% in 2019 from its previous outlook of 11-12%, citing a sharp rural slowdown. Nielsen said the slowdown was significant across all food as well as non-food categories, with categories such as salty snacks, biscuits, spices, soaps and packaged tea leading a slowing consumption.

Citing Nielsen data, industry officials said growth in the FMCG sector has declined in the past four quarters consecutively since July-September 2018 – both by value and volume – as consumers down-traded to lower-priced daily use products in urban markets and rural growth slowed."

Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Buy on decline is out, sell on rally is out, sell and go away is the fashionable word am I right?As you rightly said, what has happened is that after three years of flat Nifty earnings, people thought in 2019 you will get a 20% plus earnings growth and the long awaited earnings revival will be around the corner. After the first quarter, you suddenly see that 20-25% earnings growth expectation has been slashed to 15%-18%. If you are knocking off close to 6%-8% in the first quarter itself and with the incremental clarity also not being very positive, people feel that by the time the year gets done, there might actually be another year of the same tepid flattish growth or a decline, because you have to factor in the three important state elections coming up in the next four months.

Hopefully, the thrust on government spending which was not there in the last four months, will start coming back and there will be some amount of government expenditure. Looking at the state plus centre fiscal deficits and the fact that the revenue collection has not been robust, one does not know because the options are limited. 

If that engine does not fire, honestly you could see September quarter earnings to be even worse than the June one. Today the scare is that if a market is trading at 19 times and the outlook for earnings is not that great, one really does not know then. Probably, what you said, just sell and go away is the order for the foreseeable future.


You would not start bottom fishing in autos just yet, would you?In fact, today the way to look at is that monsoon is the absolute short term trigger now versus a fortnight back. The rain news has been good and therefore there is at least some amount of uplift there. Plus last month, we saw the inventories in the system had run down significantly and this we discussed last week as well. As a result, some amount of risk taking has started in auto names because of the fact that they have corrected so significantly. Maybe a section of the market is trying to see value but will that sustain? If the August numbers do not show a good trend, then may be, despondency will set in.


Would you still be looking for value? Would you be sitting on the sidelines? If it is the heavyweights, would you be looking at the likes of banks, Reliance?The market is actually faced with the conundrum here because one section is fairly valued where people expect growth. In case of a domestic slowdown, that growth is under question and then there is a section which is completely bombed out. You are getting it at half time book but since those are global sectors, people are wondering if it is the right time to get in with the trade war scare. 

At an aggregate level, the earnings are not showing any great revival and therefore at 18-19 times, one is really wondering whether one should sit on cash and wait for better prices and points of entry. Today at 18-19 times, I need to look at either some sort of an investment demand kicking in or a job growth. Both are not as apparent or visible to the investor now. I think that is where lack of confidence shows up.


Any specific stocks you want to highlight today?It is better if one sticks to dividend yield plays or may be utilities where at least you have fixed returns and hence those may be better stocks to hide.


Britannia is down 20% and Nestle is up 12% why?It has something to do with the grammage aspect. Also, post the management changes, Britannia has gone from single digit EBITDA margin to now the mid teens. After having done that, there was a lot of agri inflation that they had to bear, the advertising spends went up and all that started hitting at a time where the general propensity to spend is low. 

When your top line is not growing and suddenly the cost starts coming under pressure, the profits that had built up that visibility, reduces markedly. This is why people do not have that kind of confidence going forward. On Nestle, on the other hand, after the entire Maggi problem, the way they cleaned out the inventory, the way they went on a complete image overhaul and the fact that now they have ensured that the brand extensions of Maggi are something that appeals across genres and it is an every time, every day snack. The rural plus urban is a good mix for Nestle as far as Maggi is concerned and that is why some of the other categories are ensuring that growth is delivered. Basically, at the end of the day, it is visibility and that’s what people are willing to pay for.


Is a trend emerging in IT and pharma?The way the rupee has been moving in the last 7-10 days, is giving rise to optimism that the global cyclical sectors might be a better place to hide in case the domestic slowdown gets elongated in the very richly valued, domestic-facing plays. These stocks have high valuations, high ownership are chances of selling pressure is also likely to be there. That is the reason why the ownership of pharma is low relative to other sectors and the falling rupee should give a fillip to the earnings there as well. 

People want to position themselves but in my mind, it is basically a high trade because even the last June quarter earnings do not give that kind of optimism and maybe there is still some pain left there. Also valuations are not cheap. Most pharma stocks are still probably around market multiples of 18-20 times. So chances of getting a great bargain there is less


The pain in Yes Bank continues and the stock is now at a fresh 52-week low. I though the exposure would stop at DHFL and Indiabulls or ADA. Now it is Cox & Kings and Crompton?Well every time you have something…


What have they done and how come nobody figured out? RBI gave them a clean chit. None of the analysts said they were not happy with the growth they were doing. India was growing at 20%-15%, Yes Bank was growing at 40% and it became the darling for everyone. Today we can blame the management. Somewhere, the whole disclosure angle comes up. That is why the auditors are being questioned because ultimately for an investor what you get is the annual report and the financial data which is certified by an auditing firm. One would assume that the checks and balances have been seen through. Now the idea is that the due diligence is not that deep down for a minority investor or for an institutional investor also because this is something that normally a PE investor does before they take big stakes in a company. So, if that is not getting played out and as far as Yes Bank is concerned, as we have maintained earlier, the real confidence will come once you have some visibility on how this capital that has been raised is actually put to use. 

If it still goes for ensuring that the capital adequacy is maintained, then that shows the growth is still not being serviced. Probably after this fundraise, the funds flow through the system will help for a couple of quarters and the second fundraise because will come as that is what the management has hinted at. That will be the real conformation that the worst is behind us.


How are you reading into this situation and for an investor and NMDC, which would come as a big shocker? Could it really be as extended and prolonged a case as some of the brokerages seem to be indicating?When it comes to the judiciary and their decision making, especially in terms of mining rise etc., it is a difficult call to take from an investing outcome perspective. What I can evaluate is that Rs 90 is a good yield play on the stock. In terms of growth, realisations, volume all moving parts are subject to an outcome of how the mining ban goes through. 

For an investor to be able to take a call especially, in the backdrop that globally you are seeing iron ore has been quite volatile because the moment the entire supply disruption squeeze has been coming back in line. The prices have normalised but at the same time the HR prices are down almost from $650 to about 540 now. The realisation is not the story as far as the metal complex goes and NMDC is anyway a domestic play. So what do I value here? The only thing is probably it is a dividend yield which is also a function that hopefully since the government revenues are under pressure, the dividend will still be paid out. That is the only yield play I get."
47,2019-08-22,Britannia,"KOLKATA: FMCG major Britannia Industries plans to increase prices of its products marginally in the third quarter of the current fiscal to tackle the slowdown which has taken a toll on the growth of its sales in value terms, a company official said on Thursday. 

He said that the slowdown had been witnessed in the last five to six months and the period till January would ""not be easy"". 

""In the third quarter, slight increase in prices will happen"", Vinay Subramanyam, Head (marketing) of Britannia Industries told reporters here. 

Biscuit as a food product is price elastic and has a huge market penetration across the country, he said adding that the growth in sales of the company had halved in terms of value as a result of slowdown. 

""We have started seeing the slowdown five to six months back. The next five to six months are not going to be easy and there is lack of optimism"", Subramanyam said. 

He said the company is ""watching the situation very closely and expecting a positive impact of the monsoon"". 

Besides marginal price increase, the company would also go for cost optimisation, he said. 

""We have to be more efficient in operations including reduction in logistics expenses. Despite the slowdown, the company had been gaining market share and will continue to focus on major brands,"" he said. 

Subramanyam said Britannia's market share across the country was 33 per cent, putting it in the leadership position and the eastern India is ""an important market for the company""."

43,2019-08-22,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: As India's consumption breakdown begins to bite, the focus is firmly shifting to the four big buttresses that once kept the consumer economy rolling but are now floundering.

Traditionally, the bulls have emerged from the shadows whenever these four have had good numbers to show. When they haven't, the bears have taken over. Each of them starts with B, and each of them is doing pretty badly.

Biscuits, briefs, bikes and booze: These 4 categories have long been among the most accurate gauges of discretionary spending, and by extension, of the consumer's belief in the economy.

Although the 4 Bs tell the consumption story only in part — there exist several other high-frequency gauges — they are seen as adequately highlighting the direction that the consumption economy, and thus GDP, is taking. Here's a one-by-one look at these important markers and the signals they are giving out.


The cookie crumbles
Parle Products, the biscuit bellwether that employs 1 lakh workers, has just hit the alarm button amid the worsening consumption crisis. In a move that shows all isn't well with the economy, the country's biggest biscuit producer and the maker of Parle-G, Monaco and Marie said it could end up mass-firing as many as 10,000 employees if slowdown pains did not subside.

Parle is hardly alone in this bitter harvest at a time when biscuits and salty snacks have been among the most badly hurt FMCG categories. Britannia is on the same boat — amid weak consumer demand, its net profit sank 3.5 per cent in the June quarter.

This fall in sentiment has been widely attributed to listless growth of incomes. Nominal per capita disposable income in India fell to 9.5 per cent between 2015 and 2018 from a high of 13.3 per cent between 2010 and 2014.

Dwindling disposable income is primarily why Indians of all hues have cut down on or delayed buying essential items and even staple consumption items, analysts say.


An inside story
Biscuit's is not a chance fall. The slump in the sale of briefs, or innerwear, is raising a similar red flag for the consumption sector.

Amid rapidly shrinking discretionary buying, the sales growth of innerwear in Indian markets slipped sharply in the quarter ended this June.

During the period, India's top four listed innerwear companies posted the worst numbers in 10 years. The June numbers of Page Industries — the maker of Jockey briefs — were its slowest since 2008. VIP contracted by a sharp 20 per cent, Lux was flat, and Dollar Industries shrank 4 per cent.

As per the legendary Alan Greenspan's ""men’s underwear index"", the sale of men’s underwear is a very efficient indicator of an economy's health — a fall in sales reflects an economy in trouble, and a rise signals good times.


In low spirits
The deep FMCG breakdown hasn't left booze sales unscathed either. Liquor companies were unable to shake off the secular, entrenched slowdown in sales of discretionary consumption items, and beer and spirits sales shrank by as much as a third in April-June 2019.

Sales of booze had steadily been on an upward trajectory since the GST-induced blows got over some three quarters back. But the sector failed to escape the current bout of general degrowth and the trend got firmly reversed in the June quarter.

With lukewarm numbers failing to save sales from going up in smoke, cigarettes don't have a better story to tell for June, either.


A spoke in the wheels
The spoke in the wheels of India's bike industry is now too big to ignore anymore. Two-wheeler sales slipped by a good 16.82 per cent in July, the latest in a series of similar monthly performances.

The commercial vehicle segment fell even more steeply, with sales nosediving by a high 25.71 per cent. The passenger car story for July was much, much worse — sales dropped by a humongous 30.98 per cent, numbers never seen in the last 20 years.

These numbers portend seriously bad tidings for a sector that directly or indirectly employs 37 million workers. The sharp fall in demand has already compelled car/bike makers to cut production, affecting 3,50,000 jobs across the country's auto sector in the last three months alone.

Several hundreds of car showrooms have already shut shop — the likely beginning of an Armageddon for an industry that could see a million more jobs vanish if the slowdown does not ease.


What lies ahead
Nomura yesterday issued the latest of a series of dire warnings: Growth is set to slow further in the April-June quarter to 5.7 per cent.

""High-frequency indicators continue to show familiar pain points – a deep contraction in consumption, weak investment, a slowing external sector and an under-performing services sector,"" the global financial services major said.

The grim prediction came amid fears that slowdown pains may prolong as consumer confidence takes further hits from flat FDI growth and global trade & currency wars. 

Growth in India fell to 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 — the slowest since 2014-15 — largely owing to the travails of consumption, the segment that accounts for over 60 per cent of GDP. With more and more signs of trouble emerging, numbers suggest this slowdown could be deep and could keep the 4 Bs sputtering.

So, what is the likely road ahead for these four pillars of India's consumption story? A lot will become clear on August 30 when official GDP numbers for the April-June quarter are out."

48,2019-08-23,Britannia,"What started as murmur nearly a year ago after the implosion of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services , is turning into hysteria — the demand for a rescue package from the state. It has spread from just the non-banking finance companies to almost everyone in town.

That the conservative custodians of policy making — the Reserve Bank of India, and an eternal optimist like Aditya Puri of HDFC Bank — are admitting to the slowdown, is an indication that the economy needs a push from super powers.

Global giants such as the US, Germany and China are working on both monetary and fiscal stimulus to revive slumping demand — whether it is due to domestic factors or trade war. India too needs one, but unfortunately battered state finances leave little room.

Stimulus is welcome for the industry and consumers because it automatically leads to better material well-being. But the flipside of it is like steroids — a limited quantity during ill-health may be helpful, but abuse leads to lingering side effects. The seeds of the current economic pain were sown in 2008-10 when the stimulus remained in place for long. Promoting consumption isn’t just in the hands of policy makers, but industry too could, provided it has a heart.

Under Governor Shaktikanta Das, monetary authorities have been more than active to do their bit — be it slashing interest rates by 110 basis points, or making the system liquidity surplus. Partly thanks to adopting inflation targeting as a policy objective.

Still the industry says credit is expensive. There’s a reason for it. They should look at the more than Rs 10 lakh crore of loans turning sour because of them. Yes, businesses can fail but should at least refrain from stalling resolution. Frauds such as CG Power, Manpasand Beverages, and resignations of auditors at Reliance Capital and Reliance Power are not covering industry with glory either.

Thankfully, New Delhi doesn’t appear to be indulging in ‘phonebanking’ unlike earlier. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman claiming credit for banks’ clean-up would be lost if the government gets tempted to do so in desperation.

Why are interest rates not falling despite the RBI cut and liquidity push? Bankers say they don’t want to take risk. It’s not just investigative agencies, but untrustworthy borrowers. For now, nudge banks to take risk rather than order. Just take a leaf out of Ben Bernanke’s book and flood the system with liquidity that bankers don’t have a choice than taking risks.

This government repeats its commitment to fiscal deficit targets enshrined in statute even if some numbers are questionable. That may be the right thing to do if the objective is to build long-term trust rather than short-term gratification.

The state can either reduce tax rates or borrow more to build infrastructure. But bond markets would just revolt. Expecting a government that is running a revenue deficit of Rs 4.85 lakh crores, or 2.3 per cent of the gross domestic product to borrow and spend is more fantasy than reality.

Real estate developers are seeking to enhance ‘affordable home’ price ceiling to Rs 1 crore in cities such as Mumbai for buyers’ benefit. The state should sacrifice revenue, but builders not their profits.

Some worrying scenarios have been projected at Parle, Britannia, Maruti and others where thousands are losing jobs. One argument is that high goods and services tax rates are hitting consumption.

Parle’s Mayak Shah told ET’s Ratna Bhushan that the firm may have to lay off up to 10,000 workers if their demand for reducing 18 per cent GST doesn’t come through. Earlier, biscuits were taxed at 12 per cent and industry expected it to be 12 per cent for premium biscuits and 5 per cent on the ones that commoner consumes.

A back of the envelope calculation shows that under GST a Rs 5 pack of biscuits would attract 30 paise more tax per packet. Does a consumer rebel from purchasing because of a pack getting 30 paise more expensive? Debt laden companies may find it difficult to pass on higher tax incidence due to fear of losing market share.

But what about the likes of Britannia which enjoy 40 per cent gross margins and Maruti that pays 5.2 per cent royalty to parent Suzuki Motor which derives three fourths of its $18 billion market value from Indian unit holding? If businesses are serious about sales growth can they compromise a bit on prices or pampering the parent firm.

The slowdown should also be seen in relation what happened in previous years.

Between 2014 and last fiscal, truck production rose 59 per cent to 1.11 million, data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Motorcycles and scooter production grew 45 per cent. Car sales climbed 35 per cent.

Between 2014 and now equity markets captured the movement too. Maruti Suzuki rose 453 per cent between January 2014 and July 2018. It is off 36 per cent since but is still up 252 per cent. Britannia soared 659 per cent to Rs 3,450 and off 31 per cent since but is still up 420 per cent.

One sane voice in this cacophony is Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj. He admits industry’s mistake of over production and unwise business practices. Furthermore, he asserts that a 5 to 7 per cent fall in sales at dealer end is not a ‘crisis.’ It also opens up room for management to correct past mistakes and turn more efficient, says Bajaj. An admirable attitude from the scion of the ‘Bombay Club’ leader for others to emulate!"
49,2019-08-23,Britannia,"Amul has such a positive brand image, made up from decades of Amul girl ads and its roots in the cooperative movement, that it can be slightly startling when it bares its teeth. But Amul does it when it comes to defending dairy as is shown by its recent spat with Britannia over allegedly fake butter cookies claims.

Amul has released ads claiming that compared to its own butter cookies, which have 25% butter, competitors have just 0.3-3% butter and the rest is vegetable fat. While Britannia wasn’t named, the cookies shown in its ads clearly resembled its GoodDay biscuits.

Britannia hit back with ads claiming butter had more than seven times the cholesterol of vegetable fats, but as RS Sodhi, Amul’s MD, said to ET, this simply raised the question why, if butter was so unhealthy, they used the butter cookie label at all: “Why not refer to them as palm oil cookie?”

This seems like a neat, if rather nasty, tactic to trap Britannia, and it is not new. Years back, when Unilever first introduced its Walls brand in India, Amul challenged its right to use the term ice cream since Walls didn’t use dairy fat, as Amul’s ice cream did, but vegetable fat reconstituted with milk powder. Walls claimed this just gave them better control over production, but Amul alleged it was to save money, since vegetable fats were cheaper. Walls has duly had to call its products ‘frozen desserts’ since then.

Variations of this fight have been happening across the world for decades. For over 20 years Britain fought with the European Union over the definition of chocolate. British companies like Cadbury used vegetable fats in it but the EU, led by countries like Belgium famous for artisanal chocolate, insisted on only dairy fat.

In 1999, a compromise was reached with certain vegetable fats being allowed and Cadbury rebranding its flagship Dairy Milk brand as a ‘family milk bar’ on the Continent. But fights like this helped build the narrative for Brexit.

Another long running feud also involved butter. When margarine started being sold in the US in the 1870s, it was fiercely resisted by the strong dairy lobby in northern states like Wisconsin and Minnesota. Some states banned margarine outright while other lobbied for high taxes on it. Margarine manufacturers fought back, with the backing of southern states whose cottonseed oil was used to make it, with the argument that the rapidly expanding US population needed a cheap alternative to butter.

This got the worst restrictions lifted, but the butter boosters developed new tactics. They passed laws banning margarine manufactures from tinting their pure white product yellow to make it look closer to butter. Some went even further and forced margarine to be coloured an unnatural pink — a law that the courts eventually struck down on the grounds that this was forcing manufacturers to adulterate their own products.

In India, this battle took the form of vanaspati (margarine) versus ghee (clarified butter). In the 1950s, the cow protection movement was drawn into the battle on the grounds that oilbased vanaspati was destroying the market for ghee. Prakash Tandon, who would become the first Indian chairman of Unilever’s Indian company, was a senior manager in the company then and became deeply involved in the battle due to their Dalda brand.

In his memoir Punjabi Century, Tandon writes of how serious this was: “Whatever an individual’s previous views, the moment vanaspati was termed the enemy of the cow, it became anathema.” He tried to reason with one of the leaders of the campaign, Kishorelal Mashruwala, but the veteran Gandhian was adamant. 

He told Tandon he was not against vegetable oil, just the falsehood consumers were led into by making it seem like ghee by hydrogenation: “If she cannot afford ghee, let her accept the truth and buy oil, not deceive herself by buying something spurious.” Vanaspati has vanished from our lives now, thanks to the health issues associated with the trans fats produced by hydrogenation.

Unilever has sold Dalda and the cow protection movement has found newer, even more potently political targets. Yet, as the Amul-Britannia battle shows, the issue has never quite gone away, but just been obscured by the processed food industry. More natural seeming sources of fat have been developed, like palm oil, but these have brought their own issues, like the destruction of jungles, and its toll on animals like orangutans, that has come with rapidly increasing palm oil cultivation in Southeast Asia.

Even without bringing in such environmental issues, the debate might seem as simply polarised between natural versus manufactured products. One side has always argued that it is simply a question of truth — why should manufactured products claim the benefits of natural ones? Allowing one to do so just opens the floodgates to fake foods of all kinds, and the dangers of this are huge.

In his book Real Food/Fake Food ,the journalist Larry Olmsted quotes one estimate of the cost of fake food as “nearly $50 billion annually. That’s twice the entire world market for coffee, the single most-valuable agricultural commodity.” Olmsted paints a scary picture of a world where the rapid growth of processed foods, channelled to unthinking customers through the seductions of marketing and supermarkets, is enabling an explosion in fake foods, particularly led by countries like China and Italy whose labelling standards are low.

This might seem like an open and shut case, and yet, with fake food as with fake news, complexities can arise. Fake news is undoubtedly a huge problem, maliciously created and spread to confuse opinions. But there is also news which isn’t deliberately created as fake, but just represents a different way of looking at matters. The danger is that those who don’t share that viewpoint label it as fake news — which plays into the hands of real purveyors of fake news, who label this as bigoted and further use it to polarise and confuse matters.

This danger exists with food as well. Just as those American dairymen in the last century drove the creation of laws against industrialised food, their descendants today are using those same laws against a new kind of manufactured food — the rapidly expanding industry in plant-based foods catering to consumers who want vegan food for ethical or environmental reasons.

Unlike the early industrial food makers, their goal isn’t cheap foods, but sustainable ones, and they have deeply felt arguments in favour of their aims. Yet, instead of engaging with these arguments, the traditional food producers are often falling back on the old laws to ban these news foods. In Europe, there are strong lobbies calling for the term ‘milk’ to be restricted to dairy product, and not be used for soy milk, almond milk, oat milk and all the rapidly growing alternative, plant based milks.

Similar traditional farmer producer lobbies are getting the use of ‘burger’ banned for the many plant-based options that are being devised, by companies like Beyond Meat, which has become one of the most dynamic new tech ventures. They may now have to label their products ‘vegetable discs’ in some countries. Similar campaigns are being led against vegan cheese, plant-based meat and eggs made from pea protein. There is now vegan ghee, which is not made from hydrogenation, but a process called interesterification, and if this grows it might well attract protests again from an even more militant cow protection movement.

This is not a smart path for producers of traditional foods. By failing to engage with the more modern concerns driving these new foods, and trying to ban them as ‘fake foods’, they are diluting the battle against foods that are faked simply on grounds of cost. They are also not engaging with the many new consumers being drawn to the new plant-based foods for passionately held environmental and ethical reasons, for example the opposition to dairying as a system that is cruel to cows and environmentally damaging due to the cost of methane emissions from cattle, and also the costs of raising fodder for cattlefeed.

This is, admittedly, not an argument that Britannia could level against Amul, given its own considerable involvement in commercial dairying. But other manufacturers of purely plant-based foods could start raising these issues, and falling back on the old dairy defence will not help. New arguments might be needed, for example, by pointing to the lesser environmental impact of the traditional dairy practices that the cooperative sector can follow.

Even more radically, traditional farmer producers can look at getting into producing these new products as well. One non-food example of this is from De Beers, the diamond conglomerate, which after years of trying to prevent the growth of synthetic diamonds, has now started making them itself — but carefully selling them as clear alternatives to natural diamonds.

Amul might also want to remember how Dr Verghese Kurien, its visionary founder, went on to lead the larger National Dairy Development Board which he pushed into the production and distribution of edible oils.

This might have seemed beyond the scope of the Dairy in its name, but it was also an example of how Dr Kurien was able to look beyond conventional divisions of false and real to a more holistic approach to food."
50,2019-08-24,Britannia,"The week gone by witnessed another bloodbath on Dalal Street taking along with it all the heavyweights like Reliance Industries, whose AGM effect withered away in no time. Strong bastions such as ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance and the like also witnessed heavy selling, but by the close of the week, a smart recovery in broader market established that the peak of the fear is behind us for now and it is hopefully time to become greedy. 

The domestic market fell 2.6 per cent in August. However, the Chinese market which is considered to be the most affected by the trade war fell only 0.39 per cent. The quantum of selling has also reduced, albeit it is still on. Everywhere front page headlines are fairly pessimistic, which makes a reasonable case that being on the short side would lead to being caught on the wrong side. And Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's mini-Budget like announcements post market hours on Friday have just paved the way for a turn around. It is, therefore, time to set yourself apart from the herd and create longs in some of the beaten-down stocks.

Investors need to think clearly and not get influenced by the commentaries of corporate managements. To assume that a Rs 5 biscuit is not being bought due to economic slowdown on the pretext of high taxes is a big joke as FMCG companies recorded sound single-digit volume growth even in June quarter. Such news spread fear, but at the same time opportunities do surface in companies like Britannia when you think unbiasedly. Hence, during negative sentiments investors need to take every statement with a pinch of salt.


Event of the Week
Companies such as CG Power voluntarily came out with wrongdoings only during extreme pessimism. In a way, this phase will bring out all the dirty linen in the open and clean up the system for the next bull
run. Currently, every smallcap and midcap stock is beaten down on the presumption that there could be some mischief in them as well.





Technical Outlook
Nifty50 swiftly made an intraday V-shaped recovery on Friday which pointed out to a sustained bounce in the short to medium term. It has most likely taken support in its January lows, which has multiple support levels. A recovery up to 11,100 level can be reasonably expected as long as international markets do not play spoil sport. Traders can go long by keeping Friday’s lows as stop losses.


Expectations for the Week
The FM's announcements on Friday has surely created conditions for a turnaround in the both the economy and the market. But global factors remain adverse, with the US announcing a new heap of tariffs on Chinese goods. The market seems to be coming out of a fear spell that had gripped them since the beginning of August. Indian bourses would now offer opportunities to both short-term traders as well as long-term investors at the current levels. Conservative investors can look at FMCG, private bank and pharma sectors while investors with a higher risk appetite can look to buy select metal plays and cement stocks. 

Nifty50 closed the week at 10,829, down 1.97per cent."
51,2019-08-25,Britannia,"By Andy Mukherjee

When snack makers start to lament that Indians can’t afford to spend Rs 5 on biscuits,it’s time to stop arguing over how much of the nation’s slowdown is cyclical and what part is structural.

Considering its glaring income, wealth and consumption inequalities, India is a surprisingly calm society. However, when purchasing power dries up to the extent that rural laborers and urban blue-collar workers have to think twice about cheap munchies, then the situation is desperate. The culprit is deep-rooted wage suppression, a long-term issue that needs attention.

Britannia Industries Ltd., the No. 1 Indian biscuit maker, recently sounded alarm bells over the sharp deceleration in its domestic sales volumes. Rival Parle Products Pvt. chimed in and said jobs were at risk for as many as 10,000 of its workers.

A Parle executive blamed India’s 2017 goods and services tax, or GST. While the consumption tax may indeed have been an additional burden in an economy slowing under a disastrous November 2016 currency ban, the funk has its roots in insufficient wages. In recent years, only about a third of the economy’s income has gone to labour, with providers of debt and equity capital taking the rest, according to India Ratings and Research Pvt., a unit of Fitch Ratings. Raising that 33.2% labor share to the developing-country average of 37.4% would put an extra $100 billion of annual spending power in the hands of Indian households.


Bloomberg

Only then can India start facing up to the tougher challenge of reaching advanced-economy levels. It has a long way to go. The labour share of income in the U.S. was almost 57% in 2016, even after a near 10-percentage-point drop following World War II that was caused by technological changes and globalization, according to McKinsey & Co.

Trouble is, the distribution of the Indian economic pie is more lopsided than the aggregate numbers suggest. As India Ratings’ analysis shows, 80% of the output generated in informal production gets used up in paying for capital, which is scarce; households get only 20% in exchange for toiling on farms and in cottage industries. At the same time, only 32% of the production of a bloated public sector is shared with the taxpayers and banks that provide the capital; as much as 68% goes to a privileged group of state and quasi-state workers who enjoy assured jobs and higher pay than they would in the private sector.

The long-overdue privatization of inefficient behemoths like Air India Ltd. would reduce the wastage of capital in the public sector. But it won’t automatically help informal private businesses grow and become productive. In its first term, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi thought taxation would provide the required nudge. It set out to formalize entire supply chains by bringing even small firms under the ambit of the GST. The poorly designed, badly implemented plan backfired.


Bloomberg

Two years later, New Delhi is furious that it can’t meet revenue targets; its frustration is leading to an antagonistic stance toward firms. Meanwhile, industries from autos to biscuits are demanding lower GST rates. There’s no fiscal room to please all. The government hit the brakes on its own investments in the June quarter, amid an extended slump in private capital expenditure.

Taxes aren't the solution. Easier hiring-and-firing norms — and not mere consolidation of archaic labour laws — will boost employment in more productive large firms that can pay better. If Amazon.com Inc. can build its largest global center in India, why should factories be afraid to scale up by hiring blue-collar workers? At the other end of the spectrum, small firms need finance.

A yearlong liquidity crunch in the shadow banking industry has caused jitters in India’s market for loans-against-property, which is how midsize businesses finance themselves. But even the luxury of a $25,000 loan obtained by mortgaging property worth $350,000 isn’t for everyone, as Pratibha Chhabra, a financial inclusion specialist at the World Bank, notes. Most small firms only have inventory and invoices to pledge, and no lender wants to be left holding half-made chairs, or potatoes rotting in a warehouse.

However, if a bank lending to a furniture maker or a potato farmer in India can get repaid directly by Ikea or PepisCo Inc. against certified invoices, it can share the benefit of the final customer’s creditworthiness with the borrowers. This is how Citigroup Inc. greases the global supply chain of 700 multinationals and their 70,000 vendors. Since most tiny businesses run on household labour, only statisticians will worry about whether wages or profits are getting the lift. Spending power in the economy will rise.

Such financing is well established in developed markets, though in India “to efficiently finance small firms by locating them in larger supply chains will be the next frontier,” says Gaurav Arora, head of Asia Pacific at Greenwich Associates LLC.

India is overdependent on Bangladesh’s model of microfinance, which uses group pressure and social shame to collect on exorbitantly priced — but collateral-free — small loans. The country is barking up the wrong tree. A woman doing embroidery on a sari will never get more than a fraction of what her craft will ultimately sell for. But she can be given access to cheap credit. Then, she’ll also be able to buy more biscuits for her children."
52,2019-08-27,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group: The stock of Nestle India hit a record high on the speculation of being included in the Nifty 50 index in its next reshuffle. However, short-term investors may well book profit in the stock if such an inclusion stands confirmed.

This is because two out of every three companies that have made it to the Nifty in the past five years have posted negative returns in the year after inclusion. As many as 19 out of the 21 stocks underperformed after a year of inclusion against their performance a year before, indicating that the Nifty inclusion comes at the time of peak performance. It is also indicative that much of the positive sentiment surrounding the inclusion gets factored in well before the actual inclusion.

For instance, the Britannia stock was included in the Nifty in March this year. The stock is down 18 per cent since, whereas it had gained 20 per cent in the year before the inclusion. Similarly, JSW Steel, which got added in October 2018, is down 44 per cent till now. It had posted 52 per cent gains in the year preceding its inclusion.

Only two – Eicher Motors and Bajaj Finserv – of the 21 stocks that got included in the Nifty in the past five years performed better a year after their inclusion in the benchmark index. Trading at very high valuation of 71 times of its trailing four quarter earnings, the Nestle stock will be the most expensive FMCG stock in the index, if included.

Nestle India reported an exceptional performance in the latest quarter to June, posting 10.5 per cent growth in volume amid overall slowdown in demand.

While acknowledging the slowdown, the management has hinted of single-digit growth this year. The company posted a smart recovery since FY16 when its flagship noodle brand Maggi got embroiled in controversy concerning its quality. The company has institutional holding of 20 per cent. Its return on net worth stands at 45 per cent and return on capital employed at 43 per cent. The company is relaunching its global malt-based drink Milo in India."

54,2019-08-27,Britannia,"If the crop is good after a reasonably normal monsoon, rural consumers may start to loosen the purse strings. Similarly, in urban areas too sentiment may improve after the government’s many measures, boosters and push to the economy, says Kunj Bansal, Partner & CIO, Sarthi Group. Bansal says in India there is no lack of money. It is only a question of risk aversion that seems to have come in the last few months and that should go away. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Has the sentiment on the ground turned around?I will answer the question of sentiment from two points of view; one sentiment of market and two, sentiment of the economy or the fundamentals. For the market, it has certainly turned positive in the short term and this I am saying as of yesterday 3:30 pm, looking at the indices. After that, let us keep in mind that another booster shot has been given by the RBI as well. So temporarily yes, sentiments have curtained positive. 

In the medium to long term, the market or the stock movement will always be a function of sustainable financials and fundamentals which is something that we are yet to see. The next visibility will come in the September numbers. Before that, if we want, it will come out in the monthly auto numbers. That is what we need to see. Last Friday, in the mid market there seems to have been some insider buying. But otherwise, till Thursday, when we also had a statement coming in from the chief economic advisor that there will be no stimulus package and the sentiment was continuing to go down. That now, certainly does not seem to be the case. 


We have been talking about the auto stocks. Post all these sops being announced and Maruti in fact seems to be pipped as one that will benefit the most, what do you think?Yes, so it will, especially after the stimulus package that was announced by the finance minister wherein clear three, four benefits were given to the auto sector. 

The ban on government buying has been lifted, the depreciation has been increased, the registration fee hike has been postponed. Of course, the biggest booster to the sector could be GST reduction which was not in the domain of the finance minister to do; that is under the GST Council’s purview. 

If that happens, that will be the biggest booster but pending that, whatever could be done by the finance minister, has been done. That is a positive. The market is looking for those one or two months of automobile monthly sales numbers to show some kind of trend that has bottomed out. We could be very close to seeing that, if not for any other reason for the reasons of base, let us recall that the slowdown started last year around September, October. So, that is something that could kick in. 

If we extend ourselves further to the December quarter, which is traditionally a festival quarter, we have to see if some recovery comes in then. That could come on the back of some good crop effect in the rural areas. While they may not have received the cash, but if the crop is good after the reasonably normal monsoon, hopefully rural consumers will start to loosen the purse strings. 
So will the case be in the urban areas after the government’s many measures, boosters and push to the economy. More importantly, there will be the sentimental impact. 


HUL is at a 52-week high, Bata at a 52-week high, Asian Paints at a 52-week high. Am I missing something? Isn’t there a slowdown in consumption?So let me throw some other stocks, not necessarily that this is investment advice. Godrej Consumer is close to 52-week low. Jyothy Labs close to 52-week low. Dabur here and there. Marico again close to 52-week high. There are two-three things. One, as we all know, the stock price performance as well as market in the medium to long term will always be a function of financials. Added to that, is the demand or the buying interest in that. 

In case of Asian Paints, it is clearly the financials. In fact, the number that the whole sector -- not only Asian Paints but other paints companies also -- gave in the June quarter was a surprise and based on some informal discussions and checks, it looks like the secondary paint market sales for replacement, repainting and all are seeing good demand even now. 

I would not be surprised if September quarter numbers turn out to be good.. For other bellwether stocks, probably being the market leaders, it is the money which keeps going to the safe haven and that is where we see some of the 52-week highs in some other stocks.


Bond yields are down. The 10-year closed at about 6.5%. It should inch up. There could not be a massive selloff but it should settle at 6.35%, 6.4%. Will this add as an impetus for PSU banks further?I do not know. I mean PSU banks is a very difficult space…


Not the smaller ones. First, there was recapitalisation; second, RBI dividend. Money is available now and after that there is a rally in bond yields.So two things – one, although you are specifically asking about PSU banks but one thing comes to my mind is can this inflow of RBI money to the government be now used an excuse by the government to announce that now we will not be going in for foreign borrowing? You remember post budget, that had become a consensus issue.


The sovereign bond is off the table. The finance minister said on Friday that it is off the table.That is a good thing that has happened. Now coming to PSU banks, in the shorter term yesterday we saw some rally post market RBI announcement. We can again see some trading rally but these are very good traders friends. I am sure the traders know their stop losses. But on a medium to long term investing, unfortunately the financial numbers, the fundamentals themselves tell us that the stocks probably are not going to give any sustainable return from now on also. 


You were saying earlier about the factors that may lead to a pickup on the rural front. Names like Britannia have given numbers that show they have been impacted by the slowdown. Do you feel the same factors apply for expecting a rural pickup that we may start to see getting reflected in these earnings as well?What I feel is that the pickups happen for two reasons. One is the actual money or actual increased earnings in the hands of people -- be it rural or be it urban; Two, simply the sentimental or the wealth effect. If because of the reasonably good progress of monsoon, an impression comes to farmers mind that his crop is normal, he will start spending. In my view in India there is no lack of money. It is only a question of risk aversion that seems to have come in in last few months and so that will go away."

58,2019-08-27,Britannia,"JM Financial has given a buy rating on Britannia Industries with a target price of Rs 2,920 as the risk-reward has turned favourable on this counter.

“We believe Britannia merits a serious re-look post the sharp stock price correction. We expect the core theme of internal-efficiencies-driven earnings growth to continue playing out, once consumers overcome the extreme pessimism that the country is presently caught in. Britannia’s MD Varun Berry had described the current slowdown to be of a kind never seen before – “taken the category growth to almost 1-2%…has never happened before”, the brokerage said.

The intensity of the slowdown has been such that Britannia hasn’t been able to outperform much even in the Hindi-heartland states that used to grow at 1.5-2x its national-level growth rate.

“Meanwhile, the company had some time back embarked on a journey to become a ‘total foods company’ through several new category-launches; whilst these will bear fruits in times to come, they brought along additional pressure on costs (capacities, additional overheads, ad-spends) in the short-term, and recent quarters’ earnings already included hits therefrom. Stock lacks near-term trigger at this stage, but we now find risk-reward quite favourable,” the brokerage said."

69,2019-08-30,Britannia,"A significant drop in the broader equity market amid the ongoing US-China trade tensions and slowdown in the economy have raised fear among investors. At the same time, market mavens are advising investors to start accumulating stocks of good businesses with the objective of creating wealth over the long term. 

Like SIPs in mutual funds, equity investors can also use the systematic investment route during uncertain times to beat market volatility. The purpose of SIP is to create long-term wealth by investing in a disciplined way.

Mutual funds are always there for such systematic planning, but if you don’t want to go for the entire basket of a mutual fund portfolio and instead focus on a few high conviction ideas, systematic equity planning (SEP) in direct equities can help.

“It is a good opportunity for investors to go for an SIP approach as one can get more mutual fund units or stocks now compared with when the market is higher. Therefore, a prudent approach would be to continue with SIP in stocks,” said Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking.

He picked HDFC Life, Berger Paints, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki and Britannia as best bets for such direct equity SIP.

HDFC Life has strengthened its position in the life insurance sector with strong growth seen in the last five years. Its new business premium has growth at 28 per cent CAGR over FY15-19 insuring nearly 5.14 crore lives (73 per cent CAGR). Further, the company’s net profit and asset under management have also seen a healthy growth of 14 per cent and 17 per cent during the same period. 

“Consistent market share gains, strong return ratios and healthy dividend ratio make HDFC Life as one of the best long-term bets. We are bullish on ICICI Bank also as steady loan growth and ease in credit cost would improve its return ratios going forward,” Mishra said.

Berger enjoys a market share of around 20-22 per cent in domestic paint sector and is well placed to capitalize on the growth opportunity in the industry. ICICI also posted a decent set of results in June quarter with a slight miss on profit estimates. 

AK Prabhakar, Head of Research, IDBI Capital Market said SIP is the best way as it takes care of volatility. “Investors can consider HDFC Life, ICICI Bank, Indian Hotels, L&T and Bharat Electronics for such SIPs,” he said.

SIP in equities can help reduce the risk of timing the market by averaging out benefits. Investors can invest a pre-decided amount or pick a specified quantity of stocks at regular intervals over a long term. If the investment is constant, one would buy more units when the price is low and fewer units when the price is high. Similarly, when one buys a specific quantity at regular intervals, it may lower the cost by averaging it out. 

The only drawback in a direct SIP is that it does not allow automatic diversification the way a mutual fund SIP does. 

Market experts say investors opting for this route must have a clear view about the company and its stock price for 2-3 years or even more. One should go through the company’s balance sheet, study cash flow statements, return ratios and consider the impact of any micro and macro-economic changes.

Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas recommended Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, L&T, HDFC Life and Bajaj Finance for direct equity SIP.

There are hopes that volatility in the market will continue for some more time. Already, second-rung stocks have witnessed severe selling pressure over the past 20 months, while the benchmark BSE Sensex has advanced 11 per cent between January 1, 2018 and August 27, 2019.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have plunged 24 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, in the same period.

“We expect the volatility to continue in the market as the slowdown in the Indian economy is going to continue for some more time. The trade war between US and China is also contributing to global volatility and is unlikely to abate anytime soon. As a result, we feel that SIP is a good way to accumulate stocks amid the ongoing market correction as it will allow investors to take advantage of the volatility in the markets,” said Jyoti Roy, Equity Strategist (DVP), Angel Broking.

The brokerage believes the consumer space and some private sector banks would be relatively safer bets. Among private sector banks, the brokerage picked HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank as good bets. Besides, it is bullish on VIP Industries from the consumer discretionary space."

67,2019-08-30,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Leading packaged food companies have downplayed the slowdown trend in consumption, calling it temporary and restricted to mainly mass-priced products, sounding a note of hope amid a mostly grim economic commentary.

Britannia, ITC, Amul and Nestle said sales of their product categories, both premium and essential, continued to grow even as a few large categories such as biscuits and snacks witnessed slower expansion in the quarter ended in June.

Britannia has slowed down capital investment, but will continue to spend on advertising and brand building since it expects the slowdown to not last beyond six months, managing director Varun Berry said. “Slowdown is led by rural India. In six months, normalisation should happen. The base will be lower and consumers will react to what the government has done,” he said at Ficci Foodworld, a food industry convention.

Britannia, in a post-earnings conference call, had voiced concerns and said consumers were hesitating to buy even Rs 5 packs of biscuits, indicating a “serious issue in the economy”. The country’s largest biscuit maker, Parle Products, too, had said 8,000-10,000 people could face job loss if the ongoing consumption slowdown persisted.

“The statements were made in a different context and if the market conditions worsen. But we are noticing signs of a pickup already. There have been categories impacted by GST which is weighing on lower-priced items,” Parle Products executive director Arup Chauhan said.

According to market research firm Nielsen, the fast-moving consumer goods segment grew 10% during April-June, marginally slower than the year-earlier period’s growth of 10.6%. However, on a sequential basis, value or revenue growth in FMCG has been consistently coming down from its peak of 16.2% in the July-September quarter.

“There is no significant impact on staples and essentials. While growth in premium products continues, mass products are impacted,” Hemant Malik, the divisional chief executive of ITC’s foods division, said at the event.

While the slowdown is led by biscuits, salty snacks, soaps and tea, several home and personal care products including creams, detergents, toothpastes, deodorants and food items such as chocolates, malted beverages and noodles grew at a higher rate during the April-June quarter than the year earlier.

“One swallow does not make a summer. And two quarters do not spell doom,” Nestle India chairman Suresh Narayanan told 
ET. The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe posted 13% growth in domestic sales in the last quarter. “Small blips won’t affect the consumption story and it remained strong at 10%,” he said.

Chocolates, deodorants, malted drinks and noodles are all discretionary in nature, but grew between 10% and 15% during the quarter. “We haven't seen any slowdown and grew 25% in the first quarter compared to 14% a year ago,” said RS Sodhi, MD at GCMMF, which owns the Amul dairy brand."

10,2019-09-06,Britannia,"We do not expect the current consumption slowdown phase in the economy to persist forever. So this is the time to pick stocks in this space for the next three to five years, says Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Currently, markets are most concerned with the outlook on earnings growth. How soon do you see that improving? Is it a while away?From an earnings point of view, we are in for a long grind ahead, given the weak underlying economic momentum and various sectors which are facing stress right now. In any case, for FY20, the earnings recovery or rather the projected earnings recovery was built on the thesis of banking earnings recovering. Even after the first quarter of FY20, where we have cut our Nifty EPS estimate by 4% and have around 13% profit growth estimate for FY20, the fact remains that if we take out the corporate banks, the Nifty earnings are expected to grow just 3%. 

So a lot rests on what happens to the banks and what happens to the asset quality if there is a delay in the resolution of NCLT cases. With the guidance of the various banks from the first quarter earnings season as well as the ones who attended our 15th Annual Global Conference a fortnight back, more cases of stress are emerging and that is clouding the outlook for banks earnings for this year. So to that extent, the earnings recovery or rather the risk to the earnings downgrade have become elevated.

Secondly, consumption slowdown is here which is the big takeaway from the first quarter GDP print. Along with auto, more sectors are facing problems and that is getting reflected in the FY20 earnings. We can see another 3-4% downgrades from here. We might end up FY20 with 7% earnings growth like in FY19 and FY18. We had hoped for 15% earnings growth for FY20 but those hopes are getting bashed in the first half itself.


This year IT space was dealt a blow with a tax on share buyback, that was announced in the budget. What are you expecting from IT and which stocks do you like here?We are positive on IT for sometime now. It remains the most sensible defensive in India right now. Consumer is a defensive but very exorbitantly priced and pharma has ceased to be a defensive long back, even though earnings as well as valuations have corrected.

In that context, IT remains one of the best defensives in India. Earnings growth is reasonable at 8%-10%, very high quality balance sheets and managements plus 80-100% payouts . From an investor’s perspective, it should be immaterial whether you are getting the cash back in the form of dividends or buybacks. Obviously, some taxation impact will be there but even then the payout ratios are very high. 

Therefore we like tier one IT right now. Even in the last three-four quarters, the growth differential between the tier one and tier two has extinguished completely and that is why you are seeing tier two stocks are now trading at a discount. 

One or two years back, tier two stocks were trading at a premium. The commentaries from the first quarter has been pretty good; deal sizes, deal wins are pretty solid. Tech Mahindra already has about a billion-dollar-deal from AT&T. Clearly, IT stands out and at the margin in the last 20-30 days you have seen currency depreciation also coming to its help.

We like Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech and one should have a positive view on IT at this stage given the way the currency has behaved in the last 20-30 days. Nifty IT should do well relatively in this kind of an environment.


Among individual sectors, consumption and utilities are looking attractive. Where do you see opportunity?In case of utilities, the biggest thing in their favour right now is the interest rate. Interest rates are coming down and the outlook for interest rates remains very soft. We should not be surprised if there is another 40-50 bps rate cut by RBI. Valuations are at its lowest in a decade at sub one time price to book to 1.2 times price to book even for largecap companies. Dividend yields are very attractive at 4-5%. We are more positive on utilities than we were a year or six months back. We like NTPC and Coal India in this space. 

There is a distinct slowdown in consumption which is manifested in the first quarter numbers. The slowdown is more apparent in the discretionary side than on the staple side because most of the staple companies are yet to report volume decline. 

Now consumption still remains very expensive despite the time correction that we have seen in many stocks over the last one year. But this is a very long-term story and we do not expect the current consumption slowdown phase in the economy to persist forever. So this is the time to pick stocks in this space for the next three to five years. From that view point, we have been very positive on Titan, Hindustan Lever, Pidilite, Britannia as well as Marico. This is a very good opportunity for people to accumulate these stocks knowing fully well that they may not do much over the next couple of quarters, because of the way the slowdown has played out so far.


What makes you optimistic on Bharti Airtel? We have a very simple view on Bharti Airtel. We think the ARPUs have bottomed out and can be expected to improve gradually from here. Secondly, from a balance sheet perspective, they have raised some capital and are in the process of deleveraging plus the announcements on Jio yesterday have not been so disruptive. 

There was the fear a couple of weeks back but given that the lowest ARPU is around Rs 699, it does not seem as disruptive. At the same time, their main competitor continues to be in trouble as far as the balance sheet is concerned. Their debt is quite high and all of these factors have combined with the fact that valuations have also come off and the stock has been absolutely flattish for the last four or five years. 

We believe that it offers a reasonable margin of safety and if there is a decent pick up that we can see in ARPU over the next couple of quarters, then it also offers a reasonable upside as well."
11,2019-09-09,Britannia,"New Delhi: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Monday set aside a penalty of Rs 3 lakh levied by markets regulator Sebi on Central Bank of India for the violation of debenture trustee norms.

The tribunal let off the lender on censure for the violations, according to an SAT order.

""The order of the Adjudicating Officer imposing monetary penalty upon the appellant is set aside instead the appellant is let off on censure for the violations,"" the tribunal said in an order.

In July 2018, markets regulator found that the lender had not entered into written agreements with the issuer companies in respect of Britannia Industries and Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corp.

Besides, the Central Bank, while acting as a debenture trustee of IL&FS Ltd provided loan to it and the bank's director held directorship positions in the company.

In addition, the bank had not disseminated all information and reports on debt securities including compliance reports filed by the issuers and debenture trustees to the investors and general public by placing the same on its website among other violations.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had held that by indulging in such activities, the bank has violated the provision of debenture trustee regulation and imposed a fine of Rs 3 lakh.

With regard to the loan provided to IL&FS Ltd, SAT noted that the violation was ""technical"" in nature and ""...the disbursement of loan to IL&FS was the cause of old standing relations between the appellant and the Company which could not have been suddenly stopped due to amendment of the DT Regulations in between.""

Sebi had further contended that the Central Bank was required to communicate the compliance of the term of issues by the issuer companies and default in payment of interest to the debenture holders on half yearly basis and said that ""while the show cause notice is regarding five companies the appellant has given explanation regarding only one Company namely IL&FS.""

""In the circumstances, the violation of the Regulation is clearly established in the present case,"" the tribunal said.

With regard to dissemination of information on the website, SAT held that ""since there were no default, the requirement of posting information in this regard was merely a formality. The appellant was disseminating other information in substance as detailed above. The default, if any, was therefore only technical in nature."""
12,2019-09-10,Britannia,"NEW DELHI|KOLKATA: Muted growth has forced consumer goods retailers to scale down inventories up to 30% anticipating poor sentiment hitting festive season sales.

Smartphone retailers said stocking for the month is down 30% over a year ago and is likely to remain low because of sluggish sales.

“If ecommerce companies run massive discounts during their annual sales, stocking would be further reduced in the run-up to Diwali,” said Arvinder Khurana, president of All India Mobile Retailers Association, which represents over 25,000 neighbourhood outlets.

Executives of leading appliance retailers like Great Eastern and Kohinoor said there is no growth in inventory stocking for the festive season in contrast to usual practice. Retail outlets had seen muted sales last year as well. “There is unsold inventory from July and August. As a result, we are entering September and October with the same level of inventory as in last year,” said Pulkit Baid, director at Great Eastern Retail, which runs over 60 stores in East and North.

Panasonic India chief executive Manish Sharma said the industry is considering ways to spread out sales across retailers, big or small, to avoid inventory accumulation.

Between January and June, appliances had grown volume sales by 15%, smartphones by 9% while it stayed flat for TVs, according to market tracker GfK. Sales in July-August, however, crashed 7-10% over the same period last year.

Fashion and lifestyle retailers said some companies have either cut down on inventories by 5-7% from last year or are being choosy about the brands they would stock.

“While production process for the festive season starts as early as March, there are some retailers who were in touch with their vendors and managed to cut inventories at the last minute as they sensed Diwali won’t be upbeat,” said Sundeep Chugh, managing director and CEO of Benetton India.

Indian consumers are shying away from spending amid negative sentiments of an economic slowdown, a volatile stock market and the GDP growth rate hitting a sixyear low of 5% in the June quarter.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its estimate that the Indian economy will grow at 7% this fiscal, instead of 7.3%, on a weaker-than-expected outlook for domestic demand, whereas the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has lowered its growth forecast to 7% for this year on the back of fiscal shortfall concerns.


“People are also expecting the festive season to lift demand. In general, they should keep it well-stocked, because this is the time when they are expecting additional business and revenue,” said Pinakiranjan Mishra, partner and national leader, retail and consumer products, at EY India.

The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, which has been in the red through the past three quarters, is also cautious about inventories like Diwali gift packs.

“We will not push all stocks in trade channels at once. We will assess consumption offtake in the initial phase of the festive quarter and scale up accordingly. This is because consumption has been soft. We are hopeful it will pick up,” said Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia Industries, the country’s largest biscuits maker.

The October-December festive season contributes 35-40% of annual sales for most consumer companies which stock heavily for this period to make the best use of the biggest shopping opportunity of the year. The season starts with Ganesh Chaturthi, followed by Onam, Navratri-Durga Puja, and peaks in Diwali.

The chief executive of a large apparel company who didn’t wish to be quoted, said that when growth was in double digit, it made sense to stock more, but with a flat or low single-digit growth, most retailers would not want to sit on an inventory pileup.

15,2019-09-13,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council could lower levies for sectors such as automobiles, biscuits and other fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) at its September 20 meeting, said people with knowledge of the matter. It could also discuss raising the lowest slab of 5% to as much as 8%. That could set the ball rolling for a major revamp of GST structure as part of efforts to revive growth, they said.

“These proposals will be placed before the council,” said a senior government official aware of the matter.

The fitment committee, comprising state and central government officials, which met last week only discussed the possible revenue impact of a rate cut on automobiles. The GST Council, which meets in Goa next week, will take a final call on the matter.

The automobile sector wants GST rates on passenger vehicles to be cut to 18% from 28% now. The auto sector, in addition to GST, also faces a compensation cess that ranges from 1% to 22%. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has backed calls for lower GST on hybrid and other vehicles.




GST Mopup Subdued
Parle, Britannia and other biscuit makers have pitched for a reduction in GST from 18% to 12% to bring them on par with unbranded varieties.

Auto sales fell 23.55% in August with dispatches in all segments, including passenger vehicles and two-wheelers, continuing to plummet.

The government has been called upon to provide some stimulus in the form of tax cuts to boost consumption and prevent any further deepening of the slowdown.

States may have to share some of the revenue loss that would accrue due to any cut in GST on automobiles.

Alternatively, other avenues of generating revenue such as restructuring of the 5% slab or raising the slab rate may have to be examined.

Some state governments have backed merging the 12% and 18% brackets as part of broader reform. The revenue position could prompt an early call on the matter.

The Centre is facing pressure as GST collections remain subdued and states have to be compensated in full for any revenue loss, calculated at 14% growth, for five years. GST collections rose 4.51% in August to Rs 98,202 crore, staying below the Rs 1lakh crore target.

Sources said the compensation cess for June and July was about Rs 28,000 crore and if the remaining three installments are of the same order, it will add up to an additional Rs 84,000 crore for the year.

However, the amount expected to be collected in the remaining period based on revenue in the past five months is Rs 58,200 crore. Taking into account the unutilised cess amount of Rs 23,400 crore, the amount available would be Rs 81,600 crore.

“Any further shortfall in the revenue will further increase the gap between the amount available for release of compensation and amount of compensation required to be released,” said the person cited above.

The cess is aimed at compensating states with a large manufacturing presence that lost out when GST was introduced as the latter is a consumption levy.

The cess so collected is distributed among such states."

17,2019-09-16,Britannia,"In August, fund managers of the top 10 fund houses by assets under management adopted the time-tested bottom-up approach in selecting stocks. This approach is not limited to the metrics of valuation and size of a company. There have been developments around a few large- and mid-sized companies which point out to high earnings visibility at least for the next 1-2 years. Fund managers have increased exposure to companies whose business models are least affected during the present climate of economic slowdown. In all, the industry recorded inflows of Rs 9,000 crore in August which was spread across all categories of mutual funds — large-cap, mid-cap, multi-cap and small-cap — without any preference for fund category. This has prompted fund managers to invest in companies spanning a range of sectors. ET lists the companies that have attracted high interest from fund managers during the month:


Reliance Industries
Bought by: HDFC, ICICI MF

CMP: Rs 1,226

Market Cap: Rs 7,76,891 crore

The top 10 fund houses have incrementally invested Rs 4,970 crore in the stock in August. One of the key reasons is the roll out of Jio’s highspeed broadband services JioFiber across 1,600 cities in India. The services include, ultra-high-speed broadband (up to 1 Gbps), free domestic voice calling, conferencing and international calling, TV video calling and conferencing, streaming platform apps, gaming, home networking, device security, and premium content platform for subscribers. The company is partnering with local cable operators and competitive pricing should boost its earnings per share (EPS) for the next two years. Analysts estimate EPS for FY21 to improve by 14-15 per cent.


Avenue Supermarts

Bought by: HDFC Mutual Fund

CMP: Rs 1,569

Market Cap: Rs 97,925 crore

Avenue Supermarts owns and operates India’s most profitable supermarket, DMart. It sells products like food, FMCG, general merchandise and apparel through 184 stores spanning 6.3 million sq. ft. It has a strong focus on value retailing. Analysts believe faster store additions, reduction in debt, tail winds from GST, and increase in e-commerce business will support earnings. In FY19, it did not venture into any new state, which means the company is looking in increasing penetration in states where it already has a presence. The retailer commands a strong sales per sq ft of above Rs 30,000 and the average bill size increased to Rs 1,163 in 2019 from Rs 1,014 in 2016.


Britannia Industries

Bought by: DSP Mutual Fund

CMP: Rs 2,675

Market Cap: Rs 64,289 crore

A key trigger which has led to high interest in the stock of Britannia Industries is the company’s statement of increasing biscuit prices at a time its peers in the industry have not announced any price hike. Besides this, the company’s new launches both in biscuit and non-biscuit segments and increasing distribution network and focus on costs have also contributed to reasonably good revenue growth in the coming quarters. Lastly, the higher growth in sales of its premium products as opposed to value category of products should augur well for the company’s earnings. For the next two years ending FY21, the company’s earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9-21 per cent.


Lemon Tree Hotels

Bought by: Franklin Templeton MF

CMP: Rs 56

Market Cap: Rs 4,433 crore

One of the key reasons for high interest in the stock of the mid-segment hotel company is its valuation. The company’s stock has corrected close to 20 per cent in the past three months. For analysts, the company’s valuation was a key concern. On FY21 earnings, the company’s stock is trading at an EV/EBIDTA of 17, which is quite attractive considering its past two-year average EV/EBIDTA of close to 34. In addition, its acquisition of Keys Hotels by acquiring its parent company Berggruen Hotels, has elicited favourable review from analysts. Its recenlty-opened Mumbai property has achieved occupancy level of 60 per cent and operational and interest break even. Analysts say that the company does not have any further expansion plans in the near future. By 2021, Lemon Tree plans to take its total room count to 8,800 across 87 hotels from 5,828 rooms across 57 hotels. Analysts expect the company would be able to generate enough cash flows to address its debt concerns. For the next two years ending FY21, analysts expect the company’s revenues to grow in the range of 22-35 per cent, which is quite impressive, given the relatively stiff competition in the mid-market hotels segment in the country."

19,2019-09-17,Britannia,"Unless there is a case for a sustainable rally in the crude price and if it remains at a higher level for an extended period of time, then we should start getting worried about the economy, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


If I calculate the impact of spike in crude price, then we are in for a shock. Is this the right way of looking at Indian markets that when oil prices go higher, we will underperform and whatever good work bulls have done in last 8-10 days will evaporate completely?Definitely the timing and the extent of the increase in crude oil price could be a negative blow for our markets. But we have to remember that this is not the first time that we are seeing any geopolitical tensions and the spike in crude oil prices. We have seen much higher levels of crude oil prices sustaining which we have been able to absorb.

Unless there is a case for a sustainable rally in the crude price and if it remains at a higher level for an extended period of time, then we should start getting worried about the economy. Though it needs to be validated, there is a short-term setback and even global markets have remained quite calm and stable. I do not see this as a reason to derail the entire revival that we have seen for our markets. There can be a bit of a pause, but it is not going to reverse the broader positive outlook.


Yesterday we saw that trade play out on oil sensitives. Paints took a knock yesterday and it is a little unfortunate because paints perhaps was the only segment which had delivered good earnings in the quarter gone by. Do you think that trade will also get challenged with the movement in crude now?Yes, having seen a bit of an up move in that space over the last few days, there could be a bit of a pause but at the end of the day, we have to reckon that we are seeing a global rally which is backed partly by the earnings revival, lower interest rates, etc. Most of the other emerging markets also are showing a bit of a catchup. In such a scenario, I am not looking at a major negative for that particular space at this point of time.


We are seeing a whole host of buy calls coming in on the FMCG majors. Some kind of trend is emerging along those lines. Would you also be looking for an opportunity within that segment of the consumption basket going ahead?Yes, absolutely. Consumption is a space where we had negative data points for the past few months but now given a much better monsoon, over the next three to six months, one can expect a good amount of growth coming through from the rural side as well as the urban side. I definitely think that companies like Titan or some of the FMCG companies like Britannia or HUL should report fairly decent volume growth. We are extremely positive on that space from an investment perspective.


What about some of the pharma names? We have seen a shift of interest towards that pack given the risk averse trend we had seen in that space over the last few weeks. Within the pharma pack, would it be Dr Reddy’s, Divi's, where you are seeing potential currently?In pharma, the MNC stocks have seen a far better upside for about a month or so on the back of better growth indications coming in from companies like Glaxo, Pfizer, Abbott and Sanofi. There is a realisation that after a gap of almost about four to five years, some of the products, particularly in the domestic market, has started doing pretty well. 

Unfortunately, we do not have any specific coverage on any of these names but from the other basket of stocks, Sun Pharma and Lupin are the ones where there can be a decent amount of upside mainly from a domestic market perspective. Globally, in the US markets, we are not seeing any major revival per se but on the domestic side, some of these companies should do well.


It may sound like a cozy correlation but whenever oil goes higher, rupee goes lower and the IT stocks inch up further.There is going to be a good amount of traction for the IT stocks, more so, because it is not only oil but domestic economy and earnings growth have not been that great either. Some of the IT companies have delivered a good set of numbers, particularly Infosys and HCL Tech. 

Given that we are seeing a good amount of stability in the US markets, typically these IT companies should do well and rupee would give them some additional comfort in terms of margin. So Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra (because of the recent deal with AT&T), are the companies where there is valuation comfort and where overall growth would be extremely good. We are extremely positive on IT as a space, at this point of time. 


I am working with the assumption that oil is going to be in an uptrend for a long time. How do you see Reliance moving and what could happen to GRMs now?The oil prices going up bodes well for Reliance because a) on the GRM front, you typically see a bit of spike up and also because the higher export component there is going to be of some additional benefit to them. 

It definitely should be good news for Reliance Industries and one thing which we have to bear in mind is if there is any further issue in terms of the entire episode on Aramco and if their overall plans to pick up a stake in Reliance Industries gets delayed for that reason, that could be a bit of a dampener and we have to bear that in mind. 

Overall, Reliance looks to be extremely well placed and the newer businesses people have turned positive. Though the numbers are not representative at this point of time, over the next 6 to 12 months, whenever they decide to monetise those two businesses, one would see additional triggers play out. Reliance looks quite attractive at this point of time."

30,2019-09-18,Britannia,"With a crucial GST Council meet just two days away, speculations are hitting fever pitch as to whether or not any relief will come for slowdown-hit Indian industry.

The beleaguered automobile sector has been at the forefront in the clamour for a GST cut, which it says will put the wind back in the industry's sails at a time when most of the country has apparently stopped buying cars.

Carmakers are not alone. Almost all quarters of India Inc, including consumer biggies such as Britannia and Parle, are forming lobby groups to push the government to consider their demands for favourable GST action amid a debilitating liquidity crisis.

Given the current circumstances, what is the likelihood of a GST cut that would cause a tax shortfall worth thousands of crores and leave the government with an even direr fiscal fight in its hands?

This vexing question has different answers. Here is looking at how different analysts view this debate.

According to UBS, the view that high GST rates are hurting auto industry is only partly true. There are other factors equally key to sales numbers — and there's no certainty that a tax cut will boost demand for cars.

Will a cut really help automakers? RC Bhargava, the chairman of auto bellwether Maruti, thinks a GST cut on cars would only be a temporary solution. He says the bigger burden on the buyer lies in higher taxes on petrol/diesel and increased registration charges.

There is a view among analysts that the demand for a cut in GST is not entirely fair.

There is merit in the demand for tax reductions in the times of a slump, but this GST cut debate has another angle too, according to some analysts. They say taxes on most products now are almost invariably lower compared to the combined excise+VAT structure of the pre-GST era, something that eats into the credibility of the clamour for a cut.

There is also a cyclical versus structural debate going on for some time. If this slowdown is structural like many analysts think it is, a tax cut would hardly have any impact beyond creating a bit of festive season demand, they say.

There is also a big question about whether or not the government can afford to cut tax rates at this juncture. GST collections have generally failed to meet the targets. A cut in rates could result in further fall in revenues, which a government grappling with a strict deficit target can hardly afford. This July, the government already crossed 77% of its target for the current financial year.

M S Mani, Partner, Deloitte India, says: ""The GST Council would take into account the GST collections, which have been below targets until now, before deciding on any reduction in rates. Since there appears to be a shortfall in the compensation cess collections, any reductions in cess would also pose a challenge.""

So, what rate moves will India likely see on a Friday fraught with possibilities?

If the views of the fitment panel are any indication, many of the industry's hopes have been dashed already. The panel that has the mandate to recommend producer levies has shut the door on any changes in the GST structure for auto and consumer durables.

According to the panel, the current liquidity crisis and NBFC woes have more to do with the auto slump than high GST rates. It also ruled out having two different slabs for biscuits as sought by FMCG companies, saying it will likely result in evasion.

The government may at best look at the compensation cess for some categories of products which would cause no real effect on GST revenues, some analysts say."
29,2019-09-18,Britannia,"Till the time these uncertainties are over, you will not see a significantly sharp recovery coming into the credit cycle, says Vikas Khemani, Founder, Carnelian Capital Advisors. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

The crude will stabilise at some point. What happens to the market then?Crude has been on a downward trajectory. Last Saturday’s drone attack has led to a spike in crude prices. I am sure if it is not a war like situation, then it will settle down soon. I do not think we are in a structural bull market for crude oil. India can handle these kind of temporary setbacks. The only caveat is one does not know whether it is a war like situation or not. As long as it is not, it should be okay. In an otherwise uncertain market, this is the last news you would expect to be dealing with. 

Anyway, there are a lot of local challenges and this came as a spanner in the works and is inducing more volatility. One has to be careful but this uncertain period would get over sooner than later and we have had a prolonged period of uncertainty. I do not believe that we are getting into a structural downturn kind of economic cycle. It is probably somewhere in bottom and the only question is whether the upward move would have a sharp or a slow trajectory. There is no right answer for that. 

One has to keep watching events as they pan out every single day and keep making assessments. We currently believe that we will sooner than later stabilise and start seeing an improvement. The credit crisis which hit the Indian economy so badly has hit the bottom. One only hopes that no more events happen and you keep hearing new names. I will tick over a few more names there. Till the time these uncertainties are over, you will not see a significantly sharp recovery coming into the credit cycle. One has to keep watching it as it comes by.


Let us be compulsive bulls for a second. Can I safely say that markets have stopped reacting to bad news? They did not react to GDP, they did not react to that slump in auto sales. They have reacted to crude but looks like the markets have recovered. If the market stops reacting to bad news that means stock prices are nearing a bottom.Absolutely. This is a fair point and in the last couple of months, the market has made a nice range between 10600 and 11000 kind on Nifty. On any bad news, it probably corrects a little bit before bouncing back again. This also gives a sense that markets are bottoming out and settling down in this range. 

How long it takes to recover is uncertain. Otherwise, I do not have any doubt that probably the worst is behind us. The risk reward of investing into equities have started appearing significantly favourable. Only it might try your patience out before it recovers. But definitely, the risk reward of investing into equities is definitely turning favourable.


As an investor, should you already be buying this dip in the broader markets or should you wait for the froth to settle down? What is the right tactical strategy?You will never know what is the right time. You have to keep on deploying your equities in the market in a systemic manner. As a fund, we have started decreasing our cash level and deploying as and when we find the stocks you are looking to invest in are at the right levels. Broader markets risk rewards are falling into favour and you anyway got to do stock picking. We believe one should look to deploy on a regular basis because uncertain times give great opportunities.

If a bit of clarity comes in either on a macro issues or any of the uncertain issues right now, the stock prices would jump sharply. Uncertain times are the best times to shop around even though they try your patience out. One should look to deploy money within the next three-four months.


Are you fully invested or sitting on cash? About three weeks ago, we were sitting on almost 50% cash. Now, we are sitting on 30% cash. So, we have been deploying systemically. This is the best time and whatever sectors we like, every time, a little bit of uncertainty comes, you see a cut in the stock prices you go and buy a little bit more. 

Having said that, can stocks correct more. But that is what investing is all about? How do you keep your emotions out, how do you keep yourself away from day-to-day negative news flow and stay core to your investing conviction is where the investors get challenged. We do believe this is a time to step up your allocation towards equity. These prices would offer significant return over next three-four years.


If you were to look at buying opportunities in the broader markets, what would be some of the themes? Would you go for utilities, select pharma?  Currently we are quite positive on private sector banks and we think structurally things are favouring this sub segment of the market significantly. It will continue to do well. Availability of the funds, credit growth all are favouring this segment of the market and I would not be surprised if they give 20-25% return over the next couple of years. 

The second sub segment within the financials -- the non credit based financials, whether it is insurance companies or AMCs, there is a fairly large range of opportunities available. There are grest structural opportunities and we are looking at buying in every correction.

Amongst the consumption basket where India can never fail you, we have seen a significant amount of correction in consumer discretionary stocks. We have been buying and looking at the stocks in that particular area. So, financials and consumption are the top two segments in our portfolio where we keep on looking at ideas and investing opportunities. These are structural ideas and as and when the market demand bounces back, you will see superior growth as well as superior earnings growth in these businesses risks being protected. 


A report from Credit Suisse has come out today and they are pointing to the fact that this is the worst consumption slowdown in the last 15 years and that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Retail balance sheet will start contracting, new jobs will not be created and there is going to be a huge pressure on discretionary demand. Where do you think the expensive stocks like Britannia and Asian Paints move? I am not commenting on a particular house’s report but I have a very different view on that. There are two segments in the market; one believed that there is a complete gloom and doom scenario, demand is getting contracted and all the things just similar to what we saw after demonetisation. I am definitely not in that camp. Look at the June quarter numbers, starting from all the FMCG companies -- be it Dabur, Lever or paints companies -- to plywood companies to pipe companies and refrigerator and air conditioning companies, all grew 5-25% in volume terms. 

The June quarter was just two months ago. If there was a slowdown and no demand, then who were buying these products? I do not believe in that. 

Of course, in automobile, demand got impacted by unavailability of credit over the last two-three quarters. But other than that, by and large, the consumption cycle is not as broken as it is being made out to be. In my opinion, whatever impact we are going to see probably will be mostly in this quarter. We have the festive season coming in, companies will be filling up the pipeline. I am not a big believer in the theory that consumption in India is broken and we are beginning a downward cycle of consumption. I do not believe that at all.

In fact, I believe we will resume the moment the environment settles down and credit supply comes back to the system. We have to see how SMEs start getting credit flow, how HFCs start getting credit flow, how real estate developers start getting credit flow. If all that were to happen, then we will start seeing recovery across the board. That is the single biggest factor one should look for.


What would be your strategy within the auto pack right now?I think, in auto, the worst is behind us. Most of the stocks have stopped reacting to the negative news flow. We have the GST meeting lined up. If there is any cut in the tax rate, we might see a short term boost to the sector. Again, as the credit recovers and some measures on boosting short-term demand is seen, we might see this sector coming back, at least the inventory levels might. This might happen over the next three-four quarters. 

Our take on auto has been that you right now want to play auto only for 30-40% bounce back as and when these measures get taken and demand comes. But will auto get the previous levels of valuations? We have our own doubt because the market has been spooked and will start worrying about the possible headwinds ahead on the disruption side. Hence, one has to question whether auto would get those kind of valuations again. We will watch and wait very clearly that it has to be very clearly a short term trade and then re-evaluated again in light of the new developments."

NEW DELHI: Domestic equity markets opened in the green on Tuesday following a massive fall in crude oil prices and expectations of a rate cut from the US Fed.

Benchmark Sensex opened 140 points up at 36,621.38 while Nifty started the session up about 60 points at 10,872.

Fresh signs of a thaw on the US-China trade front also supported the market sentiment. US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his administration could seal a deal on trade with China before the US presidential election, or an agreement could be reached the day after US voters go to the polls.

There are good chances that the US Fed may decide to cut rates by 25 bps after the conclusion of its meeting. The traders will also be looking at the commentary of the Committee.

Brent crude futures dipped 0.1 per cent to $64.50 a barrel, having conceded more than 60 per cent of their gains made after the weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities.

At the time of writing this report, 23 of the 30 stocks in the Sensex pack were trading higher. On Nifty, 33 stocks were in the green and 17 in the red.

BPCL, Bajaj Finance and Tata Steel led the rally on NSE gaining about 2 per cent. Britannia was the biggest loser in early morning trade, falling over 3 per cent.

Among sectors, PSU Bank was the biggest gainer, rising 1.1 per cent while autos continued their slide, falling over a per cent intraday.

The rupee traded on a strong note, rising 30 paise against the US dollar.

35,2019-09-20,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: After hours of deliberation, the GST Council today announced rate cut on a number of items, amid a chorus of demands for measures to address the slowing economy. All GST rates will be effective from October 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.

Taxation simplifications and rationalisation of tax rules governed the GST council meet today, Sitharaman said.

The panel, comprising state finance ministers and the union finance minister as the chair, was expected to cut tax on 20-25 products.

Almost all quarters of India Inc, including car makers, consumer biggies such as Britannia and Parle, formed lobby groups to push the government to consider their demands for favourable GST action amid a debilitating liquidity crisis.



Here are the key takeaways from the meeting: 


GST Council approves proposal to hike rates on caffeinated drinks from 18% to 28%, plus additional 12 % compensation cess. Aerated drinks shall no longer be under compensation scheme.
Council approves proposal to cut rates on hotel tariffs. Rooms with tariff Rs 7,500 and above will now be taxed at 18%. Prior to the cut, the GST rate on this category was 28%. GST on rooms with tariff between Rs 1001 and Rs 7,500 now stands at 12%. No GST on tariffs upto Rs 1,000. 
GST on cups, plates made from flower, leaves and bio-friendly material has been reduced to zero from 5%.
GST on goods under Chapter 12 which includes supplies to railways has been hiked to 12% from 5%. This is without refund on the accumulated input tax credit (ITC).
Compensation cess on petrol motor vehicles with 10-13 person capacity reduced to 1%, while on diesel vehicles it has been reduced to 3%. Before the cut, the compensation cess was at 15 per cent.
GST on marine fuel cut to 5% vs 18% earlier.
Uniform rate of 12% on woven / non-woven polyethylene bags.
Exemption from GST/iGST is being given on import of specified defence goods not being manufactured indigenously, it's being extended only up to 2024. Supply of goods and services to FIFA & other specified persons also exempted for Under-17 Women's World Cup in India."
34,2019-09-20,Britannia,"If you find stocks that will compound over periods of time, you will have served your portfolio and yourself well, says Ramesh Damani, Member, BSE. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What are the lessons one can take away from the market?When I joined, the index was 800, today it is 40,000 and in the last 30 years, India has faced all sorts of tragedies. We have sent our gold to the IMF. We have had Kargil. Governments have come and gone. But the long term is a triumph of the optimist. While we are going through a particularly bad phase right now, most people will admit that we are in a very tough phase, there is an unexpected slowdown in the economy. There is a slowdown in corporate profits that is unexpected, but the arch of the stock market still points higher. 

What I have learnt over long periods of time is to find great businesses and not worry too much and sit it out. You might obviously get gains immediately, but if you can find stocks that will compound over periods of time, you will have served your portfolio and yourself well.


You are also somebody who has a close eye on global investing scenario, you have seen economies evolve over time. What phase of the Indian economy are in we right now so that one could understand how Indian markets are likely to be in five, seven, ten years? We are in an exciting time because every bull market tells a story and the story of this bull market has been that India is going to leapfrog like Japan did in the 1960s when it went from a third world country to a first world country. 

I am not saying we are going to make that kind of quantum leap out here because our population base is much bigger, but we are going to create a middle class of some significant size in India based on economic prosperity. Now that it has been delayed a little bit, obviously the economy is slowing down right now. Ultimately the prime minister said that we get to be a $5-trillion economy. It might be seven years, it might be eight years, it does not really matter but we are going to be a $5-trillion economy. That will be a good source of prosperity for people. On the whole, I am constructive on our economic case despite it being troublesome. But any time you have to weed out inefficiency, corruption and tax evasion, it causes pain and I hope that we can recover. It requires a strong mandate from Delhi but I am hopeful that will happen.


How are you assessing various parts of Indian market valuations after the corrections that have panned out right now? Dou see scope of alpha in next couple of years?Starting point values matter as does stock selection. We are buying very expensive stocks at this point hoping alpha or momentum will take them higher. They may but they typically do not end very well. I mean even glamour stocks correct and stay in a correction zone for a year or sometimes decades after that. 

It is important for investors to find good valuations and I would suggest to them on a contrary basis to look at these midcap stocks which have bombed out completely. But some of them have good corporate governance, good visibility and good earnings. You could probably find value on those businesses.


You must have observed the various commentary coming from corporates from all sections not only autos and any other and you are also quasi corporates. What is your view, what is the handle on the demand scenario as far as the consumer goes?In the retail part of the segment, where I am looking, no growth slowdown can be seen from the numbers, but if you look at auto or cement, there is some slowdown in bigger ticket items that are not popular consumption items.


Britannia made a headline when they said that biscuit sales are falling. Are all the categories under D-Mart exaggerated?I do not want to particularly talk about those things because those get into areas which I am not supposed to talk.


Do you think that slowdown issue is exaggerated?To be honest yes, there is palpable slowdown in many industries. The traders community fighting but there are some sectors which have been immune to these sort of problems. So, I would not necessarily paint it with the same brush or there are some industries are struggling and I think they require some sops but we need energy in this country. Forget everything else, the government needs to perhaps lower the direct tax rate and go with the PSU privatisation programme. In Delhi, they understand that the economy is in pain and they need to give proactive measures to revive it. I think they will come, and so I am hopeful.


What are your thoughts on disruption? Some of the categories like shared mobility have already got disrupted but what is on your radar?It is extraordinary what you said. Everyone is, of course, familiar with the Ubers and Olas of the world which have had a direct impact on car sales. But recently, you would think that America could have a large non-vegetarian population but even when they speak to you, the Vege Impossible Burger launch by Burger King is challenging the basic pretext of the non-veg industry, that you can have your protein and you can have it on a plant based diet as opposed to a cattle-based diet. The profound implications of this for the livestock companies and processed food companies will mean all will undergo a rapid change. So, technology is challenging various industries at various times. As an investor, we need to be cognisant of that.


In fact, we also saw the speed at which Beyond Meat stock really went up in the US?I was stunned, I thought it was just some fad going on and maybe it will take 20-30 years before it plays out. But there is a very clear possibility now that investors would not prefer beef or chicken but would prefer plant-based protein because it is just not only environmentally more friendly, the footprint for water is much less in those compared to the others. The number of litres of water it takes is huge compared to the plant protein that we are talking about. The economic implications are fairly staggering. So, industry after industry, automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, Ola and Uber, investors have to be cognisant. There are a few businesses of course which will survive. These are businesses with moats. There are some businesses; the sin stocks for example; cigarette, alcohol, seem recession proof. If you are feeling bad, you want a drink; you are feeling good, you want a drink, right. I do not think that business is going to be impacted immediately. So there are a few businesses, investors should look for those businesses but otherwise you should keep an eye on the technological cycle.


Are you giving a nudge that Indian alcohol and similar stocks which have gone into a bit of a range for the last couple of months and quarters, are looking attractive?I would say that starting a few years ago, you were paying too high a price for them. These are great stocks, they are great franchisees. You can see the profitability for the next two, three, five years down the road. So I think the stocks now have corrected and they have come to somewhat more reasonable levels so they will continue to perform.


You have observed Mr Trump for long and the functioning of America. We are just months away from elections there as well. The way trade war issue is panning out and the way the fresh geopolitical risk in Saudi has erupted, what significance does it hold for Indian markets?The Saudi drone attacks caught me by surprise. Saudi Arabia has a $75-billion budget in defence, third highest after US, USSR and yet they could not protect two key installations which is their life blood. That means they are more vulnerable, and this could escalate, get out of hand because clearly Saudi Arabia was caught napping at the wheel.

It is inconceivable to me that you would be so vulnerable in your key installations. That could lead to some geopolitical storm going on and given the fact that Mr Trump is already pushing the pedal with China, a lot of the medicines in the world, the API comes from China. So, they can start moving the prices up or cutting the supply of this thing. There is a lot of problems that need to be addressed by investors in the world and the Dow has had a 10-year bull run. It has gone to the 27000 level and has fallen viciously three times. This is the fourth time it is trying to make an attempt on that, let us see where it goes."

36,2019-09-21,Britannia,"MUMBAI: Consumer companies are likely to plough savings from India’s biggest corporate tax cuts into building new factories and expanding operating assets instead of immediately slashing sticker prices of branded apparel, home appliances, cookies or other grocery items.

“A lower tax outflow definitely means higher free cash flow, which could lead to better working capital and more money for expansion,” said Rakesh Biyani, joint managing director, Future Retail that owns Big Bazaar, Central and EasyDay.

Hindustan Unilever, Colgate, ITC, Britannia and Nestlé will benefit since their effective rates are 30-35%, higher than the recent announcement of 25%. Stocks of Britannia, HUL and Nestlé climbed between 6% and 9% on Friday.

Companies said the move would help spur investment, although the jury is out on immediate revival in consumption demand.

“A change in income tax slabs would have given money into the hands of the consumers, translating into immediate consumption. Here, some of the companies are, in any case, strapped for profit,” said J Suresh, MD, Arvind Lifestyle Brands, which runs about two dozen brands such as Gap, Arrow, Children’s Place and Sephora.

A Credit Suisse report said it expects most consumer companies to retain gains, or at best spread them over two years. Companies with large gains may smoothen earnings by increasing ad spends in FY20/21. FMCG, apparel and retail segments have been battling slower growth for over three quarters now.

Smartphone and home appliances saw a dip in sales beginning July. “A reduction in goods and service tax would have a direct impact on prices, apart from recent scrapping of import duty on LED television panels, whereby prices for LED TVs will slip 2-3% from end-October,” said Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive, Super Plastronics that makes Kodak and Thomson TVs.

India’s festive season, beginning with Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam, is the biggest shopping period, accounting for 35-40% of annual sales of consumer-facing companies. “The corporate tax structure is not factored in the pricing mechanism and hence any benefit there will not reflect in the end consumer pricing,” a senior executive with a leading smartphone maker said.

In FMCG, a high percentage of goods are manufactured in excisefree zones in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and the North East that also enjoy central excise duty exemption or duty refund.

“At present, the impact is marginal but once we are past sunset dates for tax-free units, we can benefit from lower taxes,” said Saugata Gupta, managing director at Marico Ltd. Also, most companies said it is difficult to predict exactly which goods will have the most noticeable price reduction, they were confident the move will boost overall sentiment. “The feel-good factor of this move will create optimism and consumption will certainly be spurred,” said Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia. “The government has taken economic slowdown very seriously and has taken concrete steps to ease the situation, considering the tough operating environment in India.”

The FMCG sector expanded 10% in the three months to June, marginally slower than 10.6% in the first quarter of FY19. However, sequentially, revenue growth has been consistently declining in the past four quarters from their peak of 16.2% in the three months to September 2018."
37,2019-09-21,Britannia,"A cut in the corporate tax is expected to result in the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006. The growth in the Nifty 50’s earnings per share (EPS) may be upgraded by 7-8%. This will be a significant improvement given that the index’s 12-month expected EPS had fallen by 5% to Rs 645 after the June 2019 quarter results – the highest earnings downgrade among the top global equity markets.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded the estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25% for FY20 from 13% earlier.

Kotak Institutional Equities revised upwards its earnings growth for Nifty 50 to 25% from 15% buoyed by the sharp cut in corporate tax rate. According to Kotak estimate, automobiles, banks, capital goods, consumer staples, diversified financials and oil, gas & consumable fuels will be key beneficiaries of the cut while electric utilities, IT and pharmaceuticals will see little or no impact.



 At present, there are twenty companies in the Nifty 50 with tax rate higher than 25%. They have a cumulative weight of 39% in the index. The prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30% in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty 50 soon, will be another big beneficiary considering its tax rate of 34% in FY19.

The average tax rate for the broader BSE 500 index was 31-34% in the past two fiscals with tax outgo of Rs 2.3 lakh crore. It accounted of 34% of the total corporate tax collection, according to Credit Suisse.

The lower corporate tax may also help in improving valuations of Indian equities given the possible improvement in the return on equity. They trade at 40% premium to the MSCI Emerging Market Index, which is close to the 10-year average of 41%. A year ago, it was over 70%. A possibility of superior earnings should help in widening the current premium."

38,2019-09-23,Britannia,"Mumbai: The Sensex and Nifty could advance 6-11 per cent by December as last Friday’s corporate tax rate cuts rekindle hopes of a revival in demand and growth as well as earnings boost, the majority of participants in an ET poll said.

The poll of 23 fund managers and brokerage research heads showed that investors expect large-cap stocks in banking, consumer and cement segments to benefit the most from the stimulus. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, ACC and Britannia Industries are among the top picks of the poll participants.

About 79 per cent of the poll participants believe that the worst is over for the markets. Half of the respondents see the Nifty between 12,000 and 12,500 by the end of the year, almost 11 per cent gain from the current levels.

The Sensex and Nifty soared over 5 per cent on Friday, clocking the biggest singleday gain in a decade after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced tax rate cuts for companies during trading hours the same day.


Overall Sentiment to Improve

The Nifty closed at 11,274.2 and the Sensex ended at 38,014.62 on Friday.

The Nifty could move up to 12,500-13,000 by year-end, said 28 per cent of the poll participants. The less optimistic—about 17 per cent of the participants—see the Nifty between 11,500 and 12,000.

“With corporate earnings set to improve, investors would certainly see better value in Indian equities,” said Rashesh Shah, chairman, Edelweiss Group. “Corporate tax cut will improve the overall sentiment; it will not only positively impact a company’s bottom line, but also assure the people of India that the economy is moving back on track,” said Shah.



Investors — mainly foreign funds and the country’s rich — had turned their backs on Indian equities recently following concerns of economic slowdown, liquidity crisis in nonbanking finance companies and lack of corporate earnings revival. The US-China trade war too contributed to the pessimism. Many mid- and small-cap shares have tumbled 50-70 per cent since January 2018 while a few bluechips managed to minimise losses in Sensex and Nifty. On Thursday, the Nifty touched a low of 10,670.25, which is 12 per cent below the lifetime high of 12,103 hit in early June.

With Friday’s gains, indices wiped out losses to trade positive for the year. Sensex and Nifty are now up 3-4 per cent in 2019.

Large-caps remain a favourite with money managers, with 53 per cent saying they would prefer them over midcaps. Banks, consumer, cement, auto and capital goods companies are the top sector bits, the poll showed.

“With this (tax cut) measure, the government has made a serious communication that it wants to drive up the economy. It is giving a $20 billion stimulus to the corporate sector, which in turn will decide how they want to use it, either shore up demand for products or get better margins to make further investments,” said Rajat Rajgarhia, CEO, Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities.


FOLLOW-UP MEASURES

Some in the market believe the government should follow up with more measures related to land acquisition and labour laws to boost the confidence further.

“We hope the government can deliver on follow-up reforms with respect to factors of production and the role of government in business. So, it is a necessary condition but maybe still not sufficient condition for a big increase in investment,” said Sanjeev Prasad, co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities.

Money managers believe that corporations are likely to use the tax benefits to reduce debt first, while expansion of business and returning the benefit to shareholders are likely to be the next two big focus areas.

“Corporates will use this benefit for various purposes, but a good part of this will be used for reinvesting back into the business in some form or the other. No single step revives the economy but this is a big enough step along with various other measures to give a boost,” said Rajgarhia.

A section of the market believes the market has largely factored in the optimism around the corporate tax rate cut.

“The market has largely priced in the positive impact of lower tax rate on earnings. Stocks have gone up 10-15 per cent or higher in some cases, the maximum impact on earnings due to the tax cut,” said Prasad of Kotak Institutional Equities. “It remains to be seen as to how much of the benefit the companies will be able to retain. In certain sectors, companies will have to pass on the benefit to consumers due to competitive dynamics,” said Prasad."

44,2019-09-23,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: The government’s move to lower corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent is likely to ensure Rs 72,000 crore savings for about 300-odd companies in the BSE500 basket. This would improve cash flows and earnings, and may help a few companies boost demand by passing on the tax benefits to end users.

In value terms, banks and financials, oil & gas, metals and mining, consumption and capital goods companies would gain the most, analysts said. Sectors such as IT, pharmaceuticals and electric utilities may see only limited gains, they said.

Stocks such as HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finserv and State Bank of India, among others, may lead the BFSI space with Rs 27,994 crore in savings in FY21, suggests a study by KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Stocks like ONGC, IOC and Reliance Industries could add Rs 12,459 crore to profits. Metals and mining firms such as Vedanta, Coal India and Tata Steel may add Rs 8,820 crore to aggregate bottom line. Consumption stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints and Nestle India, among others, and capital goods companies L&T, Siemens and others may together see over Rs 11,000 crore addition to their profits.



Having said that, the stocks may not go on a relentless rally. Edelweiss Securities said after Friday’s big rally, upsides may be more modest from here on.

The brokerage projects Nifty at 11,600 by September, 2020. That said, the brokerage sees more opportunities to take on risk at stock as well as portfolio levels.

Goldman Sachs on Friday reasserted its positive view on India, and raised its 12-month Nifty target to 13,200 from 12,500 earlier, saying recent pro-growth measures, a boost to already the highest earnings growth in the region and a likely revival in sentiment further strengthen the positive investment case for India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said companies currently availing exemptions can opt for paying the new tax rates, only once the exemption periods get over. On the other hand, companies which will avail the lower tax rate will not be able to avail any of the exemptions.

Domestic equity indices saw their second-biggest intraday rally of the year on Friday, as the Rs 1.45 lakh crore tax relief brought down effective tax rate for domestic companies to 25.6 per cent from 34.9 per cent. Sensex galloped 1,921 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 38,014, while Nifty zoomed 569 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 11,274.

Meanwhile, MAT or minimum alternate 
tax which applies to ‘zero 
tax companies’ has been reduced to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent earlier.

“Looking at the PAT boost due to lower taxes and keeping the current Street expectations and valuations in mind, we could see a 23 per cent upside in the overall market in next 2- 3 years,” KR Choksey said in a note.

For benchmark Nifty, analysts now expect a profit growth of 24-26 per cent compared with 13-15 per cent earlier.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded its estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25 per cent for FY20 from 13 per cent earlier. Kotak Securities expects net profits of Nifty firms to grow at 25 per cent for FY2020 against 15 per cent projected earlier.

This assumes that companies will retain bulk of the tax cuts. In reality, some of them will pass on some of the benefits to consumers. If this happens, it would be the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006.

Among Nifty stocks, 20 companies with tax rates higher than 25 per cent have a cumulative weightage of 39 per cent in the index.

Prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut would include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30 per cent in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty50 soon, will be another big beneficiary, considering it had a tax rate of 34 per cent in FY19.

Meanwhile, apart from recurring earnings benefit, there will also be one-time gains on deferred tax liabilities for companies such as RIL, Ultratech, among others, and one-time loss on deferred tax assets for corporate banks, Edelweiss Securities said."

47,2019-09-24,Britannia,"Private sector banks, the consumer stocks as well as the capex plays are what would drive this rally, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Nifty is up 8.5% post the tax cut. If I look at the consensus earnings estimates from Morgan, Goldman Sachs and UBS, Nifty earnings upgrade are in the 7-8% range. Can I say that fundamentally the best part of the rally is now behind us? If markets go higher now, it will be on momentum and liquidity?We have majorly underperformed our own markets post budget, particularly even year till date and whatever upside of 8% that we have seen is taking care of that part. Now in terms of the overall impact, we would not just see the earnings upgrades, because of the kind of tax cuts that we have seen, typically these kind of events change the sentiment and the earnings dynamics for a long period of time. 

The market would start factoring in the overall earnings trajectory, where we had not seen any growth for almost about three to four years, to a much higher earnings growth trajectory for next three to four years. It would also be a combination of the PE re-rating that we may witness. I do not think we should be looking at this as a small event. This is a game changer and this could bring about a big bull cycle over the next three to four years


What is catching your eye, what is looking interesting at this point?There are three pillars of this possible rally that we are witnessing right now. First is the banks, the entire private sector banks pack where one is really looking at the significant re-rating and growth because of the lower base and the market share gains, etc. 

The second is the consumer names -- right from Britannia to HUL and whole host of companies where there is going to be a major re-rating because of the tax impact and better sentiment. 

Third, the players which would be the beneficiaries of the possible capex revival which we all have been waiting for a long time. So the story around L&T and other equipment players would gather momentum. These are the three key pillars of the possible rally that we are going to see over the next three to four years.


But the big debate is whether you buy afresh right now and would the capex investment side of the economy now be more lucrative in terms of investment as opposed to consumption?This kind of big rally would always leave a certain amount of doubts in the minds of investors on whether they should participate now. But looking at the kind of upside we see now, it would not be sensible to try and time it or wait for some kind of a correction. In that case, you might miss out on a very big upside over a period of time. 

Also coming to consumption versus capital goods plays, we have a broad rally where both consumption as well as the capex players would participate. Some of these capex companies’ current numbers are not looking great. So, they might look a bit stretched in terms of valuation and the actual numbers may take some time to reflect. I definitely think that we should have a basket which has enough of consumer names, enough of capital goods plays and of course the banks and some midcap companies.


If the underlying view towards government action has changed, do you think the underlying view for PSU stocks should also change because that is where value is?We should take a company by company approach, rather than taking a broader view on PSUs as a sector. The steps that have been taken may be a bit of sentiment booster but the oil marketing companies would stand to benefit. 

Because of higher taxation that they are paying and the fact that there could be some sort of positive news flow in terms of the divestment, or some kind of scheme to unlock the value. there could be some rerating for select PSU companies which are doing well. 

I would definitely not be too positive on the PSU banking space because a combination of tax cut or overall growth that one is looking at is not looking that impressive for the PSU banking space per se. So yes, some of the companies in the oil marketing space are looking interesting."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits” for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India. The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list” of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries to smaller names including Manappuram Finance , Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.

“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,” he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.”



India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.

Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9 per cent while small cap names gained 7 per cent. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3 per cent in the last three sessions.

The gains show that the “first round impact” of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.

Here are the key insights from the report



Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6 per cent above Tuesday’s close
Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75 per cent of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment
Quality list additions: Britannia Industries, UltraTech Cement, GAIL, Hero MotoCorp, AU Small Finance Bank, Nestle India, Manappuram Finance, Repco Home Finance, Symphony, Power Grid, GlaxoSmithkline Consumer
Deletions from list: Sun Pharma, HDFC , Cipla, JSW Steel, L&T Infotech, Sun TV, TeamLease Services, Can Fin Homes, Eris Lifesciences, Adani Ports, Reliance Industries, Crompton Greaves, InterGlobe Aviation."
50,2019-09-25,Britannia,"At the time when the scuttlebutt among Dalal Street investors has been around stock picking, after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a series of measures to boost the Indian economy, value investor Rajiv Khanna is sceptical about this rally. 

He says new companies, for whom the FM has announced 15 per cent corporate tax, will get a lot of investment over time and, therefore, it is good thinking. Khanna said certain companies would benefit from the corporate tax cut. 

However, he said issues related to economic slowdown would take their own time to play out, unless the government made sure the consumer gets more money in their pockets. “That problem remains unaddressed,” he told ETMarkets.com in an interaction.

“I wish she (Sitharaman) would address that. The current rally is irrational exuberance. I am a bit sceptical about it, unless consumer gets more money in their hands,” he said.

Khanna, the brain behind Dolly Khanna’s multibagger portfolio, is one of the most successful stock investors on Dalal Street. This Chennai-based investor has a knack for identifying quality stocks at the right time and has pocketed stellar returns over the years. 

In the current market, he is still waiting for the economic slowdown to subside. “Let consumption start increasing, then I will start investing. At this point, slowdown is a reality. I am waiting for data points to emerge. I am not guessing it. I am looking for growth right now. Nothing at this point looks attractive to me. It is still a wait and watch for me,” said Khanna, whose portfolio is now worth Rs 200 crore based on the holdings as of June 30.

The aggregate market capitalisation of the BSE-listed firms swelled by over Rs 10 lakh crore in just two sessions till September 23. The market mood took a ‘U’ a turn after the government on September 20 cut corporate tax rate by almost 10 percentage points, as it looked to pull the economy out of a six-year-low growth rate and address a 45-year high unemployment rate by reviving private investment with a Rs 1.45 lakh crore corporate tax bonanza.

Khanna sold his stake in several companies through this selloff. He held six companies in his portfolio with over one per cent holding as of June 30 against 11 as of March 31, Ace Equity data showed.

The base rate for corporate tax for existing companies has dropped to 22 per cent from 30 per cent at present. For new manufacturing firms, incorporated after October 1, 2019 and starting operations before March 31, 2023, it was slashed to 15 per cent from 25 per cent at present.

Among other notable investors on Dalal Street, Mumbai-based value investor Vijay Kedia believes short covering took the market higher over Friday and Monday.

However, he said the market might not rise substantially from here on, because the problems at macroeconomic levels – including job losses and demand issues – have remained unresolved yet.

He sees subdued numbers for automobile sales and GDP growth. “Things that were in bad shape are still in bad shape. It will take time for them to improve. One should look for opportunities in the midcap space from October onwards,” Kedia said.

With an 8 per cent rally each, both BSE midcap and smallcap indices outpaced the benchmark Sensex index (up 4.71 per cent) on a month-to-date basis till September 23.

Abhishek Basumullick, Kolkata-based value investor and Chief Investment Advisor, Intelsense Capital, believes companies that are able to effectively manage returns on capital employed (RoCE) would be able to use the additional tax saving well. Therefore, investors should look for quality and capital-efficient companies and avoid panic buying.

One in every five companies in the BSE500 index has managed to post RoCE of over 20 per cent in last five years. The list included HUL, Britannia Industries, VST Industries, Hero MotoCorp, TCS, Care Ratings, Asian Paints, Bajaj Consumer Care, Mindtree, Whirlpool and Alembic Pharma.

Aveek Mitra, Founder, Aveksat Financial Advisory, says the worst for midcap and smallcap stocks is over. He advised investors to look for companies doing better than the industry or have good capex in the recent past."

53,2019-09-26,Britannia,"We are advising our clients to accumulate in tranches, rather than just getting carried away that the market would see rise from here on as well, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How should one approach markets now -- exercise some caution or stay fully invested? Go with the flow or go against the flow?On 29th August, when I was last on your channel, we gave a call that markets would come back roaring from around 10,600-10,700 and we are happy that the call has worked. I do not see technicals but fundamentally also we thought that there would be some valuation support which market would take and nobody knew that such a desperate measure or reform measure would come in, but probably that has helped the market not only to turn the sentiment around but also on a fundamental standpoint, if somebody talks about macros and micros, we know that macros are not exactly as we would have wanted at 5% GDP growth rate. 

But micros -- if it directly adds to the earnings of the companies or if it helps in reviving capex or price cuts which can probably spur demand -- would be a game changer at least on the supply side. We are advising our clients to stay with good stocks that we have been recommending and not to get carried away by the rally. Do not buy duds. It is not the time to buy only turnaround candidates. It is time to buy companies which are seeing earnings growth, which are having the robust business model or which are market leaders or high market share companies. We are advising our clients to accumulate in tranches, rather than just getting carried away that the market would see rise from here on as well.


Are you saying that you knew about the tax cut because nothing fundamentally has changed, the markets have gone up because of tax cut only.That is what I said. Nobody knew there would be such a reform but we felt that at some level, market would have a floor where at least on a fundamental standpoint, valuations are somewhere around screaming buys or some largecaps, which had not corrected, they also started to correct and there was a bit of capitulation in the market. 

That is why we said to start buying in tranches. Nobody knew there would be such a stellar rally following such tax cuts. But we felt that if somebody invests at that level, there is a good probability to make money in the next 12-18 months. God has been kind. Money was made in this last one week. 


We have seen some long unwinding and major moves across that auto pocket post the tax cuts. There was also a move on the downside after some amount of profit booking. What is your take on the trend going forward now?A lot of it was just due to the optimism of an earnings uptick and a lot of the sectors and I think it was more a rally of disbelief where there were a lot of shorts in the system and also there was a lot of pessimism in the prices. So on the day of the first leg of the rally, it would have been justified but the rally that continued on Monday was a little more overdone and that is what is getting corrected. 

We have not yet seen the demand coming back. These are the two crucial months to give a call on this. Navratri starts this month and next month is the festive Dussehra as well as the Diwali season. If the festive demand does not come back even for two-wheelers or some passenger car vehicle companies, it is going to be a tough ride. But if it comes back after price cuts which Maruti announced yesterday, we can see a bit of rerating. Again I am not saying that we would be the greatest buyers, but the complexion has changed from a sell to a bit of a hold.


We have had mixed views this week on Reliance Industries. There was an upgrade news with regards to possible spending post debt reduction, but there is a huge overhang on the debt reduction front. Is there any scope of an upside in RIL in the near term?Clearly debt reduction and an expected deal seems to be the trigger right now. The market has also started to give a huge thumbs up in terms of Jio. They have done a lot of capex which probably would start showing results after sometime. That is where the telecom business would come into picture where they are grabbing market share and subscriber additions which has started to happen in the Jio Fiber business is also something that the street is watching out for. 

The markets from here on would do well. These are the leaders -- a couple of banks along with Reliance. In a very street-smart way, if the market is going to go up from here, I think Reliance needs to participate and whether it can carry out debt reduction in 18 months or 24 months is debatable but if the debt is reduced, the stock would get premium valuations. With a long term view of two-three years, it should be a candidate for accumulation on dips.


Are you telling your clients to buy ITC? We look at a lot of companies and their 10-year, 5-year and 3-year performances. We look at revenue growth, PAT growth and EBITDA growth of these companies. Simultaneously, if these companies have grown 12-15-20%, we see whether the market cap of this company has also shown simultaneous jump or more than that. That is where we would be interested in wealth creation. We find that ITC does not tick a lot of these boxes except for dividend yield which could turn out to be 4-5%. India is not such a dividend yield market, it is more of a growth market. 

We are more bullish on companies like Dabur; Marico, Britannia and Nestle, which would always be expensive if you compare it to ITC but they are not like to like businesses. ITC trades at half the valuation or in fact less than half of HUL. It deserves a bit of re-rating but to be very fair, we have not bought it in our portfolios as yet.


From an investment perspective, are OMCs an attractive bet or are they at best just a trading play?That depends upon the news flow in the market and we ourselves have never got into this type of stocks which are PSUs and also cyclicals. The dependence is more or less on the crude part and that is also impacted by negative or positive news flows. If the divestment of BPCL is what the street believes in, there will be a bit of a rerating on the cards. But it would be a more speculative set of news. We would avoid the oil marketing space at this point."
54,2019-09-26,Britannia,"Companies can expect a maximum 15% hike in PAT following the cut in corporate tax. It varies from company to company, depending on the kind of exemptions that they were subject to or were taking earlier, says Mayank Shah, Category Head, Parle Products. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What sort of benefit are you expecting from the corporate tax cut? What is the current effective rate of tax and what will be the new rate that you will be paying?Like most companies, our current effective tax was upward of 30% and now it would go down to somewhere around 25%. Quite a few consumer companies that were in the 30% bracket, have gone down now to 25.17%, all depending on what are the benefits that were accruing out of various exemptions earlier. Depending on that, the tax rate has come down. So yes, some kind of a cushion has been provided by the government and that would also depend on the sector in which you are and the kind of margins that you were subject to. 

A lot would depend on the kind of PBT that you were operating on. If the PBT was higher prior to the exemption that was given, then the kind of gains that the company would be making would be higher than the companies where the PBT was lower because we are effectively talking about 10-15% increase in PAT following the cut in corporate tax.


You had already hiked prices on certain varieties due to GST. Would this reduction in direct tax change your pricing strategy? No. That is what I meant when I said that it depends on the PBT. If you are talking about PBT being lower then the effective gain, then the benefit is not really significant. We are talking about a 15% increase in PAT and that is the maximum. It varies from company to company, depending on what were the kind of exemptions that they were subject to or they were taking earlier. 

Depending on that, if you are in a cycle or if you are subject to higher tax rates, then with this 25.17% tax rate, if you are improving your PAT by about 5-10%. The scope of passing it on to the consumer is limited. What you would probably do is instead of a blanket cut in the prices of your products, you may selectively cut prices in certain categories.


Even in the recent GST Council meeting, there was no mention of reducing GST on biscuits. Are you a little worried about losing business to unorganised players? What would be your next step to try and improve growth?From what we have gathered, this time, because of paucity of time, biscuits as a category was not taken up. We are hopeful that the government will look at it and would consider it and so we have not given up hope. What honestly surprises us is how can both the categories of biscuits -- below Rs 100 and above Rs 100 -- be clubbed together under one category and be subject to uniform rate of GST. 


An AC Nielsen survey shows that biscuits have seen the lowest value growth for the category in the last two years. That has been impacted by the overall slowdown in consumption across the country. We understand that as a category, volume of biscuits have come down from 10.9% in Q2 FY19 to 1.9% in Q1 FY19. Would you be able to confirm these figures for us?Yes so it has been. This was primarily driven by a) volume; and b) the extreme price sensitivity of biscuits below Rs 100 per kg. These are biscuits sold in smaller LUPs (low unit packs) costing Rs 2, Rs 3, Rs 4, Rs 5. If you go for an indirect price hike, where you reduce the count of biscuits, that is something consumers are extremely sensitive to. 

The moment they do not see value there, they will move on to local produce, lose items which are available in the market. That is honestly not really good for anybody. Consumers do not get hygienically processed food. Companies lose out on revenue to unorganised segment and even the government loses out on tax collections because the unorganised segment is not tax compliant.


Has the consumption pattern been between your premium products as well as your standard products? Where has the down trading happened, if at all? Tell us about the latest trends?The premium products are not really an issue and that is the reason why we have been talking to the government. We have never asked for any reduction in GST on premium products. We have been fine with it and we have told the government that there is no request for any reduction of GST in biscuits above Rs 100 per kg because those are premium and are relatively unaffected by the current slowdown. 


Recently Britannia said that people are thinking twice to buy even a Rs 5 product. What do you think about that and what are the overall demand trends? Is the situation as dire as that or have things changed now?No, that is precisely what I am also saying. When you talk about people thinking twice before buying a biscuit of Rs 5, that is precisely the category we are talking about, the categories which are below Rs 100 per kg. They are typically the ones which are sold at Rs 5 packs and below. That is an industry-wide observation and consumers are thinking twice at that end of the market. While we welcomed the government step of cutting the corporate taxes and providing some kind of cushion, the larger issue of GST on biscuits below Rs 100 remain and we are hopeful that the government will consider that."

Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


SBI is down 22% in three months. ICICI Bank is up by 3.4% in three months. So, there is a huge gap.The management of one bank is working hard to improve whatever is happening and improve growth, the management of the other bank is praying. That is the difference. The problem is expectation versus delivery. In ICICI Bank, after Chanda Kochhar’s time, their delivery is better than what they have been saying. In case of SBI, they have been promising a lot, but not delivering to that extent.


That could be the environment. Who would have thought a year ago that Zee would get into this trouble? Who would have thought a year ago that IL&FS would happen. Would you give a benefit of doubt to SBI because the dynamism is changing?I would have but after the March quarter results, they gave a very hunky-dory picture. After that, nothing has changed in the environment. If at all, things would have got better, but they are still not being able to deliver. I am not talking about what they said a year back, I am talking about what they said after the March results which led to a huge rally and the stock went to Rs 390 odd. It made a new high! Although the results were bad, they gave such a rosy picture that the market just took it in its stride and the stock shot up.

After that, the next quarter delivery was bad and then their commentary was totally hazy. They were totally unsure of what is happening and I think that is the problem. 


You track Britannia and Dabur pretty closely. If you had to pick out one of the names to buy today, which one would it be?Today I would not buy anything but we hold both these stocks and we keep on adding Britannia whenever it dips. Recently, when there was a selloff, it was a very opportunity to pick up stocks. Dabur has not participated much in the current rally but it held steady in the entire correction because their guidance on volume growth always has been better than other companies. 

The reason why it has not participated so much in the recent past is because it is still not full taxpaying because it has some tax advantages. It does not immediately benefit from the corporate tax cut, but eventually every company benefits. I would think that all these consumption names remain good names. Fund flows into equities domestically remains strong. Fund managers continue to be wary and to that extent we are seeing greater flows into defensives rather than companies which benefit due to economic revival and this could continue.


When you are looking at selling stake, you need to be transparent. Oil marketing companies may be forced to pay out more dividend and there could be a royalty on crude. On paper, BPCL is a great asset at a reasonable price, but the buyer may be reluctant because we do not have very firm, clear retail policy in India..This is the reason why the stocks got sold out prior to election. The strategy was to sell and not buy before the election results and buy them once the election results were through and that strategy has actually done reasonably well. 

Now excise duty hikes do not really matter because that gets passed on to consumers, unless the companies are forced to absorb that, in which case, it hits their margin. That is something which is highly unlikely. I do not think the government is going to do that. Governments could always ask for higher dividend and that has been a strategy of the government over the last few years. It has tried to take out higher dividends from PSUs like Coal India, etc. That can happen and on the fuel pricing front, there is always a risk of interference.

But if and when it gets sold, I do not think the government will be able to intervene in the fuel pricing decisions of the privatised company. For example, Reliance or Essar price their fuel as they want to. They do not really follow what the government companies are doing. Those are the subsets in which we have to operate. A large part of BPCL’s move is due to some expected news flow on a potential disinvestment. If that disinvestment does not happen, then it creates a downside of 15% to 20% from the current levels. 


Were you short on BPCL?In this market going short and trying to become oversmart is a sureshot way to lose money. Buy whatever you want to buy on the long side rather than trying to short for a few percentage gains. I do not know what is going to happen. If I knew that this is a false news, then I would short. But I do not know whether it is actually happening or not. So either way, keep on holding whatever you are holding in the investment portfolios, and you do not really trade because trading on either side is risky now, at least in BPCL.


Should one steer clear of Piramal?One should because this is a very non-transparent company in the sense that what their lending book actually is no one knows. A greater risk comes from the lending book because it is believed that they have lent hugely to the real estate space and a lot of money is stuck there. People should be very wary.


PSU banks are like this ugly ducklings. Fund managers do not buy them as they have poor capital allocation. Institutional investors would say we bought them two years ago and we lost money and now we do not want to buy them. But is this the honey pot right now? I would say that some of the PSUs have moved in expectation of disinvestment but one should be wary of one thing, in the government. things do not happen as fast as people expect and all sort of things happen. In the past, we have seen strategic disinvestments getting delayed by two years. Although the news flow shows the intent of the government is there. So they could do it and they should rather do it but whether they will be able to do it is something we do not know.


Inox and Havells, what else?Those stocks are doing well, the entire entertainment space, actually. That is how people should invest.


What is next? What are doing in autos?
In autos, at this stage, we hold a small position in Ashok Leyland and we hold Maruti and Hero MotoCorp. I believe both have value. From here, in terms of percentage gain potential, Hero MotoCorp has a decently good return potential and investors should look at that."

57,2019-09-29,Britannia,"New Delhi: After remaining net sellers for the past two months, foreign investors infused a net Rs 7,714 crore into the domestic capital markets in September following a slew of economic reforms by the government.

The Centre last week slashed corporate tax rate by around 10 percentage points and also clarified that the enhanced tax surcharge will not apply on capital gains arising from sale of any security, including derivatives, in the hands of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).

Besides, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) simplified KYC requirements for FPIs and granted them permission to carry out off-market transfer of securities.

As per latest depositories data, FPIs poured in a net Rs 7,849.89 crore into equities and withdrew a net Rs 135.59 crore from the debt segment between September 3-27, translating into a cumulative net inflow of Rs 7,714.30 crore.

Prior to this, foreign investors had pulled out a net Rs 5,920.02 crore in August and Rs 2,985.88 crore in July from the domestic capital markets (both equity and debt).

""The government has initiated many reforms to embrace the FPIs in the home country by way of abolishing additional surcharge on the capital gains to slashing the corporate tax rates to attract new foreign investment.

""If everything kept constant, the corporate tax cut is itself a very strong factor that will lead to earnings upgrades and will bring valuations to an attractive level which will eventually lead to historic FPI buying again,"" said Foram Parekh, fundamental analyst at Indiabulls Ventures.

Reacting to Sebi's reforms, V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, ""The simplification of KYC requirements for FPIs, permission for off-market transfer of securities, simplification of registration process and the new broad classification of FPIs are welcome and desirable steps.""

However, FPI inflows into India will also be influenced by how the economy performs and how soon corporate earnings recover, Vijayakumar added. The US Fed's monetary stance and global liquidity are also crucial in determining FPI flows, he said.

Besides, the cooling of the US-China trade war is also helping investors' sentiments, said Harsh Jain, COO and co-founder of Groww.

58,2019-09-29,Britannia,"While trading on anticipated lines, the domestic equity market consolidated in a defined range on Friday, before ending with a modest loss. The trading range remained narrow, and market participants exhibited an exhausted and lacklustre behaviour, and this was evident from the formation of a lower tops and higher bottoms on the charts.

After oscillating in a 60-point range, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 58.80 points, or 0.51 per cent. The market is likely to see a lukewarm start to the week on Monday. Nifty is expected to kick off the week on a defensive note, and we expect the market to continue exhibiting a corrective bias. It may show tentative behaviour. The market continues to remain overstretched on the short-term charts, and is not likely to show any runaway rise in the immediate short term.

On any rise, Nifty will face resistance in the 11650-11700 range, and higher it goes, the more vulnerable it will be to profit taking.

On Monday, Nifty is likely to see the 11,560 and 11,610 levels act as stiff resistance, while supports are expected to come in at 11,465 and 11,410.

The RSI on the daily chart stood at 60.6359. It remained neutral and did not show any divergence against price. The MACD remained bullish and trades above its signal line.



Pattern analysis on the daily charts showed Nifty made a sharp rise following the announcement of fiscal stimulus, and it created a gap between the 50- and the 100-DMAs. On its rise, Nifty faced resistance between 11,600 and 11,700 levels and then retraced from those highs. It is expected that the gap created a couple of days back will get filled going ahead.

Weekly options data showed the upward moves may remain capped below the 11,600 mark. We expect the market to find supply with every rise. The gains are likely to stay concentrated and stock-specific. Market breadth remains a concern, and for any move to sustain at higher levels, it needs to be healthy as well.

60,2019-09-30,Britannia,"By Ronojoy Mazumdar

Poor demand from Indian consumers could dampen the mood during festivals next month, especially for automobile makers and retailers that count on the season for a sales boost, analysts predict.

Indians typically buy everything from new cars to shoes for themselves and as gifts during celebrations steeped in religion and tradition. Yet the slowest economic growth in six years, unemployment at a 45-year high and tepid private consumption may see sales fall short of recent years, even after the government’s $20 billion tax break to companies earlier this month.

“You can make the product 50 per cent cheaper, but there has to be income to spend,” said Nitin Gupta, an analyst at SBICAP Securities in Mumbai. “In the short-term, I don’t see any kind of an income boost. Rather than giving cash to individuals, they have given it to companies.”

Car sales in August fell the most on record and Maruti Suzuki India Friday reduced the price on its Baleno RS model by 100,000 rupees ($1,420) to pass on the benefit from the tax cut. Market researcher Nielsen has lowered its 2019 growth estimate for fast-moving goods to 9 per cent-10 per cent from 11 per cent-12 per cent, while a stock gauge of consumer discretionary firms is set for its first annual back-to-back losses since at least 2005.



Even so, the industry’s fortunes beyond the approaching festival season are poised to improve, according to BNP Paribas SA. Plentiful rainfall seen this monsoon season and cash handouts to farmers will help lift rural incomes, helping sales of staples recover in the second half of the year that began April 1, the brokerage said in a recent report.

Here’s what other analysts say:


SBICAP Securities’ Gupta



The festive season is likely to be dull. Consumption is hit and household income has to increase for there to be better demand for companies selling fast-moving consumer goods.
Corporate tax cuts are a long-term phenomena and won’t help in the short term. It’s uncertain how much companies could pass on the benefit in terms of lower prices.
Recommends buying shares in Dabur India Ltd., holding ITC Ltd., Colgate-Palmolive India Ltd., and Hindustan Unilever Ltd., and selling Nestle India.


Aditya Soman and Aditya Gupta, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc



Don’t expect a significant change in underlying demand trends across categories and geographies in 2Q
“We would look for color on festive demand outlook especially given the normal monsoon which could have a positive impact on demand,” in 2Q earnings calls
Recommends buying shares in ITC, Britannia Industries Ltd., and Page Industries Ltd., selling shares in Dabur, Hindustan Unilever and Marico.


Harshit Kapadia, an analyst at Elara Securities India



I’m not expecting a blockbuster festive season. It won’t be muted either, but will be decent. Even last year demand was largely flat, that’s why double-digit growth in demand on the lower end is possible.
Distributors are preparing for the Navratri and Diwali season, but nobody is stocking up heavily. They are following the normal trend of keeping 15-20 days of inventory, whereas in past years they would keep 30-35 days ahead of the festival season
Recommends buying Havells India and selling Voltas shares


Ravi Swaminathan, an analyst at Spark Capital Pte



Sales growth in refrigerators and washing machines has been moderate (mid to high single digit).
With early festive demand traction not very encouraging, dealers are hopeful for better traction over the next 2-3 months.
Recommends adding Whirlpool of India., Havells and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals shares


Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt.



The best case scenario for automobiles is for demand to remain flattish on a year-on-year basis as last festival season was bad for demand. Things have gotten worse since then.
Investors should avoid commercial vehicles and producers of lower-cost two wheelers, which face a bigger inventory pileup.
Recommends selling Hero MotoCorp Ltd., Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors shares, buying Eicher Motors Ltd., Bajaj Auto and Maruti Suzuki India.


Shirish Pardeshi, an analyst at Centrum Broking Ltd.



Demand is there, it’s only the size of the wallet that’s come down. In difficult times, people don’t stop buying the product. If someone was buying a large pack before, maybe they’ll buy a small pack now.
In the festive season people tend to forget the bad times.
Recommends buying shares in Dabur, Britannia, and Hindustan Unilever and Bajaj Consumer Care Ltd., on improving consumer sentiment, helped by a good monsoon that should support demand from rural areas, selling shares in Colgate-Palmolive"

16,2019-10-10,Britannia,"ET Intelligence Group: Titan’s weak performance and negative management commentary should not discourage its investors.

While the performance has remained subdued in the recent months, historically, the second half of the financial year has remained strong. For instance in the previous fiscal, after a tepid second quarter with sales growth at 8 per cent, the growth rebounded in the second half with sales up 27 per cent year-on-year.

According to the company’s filings, jewellery sales growth in the second quarter of FY20 was 7 per cent, lower than expectations of 12-13 per cent. The jewellery segment contributes over 85 per cent of the company’s profits and any subdued performance on this front is detrimental for the stock price movement. In addition to slower growth, hedging expenses amid volatility in gold prices, too, impacted revenue which declined 2 per cent year-on-year. This resulted in the stock losing 5 per cent on Wednesday morning.

However, there are chances that these costs could be reversed. Analysts ET spoke to said the probability of hedging costs getting reversed was higher in the coming quarters, leading to higher revenue growth. This could not be verified from the management owing to the silent period before announcement of the quarterly results.

The muted demand of June and July is a distant memory as sales growth for August and September bounced back to 15 per cent, according to data shared by the company. It is expected to be higher in the second half of FY20 due to festive season demand and higher number of weddings taking place during this period.

In fact, any correction in the stock price should be viewed as an opportunity to enter as demand for the stock is expected to remain high. No large-cap company including Nestle, HUL, Britannia in the FMCG/ retail space is offering growth visibility as high as Titan.



Based on management guidance, analysts expect a 20 per cent CAGR for the next two years and higher operating profit margins resulting from same-store-sales growth. A profit growth of over 20 per cent is highest in the large-cap consumer space. Despite this, Titan’s 12-month forward P/E multiple is same as average of the top five consumer players.

“The valuation is fully justified. In fact, increasing concerns over revenue and earnings for consumer peers will ensure higher multiples for Titan,” said Krishnan Sambamoorthy, consumer analyst with Motilal Oswal."

19,2019-10-12,Britannia,"Corporate transformations are best not done during an economic slowdown. But Marico Ltd is unperturbed as it has been a company in transition for most of its life. After all, the Mumbai-based FMCG company with sales exceeding $1 billion (consolidated total income of Rs 7,437 crore in 2018-19) had created a branded safflower and coconut oil business out of a commodity play in the 1970s and made an equally bold move into value-added products in the late 1990s.

Innovation has been the credo for the company, says Chairman and promoter of Marico Harsh Mariwala, and it can also help the company sail through the choppy waters of a slowdown in demand growth. Last week, as his interview with ET Magazine came to an end, Mariwala insisted on displaying his favourite PowerPoint slides on corporate transformation. 

Organised in pairs of words, the slides showed how the mindset in Marico had shifted from “conservative” to “risktaker” or from “steady growth” to “fast-track”. It explained how business transformation meant moving from “low margin” to “high margin”, “local” to “global” and “oils” to “FMCG”. Soon Mariwala was creating new pairs of words as he spoke about corporate transformation: “products” to “services” or “unlisted” to “listed”.



The changes afoot today are around new categories such as healthy snacks and men’s grooming products. However, the biggest move happened in 2014 when Saugata Gupta, then CEO of the consumer products business at Marico, was anointed managing director. The services business under beauty solutions provider Kaya were demerged into a separate company and Mariwala’s daughter Rajvi, 39, and son Rishabh, 37, took up roles outside Marico. Mariwala’s children have since incubated newer businesses and also help him manage the family office.

Gupta points out that while Marico was always an “insurgent”, it is also an “incumbent” today because it is the market leader in many categories. He would like to keep the company close to its “insurgent” roots. Mariwala says: “The key challenge is to identify the right categories, where we can dominate either by being a pioneer or through disruptive innovation.”




‘Total Displacement’
Marico has had an association with strategic brand expert Shombit Sengupta. In 1998, Mariwala had engaged Sengupta, who was based in France then, to help with Marico’s innovative push into FMCG skincare products. That was the second wave. In the 1970s, Mariwala, 68, himself had moved away from the family business of selling coconut oil and safflower oil in large containers to making Parachute and Saffola household consumer brands. He had disrupted the market with innovative branding and packaging. Sengupta points out that the challenge of selling to the millennial is vastly different today. “The GAFA impact (GAFA = Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple) means the whole idea of disruption, change, rupture are finished, obsolete and old fashioned. Now you need a displacement strategy.”

Explaining the point that consumers today can desire anything they dream of and can purchase it from anywhere in the world, Sengupta says: “In the digital era, consumer attitude and behaviour have become extremely intuitive. The innovation metaphor is like an old Roman aqueduct — a breakthrough at that time but displaced today. I am not sure Indian companies have understood this requirement of total displacement.” Managing Director Gupta is aware of these challenges. What took Marico to $1 billion in sales will not take it to $2 billion, he says. “We have to create new avenues of growth.”

The innovation cycle worldwide has shrunk to barely 60 days now, he says, from several months during the earlier years. “So we have to be more entrepreneurial and agile with a higher innovation velocity.” He explains how private equity-funded FMCG startups do not feel the need to scale up, are comfortable with putting 5,000-plus items on ecommerce portals, and quickly withdraw products that do not work. Further, trends originating abroad do not take time to travel to India as startups pick up ideas from global trade shows like Cosmoprof and execute them quickly in India. “When it comes to distribution, there too you do not need to do it yourself but just buy the capacity,” says the managing director.



This is why Gupta wants Marico to hold on to its “insurgent” genes of the 1970s. In the late 1990s, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) under Keki Dadiseth had famously offered to buy out the company as Marico’s Parachute was dominating the Indian coconut oil market. HUL had acquired Nihar hair oil and was looking to have a dominant foothold in the segment. But Mariwala was not willing to sell. Marico survived the battle of distribution muscle-flexing and advertising blitz and actually bought out Nihar from HUL around 2006 through a bidding process. Today, domestic sales of Parachute and Saffola brands make up for 43% of Marico’s turnover. Growth is expected to be in low single digits in these two categories.

Gupta is, however, pegging his revenue growth plans for the next few years on two other engines. The premium skincare and male grooming products are the first. The second one is foods, under the Saffola Fittify brand umbrella. The company has already launched products such as protein shakes, green tea and green coffee. A part of the plan is to also reduce the company’s dependence on Saffola and Parachute and make the business model more sustainable and less dependent, especially on coconut oil and safflower oil commodity cycles. For that, Gupta explains, the foods business has to grow from Rs 200 crore now to Rs 500 crore in sales and the skincare business, now at `30-40 crore, has to grow to Rs 300 crore in sales. For male grooming, his target is Rs 500 crore from Rs 200 crore at present.

Along with growth in these categories, Gupta wants the rural segment to contribute 40% of the turnover instead of the 35% it brings in today. Much of this will also mean answering the question of how does one sell to millennials or the mid-teens. The new Kaya Youth brand has been created with a licence from Kaya to target the young. While the economic growth has slowed, Marico has experienced a commodity cycle boost. In a report dated August 2, HDFC Securities analysts Naveen Trivedi and Siddhant Chhabria wrote that Marico was trying to make the best of a copra deflationary cycle (prices are down by almost 25%) and build a futuristic portfolio. It was also using the higher gross margin on advertising to launch new products in premium hair oil, foods and male grooming.



“Although the products are niche and may not have a high success rate, we admire the management’s aggression which will aid in driving product diversification and long-term growth,” the report added. An October 3 report by Edelweiss that focused on the entire FMCG market saw a 3% growth in turnover at Marico for the second quarter of 2019-20, with 13.9% growth in EBITDA and a 12% growth in net profit. A Reliance Securities report on October 7, on the other hand, referred to the higher crude palm oil prices to forecast a drop in profitability. It, however, said turnover would growth 4% in the second quarter.

The Edelweiss report gave a 25% weight on Marico in an FMCG portfolio that it recommended, with the other stocks being HUL (30%), Britannia (25%), Godrej Consumer Products Limited (10%) and Colgate (10%). The Reliance Securities report, on the other hand, only picked ITC and HUL as sector winners. A part of the growth for Marico is also coming from its international business, and it seems the company has cracked the Bangladesh market that accounts for 46% of its international business. Vietnam, too, is expected to bring in higher growth. Southeast Asia accounts for 26% of international business.



Clearly, the trick for Marico here will be to keep the margin moving up even as turnover growth slows down. Gupta is optimistic of that as he expects a revival in growth in the third quarter of 2019-20. Mariwala says the government is aware of the economic slowdown and will initiate action to ease the situation. But innovation alone can help industry. He adds that it could be pricing innovation that does the trick during a difficult time. “Either you grow the market or grow your own market share.” Marico has, Mariwala says, created a market in the past by launching products like Revive, Mediker or newer Safolla blends and at other times expanded its portfolio by acquired brands like Livon and Set Wet.

As the interview with ET Magazine came to an end, Mariwala pulled out one last slide that plotted the company’s new category entries, the listing of its Bangladesh arm and the multiple acquisitions over the last decade, along with Marico’s steep turnover growth. 




Owning the Game
The task now will be to plot these innovations against its share price that has been hovering in a band of Rs 300-400 band for the last two years. It closed Friday at Rs 383.70. HDFC Securities had in August set the stock price target at Rs 395.

Gupta is betting on Marico’s blue ocean strategy — enter a less crowded area and own it, instead of fighting tooth and nail in a market with dominant players. This will push the FMCG company deep into the “in-between meal” snacks categories — the turf of unbranded players. He mentions “idli-dosa” mix as one such play.

“In a large company, risk-taking is often lower. We need to create that environment internally,” Gupta says, adding that he sees Marico play the role of a “scaled insurgent”, with executives operating with an “owner’s mindset”."
20,2019-10-14,Britannia,"An apparent freak trade last week in the debt instruments of India’s biggest cookies maker Britannia Industries startled Mumbai’s bond traders Friday, causing yields on the newly listed papers to tumble about 600 basis points – an exception in India’s corporate bond market.


The drop was reported in an auction window where a shortseller needed to acquire the instrument for delivery, dealers told ET.

“The short-seller did not have enough stock to deliver on Friday. In such a scenario, s/he had to go for the auction, which showed the desperate need for securities,” said a senior trader who made money on the Britannia bond transactions.

The auction took place on the NSE’s platform. The trader ended up buying at an effective yield of less than 1 per cent, compared with 7.26 per cent last Wednesday on normal exchange platform. These bonds were traded at ₹37 in the auction versus ₹30 apiece, their face value. Britannia, a Wadia group company, had issued these bonds to its equity shareholders as bonus debentures, which are often seen as alternative rewards to dividends. During trading on the listing day, a market participant likely short-sold about 15 million bonds in a suspected “fat finger” trade. That trade was executed on NSE and the delivery had to be made by Friday, known as T+2 in market parlance.

“The trader might have been looking to sell ₹1.5 crore worth of bonds instead of 1.5 crore bonds,” said another trader.

‘Fat finger’ is referred to unintended inaccurate typing, typically a fallout of one finger striking two keys at the same time.

Last Wednesday, the bonds were listed on BSE and NSE on a par at 8 per cent, and closed the day around 7.26 per cent, dealers said.

“The sharp fall in yields was primarily due to the bonus NCDs being issued at more attractive rates compared to those for similar rated issuers and the central bank’s policy rate cut,” said a trader with knowledge of the matter. The short-seller is said to have dealt in ₹28 crore worth of bonds, which would be 78-80 lakh bond instruments, said a trader participating in the auction.




In August, Britannia allotted 240 million “secured, non-convertible, redeemable, fully paidup debentures” of the face value of ₹30 each.

These papers offered 8 per cent yield on a three-year maturity."

Analysts’ views
“Nifty is expected to trade in 11,700-12,100 range for an extended time. Short-term selling pressure is expected to push the index towards 11,700-11,750. Broader market’s health is also negative. This correction provides an excellent buying opportunity from the medium term perspective. Suggest accumulating select banking and financial services stocks” -- Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak Securities.

“Bears managed to pierce the support zone of 11,850. We have been mentioning about near term correction on the index, especially below the support of 11,850. The index is likely to witness further profit booking. Nifty is likely to test the next support zone at 11,700. Broader uptrend remains intact and market is currently seeing a phase of consolidation, which we had anticipated,” -- Amit Shah, Technical Research Analyst with Indiabulls Ventures

7,2019-11-13,Britannia,"You may credit it to experience, skill, timing or sheer luck, but the fact is India’s top money managers for high net worth individuals (HNIs) managed to generate robust alpha in last one year despite strong market volatility.

Emkay Lead PMS, a multicap strategy run by Emkay Investment Managers, stands out on top, having delivered 33.40 per cent return between November 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

With an equal weight of 6.70 per cent each, Bajaj Finance, Astral Poly Technik, Aarti Industries, Maruti Suzuki and Britannia Industries were among the top holdings of the Emkay Lead PMS.

Sectorwise, the fund had 33.50 weightage to BFSI and 26.80 per cent and 20.10 per cent to FMCG and building materials. It generated 3.90 per cent return in October against 3.95 per cent gain registered by BSE200 index.

Sameeksha Capital’s Equity Fund Strategy delivered 29.90 per cent to emerge second best for the calendar year to date, data compiled by PMSbazaar showed. The fund house had 43.10 per cent exposure to financials and 25.60 per cent to industrials.

“Our strategy is multi cap and bottom up,” says Bhavin Shah, Founder of Sameeksha Capital. “We try to understand the intrinsic value of companies based on long-term forecast of free cash flow in case of a non-financial company or excess return on equity in case of a financial company. We only buy when a company is available below its intrinsic value. We particularly find opportunity, when sell-side may not understand the dynamics and maybe a lot of mutual funds have not caught up with the story,” he said.

Aviation, IT and consumer discretionary had 9.10 per cent, 7.80 per cent and 4.90 per cent weightage, respectively, in the fund. However, Sameeksha’s Equity Fund declined marginally by 0.13 per cent in October, but generated more than 12 per cent in last three months.

Sanctum Wealth’s Indian Olympians (up 28.20 per cent), Motilal Oswal’s BOP (up 28.07 per cent), Varanium Capital Advisors (up 28 per cent) and Ambit Capital’s Coffee Can (up 27.80 per cent) were among other top gainers of last one year.

Sanctum's Indian Olympians is a largecap-focused, concentrated PMS strategy. It says the objective is to generate long-term capital growth by investing in a concentrated portfolio of largecap companies having sustainable performance.

“We are predominately invested in financials and consumers in our strategy. Reducing overweight position in consumer discretionary last year and adding exposure in information technology sector worked really well, while, we had very low to nil exposure to utilities, industrials, commodities and communication services which helped us save on any significant drawdown,” said Hemang Kapasi, Portfolio Manager, Equity Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth Management.

Motilal Oswal’s BOP is based on four themes, which are related to PM Narendra Modi’s reformist measures including affordable housing, doubling of farm income, GST opportunity and migration of value happening away from public sector banks to private sector banks and NBFCs.

“Of course, it has to fulfil our additional criteria of structural businesses having good and capable management which can double profits in 3-4 years with a decent margin of safety. We suggest investors to invest for at least three years in this product,” said Manish Sonthalia, Fund Manager.

As of October 30, the fund had 66.21 per cent exposure to companies from FMCG, retail, banks, insurance and agriculture.

Ambit’s Coffee Can, which delivered 4.90 per cent return in October, had Page Industries, Asian Paints, Berger paints and HDFC Bank among its top holdings with maximum 31 per cent exposure to the building material space.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced nearly 17 per cent between November 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019, while the BSE Midcap index stood almost flat and Smallcap index dipped 5.60 per cent.

“It’s no brainer for largecaps right now,” said Sonthalia. There is far bigger value in midcaps and smallcaps . Funds flow is choked in midcaps and smallcaps because of regulations, etc. Prices are undershooting fundamentals in this space,” he said.

IIFL’s Multicap PMS (27.27 per cent), Sundaram AMC’s SISOP (27.10 per cent), ASK’s India Select (25.50 per cent) and Nippon India (25.10 per cent) also gained over 25 per cent in the past 12 months.

Sundaram’s SISOP is a multicap portfolio. The fund’s factsheet says it holds companies that maintain over 12 per cent RoCE/ self-funded models, led by high visionary leadership.

The fund had over 50 per cent exposure to Bajaj Finance, Titan, HDFC Bank, AU Small Finance Bank and Eicher Motors as of October 31.

IIFL’s Multicap holds 15-20 companies which are business leaders, have strong managements, lower leverage with large margin of safety. The fund generated 3.27 per cent return in October and 10.47 per cent in last three months.

ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Larsen & Toubro, Procter & Gamble, Crompton Greaves, Asian Paints, Siemens, Aavas Financiers, Muthoot Finance, Tech Mahindra and Creditacces Grameen were among the fund’s top holdings as of October 31.

Newly formed Marcellus’s Consistent Compounders gave 22.50 per cent in just six months. The fund was formed in December last year.

“Marcellus remains bullish on HDFC Banks, Kotak Bank, the Asian Paints and Pidilite,” Saurabh Mukherjea, founder and chief investment officer, Marcellus Investment, said in his latest interaction with ETNow.

“It looks conservative to buy these companies, but I have seen in India over the last 10 years that if you consistently and sensibly invest in these franchises, you make anywhere between high teens to low 20s returns consistently. For someone like me managing other people’s money, that is a perfectly acceptable outcome,” he said."
6,2019-11-13,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Global brokerages were mixed on Britannia after the company reported a massive jump in September quarter profit.

Citi maintained ‘buy’ rating on the stock and raised its target price to Rs 3,575 from Rs 3,000 earlier. This translates into a potential upside of 14 per cent.

The brokerage said the company beat its profit estimate. Britannia Industries on Monday posted a 74 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 492.58 crore for the second-quarter ended September, driven by premium products and cost efficiency programme.

Citi expects healthy growth in earnings thanks to consistent strategies and good execution. It estimates revenue growth at 10 per cent, profit before tax growth at 12 per cent and earnings per share growth at 17 percent CAGR over FY19-22.

The New York based brokerage, however, sees inventory buildup as the reason behind lower operating cash flows. 

JPMorgan was ‘overweight’ on the stock keeping the target price at Rs 3,350. It said the revenue was in-line with its expectations but due to superior margins profit beat its estimates. Britannia reported a 10.28 per cent increase in revenue to Rs 3026.29 crore.

Meanwhile, Macquarie was bearish on the stock and maintained ‘underperform’ stance. It said EBITDA was ahead of consensus estimates thanks to higher margins, but volume growth remains weak. It raised its concerns over a significant jump in inventory days on the balance sheet.

The Sydney-headquartered brokerage has a target price of Rs 2,518 on the stock, meaning a potential downside of 19 per cent.

12,2019-11-14,Britannia,"While the meltdown in the globe was led by auto, the recovery will also be led by auto, says Gautam Shroff, Co-Head, Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


VST Industries is going to be in focus when you have a marquee name like Radhakishan Damani picking up stake. If one compares how some of these tobacco stocks have done and how they are quoting in terms of valuation as opposed to their global peers like a Philip Morris etc, do you find value in the space as limited as it maybe?Absolutely. Undoubtedly there is a lot of value in ITC and VST Industries. But the stocks have gone nowhere and on a longer term basis, we are positive, we like the name. There’s only one caveat in the short term. A small study of ours says that between November and February, in the runup to the Budget, ITC has always been a laggard because of the probability of sin tax being imposed. For the next three months, ITC might not go anywhere but on a three-year, five-year call, we are very positive. 

Despite ITC diversifying so much, I still want to believe 90% of the revenue still comes from tobacco. With electronic cigarette ban coming in place, it augurs well for ITC. 


Give me a stock idea or a business where you think right now there is gloom and doom but six months to a year from now, things will settle down. Markets currently are ignoring the intrinsic value of that business because of noise, sentiment and momentum?With Fed easing a double expansion of balance sheet and rate cuts, global is giving me a lot of comfort. Domestically, the economy is yet to recover but the good news is that globally things are looking fine. What we would want to play from here on is export- oriented stories. In the metal space, it is basically the lesson we have learnt from the 2016 cycle, that all the globally linked and the export-oriented stocks will recover first. 

In metals, we would want to play a Jindal Steel followed by Hindalco, followed by Tata Steel. We would want to play export auto, Tata Motors being my top pick over there. 

The one story that will do well from here on which is not doing very well in the auto space, I think is Tata Motors. It can do very well from here on. Given that the parent has injected money, there is an oversight and there is some serious commitment with things turning around. They are also looking to monetise the JLR as an asset which is very marquee and a price asset in their portfolio. Among largecaps, Tata Motors can more than double over a period of time. It is followed by Motherson Sumi, again an export-oriented story. All the capex is behind us. While the meltdown in the globe was led by auto, the recovery will also be led by auto. Motherson Sumi has set up plants across the world which caters to practically 60% of the globe and we want to believe that is one stock which can do very well from here on.


What has gone wrong with Aurobindo Pharma?I have not actually looked at that specific name per se but our top picks in the pharma space have been Cipla, Dr Reddy’s followed by Sun Pharma. We have started liking Cipla of late and we have increased our weight on it followed by Dr Reddy’s.


Today everyone is sympathising that after AGR dues, Vodafone Idea, Bharti’s balance sheets will have a problem. But what about banks?This is a slightly tricky call. We have to wait and watch what actually happens. If some kind of a moratorium or a bailout package comes through, then banks are pretty safe but if that does not happen, then we are staring at large numbers that have been advanced to these telecom companies. 

I am pretty sure that government intervention will be required and some kind of assistance is required to avoid that kind of a disaster. But we have to see how things play out from here. It is difficult to predict.


Our top picks in the pharma space have been Cipla, Dr Reddy’s followed by Sun Pharma. We have started liking Cipla of late and we have increased our weight on it followed by Dr Reddy’s.-Gautam Shroff

Other than Bajaj Finance, AU Financials and Chola are the two NBFCs that have done well. Do you track any of them?AU Bank has been our pick. We initiated our coverage on 10th or 12th of June. We came out with the price target of Rs 880 on the first quarter earnings. We revised our price target to Rs 1,000. With yesterday’s up move in AU Bank, the price to book is looking slightly expensive. It has become five times price to book but given that it is an asset-led story, it can keep compounding without much quality issues and this can go on for about a decade. 

We are very comfortable that the company will raise funds, will dilute and the growth will continue. It is a very illiquid stock and that is why one day of somebody’s interest has given it a 10% bump up. But we are comfortable buying AU Bank even now. There is a lot more steam left in AU Bank.


Just on the back of earnings some stocks that have stood out from a Muthoot to a Britannia, pick up any one where you have looked at the numbers closely. What you would be thinking now going ahead?We are very comfortable even at current prices given that government spending is coming back in rural India. For almost eight, nine months, there was no expenditure there. Money flow has started in the system and despite trading at very rich multiples, there is a lot of comfort in these consumer names. I would still take some money off the table or not choose a consumer company over a consumer durable company and that is where there is comfort in Britannia being a market leader in biscuits. 

Plus, over the years, we have seen that they have gained 900 bps market share from Parle. They have got their act together. We are very comfortable even buying Britannia at these prices."

15,2019-11-18,Britannia,"‘Unstoppable’ is the term that can be used for non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, whose shares have rallied 1,318 per cent, the most in the largecap space, in last five years.

This break-neck rally shrugged off everything, from a painful downturn in domestic equities since February 2018 to a major demand slowdown in the economy that pulled down India’s GDP growth.

With more than 20 per cent holdings by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and over 7 per cent holding of domestic mutual funds, the scrip turned out to be the apple of the eye for big investors.

There were many factors at play throughout.

Net profit of the company grew over 40 per cent annually (CAGR) during these five years, while return on equity jumped to 22.60 per cent in FY19 from 19.60 per cent in FY14.

The company’s bottom line expanded to Rs 3,995 crore for the financial year ended March 2019 from Rs 719 crore in 2013-14. JM Financial projects 54.80 per cent profit growth for Bajaj Finance in FY20 and 30.10 per cent in FY21.

Despite a challenging business environment in FY2019, Bajaj Finance signed off the year with 41 per cent growth in consolidated assets under management (AUM) and a 60 per cent expansion in consolidated profits. The company’s cost of fund increased by about 5 bps in FY2019 over FY2018.

“Bajaj Finance (BAF) has a strong risk management framework with a large client base and best practices in terms of measures in keeping strong asset quality confidence. In a declining interest rate regime, BAF has strong pricing power and is better placed to tap growth,” JM Financial said.

Of late, a couple of developments drove the share price to its all-time high of Rs 4,277 on November 6 despite a slump in India’s economic growth rate due to consumption slowdown, which has dampened demand for consumer durables also.

On October 22, Bajaj Finance posted a 63 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,506 crore for the quarter ended September 30. The figure stood at Rs 923 crore in the same period of the previous year.

Net interest income of the country’s largest consumer durables lender grew 48 per cent to Rs 3,999 crore from Rs 2,708 crore in Q2 FY19.

Meanwhile, the company raised Rs 8,500 crore by issuing over 2.17 crore equity shares at an issue price of Rs 3,900 to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Going by reports, BlackRock, Nomura, GIC of Singapore and others lapped up these shares.

Majority of analysts are still bullish on Bajaj Finance. The stock had six ‘buy’, five ‘outperform’, seven ‘Hold’, one ‘Underperform’ and one ‘sell’ ratings as of November 15, data available with Reuters showed.

Brokerage Antique Stock Broking on October 23 gave a ‘hold’ recommendation on Bajaj Finance with a price target of Rs 3,960.

“Bajaj Finance has created one-of-its-kind customer franchise and the journey keeps on getting better with newer products, newer geographies and newer delivery mechanisms. Using its size to its advantage, both on borrowing cost and cross-sell front, operating leverage benefits can continue for longer than we expect.” It said, adding that the current slowdown in the economy could have a rub-off effect on the NBFC and any major price corrections should be looked as opportunity to build long term positions.

With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 55 times, shares of the company are looking dearer against their five-year average of 38.60 times. P/E is a valuation ratio that measures the company’s current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS).

Yes Securities on October 22 gave ‘reduce’ rating to Bajaj Finance.

“In the medium-to-longer term, we expect Bajaj Finance’s AUM growth to gravitate towards 30 per cent YoY considering a large asset base and sustained deceleration in few products. The flexibility in cost structure and rising digitisation in loan origination and collection will help the company in delivering a tight cost/income ratio. Despite assuming an elevated credit cost in FY20 and FY21, we estimate Bajaj Finance to report 45 per cent earnings CAGR over the next two years and an average RoA and RoE of 4.5 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. Valuation is lofty at 6x FY21 P/ABV,” the brokerage said.

Following in the footsteps of subsidiary Bajaj Finance, group holding company Bajaj Finserv (up 777 per cent) stood the second-biggest gainer among the bluechips in last five years. It was followed by Britannia Industries, Biocon, Pidilite Industries, Titan and Reliance Industries which advanced 200-300 per cent between November, 2014 and November, 2019."

19,2019-11-20,Britannia,"New Delhi: Biscuit giant Britannia Industries has postponed product launches on account of a consumption slowdown in the country, which it said is expected to revive in the next 9-12 months.

“We had a fairly packed calendar. But when we started to see the slowdown, we decided to postpone these launches because we were seeing inefficiencies coming into the system,” managing director Varun Berry told analysts on a call after the company’s second-quarter earnings.

Britannia, which also makes dairy and bakery products, said second-quarter net sales rose 5.88% to Rs 3,022.91 crore during July-September from Rs 2,854.81 crore in the corresponding year-ago quarter.

“We know that rural is growing much slower than urban. There is pain in rural. And it’s important that gets sorted out for the overall growth to come back for every possible FMCG company,” Berry said.

The maker of Good Day and Tiger brand biscuits gets 75% of its revenue from biscuits.

“We are launching new packs but at a slower pace and getting more packs into outlets we’re already present in,” he said.

Rural growth dropped below urban levels for the first time in seven years and the FMCG sector grew 7.3% by value in July-September, down from 16.2% a year earlier, market research firm Nielsen said in a report last month. The quarterly report said while the FMCG market witnessed a resurgence in modern trade, the rural market grew only 5%, which is one-fourth of the 20% clocked in the same period last year.

“The biggest issue is the liquidity crunch in the trade, especially in wholesale channels. Disposable income is under stress, especially in rural markets, while modern trade and e-commerce are doing better,” said Marico managing director Saugata Gupta.

The maker of Parachute hair oil and Saffola edible oils said instead of introducing new products, Marico would focus on improving existing brand strengths.

“While immediate consumer sentiment continues to be weak, along with the liquidity crunch, we expect to stay invested in both innovation and go-to-market,” Gupta said.

Berry said growth was being driven by premium products as financial stress in rural markets continues.

“The mix is moving towards premium. Sales are showing that premium products are doing better than value products. Consumers seem to be cutting back but whenever they’re consuming our products or any other products in the market, they are leaning towards the premium products,” he said.


Britannia Defers Launches

Almost all consumer good companies are focusing on premium products through channels including e-commerce and modern trade to hedge against the rural slowdown, which accounts for about a third of the overall FMCG market. Hindustan Unilever, ITC and Reckitt Benckiser are among those that have rolled out premium products in the detergent, chocolate and car freshener categories, respectively.

The National Council of Applied Economic Research pegged India’s GDP growth at 4.9% for 2019-20, compared with 6.8% in 2018-19. It said India’s economy grew 5% in the first quarter of 2019-20, the slowest in over six years. “On account of the rural slowdown, we are introducing products that are affordable and accessible for rural consumers in the form of low unit price packs,” Dabur chief executive Mohit Malhotra said. The maker of Vatika shampoo and Real juices will continue to add premium products for modern trade and e-commerce, he said.

Hindustan Unilever’s chief financial officer Srinivas Phatak said on an investor call last month that the wholesale and smaller retail trade faced an acute liquidity crunch, on account of which rural markets grew far slower than the urban ones."

25,2019-11-20,Britannia,"In telecom, there is a clear signal that the regulator, the government as well as players are taking the right steps to ensure long-term viability of the sector, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What do you want to start with -- YES Bank or telecom?Both are to an extent interconnected because one is talking about a specific bank and the other is talking about banking as a system because if you look at what is happening in the telecom sector, you know that post the Supreme Court ruling on AGR dues, the financial condition of the telecom incumbents has the possibility of becoming a systemic risk. 

Then the government got in and said okay we are looking at giving a moratorium and at the end of the day, finally, the players themselves have decided that somewhere the game has to move from market share accretion to profitability in terms of operations and that freebies can’t be doled out in perpetuity. That is the reason we are seeing pricing table shifts. 

Given the fact that India has got a fairly high mobile penetration of roughly 80-85%, there might be some shakeout but not very large because by and large the market shares have now got aligned and the fact that today data has become such an important fix that everybody first renews their data plan before going and buying the monthly groceries. Data is now an essential purchase rather than a discretionary spend. Therefore 10 GB per month data consumption can plateau out a bit, but the fear of a lot of subscribers going out of the network may be slightly premature.

Also, the tariff hikes are not likely to be too large in terms of hitting the purses and even at that modest increase, people are likely to stay put because now it has become a way of life. In telecom, there is a clear signal that the regulator, government and the players are taking the right steps to ensure long-term viability of the sector, which is in turn is good for the banking system and is good for both the players as well as the consumers in the long run.

Coming to YES Bank, the new management has taken charge ad post that, they have already taken steps for guiding the market. The watch list has expanded as they have made space for contingencies. Out of that, one can say that this has got realised now to that extent that one has to wait and watch as to what treatment is being given to balance the number in that bucket. People will give it time because it is not as if it is something new, but it clearly shows that a lot of things have to be taken care of before one turns the bend.


Would you be a buyer in YES Bank if the stock falls today?For a long-term investor, anything around Rs 60-65 levels is not a bad price because the visibility as to when does the investor come and at what price he comes in is, something not a question of if, it is a question of when. Once that happens, a bank this size will definitely turn and given the fact that the kind of people who come and do the second round of fund raising and that the management is committed, over the long run, clearly there is value in the stock at these prices.


Would you be a buyer in any of the telecom stocks? If so, Bharti or Reliance?I see good tidings for the sector as price wars seem to have ended.


But would you be a buyer?If I am looking for a multibagger opportunity, Vodafone Idea probably looks better because there in case the rate of change happens, you could probably have a lot of value accretion. At Rs 16,000 crore of market cap, the problem is the net debt of about Rs 1 lakh crore and in case you talk of increasing the tariffs, the EBITDA will probably grow by almost 70%. The rate of change is not perhaps getting priced and the stock has only doubled. If the EBITDA grows 2X, the stock should technically go 4-5X.


Where is something like a Chola or a Sundaram headed?The NBFC crisis took centre-stage about the same time last year. Now what has happened is that because the other guys have actually vacated the space, it is the large companies that have gained market share by virtue of this balance sheet strength. Their cost of funds has improved. So, today they are in a sweet spot whereby they have gained market share and as cost of fund has improved, spreads look better and their earnings delivery is far better than what the market had expected. 

Now if you roll forward another quarter, the base effect will likely catch up. As a sector, some amount of growth should be visible when you look at the December or March quarter earnings purely because of the base effect. The government has also started putting in a lot of money in the system. So, hopefully the velocity will pick up over the next couple of quarters and after the kharif harvest hits the market in Jan-Feb, some sort of consumer spending should get kick-started. 

Actually it shows that you could be in a situation whereby from here, the return ratios could improve for the large guys. There is an article 227 about the regulator taking it to NCLT, there is also a function that Rs 500 crore in plus AUM can be referred. The resolution process is also now beginning to take shape. These are conference boosters, but having said that, the valuations do not give some sort of comfort for fresh entry. People who are holding will continue to hold because the earnings are good and the outlook is not all that bad.

But will I make a fresh purchase here? I do not know. Whatever incremental flows are coming in, people are wanting to remain invested in these pockets because right now, they give you a sustainable and predictable growth. 


Suffice to say that the big pain for motown is behind us. That is what the stock prices also seem to be reflecting.As of now, the stock prices have reacted and the numbers have still not shown and therefore it will be a difficult case to say whether it has actually played out because our leading two-wheeler manufacturer was very buoyant about the festival season but last week itself he came and said that November is not all that good. 

Now, last year Diwali was in November whereas this year we had it in October. So adjusting for the base, the inventory definitely is coming down. But is it at a level where at the first sign of revival in demand, you will restock adequately so as to give you a fillip in the revenue line? One does not know because if you look at the 2008-09 example, there was a very clear and a very rapid U-turn . At that time, the inventories in the system had got completely cleaned and at the first sign of any change in demand, everybody just ran to restock inventory. This time, it is different for different players in the motown. 


I do not think there should be any fundamental reason for PSU stocks to go up further from here just on account of the cabinet clearance.-Sameer Narayan

In passenger cars perhaps, it is not all that great, whereas in two-wheelers, maybe it has got cleaned out quite a bit. The market has to make a decision as to where the level of demand will first start going in because we had the data of new registrations coming in for October. Passenger vehicles have already shown the base effect. They have already started showing 1% or 2% growth YoY, but the CVs and the two wheelers are still in fairly decent negative territory.


Britannia is saying they are expecting revival only in 9 to 12 months, contrary to what we are seeing on the index. What are you making of the latest comments?Well markets always move ahead of the actual earnings. I think this is some sort of a confirmation that earnings should turn the bend from here. The challenge is that the September quarter earnings have two clear trends; first, if you knock off the tax impact of the lower corporate tax cut, not much of earnings have performed below expectations and on the revenue line, there is a far bigger disappointment than what was earlier envisaged, given the fact that the expectations were low anyway. 

These are two very clear indicators that the worst perhaps should be behind us. But there is a hope that from here, in case the liquidity in the system starts to show its impact, you should see revival down the line. Whether it is one quarter, two quarters or three quarters, the verdict is still out. Today a very clear signal of consumption demand coming back is not visible. There is no credit offtake. Those are the factors which are still to be grappled with in terms of where the market is headed relative to valuations.


The cabinet is probably meeting today to decide on disinvestment. But these stocks have already run up in anticipation of something coming in -- be it a Concor, BEL or BPCLIs there an opportunity to buy into these names?There is still a bit of time left for the divestment process to get cleared by the cabinet followed by firms getting divested and the money coming in to impact fiscal revenues, etc. I do not think there should be any fundamental reason for these stocks to go up further from here just on account of the cabinet clearance. Since the time these names were put in the public domain, the stocks have already reacted. So from here onwards, it is just a confirmation that yes the intent is clear.

The larger thing is that when FM has said they do not intend shifting the fiscal target for this financial year which means that hopefully they have plans to ensure that some amount of stake sale or ensure monetisation. One would need to see as to how the execution of that intent takes place rather than just the fact that the Cabinet has cleared the proposals."

IPO update: CSB Bank sails on Day 1
Kerala-based CSB Bank’s IPO got fully subscribed on the first day of bidding on Friday. The initial public offering (IPO) received bids for 1,20,87,450 shares against the total issue size of 1,15,54,987 shares, reflecting 1.05 times subscription, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange. The quota reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed 10 per cent, while that for retail investors was subscribed 5.60 times.
In another development from the IPO-mart, realty firm Puranik Builders has filed fresh papers with markets regulator Sebi to raise an estimated Rs 1,000 crore through its initial share-sale.


Telecom stocks ring louder
With a 7.85 per cent rally, the BSE Telecom index emerged the biggest gainer on the exchange. It was followed by Healthcare (up 3.06 per cent), Power (up 0.97 per cent), Metal (up 0.82 per cent) and Bankex (up 0.16 per cent). On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”


Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.
Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team. However, on the other side it added that net cash in the balance sheet fell to Rs 1,480 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 3,240 crore in Q4FY18.

32,2019-11-26,Britannia,"Foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Some corrections cannot be ruled out because valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, stay with good quality stocks, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.



Whether you call this a Santa rally or picking up from where we left off, we took maybe two to three weeks off in the middle. Now it looks like market momentum is intact. What are you making of it?I stay selective in my investment portfolio. I do agree that the current rally is largely propelled by the liquidity coming in from the global side and that too in select few stocks, where they matter most as far as the index is concerned. It is not across the board. Though definitely one would argue that in the respective sectors, selective stocks have started performing well in this particular rally, it is a good sign that it is merit driven. 

Now whether it will come off in a hurry, I do not know. My reading says that we are heading for relatively better times. Everybody wants to look forward to US and India signing some kind of trade treaty, wherein Indian exports would start looking up. That could signal probably a larger level of interest as far as the global investors are concerned into our market.

I guess the foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Maybe some corrections cannot be ruled out because the valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, my recommendation would be to stay with good quality stocks and corrective downside should be bought into in building the portfolio henceforth. We remain relatively confident about the market momentum on the upside for next year. Our bet would be on quality stocks.


What has been your big acquisition in October-November, where have you added a substantial amount of weight to your portfolio?We saw some amount of downside in HDFC and that gives us relatively more confidence to buy further into the stock. The company has a housing loan book which is probably one of the best in the industry. At the same time, the investments into the listed companies within the group including the bank AMC, the life insurance companies and also some of the yet to monetise businesses like Ergo are there. 

Among them, a few NBFCs from education companies, particularly NBFC side is among the themes which we picked up. We felt that this is one area where we could remain relatively safe in adding into the portfolio. We continue to add more weight into Reliance largely because we believe that consumer facing businesses -- Jio and retail would eventually get monetised. That is where unlocking of the valuation would take place and the benefit would go to the investors and shareholders. 

These are the areas where we have stayed focussed. We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them. We feel the larger ones would become bigger and they are going to create much bigger opportunity going forward. That is the theme that we are following currently.


It is a print of new all-time high on the Nifty. The global markets are also at an all-time high, as are we. Is it the start and the end of the story that there is nothing special about India? Last one month NASDAQ is up 4%, we are also 4% up. Should we stop complaining about the slowdown?Globally, few things are probably propelling this rally in equity. One of them is definitely the important aspect that the rate of interest is historically low in most of the countries. 


We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them.-Deven R Choksey
As a result, the funds had shifted to long-term asset growth like equity. That is one definite allocation perspective that one brings in. The second most important perspective that one brings in is that America and China are settling the trade row and as a result, prospects are brightening.

2020 is being seen as a year wherein we are likely to see relatively stable trade as a result of which, investors once again come back to the market with higher allocation of funds. Coming to India, in October and November, we have been seeing a good flow of money from FIIs. That is also propelling this particularly rally. 

From the indices’ perspective per se, some of the larger weight stocks are basically driving this rally. Reliance is one among them. Even a telecom company like Bharti Airtel is among them. At the same time, the HDFC and Bajaj twins are basically driving the markets and the indices up. The overweight of some of these stocks is basically driving the indices up. Overall, the midcaps and smallcap are still languishing. In select stocks, we have been seeing the buying coming from select corners but otherwise, markets are looking relatively stable. 


Yesterday we broke the story on government considering one-time rollover of debts. . Do you think a move like this could help ease the problems for the real estate space?It is a very positive move on structural side. This is where you are likely to see stress. Real assets are getting the breathing space and more money would come in to buy some of the properties which these realty companies particularly have been nurturing for some time. My reading says that if this activity gains momentum, probably we would be seeing a very strong emergence of paper use model and that is going to probably revive the real estate market.

Currently, real estate businesses are becoming prohibitively expensive for consumer and that is where the financers’ role is going to be very important. With the kind of structured vehicle that the government has built, it is going to have the potential of inviting more money into the system, particularly from the global side. We remain relatively confident about it. I do not know which company would get immediate benefits, but strong companies with good properties would probably have a better outlook to talk about going forward. 


You mentioned Reliance and of course that has been in focus. Let us also take a look at the telecom angle at some of the other teleco names, Bharti in particular. We have been going through some trends and the kind of move that it has made, is really standing out. What is your perspective on Bharti?The moratorium on AGR is going to help Bharti along with the other companies in the telecom sector. So, that creates a breathing space. At the same time, tariff is going up from 1st December. That is likely to spell out good news as far as the working of the company is concerned. 

If I am right, we could possibly see around 20-25% increase in the tariff. You could see a similar contribution coming into the EBITDA of the company. I think these are two positive news that I see. Alongside, there is one challenge and that is a challenge of putting in the 5G related bandwidth and the infrastructure in the business. So, that will need more capital and so capital infusion will have to take place. That is one challenge which one will have to look out for.

Otherwise, in current times, the stock probably he has been experiencing buying also because of the fact that I think in last few years telecom story was sounded negative now I think it is slightly stable comparatively so that is why I think you are seeing the Bharti going up. I do not think that I think the company’s financial ratios would change big time from here. They continue to operate in the single digit of ROC. That will not be changing beyond a point, even though an increase in tariff will take place, given the kind of pressure that they would have on the expansion side.


We have often debated about whether or not quality is overpriced. Has the time now come to ease off from some of these blue chip names? Would you believe that Nestle has a problem ahead because of the slowdown in the milk market?Well not as much honestly, if I start looking at the overall composition of the market and the purchasing power therein. Most of the FMCG companies are sitting on the brilliant prospect of finding themselves in a better position because of greater purchasing power in the hands of consumers, particularly the rural ones. We are definitely expecting to see more money in the hands of people, largely because of the rollout of the projects by the government and infrastructure projects.

At the same time, the favourable monsoon and the resultant outcome on the crops would spell out better times for the rural economy. Going forward, the FMCG company and food sector in particular should be in a favourable position. Having said that on the prospect side, companies and their valuations have always been challenging. They have been quoting at a premium.

If you buy any of the FMCG companies, they have probably priced in things for next two years. You should not be expecting any return out of them. On the contrary. you should be buying these companies if you want to have them in the portfolio, by doing an SIP into this kind of stocks. You are never going to get it cheaper and at the same time at least two years of prices are discounted fully at the current price level. The same story holds true for companies like Nestle, Britannia and many other companies in the FMCG basket. These are expensive but they have better prospects going forward."
33,2019-11-27,Britannia,"Academia and business need to co-create a curriculum that will address present-day skill needs. 

Technological advancements over the years have forced organisations to rethink the integration of man and machine. Organisations are spending a lot of money retraining and re-skilling their employees for the Industrial Revolution 4.0. But most of this training to address the present-day skill needs happens once employees have already joined the company not while they’re still studying. 

Is there an easier way to build the right skillsets? Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman & Managing Director, Hindustan Unilever Limited seems to think so. 

While delivering a keynote address at the CII 9th HR National Conclave recently, Mehta spoke of how forging partnerships between academia and business could help develop and sustain high skill levels. 

The education system needs to address present-day skills needs and businesses can help by co-creating the curriculum, said Mehta. 

“I think the interface between academia and business has to go up several notches,” he said. “Business has a role to play in helping co-create the curriculum. Otherwise, we’re working in silos where the academicians create a curriculum that might be irrelevant for the industry.” 


Start them young
Another way of bridging the gap between academia and business is building a culture of apprenticeship. “In India, apprenticeship hasn’t taken off at all. This is something we need to do at a far bigger scale,” said Mehta. “If you look at Germany of Japan, one of the biggest things they’ve done is (introduce) the culture of apprenticeship.” 

“(In an apprenticeship system) Young people begin working in an industry at a very young age, not just to earn pocket money but to understand what they need to learn (in order) to create a career for themselves.” 


Re-Inventing the Game
“My personal belief is that the best of Europe is behind them but the U.S. keeps reinventing itself. And one of the reasons why the U.S. keeps reinventing itself is because of its innovation ecosystem. In their innovation ecosystem, the corporation the academic institutions and the research institutions all come together. That’s how the best of innovation and the best of talent still works in the U.S.”

4,2019-12-04,Britannia,"By Swaminathan S Anklesaria Aiyar
The government has junked the 2017-18 National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) consumption survey which, accordingly to a leaked report, showed total consumption declining by 3.7% between 2011-12 and 2017-18, and rural consumption falling 8%. 

Protests have erupted from Opposition parties and a group of 214 academics. On the other hand, Surjit Bhalla, now India’s executive director in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has lambasted the NSSO findings as unbelievable. He has shown that between 2011-12 and 2017-18, sales of cars rose 31.5%, of two-wheelers 45.6%, of airline passengers 95.6% and of cellphone users 44.4%. 

This is totally incompatible with the NSSO claim of falling consumption. 


Diverging Divergence 
Bhalla further says that the ratio of NSSO to GDP estimates (made by the national accounts) of consumption had plunged steadily from 95% in the 1960s to just 55% in 2011-12, and now to an incredible 33% in 2017-18. No economic explanation can explain such a huge, rising divergence. Something may be wrong with GDP data. But, clearly, much more is wrong with the NSSO data.

In a recent interview in Mint (
bit.do/fjrfu), Pronab Sen, the most respected statistical expert in India, says whenever the statistical system throws up bad news, the government tries to suppress or discredit it. He is correct. GoI should not suppress data even when inconvenient. But that does not mean NSSO data are sacrosanct and cannot be questioned, or called incredible.

As I related in this column last fortnight ( 


  bit.do/fjskC)
 
 , even in the US, household surveys provide serious underestimates so regularly that a recent academic paper was titled ‘Household Surveys in Crisis’. We should accept that NSSO household surveys are flawed, not because the statisticians are liars or saboteurs, but because all such surveys are inherently flawed, more so in India’s circumstances.

We need a drastic overhaul of NSSO survey methodologies. Survey data must not be hidden as being politically embarrassing. Rather, they should be published along with a frank discussion of their flaws. This is happening in the US, where, too, household surveys underestimate consumption by up to 40%. US academics are trying to create models that modify household surveys by incorporating independent production and sales data. India must do the same.

Pronab Sen says critics including the government are “consistently questioning the professionalism of [the government’s] statisticians”. No, I am questioning the credibility of their models and methods, which are also under question in other countries like the US. Sen says GDP data (national accounts) are drawn mainly from the corporate sector. But the non-corporate sector accounts for half the economy. So, maybe the corporate sector is doing well, but non-corporate sectors are doing badly, which is why consumption is falling.

This will not wash. First, production in the organised and unorganised sectors is closely linked. Unorganised producers use inputs from the organised sector — electricity, steel, aluminium, yarn, plastics, commercial vehicles. Second, the country is steadily getting more formalised, which is why the ratio of corporate tax to GDP has tripled since 1991despite a cut in the tax rate. 


Lie Lie LandThird, the government has given over Rs 3 lakh crore of Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) small business loans to the unorganised sector, and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) lending to microcredit groups and small businesses has grown explosively. Sen’s thesis of a collapse of the unincorporated sector is contradicted by independent data.

Sen says NSSO data do not fully capture the upper income groups, who refuse to participate in surveys. “But that does not mean that it is not capturing data for the lower income groups accurately,” he states. Sorry, but independent data such as Bhalla’s show that the NSSO fails even in lower income data.

I looked up sales data of top FMCG companies, which cater to the lower and middle classes. Between 2011-12 and 2017-18, sales of Hindustan Unilever rose by 52%, of Nestlé by 32%, of Britannia Industries 85%, and of Venky’s (the top chicken producer) by 171%. No sign here of falling consumption among the lower and middle classes.

I argued in this column last fortnight that the total inability of opinion polls and exit polls to predict election results proved conclusively that people lie to surveyors. They will not say anything they think might harm their personal interest. In the last two decades, subsidies and benefits from both the Centre and states have often been targeted at the lower sections of the population.

It makes no sense for people to honestly declare their true consumption, and risk being graduated out of income categories from which they could get current or future benefit.

I am certain that this is the key reason for the consistently growing gap between what the national accounts and NSSO surveys show. Neither Sen nor any other critic is able to counter my thesis. That simply strengthens it.

The government is certainly wrong to try and hide NSSO data. But that does not make the data any less incredible.

We must abandon using unadjusted NSSO data, which have drifted far from reality. Instead, we must develop models using other data sources (such as production, sales and tax receipts) to adjust the NSSO data. The US is attempting this. We should not lag behind.

5,2019-12-05,Britannia,"If Shaktikanta Das were to exercise his veto power and say we need to do more, who knows, maybe some relatively unconventional measures like longer term OMOs, a CRR cut which has not even been talked about, could be tried and that would have more effect in terms of transmission, says Mythili Bhusnurmath, Consulting Editor, ET Now. Excerpts:

Is it a given that the central bank is going to cut rates today?Well, the MPC really has no other alternative, simply because if it doed not do it, the consequences, at least in terms of sentiment would be adverse, knowing full well that a typical 25 bps cut would make no difference at all. The MPC knows that it is really quite pointless, but at the same time, it is trapped in a corner. So perhaps a 25 bps cut will be there. But Shaktikanta Das is dovish and much more willing to take the bull by the horns. If he were to exercise his veto power and say we need to do more, who knows, maybe some relatively unconventional measures like longer term OMOs, a CRR cut which has not even been talked about, could be tried and that would have more effect in terms of transmission.


 You mean a steeper cut could also be an outside chance?Could be yes because a 25 bps cut is not going to move the needle at all. I always believe that the ball is in the fiscal court.


RBI is now maintaining that liquidity is back in the system. There is a Credit Suisse report also claiming the same. There are two ways to stimulate an economy – monetary action and fiscal action. The monetary action has taken place but the economy is not picking up. Fiscal action has to pick up. Is that the only thing we should look forward to?The government should spend. I do not know what is holding it back because they seem very hung up on 3.3% fiscal deficit target and it is a bit of a chicken or egg situation. Ultimately, as we have seen, even in nominal terms, GDP growth is much lower. The fiscal deficit target is going to be breached irrespective of whatever kind of fudging you could do of the numbers. Let us admit, that is not new; previous governments have also done it. Maybe there is a difference in the extent of fudging that you have done, but fiscal deficit numbers in India have never been entirely above board in terms of integrity.

So given the fact that anyway you are going to breach the fiscal deficit, why not do it for something that might get the economy kick started? Why not spend it on infrastructure, on road building. This the kind of capital spending where the money will pass into the hands of those who have a much higher propensity to consume, unlike the corporate tax cut where the corporates are not going to invest immediately. On the other hand, if a poor man gets some money in his hands, he might buy some HUL product, some Britannia products, some of consumer non-durables, if not durables. 

So, that really is the way and though the government has spoken about Rs 100-lakh-crore infrastructure fund, the spending does not seem to have started. That is my biggest angst because the government does not have too much time to lose. The external economy is not working in our favour as we have seen in case of on-off US-China trade war. 

We will have to look for internal solutions and this is where the government must act quicker, faster and disinvest big time because as you have seen with Ujjivan, as you have seen in Catholic Syrian Bank, there is appetite for “good” paper. I frankly do not understand why the government is being so lethargic on disinvestment particularly.

The message that we have to send to investigating agencies is that banking is a business of risk. Unless there is some malafide intent or corruption, do not crack down on every loan that has gone bad.-Mythili Bhusnurmath


What could be the out of jail card for us because it indeed feels like a jail if you are looking at the economy and in terms of the basic pillars of the economy. Is government spending the only out of jail card and the easy card?It is not an easy card because there will be a price to pay. Let us accept it because the rating agencies will be held to pay but as we have seen in the case of Moody’s, even when they lowered our outlook, it did not really make a difference because everybody takes ratings with a pinch of salt and ultimately even at 5% to 6%, India is relatively faster growing. We have a rather unsaturated market in terms of consumer demand. If the pricing is right, there will be appetite. First of all, one must accept that there is no magic bullet. There is no single answer. The turnaround will be slow and painful but the government perhaps will have no alternative. Fiscal is the only one which really has not done as much as monetary and with monetary remember the catch up is always much later. Just as today we are paying the price for the so called excess monetary tightening in the past few quarters, may be a year down the line, we could pay the price for a much higher monetary easing. Fiscal is really the only answer. We will have to sit through some of the pain and that is inevitable.


Given the kind of headlines that we are seeing across the globe, is it going to be a hawkish commentary?I do not think the MPC and the RBI can afford to be hawkish. It will have to be accommodative with a cautious undertone, saying anytime, things go out of hand, we are there and we will step in. It has to be iron fist in a glove.


You are essentially saying in a respect that we have moved beyond waiting to see what is going to happen in the policy because it is a kind of given, it has to be government expenditure?Yes and nobody really expects it to change things very dramatically. But as I said, the only thing RBI perhaps can do is in terms of the regulatory aspect. Where is it with DHFL? What is it with NBFC? What kind of guarantee can it give to banks because frankly the reason is not so much that banks are rates have not come down and not that banks are unwilling to lend. It is because there is no demand. Why would corporates want to borrow when there is no consumer demand? Why would consumers want to borrow when incomes are not growing and at the end of the day, the kind of crackdown that we saw on bankers, particularly public sector bankers, it has made every banker think 10 times before taking any lending decision.

Unless the investigating agencies understand that then no banker would want to lend because in a public sector bank it does not matter whether you lend or do not lend. You lend and you make a mistake, you stop lending and you are fine. The message that we have to send to investigating agencies is that banking is a business of risk. Unless there is some malafide intent or corruption, do not crack down on every loan that has gone bad."

Dabur India Ltd., the household goods maker controlled by the billionaire Burman family, is willing to spend part of its about $500 million cash reserve to acquire companies and revive sales that grew at the slowest pace in two years.

The company is exploring options in the health care, foods and personal care segment, Chief Executive Officer Mohit Malhotra said in an interview. Dabur has identified potential targets and is looking to buy companies in the 1 billion-to-10-billion rupee price range.

“We have a ready war chest available to acquire companies,” Malhotra said, adding that the company has reserves of up to 35 billion rupees ($490 million). “With slowdown, some targets will become affordable which were earlier very expensive.”

The slowest growth in six years has hit companies including Dabur, Maruti Suzuki Ltd., India’s largest carmaker, and biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd. as consumers in the world’s second-most populous nation cut back on purchases. Consumer confidence in India, tracked by the central bank, is at its lowest since at least 2014.

Dabur outperformed the Sensex by 13% in the past six months.

Bloomberg

The company is fanning out operations to remote parts of the country to access more consumers. It is expanding its rural network to cover 55,000 villages by March next year and 60,000 by March 2021 next year from 44,000 in April, Malhotra said, adding that rural consumers account for half of sales in the country. Revenue from Indian operations in the quarter ended Sept. 30 grew 4.1%, the slowest pace since the same quarter in 2017.

“We are hoping to acquire the kind of entities which take us to rural India and help us bridge the gap between urban and rural image,” Malhotra said.


Smaller Packaging
To keep the customers from turning to cheaper brands amid slowing economy, Dabur started selling smaller packets of hair oils, toothpaste and fruit drinks.

The strategy to introduce a 10-rupee packet seems to be helping the maker of Hajmola digestive candy boost sales in villages. Its rural business grew at a faster pace than urban, in contrast with rivals Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and Marico Ltd. “Dabur has outperformed the market,” Naveen Trivedi, analyst at HDFC Securities Ltd., wrote in a note.

Dabur’s shares, which have risen 12% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, lost 0.74% to 462.65 rupees at 2:55 p.m. in Mumbai. Hindustan Unilever has advanced 11% in the same quarter while the benchmark Sensex fell 1.85%."
8,2019-12-09,Britannia,"Valuations of FMCG stocks have finally started correcting, with prices falling between 3 per cent and 12 per cent in the past one month as compared with the marginally positive returns on the Nifty.

On an average, shares of FMCG companies are currently trading 15 per cent below their yearly highs as foreign portfolio investors reduced their positions on the sector, citing expensive valuations.

According to analysts, earnings outperformance is critical for maintaining premium valuations. However, contrary to Street expectations, demand recovery is rather slow and is likely to take another 2-3 quarters, as per management commentary across FMCG companies.

Stocks such as Godrej Consumer, Gillette India, ITC, Marico, Colgate-Palmolive, Bajaj Consumer, Hindustan Unilever and Glaxosmithkline Consumers have declined between 5 per cent and 12 per cent in the past one month. Nifty FMCG index has shed nearly 4 per cent in this period. Nifty 50 has gone up marginally, 0.07 per cent.



“With margin expansion likely to be at a slower pace, it is critical for the FMCG companies to drive top-line growth to match Street expectation of sustained, healthy, and double-digit earnings growth,” said Nitin Gupta, analyst, SBICAP Securities.

“Another factor safeguarding the premium sector valuations despite the recent slowdown is the TINA (There Is No Alternative) effect. Given the current steep valuations, FPIs have continued to trim their positions in the sector,” he added.

Colgate, Britannia, Dabur, Godrej Consumer and Marico are currently trading about 40 times their FY21 estimated earnings, while HUL and Nestle are trading at PEs of 51 and 59 times.

The sector is considered defensive, which means FMCG are in high demand in falling markets. The sector is struggling to boost growth. Stocks such as Godrej Consumer, Dabur, Marico, Emami and Bajaj Consumer have seen earnings downgrades in the past one month.

“With macroeconomic headwinds worsening, demand and consumer sentiments have aggravated sequentially. This, coupled with liquidity challenges, exerted pressure on the trade pipeline inventory,” said Abneesh Roy, analyst, Edelweiss Securities. “This, we believe, would lead to the softest volume growth in Q2FY20, a nine-quarter low.”

Stocks such as ITC, Gillette, and Godrej Consumer are currently trading 20 per cent below their respective 52-week highs. Britannia and Marico are down by 15 per cent, while Hindustan Unilever, Dabur, GalxoSmithkline Consumer have declined over 6 per cent from their yearly highs.

However, some analysts believe that the current slowdown is not structural and is likely to see a rebound in the medium term as the effect of central government initiatives matures."

12,2019-12-11,Britannia,"There could be some choppiness when it comes to midcaps and smallcaps but if foreign investors take a three -year time horizon from an investment perspective, it will be time to start nibbling into midcaps and smallcaps, 
says Pankaj Murarka, Founder, Renaissance Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Do you think we are in a spot of bother once again? Just when it appeared that the storm had come and gone at least in late November, early December, midcap stocks have started falling again. Are we in for more chop and churn?Possibly yes. When it comes to midcaps and smallcaps, we have seen a sharp decline since January 2018, when these had peaked and were trading at a significant premium to largecaps. Now that has reversed and we are trading at a fair bit of discount to largecaps. 

On an absolute basis, we can see pockets of value in the midcaps and smallcaps. Also from a market perspective, a lot of leveraged positions in the midcap and smallcap space have been unwound. There could be some choppiness when it comes to midcaps and smallcaps but if foreign investors are going to take a three-year time horizon from an investment perspective, it is time to start nibbling into midcaps and smallcaps.

What should one do in this kind of a market? Every time, when I speak to investors they say have a long-term view, start buying on every decline, start accumulating. The problem with that logic is that three years ago those who waited for long term, have lost money and those who bought on every decline, are not left with any money?That is very well said. I tend to agree broadly with what you are saying. The fact is that the economy has clearly surprised on the downside. All of us grossly underestimated effect of the IL&FS fallout and the important role NBFCs were playing as a whole in the credit dissemination in the last mile in our ecosystem. 

Clearly the last three or four quarters of sharp decline or downside in the economy has emerged from the fact that the credit market is completely frozen. NBFCs have been completely out of the market in terms of their ability to lend and that has impacted credit flow across the trade and across sectors. We have had companies like Lever and Britannia saying that there are credit issues with their trade partners or the dealers and wholesalers. But it seems that the worst is behind us and banks have started lending back to NBFCs. The credit will probably normalise over the next three-four quarters.

NBFCs have been completely out of the market in terms of their ability to lend and that has impacted credit flow across the trade and across sectors. Companies like HUL and Britannia are saying there are credit issues with their trade partners.-Pankaj Murarka
As that happens, the economy should mean revert. Today clearly growth is 2 standard deviation below normal. The economy has to get back to normalised growth which will probably take about four quarters. The impact of the economic slowdown has become much broader and the sectors or stocks which have done well in this slowdown, has become narrower. There are very few limited pockets of stocks which have done well, whereas the broader set of stocks have not delivered the kind of returns. All investors can invest into decent quality business to just stay invested and have faith in the long term outlook for the Indian economy.



Have you ever wondered why SBI is not getting fully priced in for the franchise value they have? It is the biggest in credit card, biggest bank, biggest balance sheet, most number of branches, biggest in terms of life insurance. Even the NPAs are the biggest in the industry but their market cap is not the highest in the banking sector?It is a very interesting case study we had done some time back. SBI is a proxy play on India’s macro economy because they represent 23% of India’s banking. If the economy goes through a downturn or a deep distress, which is what we have been witnessing at this point of time and over the last few years, then all of the pain of the real economy lies on the balance sheet of banks. 

SBI being a dominant player cannot escape it. SBI, as a stock, has not delivered any returns to the shareholders for last 10 years. In the eight years before that, SBI has been one of the best performing stocks in the Indian markets and did a 34% CAGR over 8% and the stock actually went 10x. 

We are at the bottom of the economy cycle. Though the peak of NPAs is behind SBI. obviously that has taken a significant toll on their profits. We expect that from next year onwards, their profitability will return to more normal levels. There is a significant in the franchise. A disclosure; we own the stock across our portfolios.


Next five years, except for Bajaj Finance, will NBFCs give returns? I was looking at gold finance companies. They have given good returns. I was also looking at Edelweiss. It has given almost no returns. Which way is the entire space moving?We are positive on NBFCs as a whole. We were negative on the space two years back because of lot of concerns around the developer exposure for some of these large housing finance companies (HFCs) and the kind of competitive intensity that was there in the sector. My view is that the worst is behind us. The men have been separated from boys. 

The sector plays a very important role in dissemination of credit in India and probably shadow banks as they are called globally have a very important role to play in any ecosystem, even in the developed markets. Some of these catastrophes or consolidation that we have seen in the NBFC sector, happen in every cycle.

In 2008, we had few NBFCs that had gone through deep troubles. Cholamandalam Finance used to be Chola DBS at that point of time, a JV between Cholamandalam and DBS and they had a really tough time with very high NPAs and they had to recapitalise Chola and rebuild the whole business again. But NBFCs will do well and if you can buy into or one can invest into high quality, good quality businesses which can be run efficiently and keep credit costs under check, then there is money to be made in the sector."
13,2019-12-12,Britannia,"BENGALURU: Hair oil, shampoos, toothpastes and biscuits have been among the worst hit in the FMCG industry due to the prolonged slowdown in consumer spending, which has hit volume growth of major players in the previous quarter.

Most of these products fall in the discretionary category where consumers - especially rural ones - reduce spending when financial conditions are weak. Rural markets are the biggest contributors to volume growth in these products, and these markets have been severely hit by the economic slowdown.

Toothpaste volumes, which have been in a free fall for some time, shrunk 3% in the last quarter compared to a growth of 13% in the same period last year, while hair oil grew at just 0.4%, compared to 12% in the comparable period last year, data from market research firm Nielsen, sourced from industry, showed. Shampoos have been hit the most, with nil growth compared to about 20% a year ago.

“Ever since I have been in this industry, I have never seen hair oil growth so gloomy. In the second quarter of this year, the volumes are flat, that is a big cause of concern, but the bigger cause of worry is the growth engine, which used to be rural growth, is for the first time negative,” Sumit Malhotra, MD of Bajaj Consumer Care, had said last month.

“Hair oil and shampoos are discretionary and such categories tend to witness a decline during a slowdown,” Abneesh Roy, EVP at Edelweiss Securities, said. Consumers, especially in rural areas, have tightened their purse strings in spite of a good monsoon this year. A survey by the National Statistical Office, now junked by the government, showed that spending fell for the first time in four decades in 2017-18, the fiscal which corresponds to the period after demonetisation and the implementation of GST.

Marico CEO Saugata Gupta said that in addition to the slow consumption, constrained liquidity conditions have led to a correction in trade inventories, particularly in wholesale and rural, thereby affecting growth of companies. To navigate this, companies are trying to expand their rural reach, trying to approach more retailers directly rather than through wholesalers. Dabur said it is expanding its range of products in the rural market through lowunit-price (LUP) packs to push up demand.

Biscuits, another staple product, saw growth tanking to 5% from 15% just a year ago. “What is worrying is that small packs are seeing a decline. There has been no issue in consumer demand for premium sub-segments and bigger packs in biscuits, which are still growing,” said Mayank Shah, category head at Parle Products. The category, worth Rs 35,000 crore, is India’s largest consumer product segment.

The slowdown has led Britannia to hold its launches. “We had a fairly packed calendar. But when we started to see the slowdown, we decided to postpone these launches because we were seeing inefficiencies coming into the system,” MD Varun Berry told analysts.

While most categories fell, Godrej Consumer Products, on the back of recovery in household insecticides portfolio, posted the highest volume growth of 7% year-on-year among staples companies."

19,2019-12-19,Britannia,"Mumbai | Kolkata: Top consumer goods firms including Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Nestle, Britannia and Parle expect consumer demand to recover by the middle of next year, helped by government interventions and improved sentiments in rural areas.

Consumer product sales have been tapering off consistently over the past four quarters, and experts said the low base will also help sales revival.

“Fundamentally nothing has changed in the Indian economy,” said B Sumant, executive director for FMCG at ITC. “There is a growing consumer base.”

He said the current slowdown is “short term hiccups (that) should disappear by second quarter of next year” when the winter crop yield happens, improving rural sentiments. Credit flow from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) will boost wholesalers, Sumant said.

Unilever, the British-Dutch parent of HUL, cut its sales guidance for the first half of 2020 on Tuesday, mainly due to slowdown concerns in South Asia and West Africa.

India is Unilever’s biggest market by volume and the second largest after the US in terms of revenues.

The maker of Dove shampoo and Lipton tea said it has seen slowdown particularly in rural India that, for the first time in a while, is growing at a slower rate than urban India.

“As we look forward into next year, we are tackling some of the fundamental drivers of growth around refocusing on penetration of our brands, ensuring that we have strong savings programmes into next year to fuel continued steps up in investment,” Unilever chief executive Alan Jope told analysts. “Some of the macro effects will take time to flow through. So generally, it looks as if India will start to come back in the second half of next year,” he said.

In the past decade, sales of branded daily needs in the nation of 1.3 billion people have increasingly relied on growth in the rural hinterland, home to more than 800 million people, whose purchase behaviour is largely linked to farm output. Rural consumption, which accounts for about a third of the market and has been outpacing urban sales, has come under stress due to lower farm incomes and liquidity constraints that have squeezed the wholesale channel.

“There are issues around overall economic growth, agrarian income, impact and outflow in banking


situation,” said Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director at Nestle India. “The government has looked at areas like taxation (and) ease of doing business among other things. If some of the measures that the government is contemplating also leads to more money in the hands of consumers, hopefully recovery should happen. For us to enjoy the 8-9% growth of the past, I hope it happens sooner than later,” he said at CII National FMCG Summit themed ‘Growth Wapsi: Revving up FMCG Growth’ in Mumbai on Wednesday.

From 16.2% year-on-year growth during July-September 2018, growth in the overall fast-moving consumer goods market has fallen to 7.3% last quarter, according to market tracker Nielsen, which expects FMCG to growth to come down to 6.5-7.5% during October-December.

Parle Products, makers of Parle-G and Hide & Seek biscuits, said a fullfledged recovery should come by the second or third quarter of next calendar year, but inflation could be a dampener. “We have seen some green shoots post Diwali such as improvement in sales from low single digit to mid-single digit,” said Mayank Shah, category head at Parle Products. “It should reach normal level in another 4-6 months. Inflation is right now the only major concern.”"

Trump impeached, but markets don't worry much
The US House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, the culmination of an effort by Democrats that further inflamed partisan tensions in Washington and deepened the nation’s ideological divide. The historic votes on Wednesday evening, which won the support of almost all Democrats in the House chamber but not a single Republican, leave Trump as only the third president in US history to be impeached -- and the only impeached president likely to win his party’s nomination for re-election. But market reaction is unlikely to be significant as it is widely expected that the Republican-controlled Senate will not vote to remove Trump from office.

27,2019-12-23,Britannia,"Mumbai: As equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty continue to scale new highs every second week, analysts are divided on their market outlook for the weeks ahead. Stock selection would be crucial from here on, they say.

Sensex and Nifty scaled record highs last week on the back of continued foreign fund inflows, as risk appetite improved following an agreement on the Phase One of US–China trade deal. However, RBI’s pause on key policy rate capped the gains. For the week, Sensex rose 1.64 per cent while Nifty added 1.53 per cent.

The market has been witnessing rotation of sectors as well as stocks. “This is something we have been observing over the past three months,” says Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group. “It is becoming difficult to see where the market is headed and what shape and position it will take going forward.”

But most analysts agree the market is teeming with stock-specific opportunities. Based on the recommendations of some of the top analysts on Dalal Street, we picked 12 stock ideas that they said are likely to deliver solid gains over next few weeks.


Vikas Jain, senior research analyst, Reliance Securities.

Cadila Healthcare| Buy| Target price Rs 295| Stop loss Rs 248
This stock has seen a breakout from the long-term average and rose to a seven-month closing high with volumes signalling strong buying interest. Key technical indicators are positively poised above their averages, signalling strength on the counter. The analyst believes long positions can be initiated at this level and on dips for a price target of Rs 295 with a stop loss at Rs 248.


UPL | Buy | Target price: Rs 645 | Stop Loss: Rs 555
This stock has seen a breakout from its congestion zone at Rs 540-570 levels with strong volumes and closed above the medium-term averages. A bullish cross-over in RSI and Stochastic are signalling a turnaround and resumption of its northward journey which may result in a sharp up-move from current level. The analyst recommends that long positions can be initiated for a target of Rs 645 with a stop loss at Rs 555.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Britannia | Buy | Price target Rs 3,370| Stop loss Rs 3,027
Price action on this counter appears to be quite encouraging, as it is in a consolidation mode for last four weeks after retracing around 62 per cent of its last leg of rally from the low of Rs 2,835. Moreover, it closed above its narrow consolidation band at Rs 3,115 – 3,025 in the last session. Hence, if it sustains above Rs 3,030 level, it shall eventually head towards its interim top at Rs 3,399, the analyst said. He advised traders to buy the stock for a target of Rs 3,370 with a stop loss placed below Rs 3,027 on a closing basis.


Titan| Buy| Target price Rs 1,270 | Stop loss Rs 1,149
Friday’s price action on this counter on much higher volumes is clearly suggesting that it has bottomed out at the recent low of Rs 1,123. After registering a huge bearish gap in the Rs 1,277 – 1,199 zone on November 6, this counter slipped into the consolidation between Rs 1,199 and Rs 1,130 levels for five weeks. With last Friday’s strong comeback, the analyst believes the stock has positioned for a pullback rally. In that scenario, it shall eventually move ahead towards Rs 1,277 level to bridge the said bearish gap. The analyst advised positional traders to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on declines in the Rs 1,180 – 1,170 zone for a target of Rs 1,270. The stop loss suggested for the trade is a close below Rs 1,149 level.


Corporation Bank | Buy| Target price Rs 28| Stop loss Rs 24
This counter appears to be consolidating for last 18 sessions in the Rs 27 – 23 band after witnessing sporadic rise from the lows of Rs 15-29 in just four sessions. Friday’s price action, at the lower end of consolidation band, on the back of huge volumes suggested that this counter is positioning itself for a resumption of the up-move. In such a scenario, it shall initially head to test its recent swing high of Rs 29, the analyst believes. He advised positional traders to buy this stock with a stop loss below Rs 24 on closing basis and for a target of Rs 28.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst Angel Broking

ICICI Lombard | Buy | Target price Rs 1,552| Stop loss Rs 1,327
This stock has been a traders’ delight for some time, but it faced a hurdle around Rs 1,400 level in the past few weeks. On the daily chart, the stock broke this hurdle and confirmed a bullish continuation breakout, known as ‘Rectangular Channel’. In addition, prices have closed above the higher range of the Bollinger Band, indicating a trending up-move after its recent consolidation. On the oscillators front, the RSI has given a fresh ‘buy’ signal with its smoothened moving average supporting the ‘buy’ call. Hence, the analyst recommends buying this stock at current level for a target of Rs 1,552 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 1,327, he said.


L&T Infotech| Buy | Target price Rs 1,840 | Stop loss Rs 1,640
On the daily chart, the stock has seen a strong up-move in the past couple of sessions to break above the trend line resistance joining the two major tops. The said breakout is supported by a strong bullish candle. In addition, the RSI has entered the positive zone and given a fresh buy signal with its smoothened average. The prices have closed above the higher range of the Bollinger Band, suggesting a trending up-move in the near term. Looking at all the above evidence, the analyst senses a strong upside in the near term. He recommends buying the stock at current level for a price target of Rs 1,840 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 1,640, he said.


DLF| Buy| Target price Rs 249| Stop loss Rs 221
In the past few months, this has been one of the outperforming counters as it rallied from the October lows of Rs 138 to the recent close of Rs 230. Recently, this stock witnessed a brief pause and it has since resumed its uptrend by confirming a Continuation Flag breakout. In addition, the stock price has sustained above previous swing highs on the higher timeframe chart, confirming a ‘Rounding Bottom’ breakout with strong potential for an up-move in the near term. The prices are well above key averages supporting the ‘buy’ call, the analyst said. He recommended buying the stock at current level for a price target of Rs 249 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss for the trade should be at Rs 221, he said.


Jay Thakkar , Assistant Vice President - Equity Research, Anand Rathi Stock Brokers

Container Corporation of India | Buy| Target price Rs 610 | Stop loss Rs 545
This stock has seen a breakout from a downtrend line resistance and, with that, it has provided a breakout from the Falling Wedge Pattern. Daily as well as weekly momentum indicator MACD is well into buy mode, the analyst saod. He recommended buying the stock with a price target of Rs 610 and a stop loss of Rs 545.


Mphasis| Buy| Target price Rs 898| Stop loss Rs 852
This stock has provided a breakout from the symmetrical triangular pattern with a clear ‘buy’ crossover on daily as well as weekly momentum indicators. It has provided a breakout from the base triangular pattern. One can buy the stock for the price target of Rs 898 with a stop loss of Rs 852, the analyst said.


Shrikant Chouhan, SVP Technical Research, Kotak Securities

Hero Moto Corp | Buy | Target price Rs 2,550 | Stop loss Rs 2,320
The stock witnessed sustained selloff over the past few weeks. However, a strong demand zone around Rs 2,250 level has emerged as support for the same. On the weekly chart, the stock has reversed from those levels with an increase in volume. For short-term traders, it offers buying opportunity at current level with a decent risk-reward ratio. The analyst expects the stock to resume its uptrend towards a target of Rs 2,550. He suggested a stop loss at Rs 2,320.


Vedanta| Buy | Target price Rs 160 | Stop loss Rs 138
This stock had given a Triangle Breakout on the daily chart and is currently retracing its breakout move. The stock is near the retracement level, where substantial volume activity is seen, which indicates that buying has emerged at lower levels. “Along with this, the stock has formed a higher bottom. Looking at the chart pattern, it seems the pain is over, and we can see the start of a new uptrend from current levels,” the analyst said. He recommended buying the stock with a stop loss at Rs 138 for a price target of Rs 160."
26,2019-12-23,Britannia,"NEW DELHI: Most of the FMCG stocks were trading on a mixed note in Monday's morning session.

Shares of Emami (up 2.19 per cent), Tata Global Beverages (up 0.93 per cent), Jubilant Foodworks (up 0.87 per cent) and Godrej Industries (up 0.67 per cent) were among the top gainers. 

While Godrej Consumer Products (down 1.44 per cent), Nestle India (down 1.09 per cent), Britannia Industries (down 0.69 per cent) and Colgate Palmolive (India) (down 0.32 per cent) were the top losers in the index. 

The Nifty FMCG index was trading 0.11 per cent down at 30,323.25 around 10:46 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was down 1.60 points at 12,270.2, while the BSE Sensex was 30.45 points at 41,651.09. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 31 were trading in the green, while 18 were in the red. 

Shares of YES Bank, Vodafone Idea, Indiabulls Housing, SAIL, Tata Motors, SBI, JSPL, Bank of Baroda, Zee Entertainment and Tata Steel were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
28,2019-12-24,Britannia,"India’s key equity indices are likely to gain as much as 15 per cent in 2020 as investors bet on revival measures in the February budget and a recovery in the economy to bolster sentiment. The year is also likely to mark a shift in focus to broader market as investors become less risk-averse to mid- and smallcap stocks with a gradual recovery in the economy. The Sensex ended little changed at 41,642.66 points and the Nifty at 12,262.75 on Monday.

An ET poll of 26 fund managers and heads of research at brokerages showed that 48 per cent of them see the benchmarks gaining as much as 15 per cent in the New Year while 29 per cent expect them to see more modest gains of around 10 per cent.

“Primary manufacturing, especially in auto and metal sectors, is improving. Liquidity is far better now as banks are well capitalised. Rate transmission will happen faster and balance sheets of corporates are also much better now,” said S Krishna Kumar, CIO, Sundaram Mutual Fund. “Positive news will start flowing in the first quarter of next year and we expect the market to give a return of between 12 per cent and 15 per cent next year.”



Gaurav Dua, head of capital market strategy and investments at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, expects an 8-10 per cent rise in the indices.

“We expect the next year to be a year of recovery in the Indian economy. This recovery will drive earnings growth, and lower provisioning by banks would boost earnings,” he said.

About 31 per cent of the respondents see the Nifty trading at 12,400-12,500 by budget day, February 1, which implies a potential gain of 1-2 per cent until then. About 19 per cent see the Nifty at 12,200-12,400 by budget day while 13 per cent see the index at 12,000-12,200. Another 19 per cent see the Nifty at 12,500-12,700 by February 1 and 13 per cent see the index at 13,000 by that date.

“The key events for 2020 will be the government’s balancing act in the budget, some recovery in corporate earnings and continued momentum in global equity flows,” said Rajat Rajgarhia, CEO, Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities.

The upcoming budget has to balance demands for tax measures to boost economic growth while taking deficit levels into account.

“Corporate India’s PBT (profit before tax) is yet to show any growth while tax cuts are buoying net profit,” he said. “Markets will like the PBT to deliver double-digit growth, although that has only remained in estimates for almost a decade.”

Rajgarhia said the Nifty is richly valued and any double-digit return will depend entirely on an economic revival, which can happen in the second half of the year at the earliest.

While money managers and heads of research polled by ET showed that most expect modest to mid-double-digit returns in the upcoming year, the focus is also likely to shift to the broader market where multiples have been suppressed for some time due to slowing growth. Experts said there is a need to correct the extreme polarisation of performance between the top 20 stocks and the broader markets.

“The Nifty should trade in the 12,000-12,300 range in the run-up to the budget and after the budget,” said Shiv Diwan, co-head, Edelweiss Institutional Equities. “Assuming there are some sops to boost demand, there could be a broader market rally, with investors looking to take on some risk, given compelling valuations.”

The Sensex and Nifty have gained 15 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively, in 2019, thanks to overseas investor inflows to the tune of Rs 99,000 crore — the most in a year since 2013. The government has announced several measures to engineer a turnaround in the economy, including a corporate tax cut, as growth has slowed to the lowest in more than six years.

Unlike the Nifty and Sensex, which are ending the year near highs, mid and smallcaps are far from all-time peaks. On the BSE, they are 20-30 per cent off their records.

Money managers said the broader market is likely to rise significantly if the government announces measures to boost growth.


FISCAL DEFICITThese incentives are likely to come at the cost of loosening the fiscal deficit target from the budgeted 3.3 per cent for the ongoing financial year.

About 83 per cent of polled market experts believe the government will ease the target. A 50 basis-point slippage is on the cards, according to 50 per cent of polled respondents, while 30 per cent expect the target to be eased by 30 basis points.

As much as 74 per cent of those polled believe that an adverse reaction in the stock market is unlikely in the event of the government loosening the fiscal deficit target, as they believe the market has priced in such an outcome.

Banks, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), automobiles, nonbanking financial companies (NBFCs) and metals are the top five sectors for 2020 while real estate, infrastructure, telecom and pharmaceutical companies are the ones to avoid, experts said.

RIL, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, which have outperformed the benchmarks in 2019, are favourites of money managers for 2020 as well. Those surveyed prefer Federal Bank, HDFC Life Insurance Company and Britannia Industries from the midcap segment."
