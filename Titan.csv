1,2018-01-03,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s investment of five of his pet stocks is now worth Rs 9,150 crore. Three of them – Titan Company, Escorts and DHFL – climbed 140-150 per cent in last one year, riding the bull run, while two others – Crisil and Lupin – failed to catch investors’ fancy.

Can these stocks be good bets for 2018 too? 

Titan Company, a known Jhunjhunwala favourite, has 'strong buy' ratings from nine top brokerages. Sixteen others have 'buy' ratings, two have 'hold' ratings and one each has 'sell' or 'strong sell' ratings, data compiled from Reuters Eikon showed.

The ace investor and his better half, Rekha Jhunjhunwala, owned shares worth Rs 6,200-odd crore (8.06 per cent stake) in the company.

The median consensus estimate for the stock is marginally lower than the prevailing price. But a few brokerages see it as an attractive long-term bet.

The recent aggression to capitalise on opportunities across divisions is heartening. Earnings CAGR is likely to be a massive 36 per cent over FY17-20. The sheer scale of top-line opportunity demands premium valuations, says Mumbai-based brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities.

“We maintain a buy rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 975,” it said in a note.

Jhunjhunwala held 9.16 per cent stake in Escorts at the end of second quarter, which was worth Rs 870 crore as of Wednesday. Though not as popular as Titan, this stock has two ‘strong buy’ ratings, four ‘buy’ ratings and three ‘hold’ ratings, with just one 'strong sell' call. The stock traded at Rs 770 level on Tuesday against Reuters' median estimate of Rs 811 level.

Lupin is a battered stock, the worst performer in Jhunjhunwala's portfolio in 2017. But 16 brokerages either have 'strong buy' or 'buy' ratings on the stock. Eighteen brokerages have ‘hold’ ratings and eight have either ‘sell’ or ‘strong sell’ ratings, Reuters data showed.

The median target for the stock at Rs 894 is marginally higher than its prevailing price. Jhunjhunwala’s 1.89 per cent stake in the pharma company was worth Rs 750 crore as of Wednesday's trading.

Most of the Indian pharma companies are sitting on a very healthy product pipeline for the USA markets, with many of them featuring among the highest ANDA filers. Apart from USA, the other export markets are growing at a healthy pace, says Angel Broking.

It said investors should go for pharma stocks, where valuations are very comfortable. The brokerage prefers Lupin and Aurobindo Pharmaceuticals. Jhunjhunwala held over 1 per cent stake in Aurobindo Pharma at the end of June quarter.

Crisil Ratings has four ‘buy’ or ‘strong buy’, one ‘hold’ and one ‘sell’ ratings, with a median target of Rs 1,996. Jhunjhunwala and his wife's combined 5.58 per cent stake in the company was worth Rs 750 crore as of Tuesday. The stock traded at Rs 1,880 on Tuesday.

Housing finance company Dewan Housing has eight 'strong buy' and 'buy' ratings, one 'hold' rating and no 'sell' call, as per Reuters data. 

Jhunjhunwala held 3.19 per cent stake in the company as of September 30, which was worth Rs 588 crore as of Wednesday's intraday price level. The median target for this stock is at Rs 640, while the stock trades at Rs 580-odd levels.

“Housing finance or a full-fledged NBFC like Shriram Transport, Dewan Housing are stocks we are looking at from the current levels,” Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Services told ETNow last week."

29,2018-01-30,Titan,"Mumbai: Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan Company are likely to replace Bosch, Ambuja Cement and Aurobindo Pharma in the Nifty50 index soon, said analysts at Edelweiss Securities and IDBI Capital Markets & Securities.

These changes are likely to be made in the upcoming semi-annual review of the Nifty index, the brokerages said. The index is reviewed on a half-yearly basis and a fourweek notice is given to the market before making changes to the index. Edelweiss expects the index changes to be announced by the third week of February and the same to be effective on March 30.

The inclusion of Grasim, Bajaj Finserv and Titan will lead to buying of 59.8 lakh shares, 9.2 lakh shares and 63.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

At current prices, it would mean buying of Rs 707.2 crore in Grasim, Rs 451.8 crore in Bajaj Finserv and Rs 567.9 crore in Titan.

Conversely, the exclusion of Bosch, Ambuja and Aurobindo Pharma will lead to selling of 1.4 lakh, 1.13 crore and 43.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

There are certain criteria that determine the inclusion and exclusion of a stock from the Nifty index, including liquidity, float adjusted market capitalisation, domicile and trading frequency.

For inclusion in the index, a security should have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less during the last six months, for 90 per cent of the observations for portfolio of Rs 10 crore. Impact cost is a measure of liquidity of a stock and reflects the costs faced when actually trading an index.

Companies will be included if free-float market capitalisation is 1.50 times the freefloat market capitalisation of the smallest constituent in respective index. These stocks must be available for trade in the futures and options segment and the company must be domiciled in India.

The company’s trading frequency should be 100 per cent in the last six months.

Following these changes, the weightage of sectors in the Nifty is also likely to change. The weightage of financial services will increase to 35.9 per cent from 35.5 per cent and that of cement and cement products will rise to 2.3 per cent from 1.6 per cent, said IDBI Capital in its report.

The weightage of consumer goods will rise to 10.1 per cent from 9.4 per cent, while that of pharmaceutical sector will come down to 3.5 per cent from 4 per cent, the brokerage added.

The last revision in index constituents took place on September 29, 2017, when ACC, Bank of Baroda, Tata Power and Tata Motors DVR shares were excluded. They were replaced by Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and UPL."

8,2018-03-13,Titan,"NEW DELHI: The fate of debt-ridden companies going through insolvency proceedings at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has been well-documented. But the glimmer of hope is there remains a handful of debt-free firms where promoters have high stakes with no pledged shares that are adding to shareholders' wealth.

Some of them have even big fund houses and marquee investors.

VIP Industries is one such case. This stock has rallied 103 per cent 
in one year and 347 per cent in the last three years. The company is seen as a major beneficiary of rising penetration of branded luggage, post GST. 

Brokerage Edelweiss Securities expects this company to report a 15 per cent revenue CAGR over FY17-20. Additional capacity in Bangladesh from March quarter is an incremental lever. On the other hand, there are concerns over an appreciating yuan due to the company’s dependence on China for sourcing of soft luggage. Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala owns 3.69 per cent stake with a valuation of Rs 170 crore as of 
Monday.

Another Jhunjhunwala favourite Titan Company has seen its shares double in the last one year and deliver 231 per cent in the last three years. This jeweller will be part of the Nifty50 club from 
April 2. There has been a bloodbath at jewellery counters, with PCJ, TBZ and Thangamayil Jewellery plunging 20 per cent in last one month due to the Nirav Modi scam. But this Titan Group firm has seen its shares rise 4 per cent during the same period. 

Reliance Securities expects this company to deliver revenue growth in excess of 20 per cent in jewellery business. “This coupled with high operating leverage is expected to help the company clock 23 per cent and 30.4 per cent CAGR in revenue and earnings, respectively, through FY17-20,” it said.

MNC stock Whirlpool of India is another. It has skyrocketed 659 per cent in the last three years. In an earnings note, Equris Capital noted that the company has focused on profitable growth, which is reflected in its margin performance against peers, particularly during the difficult phase of FY11-14. Franklin India Smaller Companies Fund, HDFC Midcap Opportunities Fund and Aditya Birla Sun Life Dual Advantage Fund are some of its stakeholders.

The focus remains on premium product launches in refrigerator and washing machine categories. The brokerage expects the company’s margins to improve over the near-to-medium term.

The jump in the case of Ratnamani Metals is 400 per cent in the last three years. Expectations of solid order growth on the back of revival in capital expenditure in sectors such as oil and gas and water projects have made analysts bullish on Ratnamani Metals and Tubes. The company management foresees huge order bid opportunities over the next 2-4 years in the domestic market, underpinned by upgradation of refineries, nuclear plants, city gas distribution projects, cross-country pipelines and water projects.

Nalanda India Fund and Saif India V FII Holdings are two foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) holding over 11 per cent stake in the company.

MNCs Wabco India, Gillette India and Abbott India are some other stocks that have rallied 200-300 per cent in the past three years. Prabhudas Lilladher sees Wabco as a key beneficiary of the expected upturn in the commercial vehicle cycle. 

“Increasing content per vehicle will auger well for the operating margins of the company. Wabco is looking at entering new segments -- PVs and tractors -- and has won some orders for the same. We expect it to record earnings CAGR of 32 per cent over FY18-20e on the back of revenue CAGR of 23 per cent and Ebitda margin expansion of 200 bps over the same period,” the brokerage said in a recent note.

For Abbott India, new product launches and entry into the high-margin vaccine segment are seen as key trigger while a slowdown in the domestic market is seen as a major risk. Supreme Petrochem, P&G Hygiene and Schaeffler India too have climbed 533 per cent, 208 per cent and 190 per cent, respectively, in the last three years.

For the aforesaid study, BSE500 stocks were considered. PSU and IT scrips were excluded from the list."

2,2018-04-03,Titan,"NEW DELHI: 'Expensive' growth stocks continue to top performance charts on Dalal Street, as despite the recent selloff in the market, concerns over stretched valuations continue to dog investors.

A majority of 35 BSE500-listed companies that hit record highs in last one month are ruling at trailing PE multiples of anywhere between 40 and 230, which suggests investors still prefer growth to value.

Among these stocks, Domino's Pizza operator Jubilant Foodsworks hit an all-time high of Rs 2,396 on March 27, trading at 230 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share.

Radhakishan Damani's Avenue Supermarts hit its record high exactly a month ago to rule at 177.7 times trailing price multiples. 

Kishore Biyani's Future Lifestyle and Tata Group's Titan Company are a few other examples of growth stocks that have hit all-time highs in last one month.

In the broader market, six of every 10 BSE500 stocks traded at least 20 per cent below their all-time high levels.

""In last one quarter or two, the market has been in mood to reward companies with certainty of earnings. It is not looking at companies where earnings could be iffy or where there is speculation about whether the numbers will be good. We certainly think rural consumption is going good. Urban consumption is also reasonably holding up, even though valuations are not cheap. We expect 15-20 per cent earnings growth,"" Rajat Jain, CIO, Principal PNB AMC, told ETNow on Tuesday.

Jain does not agree with the growth-only approach, through he agrees this is where the market is tilted.

Jubilant Foodworks has reported strong same-store sales growth, led by high volumes and 6-7 per cent price hikes after GST rollout. The company has seen strong consumer response to its new offer (Everyday Value) and pizza upgrade, HDFC Securities said in a note.

Edelweiss Securities expects Avenue Supermarts to report revenue, Ebitda and PAT growth of 25.5 per cent, 31.8 per cent and 41.2 per cent, respectively, over FY17-20.

Titan joined the elite Nifty50 club on Tuesday.

""High quality stocks will keep making new highs. But stocks which are making lifetime highs, let’s say D-Mart or Jubilant Life or Titan, are extremely expensive companies. They are trading in multiples of 70-80 and yet they are making new highs,” said Amit Jeswani, CIO at Stallion Asset.

""It is clearly showing that the trend is towards high quality stocks and 2018 will be about chasing quality, and not low-quality stocks,"" Jeswani said. 

Data showed stocks like Nestle India, Astral Poly, Bajaj Electrical, Bharat Forge, V-Mart Retail, Thomas Cook

Endurance Tech, Phoenix Mills and Lakshmi Mach Works, among others, have hit record highs this month.

 None of these stocks have PE values lower than 40. Equity benchmark BSE Sensex currently trades at 22.93 times its 12-month EPS. 
""Low-quality stocks are now a part of everyone’s portfolio. These stocks are not going to rally. It is going to be a move towards high growth, high return on equity, free cash flow and very high quality stocks,” Jeswani told ET Now. 

High PE multiple of a growth stock is supported by expectations that a company may continue to deliver above-average earnings. When bond yields fall, it generally makes equity investment look attractive and leads to re-rating of growth stocks. 

Experts note that growth stocks are not immune to market corrections. 

Kotak Securities said were the macro factors to worsen, growth stocks may also correct. “Their high valuations are unlikely to sustain in a scenario of higher domestic and global bond yields and increased earnings (weaker economic growth), macro and political uncertainty,” it said."

""There is no material change to our forecasts. Consistently strong YoY sales growth in Jewelry points to the sheer magnitude of value migration happening in the Indian jewelry market. In FY17, TTAN accounted for only 5 per cent of the INR2t jewelry market. Regulations governing the segment, including identity proofs for all transactions over Rs 2,00,000, GST implementation and crackdown on black money, have tilted trade decisively in favor of organized players, among which TTAN is a dominant player in terms of scale and trust. Recent aggression to capitalize on the massive opportunity is also heartening. Earnings CAGR is likely to be a strong at 26 per cent over FY18-20. The sheer scale of top-line opportunity demands premium valuations. We, thus, maintain Buy, with a revised target price of Rs 1,090 (55x March 20E EPS, 33 per cent premium to the three-year target price because of strong pace of earnings growth),"" Motilal Oswal Securities said in a report."

27,2018-04-23,Titan,"Software biggie TCS has delivered multibagger returns to investors since its listing in August 2004. What comes as the icing on the cake is it became the first Indian IT company on Monday to enter the $100 billion club in terms of market capitalisation under the group chairman N Chandrasekaran.

That means an investment of just Rs 10,000 on the listing day would have now become over Rs 1.40 lakh (ex-dividend), translating into a return of over 1,300 per cent.


Chandrasekaran as the captain has seen the IT boat transforming into a giant ship, which has grown at an ""enormous"" pace over the years.

During the past one year, TCS has delivered over 45 per cent return to investors till April 20, managed to outpace 18 other Tata Group companies, including Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Coffee, Indian Hotels, Tata Chemicals and Tata Power, among others. 

Back in 2004, Chandrasekaran was one of the directors of TCS. He took over as the chief executive officer of the IT major on November 6, 2009. 

Chandrasekaran became the first non-Parsi chairman of Tata Sons on February 21 last year after the unceremonious ouster of Cyrus Mistry.

Market capitalisation of TCS is now Rs 80,000 crore more than its nearest oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries. With a market capitalisation of Rs 6.72 lakh crore, TCS stock traded nearly 3 per cent up at Rs 3,506 early today.

During the last one year, Tata Group stocks have rallied up to 186 per cent, with Tinplate Company surging to Rs 248.55 on April 20 this year, from Rs 87 on the same day in 2017. Nalco, Titan Company, Tata Global and Voltas all rallied between 50 per cent and 125 per cent during the same period. 

Independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga said, “Chandra has managed TCS very well till date. We assume that other group of companies in his focus will also flourish in coming years.”

On the journey of TCS, former CFO, S Mahalingam, in a chat with ET Now said, “We were just about 25 people in 1970 and therefore, none of us imagined that we would ever see the landmark. We have created a whole bunch of technologies which can satisfy the state of the art requirements of anyone in the world and last of all, it is the leadership which started with Kohli pioneering it. It was Ramadorai who really scaled it up and Chandra who gave it an aggressive push, and now Rajesh really leading from the front along with N Ganapathy Subramaniam. I think there has been a phenomenal journey.”

Investors on Dalal Street are hoping for healthy returns from relative laggards such as Tata Motors, Tata Power, Tata Communications, Rallis India, Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra), TRF and Tayo Rolls.

Tata Motors declined 24 per cent during the past one year and 37 per cent in the last three years whereas Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) plunged 20 per cent and 31 per cent during the same periods. Other stocks such as Rallis India, Tata Power, Tata Coffee and Tayo Rolls also need a Midas touch from Chandra.

Tayo Rolls and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) have been reporting losses for many quarters now. For the December quarter, Tayo Rolls posted a net loss of Rs 7.84 crore while Tata Teleservices Maharashtra suffered a net loss of Rs 480.75 crore. Tata Power and Rallis India reported 7.17 per cent and 1.58 per cent year-on-year decline in net profit, respectively, in Q3 FY18. 

However, Tata Motors reported over 10-fold jump in quarterly profit in October-December, driven by higher sales from its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) business after a particularly weak quarter a year earlier. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal sees nearly 11 per cent annual rise in net profit in Q4 FY18 of Tata Motors. The brokerage firm has ‘Buy’ rating on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 528.

According to recent reports, Chandrasekaran has asked Tata Motors to create value for the group, especially from its domestic business, in line with his objective of making Tata group companies more accountable.

G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory, said, “The falling rupee along with the robust performance of TCS in terms of business supported the share price of the IT major. Seeing the share price movement of Tata Motors and Tata Steel, it is too early to comment on Chandrasekaran's leadership. Titan has inherited a growth story.”"

Here's a list of seven developments that may move the market in the coming week:


Next batch of earningsAmong notable names, ICICI Bank, Tata Chemicals and Tata Coffee are slated to announce January-March results on Monday, while ABB India and Jubilant FoodWorks will unveil their score cards on Tuesday. Eicher Motors and JSPL are scheduled to announce results on Wednesday.

Adani Enterprises, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Tata Communications, Titan Company, Union Bank of India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises will release their quarterly numbers on Thursday. Gillette India and Tata Global Beverages will announce January-March numbers on Friday.


Karnataka pollsThe Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections 2018 is scheduled to be held across the state on May 12. Results of the poll will be out on May 15. Leading parties, the ruling Congress and the BJP, have been campaigning aggressively in the state for the last few months to woo voters. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will be fighting against BJP's BS Yeddyurappa for the CM's post in the upcoming polls. Market will keenly follow the developments from the state.


US jobs dataUS job growth increased less-than-expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17.5-year low of 3.9 per cent, as some out-of-work Americans left the labour force, Reuters reported.

The report also showed wages barely rose last month, which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening. Financial markets across the globe, including India may react to it when trading resumes on Monday.


All eyes on US sanctions against IranOil prices rose about 2 per cent on Friday, with US crude hitting its highest in more than three years, as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported. On May 12, the US President Donald Trump will decide whether to extend waivers on economic sanctions against Iran. If it doesn’t, the global market could lose about one million barrels of oil a day, says a Market Watch report.

The sanctions on Iran were lifted under a 2015 agreement among a group of world powers, including the US and Iran, aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear activities.


Tech ViewThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a ‘Dark Cloud Cover’ pattern on daily chart, suggesting possible downside ahead. The pattern may have negative repercussions, which will be confirmed if the Nifty50 closes below the 10,600 level, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

However, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan has a bullish outlook on the index for the short term with a target 10,910 and reversal placed at 10,500. ""The short term trend will remain bullish as long as it does not close below 10,500. On the way up, 10,708 – 10,785 will be crucial resistance in the near term. The rise in the benchmark index can stretch towards 10,910, if it breaks the crucial resistance level of 10,785,"" Ratnaparkhi said.


Macro numbersThe government will release industrial production data for March on Friday. India's industrial output grew 7.1 per cent in February from a year earlier. This apart, the government will also unveil inflation data based on consumer price index (CPI) for April. Retail inflation stood at 4.28 per cent in March, slowing for the third straight month from a 17-month high, according to data released by the Central Statistics Office.


Global cuesThe big central banking event of next week is the Bank of England’s May 10 meeting, with market expectations overwhelmingly in favour of interest rates being held at the current 0.5 per cent. Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early April when investors priced a 90 per cent chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points, Reuters reported.

In addition, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting minutes will be unveiled on Monday, 7 May 2018."

33,2018-05-15,Titan,"CHENNAI: India will continue to be the fastest growing market for luxury writing instruments and accessories maker Montblanc, according to its chief executive, Nicolas Baretzki.

Despite challenges in locating premium real estate in tier 2 cities for expansion, Montblanc’s sales in smaller towns have been growing through its joint venture with Indian watchmaker Titan and new ecommerce channels, Baretzki said on the sidelines of a store launch in the city on Monday.

The German luxury maison has 10 boutiques in the country and plans to open five new stores every year for the next three years, Baretzki said.

“Boutiques in tier 2 and 3 cities, and the new network through the ecommerce platform will keep India at the top in terms of percentage growth,” Baretzki said. “It will definitely be much faster than any other mature market with large coverage where the growth is more on a like-for-like basis.”

Montblanc has been looking to tap into demand from the non-traditional and smaller markets with an eye to expand in cities like Kolkata and Chandigarh. However, Baretzki said that locating premium real estate has been a challenge. “In many cities in India, where we believe we could have a presence today, we can’t because malls at the standard of a luxury maison like Montblanc aren’t available,” he said.

However, despite this the company is seeing increased demand from smaller cities through its online sales channels, he said. “I believe the demand is there, which is also why a month ago we tied up with ecommerce platform Tata CliQ. We were surprised to notice that the majority of our sales were coming from cities where we don’t have a boutique,” Baretzki said.

After winning the international arbitration case last year that terminated Montblanc’s 20-year relationship with former Indian cricketer Dilip Doshi's Entrak International, Baretzki believes the joint venture with Titan Company (since 2014) has proved better for the brand's business in India, and for customer proximity in smaller cities.

Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities, said the market for brands like Montblanc in India is quite large as the penetration of luxury products has been quite small.

“The luxury market in China is quite large if you see. As India’s per capita income and aspiration levels go up, it’s going to be a reasonably high, but gradually growing market. That’s why Montblanc tied up with Titan, because earlier promoters weren’t able to deliver profitability. It’s a good business, but it is for the long haul,” Roy said.

Bhaskar Bhat, managing director of Titan, had earlier told reporters that the company estimates a turnover of up to Rs 600 crore from the joint venture by 2020."

41,2018-05-17,Titan,"Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala recently grilled the top management of Titan Company at a conference call following its March quarter earnings. 

The Tata Group firm reported 70.86 per cent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 304.41 crore for the quarter ended March 31 against Rs 178.16 crore posted for the same quarter of 2016-17.

Jhunjhunwala’s cumulative holdings in Titan in the name of Jhunjhunwala Rakesh Radheyshyam, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Jhunjhunwala Rekha Rakesh stood at 8.46 per cent as of March 31, 2018.

At a conference call post Q4 earnings, Jhunjhunwala sought clarity on bonus and gratuity that Titan gives to its employees.

“Is the bonus that you provide one-time? The gratuity to employees is one-time, I understand. Where is the dividend in respective businesses?” he asked.

The management representatives replied that the bonus is done one-time and it depends on performance and it is only a practice, not a policy.

“It is not part of the CTC. When we perform way above our own internal plans, this is something which is shared with the employees. From that perspective, it is a one-time for the quarter. It does not get amortised over the years. It is given at the end of the year,” the Titan top brass clarified.

During the quarter, the company made provisions for impairment for a Rs 75 crore investments it had made in Favre Leuba. It was triggered by slower-than-expected takeoff.

Jhunjhunwala further asked how much the company proposes to write off in the coming quarters.

“We do not expect to write off any further, but we have just been conservative in our accounting,” said Bhaskar Bhat, Managing Director, Titan. He said the company would continue to invest for five years.

Jhunjhunwala was also keen to know the company’s investment, writeoff and business plans. 

On investment plans, Bhat said the magnitude was of Rs 200 crore. “When we see the business model working, only then shall we take a decision to make larger investments,” Bhat said.

Out of the planned investment, the company has already invested Rs 145 crore. It will invest another Rs 55 crore and then take a decision whether to invest further or not.

Titan saw a drop in margin in the watch business to 8 per cent in Q4FY18 from 15.50 per cent in Q3FY18. The company clarified to Jhunjhunwala that this was because of exceptional thing because of a stockists.

“We took back stocks from RS, because we are consolidating them into other RS. We did not sell to them and, therefore, there was a drop in sales,” CFO S Subramaniam said.

51,2018-05-31,Titan,"Overseas portfolio investors, or FIIs, have been largely bearish on Indian equities so far in 2018. But there are a few companies FIIs would not desert no matter how bad the future outlook gets.

For last 40 quarters, FII holdings in nearly 100 companies from the BSE500 index have been hovering above their mean and median. No marks for guessing, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is the most favoured firm among them all. 

FIIs held 74 per cent stake in the country’s biggest mortgage lender as of March 2018 compared with the median and mean of 73.40 per cent and 69 per cent in last 40 quarters, data available with corporate database Ace Equity showed. Shares of HDFC have grown nearly 275 per cent in last 10 years.

HDFC reported strong growth in loan disbursement for March quarter as well as for FY18. Reliance Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,372.

Then there are a couple of private lenders FIIs seem to be backing steadfastly. They include HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and City Union Bank. At the end of March, 2018, FII holding in each one of these was higher than the median and mean holdings of past 10 years. 



“I would stick with HDFC Bank, because it has got the balance sheet strength to move into the corporate space and take up market share, which has been vacated by PSB banks,” Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities, told ETNow in an interaction.

Foreign portfolio investors have been rather cautious on Indian equities this year, having been net sellers in 32 out of 40 sessions till May 29; meaning they offloaded more shares than what they bought on all these days.

FIIs’ net outflow so far in 2018 has been Rs 640 crore against total net DII inflow of over Rs 48,000 crore. 

A shift in yield dynamics between the developing and developed world, weakness in emerging market currencies against the greenback, softer earnings growth, concern over corporate governance issues and political risks ahead of the general elections in 2019 are some of the factors that have kept FIIs jittery. 



Auto companies Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra and Mahindra, Eicher Motors also have pride of place on the list of FII favourites. Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied over 9,500 per cent in last 10 years, while those of Maruti Suzuki have jumped over 1,000 per cent in the same period. Global brokerage Credit Suisse is ‘neutral’ on Maruti Suzuki with a target price of Rs 9,800.

Jefferies recently upgraded its target price for M&M to Rs 975 from Rs 860 earlier. “Mahindra & Mahindra is among our preferred rural picks and FY19 growth outlook remains positive across tractors, LCVs and PVs,” the brokerage said.

FII holdings in pharma firms IPCA Laboratories, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Jubilant Life Sciences at the end of March quarter were nearly the same as the average and median of the previous 40 quarters.

Centrum Broking has maintained a ‘hold’ rating on Dr Reddy’s Labs with a target price of Rs 2,000 (earlier Rs 2,450). The stock traded at Rs 1,983 on May 29.

Several midcap stocks, many of which have been multibaggers in recent months, such as Astral Poly Technik, Page Industries, Kajaria Ceramics, Supreme Industries, Britannia Industries, Motherson Sumi System, Balkrishna Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, SRF, Shilpa Medicare, Phillips Carbon Black and Titan Company too figure on the list of top 100 FII favourite companies in India. Even in the most bearish times, these overseas investors have rarely sold shares on these counters.

Edelweiss Investment Research is positive on Phillips Carbon Black with a target price of Rs 328, indicating an upside of over 30 per cent from current level. 

Cholamandalam Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on Balkrishna Industries with a target price of Rs 1,327. Shares of Balkrishna Industries are up over 1,600 per cent in last 10 years.

FIIs are also looking confident on oil and gas majors Petronet LNG, Hindustan Petroleum, Gujarat State Petronet, IGL and Bharat Petroleum. At the end of March quarter, their stakes in these companies were higher than their mean and median holdings of last 10 years."

22,2018-06-08,Titan,"Smart investors, who spotted the trend early and shifted focus to largecaps in early 2018, have not only managed to protect their wealth in the recent carnage, but have made money too! Some have done it even in midcap and smallcap stocks, and how! 

Nifty Smallcap100 and Midcap100 indices are down up to 20 per cent this year, while the benchmark Nifty50 is still holding its head above water. 

A couple of largecaps drew investors’ attention this year, with IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surpassing the $100 billion market capitalisation in April, and stocks like HUL, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints scaling fresh all-time highs over the past one month. The Infosys stock is hovering around its highest level in two years. 

The theme is pretty clear: it’s a year for fundamentally strong businesses and those that have been trying to tap demand revival.

Most analysts are bullish on the largecaps despite the depression in the broader market in recent times. They are advising investors to add some stocks from this segment to protect their portfolios against volatility ahead of the general elections in 2019.

There are expectations that the largecaps may provide some cushion to investor portfolios as their valuations are lower compared with those of midcaps and smallcaps.

As many as 21 stocks from the Nifty pack were trading in the green so far this year, with Tech Mahindra up 37.50 per cent till June 6, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 31.58 per cent), Tata Consultancy Services (up 30.46 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 25.21 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 22.78 per cent), Infosys (up 19.73 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 18.23 per cent).

The 50-share index moved from 10,435 on January 1 this year to trade at 10,684 on June 6. 

Largecaps look attractive compared with midcaps and smallcaps at this point of time, Sankaran Naren, Executive Director, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, told ETNow in an interview.

Brokerage Sharekhan prefers HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS. HCL Tech has advanced over 3 per cent on a year-to-date basis. Managements of most IT companies have indicated that CY2018 would be better year compared with the previous one, thanks to some large deal wins, improving macro environment in key geographies, demand in certain industry pockets, emerging demand in digital, higher outsourcing demand from European clients and benefits of a weaker rupee.

Shares of HUL, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints and HDFC have gained between 10 per cent and 17 per cent in this period.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse has a ‘buy’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,750. Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target of Rs 2,251.

“Largecap valuations are far more reasonable than the second-rung stocks. Select largecap companies with rich valuations are also among the top picks right now when it comes to future growth visibility,” said Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director, Ladderup Wealth Management.

Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says the margin of safety is better in largecap names than in midcaps and smallcaps.

“There is certainty in terms of how the numbers will pan out,” he said.

More than 70 stocks from Nifty Midcap100 index gave negative returns to investors in 2018. Vakrangee, PC Jeweller, Adani Power and Suzlon Energy have plunged up to 93 per cent.

On the other hand, select midcap names like Mindtree, Indiabulls Ventures, Jubilant FoodWorks, Mphasis and Gruh Finance have risen up to 67 per cent in the same period. Gruh Finance hit an all-time high of Rs 381 on June 7.

There are takers for quality in any market. “I think it is time to buy into some of the quality companies in the midcap space, where the comfort level is on the higher side. Forget the index, this correction is a welcome opportunity for investors,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Smallcap stocks like Gitanjali Gems, Diamond Power, Bombay Rayon and Electrosteel Steels have slipped up to 91 per cent. 

There are specific pockets in the midcap and the smallcap segments, which are qualitative in nature, and earnings growth in this space can still be far better over the next two years, said Joshi of Angel Broking.

Coal India, YES Bank, L&T, Titan Company, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, ITC, Power Grid and Eicher Motors are other largecap stocks, which have been trading in the green so far in 2018.

On the other hand, shares of Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, HPCL, Vedanta, Bharti Infratel, BPCL, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Wipro are down up to 30 per cent between January 1 and June 6."

49,2018-06-29,Titan,"NEW DELHI: What made ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala cut his stake in Titan Company, the biggest holding in his portfolio? 

A regulatory filing on Thursday showed the ace investor sold 1.25 crore shares, or 1.4 per cent stake, in the jeweller during May and June.

The ace investor saw his holding in Titan drop to 6.54 crore shares, or 7.37 per cent stake, from 7.79 crore shares, or 8.78 per cent stake, as of May 21, 2018. 


High valuations, profit booking? 
Ever since the Jhunjhunwalas first invested in the stock ( in 2002), the company’s market value has swelled over 300 times. The combined holdings of the ace investor and his wife, Rekha Jhunjhunwala, in the company remained in the 8-10 per cent range all through these years. This time it has slipped below 8 per cent. 

Titan is a growth stock and has historically enjoyed high PE multiples. The scrip has risen 65 per cent in last one year but its recent performance has been anything but spectacular.

Data showed PE multiple expansion contributed nearly 63 per cent of return that the stock generated all this while; the contribution of earnings was merely 37 per cent.



But given the strong earnings expansion the company is projected to report over the coming years, analysts are not too much worried above valuation.

Out of 31 analysts tracking the stock, 14 have ‘outperform’ and eight others have ‘buy’ ratings, Reuters data suggests. Titan will continue to command punchy valuations and, hence, current PE of 44 times FY20E EPS is inexpensive, Ambit Capital said in a note.


In the fourth quarter, the company's jewellery segment growth was healthy even on top of last year’s high base. The management has guided for 25 per cent growth in FY19 despite a strong base of 25 per cent growth in the jewellery segment in FY18. The company also offers eyewear and watches.
What stood out about the results was outperformance on margins, the guidance and the jewellery segment growth projection for FY19, Motilal Oswal Securities said.

""The management’s confidence on margin has increased remarkably over the past one year, moving from talk about sacrificing margins for high growth last year to talking about sacrificing margin growth in quest for growth toward the middle of FY18 and finally stating that if high growth sustains, margins will improve,” the brokerage said in a recent note. 

In late February this year, Jhunjhunwala for the first time sounded a little iffy about the stock.

In an interview with ETNOW, he said he does not have any advice to anybody on Titan. Asked whether Titan was benefitting from the formalisation of the economy, he said: “Time will tell. It is very difficult to predict.”


Jhunjhunwala & Titan management
During the March quarter investor meet, Jhunjhunwala grilled the Titan management, arguing that margins were going up because Titan does not report the amount of jewellery it purchases from or exchanges with customers.

“So you get margin and believe in what you buy also takes up your overall margin. Am I right? Suppose I come to exchange jewellery, I give you gold ornaments and buy jewellery. The company gets two margins. One is, of course, in the sale, and the other on what you purchase,” he said.

CK Venkataraman, CEO of Titan’s jewellery division, said the company had changed its policy to make exchange more attractive and it does not make any profit on these transactions. “We make a loss,” he said.

During the quarter, the company made impairment provisions for a Rs 75 crore investment it had made in Favre Leuba due to slower-than-expected takeoff. Jhunjhunwala was concerned.
“Your belief is, it will make money?” he asked at the investor meet. Managing Director Bhaskar Bhat answered in affirmative, but said the investment will take at least five years before it starts making money.

""You can keep on investing and writing off. But we have some right to ask you, because you have written off Rs 75 crore. How much do you intend to invest and what business plan do you have?,” Jhunjhunwala asked.

The Big Bull later said the impairment was absolutely right, but as an investor he wanted to know how much more investments will be made going ahead and how much writeoffs it proposes in the coming quarters. 

“We do not expect to write off any further, but we have just been conservative in our accounting,” Bhat said. He said the company would continue to invest for next five years. 


Charity?
In 2016, the Big Bull announced plans to donate Rs 5,000 crore, or 25 per cent of his total wealth – whichever is lower – to philanthropy when he turns 60 on July 5, 2020. 

While only Jhunjhunwala knows the exact reason for this trimming of holding in Titan, analysts say one must do own research before taking any decision on whether to enter or exit the stock. Mimicking investment strategies of big investors do not always work, they said."

on Friday to cut its weekly losses to 7 per cent.

5,2018-07-03,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Monday spelt misery for equity investors on Dalal Street. A falling rupee and continuing trade war tensions robbed them of risk-taking appetite and sent the stock market crashing.

At close, the S&P BSE Sensex stood at 35,264, down 159 points, while NSE’s Nifty50 took a 57-point tumble to close at 10,657. 

But some 51 stocks stood apart and an important trend-spotting indicator signalled that they may show an uptrend in the coming sessions.

Stocks like Tata Steel, Titan, Kolte-Patil, Graphite India, GM Breweries, JMC Projects and Godrej Industries showed bullish crossovers on the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, charts.

Some of these counters have been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Some other stocks such as Genus Paper & Boards, Kothari Petroche, Arshiya, HEG, Allsec Technologies, Hindusthan National Glass and JMT Auto showed bullish crossovers on the MACD chart, signalling an imminent downturn.



MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa.

The MACD alone may not be sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also signalled bearish crossovers for 40 stocks on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. They included Dewan Housing, Sun Pharma, Granules India, Lupin, SJVN, Rolta India, 8K Miles Software, Can Fin Homes and Uniply Industries.



The Nifty50 index on Monday formed a candle similar to the ‘Dark Cloud’ pattern on the daily chart. Even as the session saw buying at lows, the 50-pack may need to move above the 10,740 level in the short term to instil confidence among traders, experts said. 

As long as the index holds below 10,660, it could slip towards 10,600 and 10,550 levels. On the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,700 and 10,770 levels, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the chart of Titan Company shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa. 

Shares of the company closed 2.15 per cent higher at Rs 897.40 on July 3."

7,2018-07-04,Titan,"NEW DELHI: The much-awaited verdict of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on the Tata-Mistry battle later today might set a landmark precedent for corporate feuds, but the Tata businesses have since taken it all in their stride and moved on.

Total market capitalisation of 26 listed Tata companies has risen 30 per cent to Rs 10.86 lakh crore, from Rs 8.34 lakh crore on October 24, 2016, with TCS alone contributing 54 per cent of this rise.

Data compiled from corporate database Ace Equity show that major group firms such as TCS (up 54 per cent), Titan Company (up 153 per cent) and Tata Steel (up 39 per cent) have outperformed the benchmark indices during this period while others like Tata Motors, Tata Power and Tata Communications have slid up to 51 per cent.

Some 13 other group company stocks have underperformed the Sensex’s 25 per cent rise during the same period. 



Justices BSV Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy of the Mumbai bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) will pronounce the verdict in the matter later on Wednesday.

The case relates to two-year-old feud between Tata Sons and Cyrus Mistry, who was axed as Tata Sons chairman on October 24, 2016.

Market analysts and observers say the Tata Group did not see any turnaround under Mistry, as was widely expected, and except for TCS and to some extent Tata Motors, almost all other businesses of the conglomerate, including Tata Steel, actually went downhill under him.

The Mistry camp claims that Cyrus' removal as chairman and subsequently as director on the board Tata Sons was the result of oppression by the promoters, led by Tata Trusts, ET reported. The trust owns over 68 per cent in Tata Sons. The Mistry family owns 18.6 per cent stake in Tata Sons, but has only 4 per cent voting rights.

		}Tata-Mistry fight: The D-day is here of 14NextPrevPlay SlideshowThe final chapter?4 Jul, 2018It's judgement day for Cyrus Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons. The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal is slated to pronounce its verdict on the much publicised Tata-Mistry battle later today. Whichever way the verdict goes, one thing is clear. It will set a precedent on corporate feuds, particularly for promoter-led firms.NextWhat started the fire?4 Jul, 2018His dismissal as the chairman of the Tata Sons on October 24, 2016, has set off this chain of events. Mistry on his part has a host of allegations. He has also termed the changes to the articles of association since his dismissal from office as ""arbitrary"".NextFiring a salvo4 Jul, 2018Mistry sees his removal as the chairman and subsequently director of the board as a result of oppression by the promoters, who are in turn owned by Tata Trusts that owns over 68 per cent in Tata Sons.NextUpping the ante4 Jul, 2018Mistry's Cyrus Investments, the key investment vehicle of the Mistry family and the key petitioner, shot off a letter to the Directors of Tata Sons on June 30. He has demanded accountability and information from the board of Tata Sons, in which his family owns 18.34 per cent.NextWhat are his other complaints?4 Jul, 2018He has questioned the free sale of Tata telecom arm to Bharti Airtel. He terms it as a “sweetheart deal” which has led to an increase in market capitalisation of Airtel by almost Rs 30,000 crore.
Mistry also wants to know the logic behind massive debt-driven acquisitions by Tata Steel and its unequal tie-up with Thyssenkrupp, and a first-ever dip in the Tata Consultancy Services profit, among others.Next
Mistry also raised concerns over alleged mismanagement by Tata Sons board and Ratan Tata, which he claimed caused loss of revenue to the group. 

Market veteran Deven Choksey of KRChoksey last week told ETNow that the Tatas would probably like to make TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel stronger than what they are currently.

""In the case of TCS, in particular, the possibilities hereafter could be that they may try to create digital platform-based services for some of the verticals. They are extremely strong in BFSI, strong in healthcare and telecom and I think if they adopt the vertical-based software and service approach, they start growing further. I would think TCS would possibly lead wealth creation over time, if not over the next 12 months,” he added. 

This April, TCS became India’s first company to enter the $100 billion club in market capitalisation. Under new Group Chairman N Chandrasekaran, TCS has seen ""enormous"" growth over the years. In a message to shareholders, he told ETNow in April, “TCS will continue to prosper.” 

Analysts currently find Tata Motors attractive, purely based on valuations. The carmaker’s domestic market portfolio has started doing better again after a long bad spell, Choksey said.

Tata Steel is expected to get a thrust from India's infrastructure-related growth and its recent acquisition of Bhushan Steel, which could ensure higher profits for the company going forward, Choksey told ETNow last week."

37,2018-07-16,Titan,"If you have a strong conviction on a stock but are worried about the gestation period, investing may not be your cup of tea. Maybe, you should trade!

Some 10 stocks from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) took 20 years for gestation, but have delivered up to 2,619 times return in this period. They were penny stocks back then; five are part of the elite Nifty50 club today. They are Eicher Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UPL, Lupin and Titan Company.

Others which made their investors millionaires included Bajaj Finance, Shree Cement, Gruh Finance, JSW Steel and Ashiana Housing.

No, it has not been a steep climb for any of them. UPL, Titan, and JSW Steel tested investors’ nerves for several quarters or even years before they took off. 

That’s what you face on the path to richness. 

Ian Cassel, a well-known microcap investor, said in a recent tweet: “Every multibagger will have long periods (even years) of stagnation, as fundamentals backfill, old shareholders get bored, and new shareholders enter.”

So how long is it, really?

UPL remained in the Rs 3-8 range all through 1998-2003; Titan traded in the Rs 2-4 range around the same time. The former is at Rs 637, today and latter at Rs 832.

Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied 2,61,772 per cent from Rs 10.70 on July 12 in 1998 to Rs 28,020 on July 12, 2018. The company has no debt on its books and continues to redeploy cash for further expansion and product innovation.

Data available with Ace Equity showed Eicher’s net profit swelled to Rs 1,712.90 crore for the year ended March 2018 from Rs 23.50 crore reported for FY01. Net sales soared over 20 times during this period. 

An investment of Rs 55,000 in Eicher Motors shares in 1998 would have become over Rs 14 crore today. 

Kotak Mahindra Bank is the second biggest gainer on the list, up 1,29,337 per cent from Rs 1.10 in July 1998 to Rs 1,394 at last Friday’s close. Net profit of the lender multiplied over 50 times to Rs 4,084.30 crore for the year ended FY18. In comparison, shares of HDFC Bank rallied 16,022 per cent from Rs 13.40 to Rs 2165 in the same period.

Brokerage Sharekhan says Kotak Mahindra Bank is among a handful of banks that have been able to maintain strong asset quality in sharp contrast to most banking peers that have become fraught with challenges. Kotak Bank is well positioned to capture incremental market share in the advances market.

“With PSU banks hobbled with non-performing assets (NPA) and capital-related issues, private banks (such as Kotak Bank) have a great opportunity to grab market share and gain access to attractive clientele,” the brokerage said in a report.

UPL has multiplied investor wealth by 647 times in last 20 years. The scrip jumped from Rs 0.90 on July 13, 1998 to Rs 582.70 on July 12, 2018. Net sales and net profit have soared manifold in the same period.

UPL is engaged in the crop protection business, comprising agrochemicals, industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and specialty chemicals.

HDFC Securities in an April report said UPL’s long-term prospects remained positive led by its focus on branding and launch of innovative products, maintaining geographical presence and catering to major crops.

It has increased its share in the global agrochemical market (4 per cent in CY16 against 3 per cent in CY14), and improving Innovation Turnover Index, which rose to 19 per cent in FY18 from 15 per cent in FY17. The company has been investing consistently in backward as well as forward integration, resulting in better cost management.

Shares of pharma major Lupin have rallied 46,370 per cent to Rs 885.30 from Rs 1.90 on July 13, 1998, while Titan has soared 35,415 per cent to Rs 808.90 from Rs 2.30 during the same period. 

Lupin’s profit has jumped from just Rs 2.90 crore in FY2000 to Rs 1,344 for the financial year ended March 2018. It is the market leader in 51 out of the 158 products it sells in the US generic market. As many as 109 of its products feature among the top three in the US generic market.

Lupin plans to launch around 30 new products in the US during FY19. With 163 ANDAs pending approval by USFDA, Lupin is poised for good growth, according to Centrum Broking. The management has guided an EBIDTA margin of 19-21 per cent and single digit decline in revenues for US generic business in FY19.

Titan’s bottomline has soared to over Rs 1,150 crore in FY18 from Rs 25 crore in FY05, while top line has grown 15 times.

The previous financial year turned out to be a robust one for the company, with the jewellery division delivering healthy expansion in bottomline and topline. Revenues for the jewellery division grew 25 per cent YoY to Rs 13,257 crore.

Recent regulatory changes such as demonetisation and GST have led to market share gains for the company, while its enhanced focus on wedding and high value studded jewellery and favourable gold exchange policy has also helped grow topline. The management remains upbeat on the growth outlook for the jewellery division with plans to grow revenues at a compounding rate of 20 per cent till FY23. 

The size of India’s jewellery industry is pegged at Rs 2,50,000 crore, of which Titan’s Tanishq brand has just 5 per cent market share. This provides immense opportunity to enhance market share, going forward."

Key indices Sensex and Nifty were down, tracking weak Asian cues. Investors were cautious after an official data showed that China's economy slowed a little in the second quarter. 

Weak domestic macroeconomic indicators too hit the sentiment. India's trade deficit widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee.

Going ahead, it's going to be a policy week as many major central banks are going to declare their monetary policy. 

Here’s an in-depth look at these and other factors that are likely to steer market this week - 


RBI's rate-setting meetingThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to meet during July 30 to August 1 for the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2018-2019. The six-member monetary policy committee of the central bank headed by Governor Urjit Patel in June meet bit the bullet and hiked the repo rate – the short-term lending rate – by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent.

Speculations are rife that the bank will hike interest rates for second time on Wednesday as inflation risks mount. 


Next batch of quarterly earningsCorporate earnings will continue to dominate the Street's proceedings in the coming week. Among notable names, Axis Bank, HDFC, Idea Cellular, Tech Mahindra, IDFC and Shree Cement are slated to declare their June quarter results on Monday. Bank of India, Dabur India, Power Grid Corporation of India, Tata Motors and Vedanta will announce theirs on Tuesday. Indiabulls Housing Finance and Marico are expected to unveil their report cards on Thursday. Nestle India and Titan Company will declare theirs on Friday.


US Fed meetUS Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed had hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter percentage point in June and indicated that two more increases are likely this year. The move pushed the funds rate target to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.


BoJ and BoEBank of Japan (BoJ) will unveil its interest rate decision on Tuesday. According to a report by Reuters, it might be doing some ‘jinarashi’ i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. BoJ had left its key short-term interest rate unchanged at -0.1 per cent at its June 2018 meeting.

This apart, Bank of England (BoE) will declare its interest rate decision on Thursday. Governor Mark Carney is looking to throw off his “unreliable boyfriend” tag and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 per cent, reports Reuters. BoE left its key bank rate on hold at 0.5 per cent on 21 June 2018.


Auto stocks in focusAutomakers will start releasing their sales numbers for July from Wednesday. Auto firms including cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, reported a higher double-digit growth in sales in June. Auto major Maruti Suzuki India posted a robust growth of 44 per cent in the domestic sales with 1.34 lakh units in June as compared with 93,057 units the same period last fiscal.


TCNS Clothing listingShares of TCNS Clothing will get listed on BSE and NSE on Monday. The initial public offer (IPO) of the women's apparel maker was subscribed 5.27 times during its IPO. The Rs 1,125 crore public offer received bids for 5,79,79,780 shares against the total issue size of 1,09,99,828.


What tech chart sayThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a bullish candle similar to the 'Bullish Marubozu' pattern on the daily and weekly scales. Friday's opening gap remains unfilled, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. “A long bull on the daily time frame chart and a similar candle on the weekly chart indicate strength in the upward move. The weekly momentum oscillator is signalling strengthening of the upside momentum in the Nifty50,” the expert said.

27,2018-08-10,Titan,"Prabhudas Lilladher has a buy call on Titan Company with a target price of Rs 1,114.

The current market price of Titan Company is Rs 920.50.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Titan Company price can reach the defined target.


Prabhudas Lilladher's view on the company:
Titan reported strong profit growth of 26 per cent despite significant disappointment in jewellery volumes as a better mix in jewellery, higher sales and margins in watches and income of surplus funds boosted profits. 

TTAN has given cautiously optimistic outlook with 25 per cent jewellery sales growth for the balance of FY19 led by strong 70 per cent surge in July, upcoming festival season, the success of new collections like Gulnaaz and Lavanayam, benefits of a sustained increase in stores across Tanishq, Mia and Caratlane. 

We expect Tanishq to achieve 22.2 per cent sales and 26.3 per cent EBIDTA CAGR over FY18-20 as growing store network, focus on high value studded and wedding jewellery will enable 80 bps expansion in margins. Watch business is likely to report improved growth (21 per cent GST adjusted sales growth) but 1Q margins of 18.8 per cent seem unsustainable due to skewed sales mix in favour of Titan brand and activation in 1Q. 

Eyewear business remains in investment and customer acquisition mode, significant profitability improvement looks unlikely. We estimate 26.7 per cent PAT CAGR over FY18-FY20. 

We value the stock at 45xSept20 EPS and arrive at a target price of Rs1114. Retain Buy."

28,2018-08-13,Titan,"Growth in revenues, operating profits and net earnings is integral to fundamentally strong companies. 

Revenue growth indicates strong demand for a company’s products and the pricing power it commands in the market. Growth in operating profits (excluding other income) indicates cost efficiencies through expenditure control. Improvement in net earnings or profits is an indicator of wealth creation for shareholders.

To identify robust stocks, these financial parameters need to be evaluated over an extended period of time.

Financial experts advise investors to hold stocks for long enough—around five years—to allow their prices to align with their intrinsic or fair values. This is because in the long run, the fair value of a stock is largely a factor of its fundamental metrics—profits and cash flows.

We analysed 294 stocks of the BSE500 index that have declared their profit and loss accounts and balance sheets for 2017-18.

The study was aimed at finding companies that have shown the highest growth in revenue, operating profits and adjusted EPS in 2017-18 compared to the past five financial years, starting 2013-14. After applying the filters we were left with just six companies.

These companies not only delivered a strong performance on the parameters listed above but also scored well in terms of their historical share price performance.

In the last one year, the average return of these six companies was 102%—BSE Sensex generated 16.6%. In the past five years, their average point-to-point return was 752%—the BSE Sensex returned 101%.

These companies also paid regular dividends and their net worth was the highest in 2017-18 compared to the past five years.

Net worth is the difference between a company’s total assets and total liabilities. Increased net worth shows that the business is doing well. 


These stocks could be your best bets
The average absolute return of these stocks over the past five years has been 752%

Let us look at these six companies:


1. GRAPHITE INDIA: The company develops, manufactures and markets graphite electrodes, pipes and tanks, impervious graphite equipment and related components. Its results for 2017-18 and first quarter of 2018-19 were better than expected. According to a report by ICICI Direct, decline in graphite electrode exports from China has tilted the demand-supply dynamics in favour of domestic players such as Graphite India. The company is likely to maintain healthy profitability going forward as prices of graphite electrodes are expected to remain high due to supply constraints amid strong demand.


2. MEGHMANI ORGANICS: It manufacturers pigment and pesticides. According to a report by Stewart & Mackertich, the company’s plan to enter different product categories will prove beneficial as it has an existing customer base and an available network. In addition, its agro-chemicals division will continue to deliver good results due to the benefits of backward integration.


3. NAVA BHARAT VENTURES: It’s a diversified company engaged in power generation, operation and maintenance services, ferro alloys, mining, agri-business and health care services. According to a report by Firstcall Research, increasing power demand due to the government’s focus on power for all will be a significant growth driver. 

Also, supply constraints will force sugar prices to remain high, helping the company’s sugar segment. Nava Bharat reported 69.3% and 356% jump in net revenue and operating profits respectively in 2017-18.


4. SOBHA: A real estate company, Sobha is primarily engaged in residential and contractual projects. Its results for 2017-18 were 7% above the Bloomberg consensus estimates. 

According to a report by SBICAP Securities, the company is among the very few developers with a consistent quarterly sales record since demonetisation happened. The pace of the sales is encouraging as it indicates market share gains in Bengaluru and Gurgaon, where overall sales have declined in the past few quarters. It reported robust growth in residential sales booking of 18% year on year in the first quarter of 2018-19.


5. TITAN COMPANY: This lifestyle goods company is present in 32 countries. Its business segments include jewellery, accessories, and eyewear. Titan’s results for 2017-18 and the first quarter of 2018-19 beat analysts’ estimates. According to a research report by Dolat Capital, growth in jewellery category will continue due to new store additions and customer acquisitions. In addition, changing trend of buying jewellery for fashion instead of investment will be beneficial for the company.


6. ZYDUS WELLNESS: The company is engaged in the development, production, marketing and distribution of health and wellness products. Its 2017-18, annual numbers were 5% above Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a report by Anand Rathi, the company’s revenue growth will continue to improve due to innovations, expansion in international markets, focused distribution expansion and greater investment in brand-building."

34,2018-08-20,Titan,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had to endure a volley of headwinds last week. A plunging currency, weak global cues in the wake of a lingering trade war and subdued macro indicators turned investors indecisive. India’s trade deficit soared to a near five-year high in July. 

The rupee last week plunged to a record low of 70.32 against the US dollar, mainly on account of global currency market turmoil emanating from Turkey, which infused weakness in other emerging market currencies as well.

On top of it, worries about the health of the Chinese economy spooked most equity markets, triggering a rush to safe-haven assets, including the US dollar.

Despite all the negative development, domestic equity indices inched up last week. Nifty rose 0.36 per cent for the week, while the Sensex clocked a small gain of 0.20 per cent.

Two major factors helped the market move up; first, hope of an end to the trade tensions after the US and China agreed to hold fresh talks on trade-related issues, and secondly, weakness in the rupee proved to be manna from heaven for export-oriented sectors, such as IT and pharma. 

This coming week is going to be a truncated one and analysts expect the market to swing to the tune of global cues. While the indices have already climbed to record peaks, analysts see stock-specific opportunities all over.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, we picked 10 stock ideas that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 11-21 sessions.

Bajaj Auto | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,827 | Stop loss: Rs 2,590
This scrip appears to have registered a double bottom around Rs 2,605 level after the recent big fall from the highs of Rs 3,195 level. On last Thursday, when the equity market was reeling under selling pressure, this counter clocked decent gains, suggesting some sort of accumulation at lower levels. Hence on recovery, a minimum retracement will take this counter towards the Rs 2,830 mark. As risk-reward ratios will be favourable, positional traders should buy into this counter.


BEML | Buy | Target price: Rs 903 | Stop loss: Rs 790
After retracing around 62 per cent from its last leg of a rally from the lows of Rs 737–935, this counter appears to be bottoming out as it registered a higher bottom with three consecutive positive closes around the Rs 790 level. If a fresh leg of up move is in progress from the recent low of Rs 737, then eventually it should lead to the test of its recent high placed at Rs 935. 


State Bank of India | Buy | Target price: Rs 327 | Stop loss: Rs 290
After retracing around 50 per cent of its last leg of a rally from the lows of Rs 250–327, this counter appears to have resumed its upswing. As uptrend is intact in this counter with series of higher tops and higher bottom kind of formations, it should eventually head to test its previous swing high of Rs 327.

The current market price of Titan Company is Rs 915.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Titan Company price can reach the defined target.


View of Edelweiss on the company:
Titan’s jewellery division was soft in Q1FY19 on expected lines. However, July started with a bang—comparable sales growth of 40 per cent plus—and management is confident of clocking 25 per cent plus YoY growth over balance 9 months.

The Skinn (perfumes) business is doing well and Titan is targeting doubling of sales led by the entry in new categories (body mist) and expansion of distribution reach. Entry in the saree business via Taneira with 2 pilot stores in Bengaluru has exceeded Titan’s expectations; planning to test waters in Mumbai and Delhi.

In watches, new launches with smart features—Fastrack Reflex (smart band)—are on the anvil. Focus on the eyewear division will be on adding new customers and the company is on target to achieve 25 per cent growth in FY19.

We believe Titan has the ability to create significant value with its large distribution presence, strong brand, designing skills and proven execution track record. Witha robust balance sheet, strong brand equity and professional management team in place we remain bullish on Titan.


Risks: Gold price volatility, regulatory hurdles and seasonality in business."

So, the 37-year-old started off on an ambitious initiative from Hosur on Wednesday — to skate 6,000 km along the Golden Quadrilateral network in 90 days. Through the effort, he hopes to raise awareness and funds to educate at least 25,000 schoolgirls and create awareness among lakhs of children about personal safety, good and bad touch.

“I will skate for about 75 km per day. The aim is to merge resources with the cause and raise money to educate 25,000 girls through online and offline channels. The CSR partner has pegged this cost at Rs 3,600 per child,” said Uppalapati. The skater has collaborated with the CSR wing of Titan Company and the proceeds will be directed towards the organisation’s Titan Kanya initiative, executed through associations with nonprofits Nanhi Kali and IIMPACT.

The initiative, called ‘Educate to Carry Her Onwards (ECHO)’, is also linked to the nonprofit CIIYoung Indian, who will organise 6,000 workshops and sessions over 90 days with children, parents, teachers and other stakeholders to create awareness about ‘good touch, bad touch’.

“While 25,000 children will be impacted directly, we hope to reach many more through the awareness created by this specific programme”, said Bhaskar Bhat, MD, Titan Company. The initiative aims to reach over six lakh stakeholders and people within and outside the Titan ecosystem."

At Friday’s closing price, the 7.09 per cent stake that the ace investor and his better half Rekha Jhunjhunwala held in this jewellery company as of June 30 was worth just over Rs 5,000 crore.

But this time, the company and the jewellery industry are staring at disruption. The government is planning to come out with measures to curb import of ‘non-essential commodities’, which could also include gold.

The government’s plan reminds investors of 2013 when a gradual increase in customs duty on gold to 10 per cent from 2 per cent had sent jewellery stocks tumbling.

Here’s a chart showing what happened to the Titan Company stock between 2013 and 2015.

There have been wide concerns that a rise in crude oil prices would shoot up the government’s import bill and hurt current account deficit (CAD). Gold imports are non-essential and may come up on the government’s radar. Analysts say the situation is not as grave as in 2013, but the stock may take a beating in the short term.

Data showed India imported 955.16 tonnes of gold in FY18, up 22.43 per cent over 780.14 tonnes in FY17.

“Even if the government does not take specific action to curb gold imports in the near term, the overhang would still remain as actions could be staggered,” said CLSA, which has cut the Titan’s rating to ‘sell’ from ‘outperform’. 

Titan’s better competitive position and gold exchange plans are safeguards, the brokerage said, but the risk is from its premium valuation. 

“Despite being better placed than the previous cycle, we are worried of the impact of a potential hawkish stance on gold regulations, which could weigh on Titan’s premium valuation. Titan missed its jewellery growth guidance in Q1 of FY19, but retained its 25 per cent guidance for FY19,” CLSA said.

History suggests any curbs on gold imports works well for easing deficit. Gold imports fell to $39 billion in 2013 and $31 billion in 2014 from $53-54 billion in 2011-12.

“Imports fell below $1 billion a month for 3-4 months after the restrictions were first imposed, partly due to a hike in customs duty on gold imports. There were only four instances in the past 90 months when India’s gold imports were less than $1 billion per month. The run-rate for the current year stands at $33 billion (based on January-August data),” JM Financial said in a note.

What happened to Titan then?

JM Financial noted that Titan’s front-end operations emerged unscathed from all of RBI’s flip-flops in 2013. Growth slowed down in FY14, but it had more to do with weakening consumer sentiment than gold availability per se.

Analysts noted that Titan was able to source the gold it needed and also completely hedge its price exposure – initially on MCX and then on international exchanges.

“Its balance sheet, however, bloated severely due to non-availability of credit for gold imports. ROIC fell from 73 per cent in FY13 to 30 per cent in FY14, as invested capital rose 2.5 times due to a four-times increase necessitated in working capital following the ban of gold on lease,” JM Financial said.

Titan has ramped up the percentage of gold sourced through customer-exchange programme to 40-45 per cent from 15-20 per cent in 2013.

 “We expect Titan shares to remain volatile, and mostly weak. We do not expect RBI or the government to create disruptions of the kind they did in 2013, which in hindsight did no material damage to Titan’s business model, but did severely impact stock performance in the interim. Any sharp fall in stock price should be used as a buying opportunity,” said JM Financial.

This brokerage said Titan’s intrinsic value would be impacted if and only if RBI’s restrictions stay on for perpetuity; a temporary restriction for a year or two would not impact the intrinsic worth of the business."

58,2018-09-27,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Titan Company gained more than 3 per cent on Thursday as the government did not raise import duty on gold from the existing 10 per cent, contrary to speculations. 

The government has instead raised import duty to 20 per cent from 15 per cent on jewellery and to 7.5 per cent from 5 per cent on cut and polished diamonds, which is unlikely to affect the company. 

The stock jumped 3.27 per cent to hit a high of Rs 838.75 on the BSE early today. 

Bhaskar Bhat, MD, Titan, said: ""Large part of its imports is gold, where the import duty has not been touched. It is a wise move by the government as it will garner more taxes, given the weak CAD position. As of now, the marginal increase in import duty is not going to affect the industry much.”

In terms of total value to the entire business, this is not such a significant part of Titan’s business at least. A large part of the Indian jewellery sale is plain gold jewellery, which is nearly 85 per cent of total sales. Diamond and studded sales account for 15-20 per cent. Though there is a cost increase, it will be paid by the consumer, Bhat told ETNow.

Bhat does not see a significant dent on consumer pocket. “Consumers have paid much higher prices for gold in the past when gold prices surged. I think festival season sale is safe and it is going to be a good festival,” he said."

Nifty Tata group, an index tracking Tata group stocks on a full market capitalisation basis (and not on free-float basis) stood almost flat at 6,870.36 on Wednesday against 6,868.30 as of August 29.

The group managed to restrict losses, even as 99 per cent of its listed shares tumbled up to 36 per cent in last 24 sessions, thanks to a fall in the rupee, which aided the shares of TCS, the most valuable stock on BSE.

TCS alone commands over 70 per cent of group’s market capitalisation. (See table)

Analysts noted that the 4.5 per cent slide in the rupee during September quarter may alone aid top five IT firms’ margins by up to 110 basis points on a QoQ basis.

On the revenue front too, TCS is expected to lead the IT pack.

The technical indicator signalled upward crossover, which is a bullish signal, for at least 15 stocks, hinting at possible upsides for these stocks.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Among the stocks that signalled such bullishness are Titan Company, Talwalkars Better Value Fitness, Bhansali Engineering Polymers, Aster DM Healthcare and Gujarat Pipavav Port.

Others included Viceroy Hotels, Tijaria Polypipes, Morarjee Textiles, Take Solutions and Gokul Agro Resources.



The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Among the stocks that witnessed this bearishness were metals majors Vedanta and Hindalco Industries, natural gas transmission company Gujarat State Petronet, maker of defence products Astra Microwave and AC generator TD Power Systems.

Others included Cyient, Vikas Ecotech, Indian Terrain and Kilitch Drugs.



That said, the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ call using a single valuation ratio.

Market veterans say the MACD alone may not be good enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

On Nifty50, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan, said the impulse structure looks incomplete on the way down on the daily chart. Thus, any bounce is likely to be a shallow one. 

The Nifty50 is on the verge of seeing a bounce from the lows, but the sustainability of the upmove is doubtful, said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. 

Shetti said the 10,500-550 zone is going to be a strong overhead resistance for the index. The Nifty50 has completed an impulse on the hourly chart.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in, meanwhile, said the intraday recovery appeared to be on the strength of a few largecap stocks, which attracted value buying at lower levels. 

“Going forward, pullbacks shall remain vulnerable to unexpected selling pressure, as multiple hurdles are placed on the way to the 11,000 mark. In case this pullback materialises, the first hurdle shall be at 10,547 level,” Mohammad said. 


Understanding MACD 
 A close look at the stock chart Titan Company shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show an downward momentum and vice versa.

On Monday, the stock rose 2.7 per cent to close at Rs 813.45 on NSE."

However, the correction in the market which began in September has also made stocks cheaper.ET takes a look at five stocks which market experts believe should be bought after the correction.


Axis BankCMP: Rs 552.75
Change since September: -14.86%
Consensus Rating(buy/hold/sell): 28/16/7
Consensus Target Price: Rs 630.78

IIFL’s head of research Abhimanyu Sofat sees Axis Bank's revenue and operating profi t to grow on a compounded basis at 19% and 20% respectively, over fi nancial years 2019-20 and 2020-21. “The bank's focus on high-rated corporate accounts and reduction in watchlist will strengthen its asset quality. Credit costs are likely to decline in FY20, driving signifi cant improvement in profi tability,” said Sofat. IIFL has a target price of Rs 683 on Axis Bank.


Bajaj FinanceCMP: Rs 2,061.80
Change since September: -27.89%
Consensus Rating(buy/hold/sell): 12/8/2
Consensus Target Price: Rs 2,519.40

Analysts believe that Bajaj Finance is one of the better placed NBFCs in the current challenging environment for the sector. The stock was earlier expensive but now it has come down to reasonable value, said Navin Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities. “Bajaj Finance may stand tall in the NBFC space as it has better pricing power than others,” said Kulkarni.


Jubilant FoodWorksCMP: Rs 1,152
Change since September: -25.6%
Consensus Rating(buy/hold/sell): 24/7/2
Consensus Target Price: Rs 1,528.03

Navin Kulkarni of Reliance Securities believes the growth story of Jubilant FoodWorks is strong and valuations have come down. “We see earnings growth of 40% in Q2 and revenue growth of 19%, on a YoY basis,” said Kulkarni. Phillip Capital also said in a report recently that Jubilant is poised to deliver strong Q2 results and that it offers a favourable risk-reward to long term investors.


Titan CompanyCMP: Rs 750.35
Change since September: -15.76%
Consensus Rating(buy/hold/sell): 26/6/2
Consensus Target Price: Rs 1,020.32

Analysts see the watch-to-jewellery maker as a buy. “Titan has been a key benefi ciary of migration from unorganised to organised players driven by recent regulatory changes, which is evident from sustained market share gains,” said Pandey of ICICIdirect. “Management's commentary suggests that despite headwinds like surge in gold prices, subdued consumer sentiments and tightening of credit policy, the jewellery division witnessed healthy growth in Q2FY19,” said ICICIdirect.


ITC
CMP: Rs 268.5
Change since September: -15.87%
Consensus Rating(buy/hold/sell): 37/4/1
Consensus Target Price: Rs 344.44

Analysts favour ITC after the recent correction due to its light balance sheet and improving performance of nontobacco segment. “We are expecting strong numbers in Q2FY19 given the favourable base of Q2FY18. Regulatory overhangs are in the price and its FMCG portfolio continues to witness strong traction,” said Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICIdirect. Abhimanyu Sofat of IIFL said that the stock may see a re-rating due to improving non-tobacco performance and investment plan."

21,2018-10-16,Titan,"Remaining invested with schemes that have a focused approach in selecting large-sized companies is one way to deal with the heightened volatility in markets. A key reason for this approach is that large-sized companies that have a long operational history have experienced differing demand and market cycles, which are better placed to contain the downside for investors.

Among the large-cap schemes, ICICI Prudential Bluechip focuses on bluechip companies. Launched in 2008, the scheme suits well for conservative investors who have reasonable expectations in returns. Besides consistency in its performance, the scheme is known to protect the downside in bear cycles over the past 10 years. This is largely due to keen focus on quality companies. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 10% and 15% returns while its benchmark index Nifty 100 TRI has given 10% and 13.7% returns.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers Priyanka Khandelwal, Rajat Chandak and Anish Tawakley have enhanced exposure in large-cap stocks across sectors which have reasonably good visibility of revenues and turned attractive in the recent fall in markets. A few prominent stocks in the scheme are: HDFC, Vedanta, and SBI Life Insurance.

25,2018-10-22,Titan,"The net profit earned by a company belongs to its shareholders, but not all of it is distributed to them. The profits not distributed by the company are called retained earnings. 

A company’s retained earnings depend on its investment opportunities, business and economic outlook, ownership structure, the business phase it is in, among other things. Retained earnings help finance research and development programmes and, therefore, companies that are in their growth phase retain substantial amount of earnings compared to those in the maturity stage of their life cycle. 

Ideally, a company should retain profits, if it can invest them to generate higher returns for shareholders. In other words, a rupee worth of earnings with the company should be more valuable than a rupee worth of earnings in the hands of the shareholders. 

Warren Buffett says that retained earnings should be used to create value for the shareholders but, if the management fails to create value, it is better that it pays dividends. The retained earnings-to-market value ratio, designed by Buffett, is used to evaluate the efficiency with which a company utilises its retained earnings. 

The ratio provides the value the management has created for every rupee of profit it has retained. For example, if the ratio is 2.5, it implies that the management has created Rs 2.5 worth of market value for every Rs 1 that it retained. 

We used data for the past five years, starting from year 2013-14, and calculated the earnings-to market value ratio for companies with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore. Only the companies with the average retention ratio—percentage of a company’s retained profits vis-a-vis total profit—of more than 50% in the past five years were included in the analysis. The retained earnings are calculated by adding the adjusted earnings per share for the past five years (2013-14 to 2017-18) minus the total dividend per share for the past five years.

Next, the change in the stock’s market value was computed by subtracting its price five years ago from its current price. Finally, the retained earnings-to-market value ratio was calculated by dividing the change in market value by the retained earnings.

The stocks were then sorted in their descending order of retained earnings-to-market value ratio. The top 10% stocks in this list have delivered average point-to-point returns of 20.05%, 166.2% and 654.7% in the past one, three and five years, respectively. 

On the other hand, stocks that made the bottom 10% of the list delivered an average point-to-point returns of -32.5%,-15.1% and 13.3% returns in the past one, three and five years, respectively. The BSE500 Index delivered -2.33%, 26.02% and 83.3% point-to-point return during the same one, three and five-year periods, respectively.

For long-term wealth creation, investors should not only assess the profitability of a company but also see whether the management is capable of generating growth from its profits. 

Let us look at the seven companies in the top 10% of our list that promise significant stock price growth over the next one year based on Bloomberg consensus estimates.


1. Havells India
 
An electrical goods company, Havells India has a strong global presence and offers a wide range of products including cables and wires, motors, fans, modular switches, home appliances and air conditioners.

According to the Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company is likely to report a 24% jump in adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2018-19


6. VIP Industries
 The company manufactures and sells luggage bags and accessories in India and abroad. Analysts expect that luggage industry will continue to grow on the back of rising disposable incomes and strong consumer demand.

2,2018-12-06,Titan,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy call on Titan Company with a target price of Rs 1,105.

The current market price of Titan Company is Rs 912.60.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Titan Company price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage:
In an encouraging sign, wedding season demand is scaling up well for TTAN. This should uplift management confidence as it had guided for healthy growth (25-30 per cent) for 3QFY19 but refrained from commenting on the fourth quarter performance. In our view, if consumers continue flocking to its stores in the wedding season, Jewelry sales growth of 25 per cent for the full year is achievable (note that TTAN had guided for Jewelry sales growth of 25 per cent at the start of the year but lowered it to nearly 20 per cent later).

SSSG is likely to contribute 75-80 per cent of Jewelry sales growth, which is even higher than the impressive 60 per cent that it reported earlier. This, in turn, would have extremely positive implications on Jewelry EBIT margin.

Sustained growth in the Watches segment (where visibility is high for the near term, but somewhat unclear for the longer term) can prove beneficial, as EBIT margin in this segment is 300-400bp higher than that in Jewelry.

Jewellery business growth prospects remain robust, and now Watches and even Eyewear segments have raised their hands to contribute to growth. We believe that premium valuations are fully deserved for a business that has perhaps the best revenue growth potential in the largecap FMCG/retail space (20 per cent CAGR in Jewelry business over the next five years) and also operating leverage-led margins support. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,105, based on 47x Dec’20 EPS (nearly 10 per cent premium to three-year average P/E)."

Nifty makes Strong Bullish candleThe bulls made a strong comeback in the second half as the Nifty formed a Strong Bullish candle on the daily chart. But to maintain the bullish trend, the NSE barometer needs to sustain above 10,333, say analysts.

7,2018-12-19,Titan,"Calendar 2018 taught some hard lessons to retail investors, especially those who blindly ape established names on Dalal Street, as even the biggies like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Dolly Khanna, Anil Kumar Goel and Porinju Veliyath faced the heat in the prolonged selloff. 

Take this: As many as 10 of Jhunjhunwala’s portfolio stocks plunged over 50 per cent in 2018 till December 17. Among the top wealth destroyers, The Mandhana Retail tanked 76 per cent, followed by Geojit Financial Services (down 65 per cent), Dewan Housing Finance (down 63 per cent), Prozone Intu Properties (down 60 per cent) and Prakash Industries (down 58 per cent).

Some of his other favourites like Orient Cement, Anant Raj, Aptech, Bilcare, Man Infra Construction, TV18 Broadcast and Ion Exchange (India) have declined between 40 per cent and 54 per cent for the year till date.

Other holdings such as VIP Industries, Firstsource Solutions and Titan Company, however, played saviour and gained 49 per cent, 26 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.

Shankar Sharma of First Global in an earlier interaction with ETMarkets.com said one should never ape others in the stock market. “You should read a lot. This will help you develop your own style. You can take some elements from others, but ultimately you have to find your own style in investing,” he said. 

Kochi-based investor Porinju Veliyath also took a massive hit on his portfolio, comprising largely smallcaps and midcaps. Sebi data showed the Kochi-based investor’s PMS took a 20 per cent knock in September, 3.6 per cent in October and another 2 per cent in November. The fund had gained 6.33 per cent and 3.70 per cent in August and July, respectively. 

Some of his portfolio stocks plunged drastically in the selloff September-November. Stocks owned by his wealth management firm Equity Intelligence, like LEEL Electricals, Liberty Shoes, Shalimar Paints, Ansal Buildwell, Eastern Treads, Kerala Ayurveda and BCL Industries slipped between 35 per cent and 81 per cent in 2018. 

Often called the smallcap czar, Porinju in a letter his investors advised investors to keep faith in the India growth story and stay put on their investments.

In one of his recent letters, Porinju said there is nothing to do in this market for investors who have put in money with a longer horizon. “This, too, shall pass,” he wrote, adding: “The prevailing bearish trend will reverse and turn into a 2009 kind of bull run. Hundreds of stocks, including many of those we are holding, would be up more than 100 per cent by next year.

Most of the shares held by Chennai-based investor Dolly Khanna also too moved southward during the year. Srikalahasthi Pipes, Rain Industries and Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances dipped over 50 per cent during the year. Khanna’s other stocks such as RSWM, IFB Agro, Mannappuram Finance, Nilkamal, Nocil and Ruchira Papers slipped between 7 per cent and 32 per cent.

With over 1 per cent holding in more than 30 companies, Anil Kumar Goel saw his portfolio value fall up to 73 per cent during the year. Over 10 of his holdings dipped over 50 per cent. Samtex Fashions, Sarla Performance, Indsil Hydro Power and Manganese, Vardhman Holdings, KG Denim, Srikalahasthi Pipes, KRBL, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Shivam Autotech and Thirumalai Chemicals dipped between 50 per cent and 75 per cent.

Among his other holding, Ador Fontech, Sterling Tools, Mazda, Majestic Auto, Star Paper Mills, Swelect Energy, Majestic Auto and JBM Auto have dragged his portfolio since January.

Two of his holdings, Punjab Alkalies and Chemicals and Technocraft Industries, however, rallied 129 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, during the same period. 

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices retreated 15 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, between January 1 and December 17, while the benchmark Sensex gained 7 per cent.

Jhunjhunwa last week said volatility is here to stay in the market. “Worldwide, volatility has ruled the roost and nervousness and uncertainty have triggered it in the market,” he said. 

The Big Bull said excitement about midcaps has mellowed down quite a bit. “Midcaps can’t trade at the valuation of largecaps,” he said. 

He said 98 per cent of money in Indian stock market is being made by being bulls. However, he admitted he himself has not always made money by being bullish."

10,2018-12-24,Titan,"The NAV of ICICI Pru Focused Equity Fund fell over 4% in five sessions, reaching Rs 27.22 on 10 December 2018. A key reason far this fall was the sharp drop in the stock price of one of the fund’s holdings—Sun Pharma. The stock, which made up almost 11% of the fund’s holdings, closed at its lowest level in about six years on 10 December, and dragged down the fund’s NAV. The NAV has since recovered 6% and touched Rs 28.97 on 20 December 2018. The swings in NAV have brought attention to focused equity funds as a category.The cost of focus“Focused funds invest in few stocks to build a concentrated portfolio around convictions of the fund house or the fund manager. This leads to a high exposure to a single stock,” says Amol Joshi, Founder, PlanRupee Investment Services. This approach leads to concentration risk. Given the high exposure to select stocks, a sharp fall in any stock will pull down the return of the entire portfolio. The recent fall in the ICICI Focused Equity is a case in point and it holds valuable lessons for retail investors looking to invest in focused schemes. “The volatility and losses that retail investors are seeing in focused funds are because these schemes are riskier than diversified funds. They can give better returns, but these potentially higher returns come with higher volatility,” says Shweta Jain, Founder and CEO, Investography, an investment management firm.Highly focused equity schemesA single stock can both lift as well as sink the overall performance of these funds.

Jain does not recommend focused equity funds to retail investors with low risk appetite. “The additional volatility and risk is not worth that extra bit of return which may or may not come,” she says. Joshi concurs: “Anyone who cannot tolerate volatility in returns due to the concentrated bets should always choose diversified funds.” However, while diversified equity funds are a relatively safe bet, you need not shun the focused funds category altogether. The key is to be aware of the risks they carry and whether you have the appetite to take these risks.Not-so-focused equity schemesDiversified schemes may be a better bet than these loosely focused funds.

Source: Accord Fintech, Compiled by ETIG DatabaseChoose wiselyDespite the risks involved, the focused fund strategy is bound to gain traction, say experts. “They will gain appeal especially in the large-cap and large-cap oriented space. The ability to generate alpha, post Sebi recategorisation of mutual funds, is higher in this category,” says Vidya Bala, Head, Mutual Fund Research, Fundsindia. Some savvy investors with conservative risk profile may scout for funds within the focused category that invest in relatively less volatile, defensive stocks. “Concentration does not automatically mean higher risk. For instance, a scheme’s top five or six holdings could be low-risk stocks. If it has a high exposure to stocks like HDFC Bank or Infosys, where the regulatory risk is lower and earnings predictability is higher, the volatility will not be as high,” points out Bala. So, you need to evaluate the scheme’s strategy before investing. For instance, funds with high exposure to energy stocks, which are sensitive to regulatory issues, can see high volatility. Similarly, if a fund has a high exposure to companies with corporate governance issues, it may pose undue risks. But this does not mean that you opt for focused funds that are not true to their label. If you are convinced about a fund’s focused strategy, go for it instead of ‘diversified’ focused funds. Focused funds that do not take aggressive bets are no different from diversified funds. If you choose to invest in focused funds, experts advise that you restrict exposure to 10% of your overall allocation to equity funds. “You should also diversify in terms of strategy as well as category allocation,” says Bala. Ensure that you pick a fund where you are as convinced as the fund manager is about the potential of the stocks that form the fund’s portfolio. “Once you invest, review periodically to see if the thesis of investment is holding on. Be focused, have conviction and stay the course if the fund is on track. If you are unable to do this, choose diversified funds,” says Joshi."

19,2018-12-29,Titan,"The year 2018 has had an exciting run in fashion. Designers, at least internationally, decided to walk the talk. Diversity, questioning standards of beauty and even the #MeToo movement were mirrored on runways that were as much about showcasing opinion as about fashion.

Year 2019 will also be when marginal conversations in Indian fashion start taking centre stage, says Jaspreet Chandok, vice-president and head of fashion, IMG Reliance. There’s investor interest in scaling up designer brands and more investment is expected. Retail, too, continues to change its tack to become the place where the consumer experiences a brand in a more holistic way. Ecommerce & Instagram will help scale up young designer businesses faster. 

Designer Gaurav Gupta puts his money on more originality and innovation. Men are likely to search for watches, light-wash denim and corduroy, while women will continue to search for statement trainers, bamboo-structured handbags, as well as sustainable fashion, according to Pinterest. Here is a look at the trends you can invest in for a chic new year:


Khadi is Couture 
The biggest designers have rediscovered the beauty of our heritage fabrics, says fashion entrepreneur Prasad Bidapa, and everyone — from Rohit Bal to Abraham & Thakore — is celebrating the fabric of freedom in not-so-humble avatars. From rough spun to the finest mulmul, expect to see the finest of khadis everywhere.


Indigo is the New Black 
If India had a national colour, it would be indigo. Traditional block-printers in Jaipur use more of indigo than any other colour. This year, they introduced a green indigo, made possible with the addition of turmeric in their mix.


Indian AccentAssomull says India-based label D’Ascoli, is selling well on international luxury fashion websites, because of its new-age use of traditional crafts. There’s a stronger integration of Indian craft into mainstream retail brands such as Raymond and Wills Lifestyle. With brands like Fendi coming to India to source crafts, wearing Indian accents should be your go-to fashion mantra in 2019.


Black, White & Grey 
Sophisticated combinations of these neutrals popped up in many designer collections this year — from Abraham & Thakore to Rajesh Pratap Singh & Shahab Durazi.

The Sari is the New LBD 
Saris was rediscovered by trendy young ladies, who wore them with utter disregard for conventions and in the most unusual of ways, says Bidapa. “Blue jeans and churidars replaced petticoats; cholis morphed into skinny stretch tees or bikini bras and hemlines floated well above traditional lengths.” 2019 will see saris take the centre stage.


Designer: Princess Diya Kumari Foundation; photographer: Jiten Agarwal


Curation is Key 
There is now a preference towards well-rounded retail experience over a simple purchase of a product, says Samyukta Nair, founder of Clove, a Mumbai-based multi-store brand. “There is a focus on curating and creating a heightened level of engagement.” Brands are actively moving away from only being associated with shopping in the traditional sense.""


The Art of Craft
India’s plethora of indigenous craft forms served as inspiration for many designers. Vidhi Singhania looked to Jaipur Blue Pottery while Sabyasachi, Swati & Sunaina and Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango worked with the Banarasi and the art of zari. Expect to see more of these brilliant inspirations.


Designer: Vidhi Singhania ; Photographer: Jiten Agarwal

Live Life in Full Colour
The Pride movement was an inspiration for rainbow dressing — be it at Halpern, Carolina Herrera and Valentino. Expect more colour in 2019. “Good fashion is always a reflection of the times – it picks up on social and political issues of the day,” says fashion journalist Sujata Assomull.


Shivan & Narresh


End of Celebrity Inspiration
The constant wave of obsession over how celebrities style themselves will change in 2019, says Palak Shah, founder and CEO of handloom brand Ekaya. “I see the younger generation borrowing heirloom pieces from their mothers and grandmothers, and revamping them with a contemporary twist.”


Sustainability
Sustainability will be a big influencer for purchasing decisions. The percentage of ecofriendly and recycled fibres & fabrics in retail brands will go up significantly as consumers demand more sustainable lifestyle choices, says Chandok of IMG Reliance.


Functional Garments
Features such as adjustable trouser length, hidden and roomy pockets, adjustable slit in dresses and anti-stain, antiwrinkle and easy care garments will become the norm. Year 2018 saw the reappearance of reversible clothing and this should continue to be a part of work-wear closets in 2019, too.


The Dandy March
Designer Kunal Rawal puts his money on tone-ontone, thread work and textures. “Personalisation is also something that men seek now. Another well-received pattern is the deconstructed silhouette that allows the outfit to be broken up and paired differently,” he says. In 2019, menswear will include experiments with asymmetry, drapes and tailoring.


Kunal Rawal


The End of Trend
Designers Abraham & Thakore foresee an end of trend in the digital era. As everything becomes more accessible due to technology, what people decide to follow will not be tied to wide-spread trends. Earlier, fashion trends at shows in major cities like Paris and Milan would have an impact on what is happening in India. Not anymore.


Twinning
Designers Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja of Shivan & Narresh say twinning will remain a popular trend for celebratory occasions and decadent honeymoons.


Bohemian Bridal
In a refreshing twist, Bidapa says one can expect brides to wear flowers and wooden jewellery to their weddings. Shock-value experimentation will change perceptions about fashion dos and don’ts. More brides will also feel confident about wearing unconventional colours.


Designer: Bibi Russell; Photographer: Jiten Agarwal


Fine Tailoring
Sharp tailoring with focus on sleekness will be a trend. Puneet Mangla, cofounder of Perona, says, “As consumers make more thoughtful and mindful purchases, they will seek quality over quantity. Price matters, but it will not be the only differentiator, as it once was.”


SS Homme - Sarah & Sandeep


Stop Being Straight
There’s nothing straight about spring-summer 2019 — in the hems at least. Designer Ritu Kumar says with boho dresses here to stay, it can only mean more handkerchief hems, floaty hemlines and feminine cuts.


Shivan & Narresh


Pastel Perfect
This will be the year of sophisticated pastels or neutral pastels like pale pink, ivories, ecru and silvers, and greys and champagnes.


Gaurav Gupta


Designer Will Multitask
This year will see designers trying out multiple mediums and formats, says designer Manish Malhotra. Collaborations will be more widespread. “Dipping your fingers in many pies is here to stay, given the quick evolution of the world and its consumption of art, design and fashion,” he says.


Fashion Instagram
Vertical videos (IGTV) will continue to change the way people use Instagram for fashion. The fashion industry continues to lead the change in the inspiring and creative ways it uses videos on Instagram, and has also been quick to embrace IGTV. We saw brands, including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Miu Miu, embrace IGTV from the start, taking advantage of the different ways to play and creating innovative, vertical-first content.” Instagram spokesperson.

With the rise of millennials and the emergence of omni-channel retail, many fashion retail brands are exploring various strategies to offer seamless experience to customers, like digitising of in-store retail experience.


TECH IN STYLE 
In India, marketing trends suggest various clothing brands would adopt augmented reality to create digital stores as the results become more prominent. An Indian clothing brand launched a readyto-wear experience store in Bengaluru. According to initial trends, the company was able to generate more-than-average footfall and transaction value. Virtual reality is gaining traction in developing countries and is not only used as a marketing tool but also as a sales enabler. Artificial intelligence too is transforming various business processes in the form of ease of payments, providing product information, offering personalisation, etc.


TRIBE TAILING
As the preferences of the consumers change with the evolving retail environment, groups of consumers with specific characteristic sets have emerged. Customised targeting and offering to these groups or tribes is seen to be essential. Anil Talreja, partner, Deloitte India.

Investment rationale by the brokerage

FY19 jewellery revenue guidance upgraded to 22 per cent against 20 per cent: Before the start of the financial year, the management had guided for nearly 25 per cent revenue growth for the jewellery division in FY19E. Titan had to trim its guidance to 20 per cent owing to lower than anticipated performance in Q1FY19. However, with visibility of green shoots in Q2FY19 (revenue growth of 29 per cent) and positive trends witnessed in Q3FY19, the management has guided at 22 per cent revenue growth for FY19E (translating into implied revenue growth of 30 per cent YoY in H2FY19E vs. 17 per cent in H1FY19). Capitalising on a seasonally strong quarter, Tanishq witnessed robust SSSG in Q3FY19 with sustained market share gains. Furthermore, the store expansion plans are well on track with Titan adding 24 Tanishq stores on a net basis for 9MFY19. Tanishq launched the ‘Utsav’ collection (based on heritage and Antique gold jewellery) which received healthy traction. Tanishq also launched the ‘Preen’ collection (high value diamond studded jewellery). The new collections are in line with Titan’s strategy to scale up its share of high value studded jewellery segment from 30 per cent in FY18 to 50 per cent by FY23.


Product launches in smart watches segment to support revenue growth: After five consecutive years of single digit revenue growth, the watches division registered a turnaround in FY19E with 16 per cent revenue growth and EBIT margins expanding nearly 600 bps YoY to 17 per cent in H1FY19. The watches segment continued on its healthy trajectory for Q3FY19, driven by launch of new products, with online channel and modern retail outperforming the traditional channels of sales in Q3FY19. The division strengthened its smart watches product portfolio with launch of products such as, ‘Reflex Wav’, and ‘SF Rush smart band’. The management expects the EBIT margin for the watches segment to be subdued in Q3FY19 owing to higher marketing spends. On a net basis, the division added five WOT stores, nine Fastrack stores and three Helios stores for 9MFY19.


Strong performance to sustain over long term; maintain 'Buy': We anticipate H2FY19 revenue growth will be significantly better (vs. 17 per cent growth in H1FY19) as Q3FY19 is predominantly expected to be driven by strong festive demand while Q4FY19 is expected to be supported by higher number of wedding dates. Capitalising on larger opportunities such as the wedding space (focus to enhance contribution from 35 per cent in FY18 to 50 per cent by FY23) and high value diamond studded jewellery has resulted in new customer addition and expansion of average ticket size. High asset turnover, coupled with positive operating leverage (driven by healthy SSSG) are expected to translate into 34 per cent RoCE by FY21E from current 29 per cent. We expect revenues and earnings to grow at a CAGR of 20 per cent and 26 per cent respectively, in FY18-21E. We reiterate our 'Buy' rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,065 (42.0x FY21E EPS)."

19,2019-01-29,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Market breadth is depleting, and the benchmark indices are making lower highs and lower lows, suggesting that supports are shifting lower in the runup to the Union Budget.

As weakness grows, more and more stocks are looking weak on the technical charts.

As such, 80 stocks on NSE appear to be readying for a correction in the coming days, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The list includes at least seven Nifty stocks.

The technical indicator has signalled a downward crossover, meaning bearishness, on these counters. This, coupled with the fact that many of the counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adds credibility to the emerging trend.

Vedanta, Sun Pharma, Hindalco Industries, Cipla, Bajaj Finance, Titan Company and BPCL are among the Nifty50 stocks that witnessed downward crossover of late, signalling weakness on the charts. 

Other stocks in this list included Indraprastha Gas, Hexaware Technologies, Rolta India, Infibeam Avenues, NIIT, Punj Lloyd and Amara Raja Batteries.



“Last two days have not been good for our market, as there was a pause to the recent optimism. Index-wise, no major damage has been done, but if we look at some of the individual stocks, they have certainly taken a brutal knock,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, eight stocks showed bearish crossovers on the daily charts, sending out bullish signals. They included NMDC, Voltas, Uttam Galva Steels, Thyrocare Technologies, Raj Television Network and Johnson Controls.



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, the daily Bollinger Bands have started an expansion after a phase of contraction, thus assisting the price action on the way down. “The internal structure i.e. the hourly chart, showed a fall is developing as an Impulse structure, which is a typical characteristic of a deeper fall,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan.

Chavan says if Nifty50 stays below 10,675 level for some time, it would see selling pressure and test sub-10,600 levels.


UNDERSTANDING MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Vedanta shows whenever the MACD line breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show a downward momentum and vice versa.

Technical analysts see stock-specific opportunities in the bearish market. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of seven stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over next 2-3 weeks.


Kunal Parar, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking

Tech Mahindra | Buy | Target price: Rs 793-810 | Stop loss: Rs 710
This stock has seen a breakout from the upper band of a symmetrical triangle formation on the daily charts. This may cause the stock to spurt from its current level. Moreover, the stock has been continuously trading with strong support from 200-day moving average (DMA), which shows that the long-term trend is upward. Daily momentum indicator RSI read 62.80 with a positive crossover, which signalled positive breadth on the counter.


UltraTech Cement | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,720-3,800 | Stop loss: Rs 3,330 
This stock has been trading with support from its upward rising trend line on the weekly chart, which suggests a likely bounceback on the counter. Daily momentum indicator RSI reading was at 33.10 with a positive crossover. Apart from this, the RSI has just come out of the overbought zone, which indicates a positive move on the counter.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher 

Hexaware Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 385 | Stop loss: Rs 315
This stock has been consolidating for some time in the Rs 310-330 range. It has seen a breakout above that range to signify strength and is showing immense potential to rise further in the coming days. The RSI has shown a trend reversal and given a buy signal to maintain the positive bias. “With good volume activity, we recommend a buy signal on this stock for an upside target of Rs 385, keeping a stop loss at Rs 315,” said Parekh.


Hindustan Unilever | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,930 | Stop loss: Rs 1,725
This stock has been sliding in recent times and it has seen a decent bounceback with a bullish positive candle to signify strength. It has the potential to rise further in the coming days. The chart looks attractive and with the RSI indicating a steep trend reversal to signal a buy, the bias has become positive. 


Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Angel Broking

Godfrey Phillips India | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,020 | Stop loss: Rs 903
The daily chart of this stock shows a series of ‘higher highs and higher lows.’ In the process, the stock finally broke out the trend line hurdle at Rs 930 with some authority. This move was supported by humongous volumes, providing credence to the price action. After this, the stock saw some consolidation but that could be seen as a good buying opportunity. 


Jubilant Foodworks | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,565 | Stop loss: Rs 1,212
After enjoying a good multi-year bull run, this stock slipped into the consolidation mode. Price action in past two days has been encouraging. Due to a massive bumpup on Friday, the stock finally seemed to have come out of the congestion zone. Its volume activity has risen substantially over the past three days, indicating the emergence of strong buying interest. “Considering this price and volume development, we expect the stock to resume its higher degree uptrend,” said Chavan. 


Titan Company | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,055| Stop loss: Rs 964
This stock has been one of the outperformers and is known for its steady performance. It has been enjoying a strong multiyear bull-run, started a decade ago. In between, all natural corrections in this stock were interpreted as good buying opportunities. The stock recovered sharply from recent lows and went on to clock fresh record highs. The daily chart looks extremely promising from a near-term perspective.

28,2019-02-21,Titan,"NEW DELHI: The market is telling you what’s on the investor’s mind: While low PE stocks continue to bleed, so-called growth stocks have been among the top gainers in an otherwise depressed market.

Looks like investors are in no mood to chase value at the moment. And given the pre-election uncertainty, the trend is unlikely to change for now. 

The disconnect between price and value in ’growth’ and ‘value’ stocks is such that many of the growth stocks are trading at expensive valuations, even on FY2021 earnings estimates, while many value stocks are ruling at inexpensive valuations, even on FY2019 basis, said Kotak Securities. 

Out of the 49 BSE 200 stocks that have gained between 10 per cent and 60 per cent in last 12 months, half had PE multiples in excess of 40, data compiled from AceEquity suggests.

Shares of HUL and Nestle India have gained 30 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively. The two FMCG stocks have managed to sustain high price multiples in last 12 months, even as the benchmark BSE200 has declined 2 per cent in the same period. 

Shares of United Breweries are up 28 per cent; Jubilant Foodworks has gained 34 per cent and Bajaj Finance 56 per cent while Pidilite Industries, Asian Paints and Dabur India have risen up to 25 per cent in last one year.

And look at the low PE stocks: oil firms ONGC, BPCL and HPCL, power firms NTPC, REC, Power Grid, Torrent Power, NBFC stocks Dewan Housing and Reliance Capital, metals & mining companies Vedanta, Coal India and NMDC are down up to 77 per cent during this period.


What disappointed
Calendar 2019 has an even worse record: none of the 40 stocks that quoted single-digit PE as of December 31, 2018 are in the green. 

Analysts say poor returns by these stocks are either reflecting the poor growth prospects and, in many cases, concerns over corporate governance.

“Stocks quoting low PEs at this point mostly belong to heavily-indebted firms or companies with unstable earnings. As such, the pressure on stock prices are further dragging their valuations. Low PE in no way suggests a stock is cheap and that it is a better company to bet on for the future,” said Sameer Kalra of Equity Research Analyst and Founder, Target Investing.

Among the top 10 BSE200 losers so far are three ADAG group stocks Reliance Power (down 63 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (down 62 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 35 per cent). These stocks have been hammered after two lenders sold shares pledged with them by the promoters.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have dropped xx per cent. Company’s CEO Harshil Mehta resigned earlier this month. A news portal recently alleged that the NBFC was involved in a financial scam as big as Rs 31,000 crore. The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

“Certain so-called value companies have found new ways to disappoint investors on corporate governance, thereby making the valuation argument largely redundant for such stocks,” Kotak Securities said.

Graphite electrode makers Graphite India, HEG are seeing tough days as electrode prices have softened due to weak global steel prices, increased Chinese imports into India and select trade restriction placed by the US.

Adani Power and IDBI Bank have been posting losses. Nalco has seen 58 per cent plunge in Q3 earnings, while Vedanta has been in news on concerns over corporate governance.

In contrast, among the top BSE200 stocks this year are from IT sector, where firms do offer earnings guidance at the end of each quarter. Two are private lenders, and one is consumer-oriented firm (Titan Company, which too offers guidance on its jewellery business).


Smart money chases growth
Smart money will always chase growth even at the higher premium, Kalra said. “For good retail and institutional investors, growth has always been a key criteria as cleaner growth is much more sustainable. Growth is what makes them give premium valuations to stocks. Consumer stocks are a case in point. They always trade at a higher premium as they are high cash flow businesses and there is high earnings visibility. It’s easy to estimate growth simply by looking at volumes,” he said. 

Kotak Securities said: ""The market seems to have taken a permanent view on the future of most companies, thereby effectively segregating companies into long-term winners; which are companies with superior business models, trustworthy managements and good corporate governance practices where no price or valuation may be too high to own the stocks, and long-term losers; which are companies with inferior business models and poor governance practices where no price or valuation may be too low to avoid the stocks.""


Election & demand for qualityElection dates are likely to be announced over the next three weeks. In a study of past three general elections, Elara Capital found that volatility usually rises sharply ahead of Lok Sabha elections and cool off only after the election outcome. In a study of the 2004 -2018 period, the brokerage found that quality stocks tend to outperform in an uncertain market.

The brokerage says by high quality, it refers to companies with RoCE of greater than 15 in each of last five years, net debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1, positive free cash flow (FCF) yield for at least four out of last five years and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) either stable or increasing. Within the BSE200 universe, there are 34 companies that fit the bill.

The brokerage has recommended 15 of them, which include Castrol India, Cyient, Eicher Motors, Gillette India, GSK Consumer, Infosys, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Oracle, Sun TV Network and Tata Elxsi.

11,2019-03-12,Titan,"Titan Company Tuesday said it has entered into an alliance with FTS USA LLC to assist in setting up an assembly unit of the American watchmaker.

""We are happy to support FTS through this new facility, in helping them revive the American watch manufacturing industry,"" Titan Company CEO - Watches and Accessories S Ravi Kant said.

According to him, the alliance signifies Titan's three-decade long expertise in watchmaking.

Nearly all large-scale watchmaking for the US market is done outside America in countries such as Switzerland, China, Japan, the Philippines and India.

""Through this alliance, FTS sees an opportunity to make more classic watches and movements. The new facility will lead to higher quality, fewer shipment delays and a better connect with the US customers,"" Titan added."
7,2019-03-12,Titan,"NEW DELHI: A recent opinion poll that predicted NDA retaining power in the upcoming elections has put the bulls in-charge on the Street.

NSE barometer Nifty has broken above its three-month long consolidation range and is eyeing 78.6 per cent retracement of the September-October 2018 decline near 11,400 level. 

As such, 20 stocks look poised for a rally, according to momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The gauge has signalled an upward crossover -- a sign of bullish undertone -- on these counters, hinting at a possible upside. 

Signs on the ground lend credence to the emerging trend. Many of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late. 

The list includes Nifty constituents Bharti Airtel, Titan Company and other blue chips such as paints makers Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac, pharma firms Biocon and GSK Pharmaceuticals, Dabur India and Adani Transmission. 

Aditya Birla Fashion, Avenue Supermarts, Prestige Estates, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Future Lifestyle and Thyrocare Technologies are other prominent names that figure in the list. 



MACD -- the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages -- is used for indicating trend reversals in traded securities or indices. 

 A nine-day exponential moving average called the signal line is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. When MACD goes above the signal line, it throws up a bullish sign, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, three stocks Dhampur Sugar, Swan Energy and Atul have observed a downward crossover, signaling bearish sentiment on these counters.



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio. Traders should use other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend, say analysts.

Analysts said the ongoing rally has more legs.

“It’s better to stay on the positive side and expect this rally to extend towards 11,300-11,400 in days to come. The previous hurdle of 11,050-11,000 range is likely to play a sheet anchor role for the index. Traders should identify potential candidates, who are poised for blown up moves. Do watch out for auto and auto ancillary space, along with a few midcaps in the private banking space,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

The index has moved above the immediate resistance of previous swing high of 11,118 levels (February 7) and closed higher. This is positive indication for the Nifty, said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities.

“The short-term trend of the Nifty is positive. One may expect further upside for the short term. Next upside is to be watched at 11,250-70 in the next few sessions,” Shetti said.


Understanding MACD 
  A close look at the stock chart of Titan Company reveals that every time the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock tended to show an upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 2 per cent higher at Rs 1,090.55 on the NSE."
9,2019-03-12,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Bulls continued to have an upper hand on Dalal Street as the NSE benchmark Nifty jumped over 1 per cent for a second straight session on Tuesday. 

Out of Nifty pack, five stocks -- Reliance Industries (RIL), ICICI Bank, UPL, Titan Company and Axis Bank -- settled at fresh record highs.

Shares of RIL settled 2.05 per cent higher at Rs 1,330.85 on the NSE, while ICICI Bank and Axis Bank gained 3.42 per cent and 1.10 per cent to close at Rs 388.70 and Rs 742.60, respectively. 

“Reliance is the consumer-facing businesses. Retail, Jio and the media businesses are unlocking its value. In the next two-three years the stock should see 100 per cent appreciation from the current levels, given the kind of fundamental possibilities the company has created for its shareholders,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers in an interaction with ETNow.

UPL (up 0.14 per cent) and Titan Company (up 1.03 per cent) also hit their record close of Rs 898 and Rs 1080.25, respectively. Brokerage firm Sharekhan in February gave ‘Buy’ rating to Titan Company with a target price of Rs 1,200.

“Q3FY19 was yet another strong quarter for Titan with revenue rising by 35 per cent and adjusted PAT growing by 63.2 per cent, beating ours as well as the street’s expectation,” Sharekhan had said in a report.

Going by market experts, positive global cues, as well as unabated buying by overseas institutional investors, mainly lifted market sentiment. 

Hemang Jani, Head-Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said: “Strong global cues and aggressive buying by foreign investors are some of the triggers that led to positive market sentiment. However, elections results on May 23 will be the deciding factor for further upside in the short term. In such a scenario, investors should focus on quality stocks and use price corrections to add fundamentally strong stocks.”

Jani is bullish on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. “With peaking of NPA cycle, corporate-facing banks are likely to benefit with improvement in the overall asset quality and profitability,” he said.

The BSE Sensex closed 481.56 points, or 1.30 per cent, higher at Rs 37,535.66 today."

16,2019-03-15,Titan,"With the theme of ‘Enchanted Cosmos’, GJEPC’s Artisan Awards 2019 celebrated the best design talent in the Indian gems and jewellery industry.

It was a night to remember as the stars of designer jewellery came together at the Royal Opera House in south Mumbai recently. Following the theme of ‘Enchanted Cosmos’, The Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) held the Artisan Jewellery Design Awards 2019 powered by GIA (Gemological Institute of America) and co-partnered by the DPA (Diamond Producers Association). 

The Artisan Awards celebrate the highest levels of art, creativity and innovation by honouring the best talent in jewellery design. It also offers an ideal platform for designers from within and outside the industry to showcase their talent by helping them collaborate with some India’s best manufacturers. Talented minds from diverse walks of life come together to discuss, debate and deliberate on the creativity of young designers. 


Agencies(L to R): Milan Chokshi, Convener, Promotions & Marketing, GJEPC, Colin Shah, ViceChairman, GJEPC, Paola De Luca, international jewellery trend forecaster, Pramod Agrawal, Chairman, GJEPC, and Sabyasachi Ray, Executive Director, GJEPC.

Pramod Kumar Agrawal, chairman, GJEPC, said, “The Indian gem and jewellery industry has a history of more than 5, 000 years. We always had the advantage of skilled artisans and karigars when catering to global markets. 

“Today, total gem and jewellery exports accounts for $42 billion annually. The industry contributes around seven per cent to India’s GDP and employs more than five million people. It’s time that the world is made aware of India’s jewellery design potential and portray India as a ‘design destination’ for jewellery. The Artisan Awards is an initiative and a sincere effort to encourage the true design talent in the industry and showcase India’s Design extravagance to the world.” 


Winners shine bright 
Actress Aditi Rao Hydari was present for the grand finale, where the winners triumphed from over 550 entries and 23 shortlisted sketches. The finalists then had to get their pieces manufactured and went in for a second round of judging. The selection was based on various parameters such as design aesthetics, wearability, innovation, relevance to the theme and makeability/manufacturing. “I am in awe of the jewellery designs presented at the Artisan Awards 2019. I applaud GJEPC for organising such a brilliant initiative which not only encourages our jewellery designers but also brings to forth our country’s immense jewellery designing talent at the global level,” she said.

Colin Shah, vice-chairman, GJEPC, said, “The importance of India in the global jewellery design context is growing to what it used to be historically when Indian influence on luxury jewellery was evident in the creations of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Harry Winston for the Maharajas and Nawabs. Incidentally, GJEPC chose the theme of ‘Enchanted Cosmos’ before it becomes the design theme for buying season 2020. We were overwhelmed to receive 550 entries across India. The theme helps designers explore the mysteries of galaxies and universes known and unknown.” 

While Mehul Gupta triumphed as a winner in the rings/pendant category (her piece was manufactured by Jewel Goldi), Koushik Mondal, Tanvirkumar & Co, emerged as the first runnerup and Deepika Pathya, Titan Company Ltd, came in second.

Tab on trends 
In its endeavour to promote innovation in jewellery designing and elevate India’s status as the centre of design, GJEPC had commissioned a trend book named AATMAN - Inspirations 2020. The book has been curated and developed by The Futurist’s team, led by international jewellery forecaster Paola De Luca. The book was launched at the Artisan Awards. 

Milan Chokshi, convener, promotions & marketing of the GJEPC, said, “AATMAN - Inspirations 2020 is a significant initiative by the GJEPC. I am sure this will pave the way forward and build bridges to a new, vibrant and exciting future filled with creativity. The book covers a broad spectrum of jewellery trends in major categories such as bridal, couture and pret. It’s an ideal tool for young designers, and businesses.” 

De Luca said, “India is reclaiming its global stature as a leading pioneer in luxury jewellery design. AATMAN - Inspirations 2020 will inspire the new generation of Indian creative leaders, providing a blueprint for key design trends, raising topical issues affecting the diamond industry, and presenting an illustrated history of India’s early prominence in design.” 

Design Inspirations is another ambitious project of GJEPC to drive forward Indian design talent on the global stage. 

It is a series of talks that focusses on educating jewellers, designers and students about the upcoming trends in gems and jewellery sector in India, Europe and the US. It gives in-depth insights into consumer behaviour patterns, aspirations, desires, emotions, feelings; and how to translate them into thematic concepts and visual directions."

Collections like Diamond Treats, Gulnaaz, Utsava and Preen were major hits during the year. FY19 saw the highest number of store openings with 40 stores opened and 5 stores closed adding nearly 90,000 sq.ft. of net retail space. CaratLane grew nearly 42 per cent in FY19 on the back of aggressive retail stores opening in-line with its Omni-channel strategy and increased brand awareness. Titan has invested Rs 100 crores in CaratLane by subscribing to 30,48,780 additional shares to increase its stake from 66.39 per cent to 69.74 per cent.


Watches – new launches power growth: Revenues grew by nearly 16 per cent in FY19 led by new product launches across brands and growth in the E-commerce channel. Smart products including wearables (introduced 2 years ago) grew by more than 80 per cent in FY19. Smart products and accessories both crossed the milestone of Rs 1bn sales in FY19. Helios continued to be the fastest growing offline channel for the division. The division added 30 WOT stores and closed 24, added 22 FastTrack stores and closed 14, and added 12 for Helios stores and closed 4 during FY19.


Eye Wear- getting back on track: Revenues grew by 23 per cent in FY19 with number of customers increasing from 2.5mn to 3.5mn. Eyewear division witnessed new assortments and brand building campaigns. Frame sales now contribute mid-single digit to the sales of the division in its first year itself. The division added 74 stores during FY19 and closed 30 stores ending up with a net increase of nearly 28,000 sq.ft. of retail space. Multiple new products were launched under FastTrack, Titan and Dash brands for Spring Summer Collection.


New Businesses: Skinn continued to gain market share and be the best seller in in departmental chain stores. Skinn Point of sales has now increased to 3000 and has crossed the 1-million-unit volume landmark and sales of Rs 1bn in FY19. 'Taneira' launched in 2017 is receiving good response and Titan plans to expand it in FY20."

21,2019-04-15,Titan,"ICICI Direct has a buy call on Titan Company with a target price of Rs 1,290.

The current market price of Titan Company is Rs 1,092.30.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Titan Company price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage-

Another solid performance for Tanishq in FY19: After a tepid start to FY19, Titan’s jewellery division (Tanishq) ended on a high, with healthy revenue growth of nearly 22 per cent in FY19 (the division reported 30 per cent YoY revenue growth in H2FY19 vs. 17 per cent in H1FY19). FY19 was a challenging year for the jewellery industry owing to; a) tightening of credit policy, b) surge in gold prices and c) lower number of wedding dates. Despite headwinds, Tanishq continued to gain market share in FY19. The management added highest number of Tanishq stores in a single year (net addition 35 stores) taking the total store count to 312 in FY19. We expect the aggressive store addition run rate to sustain in FY20, FY21E. The management highlighted that new diamond collections such as, ‘Gulnaaz’, ‘Utsava’ and ‘Preen’ saw robust traction. The new collections are in line with Titan’s strategy to scale up its share of high value studded jewellery segment to 50 per cent by FY23. Titan continued to aggressively add CaratLane stores, to strengthen its Omni-channel strategy. CaratLane recorded robust revenue CAGR of 42 per cent in FY16-19E, albeit on a small base, with EBITDA breakeven expected in FY19E. In order to capitalise on the potential, Titan invested Rs 100 crore to increase its stake in CaratLane from 66.39 per cent to 69.74 per cent.


Revenue growth revival witnessed in watches and eyewear: After five consecutive years of single digit revenue growth, the watches division registered a turnaround in FY19 with 16 per cent revenue growth. The division strengthened its smart watches product portfolio with number new launches. Smart products including wearables grew at 80 per cent+, crossing the landmark of Rs 100 crore in FY19. On a net basis, the division added six WOT stores, eight Fastrack stores and eight Helios stores in FY19. For the eyewear division, the management’s strategy to increase assortment at more affordable points have worked out well in FY19 with revenue growth of 23 per cent.


Strong business model aiding sustained profitable growth: Titan has consistently displayed its ability to gain market share amid a tough industry scenario. Robust balance sheet (30 per cent+ RoCE and virtually debt free status) and asset light distribution model (A/TO: nearly 10x) has enabled it to outpace peers in terms of store addition. Enriched jewellery portfolio with launch of new collections (wedding space) and sustained investment in brand building is enabling better than industry revenue growth. We model revenue, earnings CAGR of 21 per cent, 27 per cent respectively, in FY18-21E. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,290 (49.0x FY21E EPS)."
19,2019-04-15,Titan,"Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala continued to reduce his holding in watch and jewellery retailer Titan Company for the second straight quarter.

Regulatory filing on Monday showed Jhunjhunwala’s stake in the company has fallen to 5.72 per cent, or 5,07,75,645 shares at the end of March, from 5.78 per cent, or 5,13,25,645 shares, at the end of December quarter. 

However, shareholding in the name of Rekha Rakesh Jhunjhunwala increased marginally at 1.32 per cent as of March 31 from 1.30 per cent at the end of the previous quarter.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala held 5.82 per cent stake in the company as of September 2018.

Ever since the Jhunjhunwalas first invested in the stock in 2002, the company’s market value has swelled over 300 times. The Jhunjhunwalas combined holding in the company has remained in the 7-10 per cent range all through these years. 

Higher valuation seems to be a concern for the stock, which traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of 71.50 on April 12 against its five-year average of 51.90.

P/E is a valuation ratio that measures the current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS).

However, most analysts are still bullish on the stock. Out of 30 analysts tracking the stock, 17 have ‘outperform’ ratings while nine others have ‘buy’ ratings, Reuters data showed.

ICICdirect says Titan has consistently displayed its ability to gain market share in tough market environments. “A robust balance sheet (over 30 per cent RoCE and virtually debt-free status) and an asset-light distribution model have enabled it to outpace peers in terms of store addition,” the brokerage said. 

“Titan’s enriched jewellery portfolio along with the launch of new collections (wedding space) and sustained investment in brand building is enabling better-than-industry revenue growth. We model in revenue and earnings growth of 21 per cent and 27 per cent CAGR, respectively, in FY18-21E. We reiterate our ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,290,” the brokerage said. 

Prabhudas Lilladher also has a ‘buy’ call on Titan with a price target of Rs 1,195.

In a report on April 4, the brokerage said Titan has given an optimistic outlook for FY20 aiming to achieve 20 per cent revenue growth despite muted industry demand growth.

This is on the back of 20 per cent sales growth in jewellery business led by higher number of wedding dates, 35 store additions, increased share of wedding jewellery as well as high value diamond jewellery and gains from consumer shift from unorganised to organised sector, it said."

26,2019-04-18,Titan,"BENGALURU: Indian consumers, apparently, shy away from sporting sunglasses. Despite rising temperature this summer, the penetration of the sunglass segment is low, said Shalini Gupta, head-marketing for Titan Eyeplus. Tata Group-owned Titan Company’s optical retail brand is not happy with the sales figures of their sunglasses division and are exploring strategies to increase customer awareness.

“Sunglasses form one-third of our sales. Our country is hot and humid but the penetration of sunglasses is still low. The year-on-year growth is a high single digit. There is still snob value attached to wearing a sunglass,” said Gupta.

Titan Eyeplus offers sunglasses from Titan and Fastrack along with international brands like Ray-Ban, Maui Jim, Vogue and Oakley through its online and offline channels. The eyewear retailer is looking to educate customers at its physical stores about the benefits of wearing a sunglass to avoid eye damage.

“Sunglass is a category which needs a lot more visibility and round-the-year input. We are adding sunglass trials for our customers at our stores. The idea is to remove hesitation for the first attempt,” said Gupta. She noted a growth in sale of sunglasses only by its youth brand Fastrack, especially the rider line for bikers.

Gupta added that millennials have saved the day for the watchmaking company’s sunglass segment. Millennials have emerged as their primary consumers and the young mindset apparently likes to sport and invest in multiple sunglasses.

“Millennials like to own one sunglass from a luxury brand for snob value and other affordable ones,” Gupta said.

Titan Company is a watches and accessories brand that forayed into optical retail in 2007 with a range of frames, prescription eyewear, contact lenses and sunglasses. The eyewear division added 74 stores and the revenue grew by 23% in FY19."

A spike in crude oil prices following reports of a US move to end all sanction waivers on import of Iranian oil, election-related jitters and record high levels of equity indices are making investors nervous.

A slide in the rupee slide against the US dollar also depressed investor sentiments. The rupee slumped by 52 paise in early trade on Monday.

Analysts said while the broader market has turned rangebound, a stock-specific approach can hold investors in good stead. Based on various analyst recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that can potentially give good returns over next 2-3 weeks. 


Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities

Minda Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 470 | Stop loss: Rs 350
Minda Industries is one of the strongest stocks in the market currently. It rallied smartly last week on the back of above average volumes and closed at a seven-month high in the process. Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock trades above its 13-day and 50-day simple moving averages. Intermediate momentum readings are in the rising mode, and are not signalling overbought condition.


APL Apollo Tubes | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,920 | Stop loss: Rs 1,380
APL Apollo Tubes rallied smartly last week on the back of huge volumes and closed at a new seven-month high. In the process, the stock reversed the recent intermediate downtrend and broke out of a recent narrow trading range. Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock trades above the rising short-term (13-day SMA) and medium-term (50-day SMA) moving averages. Intermediate momentum indicators like the 14-week RSI are in the rising mode and is not overbought yet. 


Kkunal Parar, Senior Technical Analyst, Choice Broking

Hero MotoCorp | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,910 | Stop loss: Rs 2,645

Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst, Angel Broking

Quick Heal Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 254 | Stop loss: Rs 217
After the sharp rally seen from Rs 171 to Rs 240 levels, this stock went into a consolidation phase last month. On the daily chart, the stock has now closed above the higher range of consolidation and seems to have resumed a primary uptrend. The aforesaid breakout is supported by a bullish candlestick pattern and increasing volume. On the oscillators’ front, after forming a base around 50 level, a smoothened RSI has given a fresh ‘buy’ signal with its average supporting our positive bias. 


JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 325 | Stop loss: Rs 284
In the recent broader market rally, this heavyweight metal counter had no major contribution. However, after breaking above a consolidation range of last three months, the stock is likely to end its slumber and may show outperformance.

32,2019-04-26,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is not expecting a sweeping majority for the Narendra Modi-led BJP in these elections.

In fact, he is waiting for a possible dip in the market post election outcome, which he says could offer an attractive buying opportunity.

“The market may go down 5-10 per cent if something unexpected happens. But innately I have never felt so bullish in my life. I am a bull,” he told ETNOW in a recent interview.

Data available with corporate database AceEquity suggests several of Jhunjhunwala’s pet stocks like Lupin, Escorts, CRISIL, Delta Corp and VIP Industries have not delivered good returns this election year.

He has, however, made a killing on his biggest bet, Titan Company. The Big Bull’s investment in Titan accounts for a major chunk of his $3 billion fortune.

Lupin shares are up a mere 2 per cent for this calendar. The Big Bull holds Lupin shares worth Rs 760-odd crore even when analysts are concerned over the regulatory overhang on four of its key facilities. Jhunjhunwala recently called pharma a ‘sunrise’ sector.

Shares of Escorts have gained 6 per cent this year against an 8 per cent rise in the Sensex. Analysts say the company’s medium-term goal of gaining 15 per cent share in the domestic tractor market and doubling exports volumes by FY22 are achievable. Jhunjhunwala holds nearly Rs 750 crore worth of Escorts shares.

CRISIL, Delta Corp and VIP Industries are three other top stocks in his portfolio, which are down 4-10 per cent year to date. The Big Bull holds Rs 250-400 crore worth of shares in these companies.

Titan has jumped 22 per cent so far this calendar. At Thursday’s closing price, the combined holding of the billionaire investor and his better half Rekha Jhunjhunwala on this counter would be worth Rs 7,100 crore.

Analysts said stocks like Titan are long-term structural plays: to be bought and held.

“Titan is the biggest beneficiary of the shift from an unorganised to organised market. We have been liking the stock since 2016. It was expensive back then. It is more expensive today. But the fact remains that the composition of the organised trade in the Rs 2 lakh crore jewellery market is still below 20 per cent. Hence, Titan a multi-year growth story. Do you want to sell it today and then regret later? The answer is obviously no,” said Gautam Duggad of Motilal Oswal Securities.

DB Realty has been Jhunjhunwala’s worst hit portfolio stock. The scrip is down 44 per cent year to date. DHFL, Among some of his other bets, Bilcare, The Mandhana Retail Ventures and Autoline Industries are down between 20 per cent and 42 per cent.

But Jhunjhunwala looks unperturbed. In fact, he would still be a buyer if there is a correction because of an adverse election outcome.

SpiceJet, where Jhunjhunwala owns shares worth some Rs 100 crore, has rallied 47 per cent so far this calendar, making it the best performer in the portfolio of the Big Bull. 

In his interview with ETNow, Jhunjhunwala said he does not see the BJP winning a complete majority in the ongoing election, but expects it to be a dominant player in the next government.

 “I do not think it will need support from parties other than the current NDA partners to form a government. Economically and philosophically, nothing is going to change in India for next four-five years. Having said that, I feel governments have actually not made much difference to India,” he said.

Jhunjhunwala said that any dip in the market due to elections will be is an opportunity to buy. “I do not have any money (surplus) at the moment. So, I cannot buy. That is why I feel very cautious. But I am extremely bullish,” he said."

2,2019-05-05,Titan,"NEW DELHI: A host of triggers are likely to help benchmark indices move out of rangebound trading next week. While quarterly earnings will drive stock-specific actions, economic data such as March factory output and manufacturing growth prints, fifth phase of elections and progress of US-China trade talks will be keenly followed. 

Oil prices, rupee-dollar exchange rate and foreign flow trend will also be tracked keenly. 

For the week gone by, BSE Sensex fell 104.07 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 38,963, while NSE’s Nifty50 fell 42.40 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 11,712. 


Here are key factors to watch out for next week: 


US-China trade deal
A Chinese delegation will arrive in Washington on Wednesday (May 8) to discuss the proposed trade deal. Donald Trump on Friday said the trade negotiations with China were going on pretty well. The comment by the US President came after White House’s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney earlier this week said the trade dispute with Beijing will likely be resolved “one way or the other” within the next two weeks. A report by CNBC quoting sources suggested that a trade deal could be announced by Friday this week. 


Q4 earnings
A total of 216 companies will report March quarter earnings in the coming week, BSE data suggests. Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank and Marico will declare results on Monday, Vedanta, Escorts and CEAT on Tuesday, Titan Company and Dhanlaxmi Bank on Wednesday, HCL Tech and Apollo Tyres on Thursday and SBI, L&T, Eicher Motors and Allahabad Bank on Friday.


IIP, manufacturing growth data 
On Friday, investors would like to know whether the industrial output growth improved in March from a 20-month low of 0.1 per cent hit in February. The factory output last month was hurt mainly due to a contraction in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, the numbers on manufacturing output to be released the same day will also be watched. Meanwhile, Nikkei India PMI Services data for April will be released on Monday. The three data prints will give cues on the state of the economy. 


5th phase of elections
The fifth phase of voting in the general elections will take place on Monday. Voting will happen in 51 Lok Sabha constituencies across seven different states. After four phases of elections, the voting percentage stood at 67 per cent, comparable with 67.6 per cent reported in 2014. Equirus Securities said flattish turnout has historically proved to be good for an incumbent party. 


Global economic releases
Among global cues, investor will watch Euro zone’s retail sales figures on Monday, China’s foreign reserves data on Tuesday, its trade data on Wednesday and CPI and PPI data on Thursday, and US’ CPI numbers and Baker Hughes oil rig count on Friday will be watched keenly.


Oil, rupee movement
Investors are keenly waiting to see if the recent fall in crude oil prices was temporary. A drop in crude prices will help the rupee appreciate or vice versa. Data suggests Brent crude futures settled at $70.85 a barrel on Friday, down 2.6 per cent for the week, snapping a five-week rising streak. US crude futures on the other hand fell around 3 per cent for the week to $61.94 a barrel.


Foreign flows
Foreign flows into India were pretty strong at Rs 72,394 in the last three months. That said, inflows in April at Rs 21,193 crore were down 37 per cent from March’s record flows of Rs 33,980 crore. In May so far, FPIs have pulled out Rs 367.30 crore from domestic equities."
6,2019-05-06,Titan,"NEW DELHI: In line with its global peers, Indian equities suffered strong losses on Monday as renewed worries over the US-China trade tussle jolted markets across the globe. 

Hopes of an amicable solution to the US-China trade tussle were dashed after US President Donald Trump vowed to hike tariffs on Chinese goods later this week.

Major markets the world over felt the tremor, with China’s SSE Composite Index falling 6 per cent. 

“Global cues dented sentiment. The renewed trade tension between the US and China is not a good sign for the market,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head Research at ICICI Securities.

Sensex and Nifty shut shop with a cut of nearly 1 per cent each.


Let's take a look at the highlights of Monday's session:

Investors lose Rs 1.24 lakh cr in a dayMonday's losses made investors poorer by Rs 1.24 lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 1,50,37,619 crore from Rs 1,51,62,013 20 crore on Friday. In the last four sessions of losses, investors have lost more than Rs 2.71 lakh crore. 


YES Bank leads losers’ packShares of YES Bank led the pack of losers in the Sensex. Shares of the private lender closed 5.30 per cent lower at Rs 166.30 after domestic rating agency Icra downgraded its long-term bond ratings and guided for a negative outlook. The scrip broke the winning run of last two sessions. “The bank's intention of cleaning up its balance sheet is good and it is on the road to recovery. However, it will take time,” said Pankaj Pandey. 


Tata Steel extends lossesFalling for the third consecutive session, shares of Tata Steel closed 2.20 per cent down at Rs 535.55. In the last three sessions, the stock has come off nearly 4 per cent. A Financial Times report suggested that Brussels may block the merger between Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp, a German multinational conglomerate. Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp have proposed a 50:50 joint venture in Europe by combining their steel operations to form the region’s second-biggest steelmaker. 


Strides Pharma shares plunge 5%Strides Pharma Science said the USFDA has classified its Puducherry facility as official action initiated (OAI) for non-compliance of norms following an inspection. Shares of the company closed 5.25 per cent down at Rs 457.


Firstsource Solutions shares rise on Q4Smallcap BPO firm Firstsource Solutions posted a 5.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 98.2 crore for the quarter ended March 2019. The stock closed 3.37 per cent up at Rs 50.60. 


Reliance Capital plunges 7%Extending the losses into the second session, shares of Reliance Capital closed 7.22 per cent down at Rs 126.65 amid fresh pressure from rating downgrades and upcoming maturities. Rating company Icra has downgraded the short-term ratings on two Anil Ambani-led entities – Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial Finance – recently. 


ICICI Bank in the red ahead of Q4Shares of ICICI Bank slipped 0.11 per cent to Rs 401.40 ahead of its March quarter results. Post market hours, the bank reported a 5 per cent drop in fourth quarter profit at Rs 969 crore on lower treasury income and higher expenses. 


Vodafone Idea shares climb 2%Shares of Vodafone Idea settled 1.86 per cent higher at Rs 16.40 after the promoters infused Rs 17,920 crore into the company via the Rs 25,000 crore rights issue. Besides, the company has inked a new $700-800 million (Rs 4,900 crore-5,600 crore) 5-year technology outsourcing contract with IBM that is expected to contribute a major part to the Rs 8,400 crore annual opex savings target of the company which it has set to achieve by FY21. 


HUL shares fall after Q4Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) fell 1.21 per cent to finish at Rs 1,672.35, following lesser-than-expected March quarter numbers. The company reported a 14 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 1,538 crore for March quarter, which was below Rs 1,617 crore profit estimated by analysts in an ETNow poll.

10,2019-05-07,Titan,"Titan Company is slated to announce its March quarter earnings on Wednesday. Market projections showed the company may report double-digit growth in net profit as well as net sales for Q4FY19.

Emkay Global Financial Services expects Titan to post 19.70 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in profit after tax and 16.70 per cent and 17.80 per cent YoY rise in net sales and Ebitda, respectively. 

“Titan is likely to report healthy top line growth due to strong performance of its jewellery segment, which is projected to grow 17 per cent amid a subdued industry environment,” the brokerage said in a report.

It estimated a 10 basis points margin expansion, largely driven by watches as comparables for jewellery are high.

Sharekhan expects Titan to post 19.7 per cent YoY revenue growth on the back of an uptick in demand in the jewellery segment driven by the ongoing wedding season.

However, it sees a 62 basis points YoY drop in operating profit owing to increasing gold prices, jewellery being the major segment of the business. The brokerage projects 30 per cent YoY rise in net profit in Q4FY19.

Prabhudas Lilladher sees 2.50 per cent YoY rise in adjusted PAT for Titan on 18.80 per cent and 20.50 per cent growth in net sales and Ebidta. Titan is aiming for 20 per cent revenue growth for FY20 despite muted industry demand growth."

7,2019-05-07,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Another week has gone by, but NSE barometer Nifty50 has failed to break past the crucial 11,550-11,850 range.

This range has been intact since March end. If one were to go by history, the month of May in election years has been known for wild market swings, suggesting that the index may send out some directional cues sooner than later. 

For now, the index looks rangebound with seven constituents showing a bearish bias, as suggested by the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled a bearish crossover – a sign of bearish undertone – on these counters, hinting at possible downsides.








These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Tata Steel, Coal India, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Auto, Titan Company, UPL and Zee Entertainment. Among non-Nifty stocks Indiabulls Real Estate, Bank of Maharashtra, Havells India, Zee Media, SJVN, Gujarat State Petronet, Dr Lal Pathlabs and Motilal Oswal Financial Services are among 29 other stocks sending out weak signals.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed there are 20 stocks, mostly smallcaps, which have been showing bullish trends. The list included Uniply Industries, Raymond, Deepak Nitrate, Birla Corporation, Cimmco, Bhansali Engineering and Mold-Tek Technologies.





The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, its sharp fall on Monday to an extent was led by global weakness. “We need to see how the index reacts around the 11,550 mark. A close below this level may confirm an intermediate top, which may pull the index towards 11,350. If we hold the level, we may see a bounceback to fill Monday’s bearish gap between 11,630 and 117,00 levels,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking. 

The technical analyst advised traders to keep positions light in such volatile conditions and avoid undue risk.

“The recent distribution occurred near the upper end of a triangular pattern, but the index tumbled towards the lower end. As per the number of legs, the triangular pattern seems to be nearing completion. This is a high probability area for the next legup to kick in,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst Sharekhan said on Monday.

On Tuesday, the index traded at 11,640.40, up 42.15 points, or 0.36 per cent at the time of writing this copy. 

Understanding MACD

Investment rationale:

The guidance of 20 per cent growth in jewellery sales during FY20, expected gains from backward integration and proactive strategy in eyewear and the success of new collections in watches are the factors that helped the brokerage maintain its positive stance on Titan.

Analyst calls
• IIFL has maintained reduce rating on Kansai Nerolac Paints with a target price of ₹410. Continued strength in decorative and powder coatings segments is likely to offset weakness in auto coatings and support FY20 growth, the brokerage said. 

• Anand Rathi has upgraded DFM Foods to buy and revised target price higher to ₹361. DFM’s growth momentum will persist, bolstered by its three focus areas: innovative marketing, distribution expansion and introducing products, said Anand Rathi.. The brokerage said it is optimistic on the company with the new products gaining traction and boosting overall growth and profitability. 

• CLSA has maintained sell rating on Vedanta and revised target price to ₹135 from ₹170. The 14-34% rally in zinc and oil prices is benefiting Vedanta as these form 80% of its EBITDA, said CLSA. On the flip side, the slow volume ramp-up in zinc and oil as well as increased costs in Hindustan Zinc are concerns, it added. CLSA believes that concerns of related party transactions and the future use of cash will overshadow earnings outlook. 

• CIMB Securities has maintained add rating on Escorts with a target price of ₹938. The brokerage believes Escorts will continue to outperform in terms of tractor volumes and market share gain. After the recent stock price correction of 17% in April, the stock is looking attractive at 9 times FY21 price-to-earnings considering compounded growth of 14% in earnings per share over FY20-FY21. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Jyothy Laboratories and revised fair value to ₹200 from ₹210. Jyothy Lab's fourth quarter earnings print was weak on all fronts with subdued topline growth and sharp margin decline, off a high base, it said. The company's growth guidance appears ambitious in the backdrop of the current business momentum and demand slowdown suggested by larger players, it added.

Board meetings (Full list)



Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on KEC International with a target price of ₹350. KEC's fourth quarter numbers were a mixed bag-while revenue and EBITDA missed estimates, balance sheet improvement was encouraging, said Edelweiss. While order book and order pipeline are healthy, the management's 15-20% revenue guidance for FY20 looks a tad on the lower side, probably indicating persistence of a few domestic execution challenges, the brokerage said..

• Anand Rathi has maintained buy rating on Visaka Industries with a target price of ₹495. Higher selling and branding expenses along with losses due to a delay in the Jhajjar plant commencement and losses in ATUM resulted in Visaka’s restrained operating performance in the fourth quarter, said Anand Rathi. The yarn division’s better performance is another positive, said Anand Rathi. 

• CLSA has maintained sell rating on Shriram Transport Finance Company with a target price of ₹ 960. The brokerage expects a pick-up towards second half with 14%-15% growth in AUM in FY20-21. Asset quality showed some improvement with a fall in stage-3 loans to 8.4%, but the brokerage is concerned by aggressive growth in rural markets and business loans. Clarity on the group structure is awaited and may be a medium-term overhang, said CLSA. The stock ended up 0.29% at ₹1,030.85 on Thursday.

• Jefferies has maintained hold rating on Titan Company with a target price of ₹1,100. Titan continues to execute strongly in terms of design aspect, new customer acquisition and store expansion coupled with strong market share gains continuing since demonetisation given industry headwinds, said Jefferies. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained buy rating on Brigade Enterprises with a target price of ₹290. Brigade ended FY19 with a strong performance on the residential business, with 83% YoY growth in pre-sales at ₹16.5 billion and an exit quarter performance of ₹5.2 billion, aspiring for a 30% YoY increase in FY20 on the higher base, the brokerage said.

24,2019-05-10,Titan,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Consumer Durables index was up in Friday's afternoon session with most of its components trading higher.

The S&P BSE Consumer Durables index was trading 0.27 per cent up at 23,027.64 around 12:16 pm. 

Shares of VIP Industries (up 1.39 per cent), Whirlpool of India (up 1 per cent) and Titan Company (up 0.67 per cent) were trading higher. 

TTK Prestige (up 0.54 per cent), Voltas (up 0.16 per cent) and Rajesh Exports (up 0.12 per cent) too were among the top performers in the index. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 19.30 points at 11,321.10 while the BSE Sensex was up 73.77 points at 37,632.68. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 22 were trading in the green, while 28 were in the red. 

Shares of Vodafone Idea, PC Jeweller, YES Bank, Suzlon Energy, Tata Motors, South Indian Bank, Dish TV India, Reliance Capital, Vakrangee and Spicejet were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
25,2019-05-10,Titan,"Ambit Capital has given a buy recommendation on Titan Company with a target price of Rs 1,250.

Shares of Titan Company traded at Rs 1,116.5 around 1:10 pm on 10 May, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 


March quarter highlights:



Titan’s fourth quarter sales grew 19 per cent, while Ebitda and PBT rose 31 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively.
The top-line growth of Jewellery segment was strong at 21 per cent while margins improved by nearly 60bps, excluding inventory losses in gold jewellery in fourth quarter.
Watches had a weak quarter with 8 per cent growth year-on-year (YoY). Ebit declined 18 per cent YoY due to adverse product mix (wearables) and provisioning of one-time employee bonus.
TEAL witnessed 42 per cent growth sales growth YoY. Caratlane (nearly 70 per cent stake by Titan) grew 44 per cent and also witnessed margin expansion due to better product mix. Titan took a write-off of Rs 70 crore as it impaired its investments in subsidiary Favre Leuba.


Investment rationale:

""Our target price of Rs 1,250 implies 49 times FY21 EPS and 29 per cent earnings per share (EPS) CAGR over FY19-21,"" said the brokerage.

The brokerage sees a $20 billion wedding jewellery market a big opportunity for Titan where its share is below 1 per cent. As GST compliance is increasing, Titan’s competitiveness is improving against local jewellers.

As per the brokerage, investments in wedding jewellery, extending presence in occasion wear and high-value diamonds, and growth in GHS from new customers provide visibility of sustained 20 per cent growth for Titan over next decade. ""Management remains positive on jewellery demand with 20 per cent guidance for the next year. Higher number of wedding days and market-share gains are likely to aid this growth despite a weaker industry environment,"" the brokerage said.

Titan has also shown the ability to incubate new businesses over longer periods and has withstood competition. 

The sizeable cash flows from jewellery and watches can cushion losses from entry into new formats, such as Taneira and eyewear, the brokerage said. 

""Titan’s jewellery and watch businesses will continue to generate good cash flows even after funding their own aggressive expansion,"" the brokerage said."

BAJAJ FINANCE
CMP: Rs 3,447.70 Change in last 5 years: 1,852%

BRITANNIA INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 2,851.25 Change in last 5 years: 560%

Britannia did well in the last five years since new CEO Varun Berry was appointed in March 2014, just before the NDA was elected, said analysts. “He implemented a lot of strategy changes that resulted in margin expansion and return ratio expansion. The stock was adequately rewarded for this,” said Deepak Jasani, head of research at HDFC Securities. Jasani said the stock may not repeat its strong show in the next five years due to stretched valuations and a high base.


TITAN COMPANY
CMP: Rs 1,240.45 Change in last 5 years: 304%

The implementation of GST and lower corporate governance levels in other listed jewellery stocks made investors shift to Titan, said independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga. “Titan’s corporate governance was never under any question.

HAVELLS INDIA
CMP: Rs 756.35 Change in last 5 years (%): 302%

Jasani of HDFC Securities said Havells has transformed itself from an industrial to a consumer facing company with strong focus on brands, mass premium markets, innovation and strong distribution across the country. “Investors recognised the moat in their business and pushed up the stock prices,” said Jasani. He believes the stock may not repeat its superlative performance in the next five years as valuations are high.


PIDILITE INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 1,212.30 Change in last 5 years: 289%

Demand revival, entry in new markets and adjacent categories, and anticipated demand shift from unorganised to organised players are likely to boost Pidilite’s revenue and earnings, said Abneesh Roy, senior vicepresident-institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities. Roy is optimistic on Pidilite Industries – which is a market leader in the adhesives segment, due to anticipated demand recovery and market leadership.


PAGE INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 22,526.8 Change in last 5 years: 280%

Page has underperformed in the last one-and-a-half years because of expensive valuation, consumer slowdown and margin pressure, it is one of the outperformers in the last five years, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets and corporate affairs at IIFL. “The management is very competent and the brand value of Jockey is immense. It is one of the best consumer companies in the midcap space,” said Bhasin.


BIOCON
CMP: Rs 519.6 Change in last 5 years: 263%

India’s largest bio-pharma company Biocon is expected to perform well going ahead as well, said analysts.

HDFC BANK
CMP: Rs 2405.1 Change in last 5 years: 199%

Investor favourite HDFC Bank’s profit has grown at a compounded rate of 20.6% over the last five years. “Considering the healthy balance sheet growth, superior asset quality and management, the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios.

KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK
CMP: Rs 1495.50 Change in last 5 years: 230%

EICHER MOTORS
CMP: Rs 21,221.85 Change in last 5 years: 233%

After rallying sharply over the years, the stock may face headwinds going ahead. There seems to be brand fatigue for Royal Enfield in metro cities which is visible in sharp moderation in same store sales, said HSBC. “The stock is facing sector headwinds as well as product headwinds. It could underperform going forward,” said independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga.


ASIAN PAINTS
CMP: Rs 1,366.75 Change in last 5 years: 155%

51,2019-05-27,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Seven battered stocks from Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's portfolio have rebounded smartly in the Modi 2.0 wave.

These stocks were down 20-40 per cent, but the post-election rally in domestic stocks since the exit polls has lifted these battered stocks up to 25 per cent, helping them cut some of the year-to-date losses.

Overall, 19 of 28 Jhunjhunwala stocks are still in the red for calendar 2019 so far, but his largest bet Titan Company has made sure his portfolio remains in the pink of health. 

Shares of Anant Raj, which will be announcing quarterly earnings on Thursday, has climbed 23.81 per cent since May 20, after falling 24 per cent between January 1 and May 17. With this, the scrip has cut year-to-date losses to 6 per cent. Jhunjhunwala held 3.2 per cent stake in this firm as of March 31.

Delta Corp, owner of Asia's largest live offshore gaming casino, rallied 20 per cent in Modi 2.0 wave after falling 35 per cent in 2019 earlier. The scrip is still down 22 per cent year to date. This stock had come under selling pressure on reports of alleged GST evasion, which the company denied. 

Shares of Edelweiss Financial Services are now in the green year to date, as a 19 per cent rally in the stock since exit polls erased 15.62 per cent loss it had suffered earlier in the year. 

“India has moved above old vote bank politics, pseudo-secularism and casteism to mature politics. The country is going to see good economic policies and creation of a far more prosperous India,” Jhunjhunwala told ET Now in rection to the election outcome on May 23.

“This mandate is to make them do what is right and what is realistic. This mandate is for growth and development and for the fulfillment of India’s aspiration,” he said .

Prozone Intu Properties, Aptech, Escorts and TV18 Broadcast are a few other Jhunjhunwala stocks, which have gained 11-15 per cent in past few days after falling 20-30 per cent earlier this year.

14,2019-06-11,Titan,"Earnings growth being restricted to only few sectors has restricted the scope for new investment ideas across market capitalisations. The difficulties are compounded by the not-so-encouraging improvement in private capital expenditure in recent years. In such a situation, it makes sense to focus on large-sized companies, which offer stability to the portfolio. 

Dominant market share, high return ratios, steady cash flows, consistent dividend paying record and relatively better balance sheets ensure consistency in earnings. For conservative investors, these factors are important as they ensure that share prices of large-sized companies is not as volatile as mid and small-sized companies. 

Among large-cap schemes, investors can consider SBI Bluechip with an investment horizon of at least five years. A key characteristic of the scheme is that it stays away from momentum stocks and focuses on themes which do well only in the long-term. 

Besides its low expense ratio, the scheme’s fund manager Sohini Andani has been focusing on companies that have certain distinct advantage even among large-sized companies. For instance, Andani has invested in Shree Cement due to its cost efficiency even if it is not the largest cement manufacturer. 

In the past five-year and ten-year periods, the scheme has given 13% and 12% returns, respectively while peers in the same category have given average returns of 10% and 11% returns, respectively.

The scheme follows a combination of value and growth style of investing. Its conservative investment decisions has led to its under performance during sustained bull runs when compared to its peers and benchmarks in the recent past. However, it has been an outperformer over longer periods of time when markets complete two to three cycles."

22,2019-06-14,Titan,"Domestic equity barometer Sensex fell for the third consecutive session on Friday, mirroring similar trends in global markets.

“Other than the weak global sentiment, the liquidity crisis in the NBFC sector and reports of defaults and corporate mismanagements are keeping the market down,” said Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst for Fundamental Research at Choice Broking.

He said the market is correcting because of high valuations. The momentum may change after the Budget.

Rupee’s weakness against the US dollar also influenced market mood. The domestic unit fell by 34 paise intraday against the greenback. 

Sensex ended 289 points, or 0.73 per cent, down at 39,452, while Nifty finished 91 points lower at 11,823. During the week, Sensex and Nifty shed 0.41 per cent each.

Yes Bank at five-year low
Shares of Yes Bank closed at Rs 115.35, down 1.58 per cent, near its five-year low. With this, the stock extended losses into the third consecutive session, losing 17 per cent. Bloomberg data showed about 18.2 lakh shares of the private lender changed hands in a block deal on Friday, whose buyers and sellers were not known immediately. 


RCap, Reliance Home Finance extend losses
Shares of Reliance Capital fell 9.30 per cent to Rs 76.55 while those of Reliance Home Finance declined 4.01 per cent to Rs 14.35, extending their losing streak into the third consecutive session. Media reports suggested that Sebi and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs are looking into the sudden resignation of PwC as auditor of both companies and have asked stock exchanges to collect necessary information, including trade details and statements made by the three entities.


Jet plunges to all-time low 
Shares of Jet Airways tanked over 13 per cent to hit an all-time low of Rs 79.65 after reports that DGCA has cancelled critical authorisations to Jet Airways’ engineering department. However, the stock pared losses later in the day to close at Rs 82.05, down 10.77 per cent.

23,2019-06-17,Titan,"BENGALURU: For 13-year-old Raina Pradhan, shopping is an ordeal as she listlessly scans the racks hoping to find something aligned with global youth fashion. What she mostly gets are routine childlike collections, often with cartoon prints. Unable to find hip styles, the tween shops at Forever21, the American fast fashion brand for slightly older people.

“Clothes with Disney characters are kiddish. It is hard to find trendy clothes as sizing is either too small or big. So I shop for the smallest size or whatever fits in the adult sections of brands,” Pradhan said.

T-shirts featuring Disney characters or bubble-gum coloured eye frames don’t cut it for India’s tweens and high-schoolers; neither kids nor adults. Aged between 9-15 years and practically born with smartphones and social media accounts, they are the new target segment for brands geared towards these young consumers who are beginning to make their own style choices.

“Increasing access, double-income households, brand consciousness and independent mindset shift in kids have contributed to the growth of this category. This age bracket has also nudged out hand-me-downs and cheaper export-reject options,” said Vineet Gautam, CEO of Bestseller India, referring to high-schoolers as fashion influencers and opinion-makers of the future.


Source: Euromonitor Jack and Jones, a menswear brand by Danish company Bestseller, extended its product portfolio to kidswear division by launching a junior range aimed at boys from 8-15 years. The apparel line comprises scaled-down sized garments of adult designs like slim-fit distressed jeans, mandarin collar and corduroy shirts to sweat pants that mirror mature colour stories.

Tweaking merchandise mix, introducing fashion that imitate adult clothing and accessories and having a smaller size within adult range is what several brands like US Polo, Flying Machine, Titan and Lifestyle are doing to woo this demographic segment.

“It is an important segment for us and a bridge between children and adults. It is also a starting point in exploring kids as an opportunity,” said J Suresh, chief executive officer of Arvind Fashions that started ‘dress like father’ campaign for US Polo. “For Flying Machine, we introduced an S size that fits young teens,” he added.

Retailers are aware of this. Tata Group-owned Titan Company’s optical retail brand Titan Eyeplus is expanding its styles in prescription eyewear range. “The target age has dropped from 18-24 years to 15-year-olds. We have been seeing the shift for last couple of years but manifestation is happening now,” said Shalini Gupta, marketing head for Titan Eyeplus.

“High-schoolers across Tier 1, 2 and 3 cities are driven and behaving like adults now. Timelines have collapsed for this selfie-generation who want to be aligned with global trends,” added Gupta. Retail experts also note that a large portion of the kidswear market is unorganised sector, that is gradually shifting towards branded segment helped by rising aspiration, frequent socialising, international travel and children’s fashion on social media.

Dubai-based Landmark Group that owns Lifestyle International is clearly delinking highschool segment from younger children. They have recently started stocking dedicated lines from brands such as Bossini and Kappa that offer sized-down versions of adult apparel for children aged between 9-15 years.

“With no brands specifically targeting this segment, a highschooler currently remains underserved in the market. By the time children reach this stage, they have their own fashion preference and constantly seek to establish identity,” said Vasanth Kumar, MD of Lifestyle International."

26,2019-06-18,Titan,"As NSE benchmark Nifty slipped for the second straight session on Monday, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled downward crossovers for 99 counters on NSE, suggesting that these stocks may see further downside in the days ahead.

The 50-share index ended Monday’s session 151 points lower at 11,672.

Among the stocks that saw bearish crossovers were Adani Power, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Industries, IDBI Bank, NTPC, Titan Company, Adani Ports, Jubilant Foodworks, Amara Raja Batteries, Future Retail, KEC International, Tata Steel BSL and Wockhardt, among others.

Some of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes in recent time, adding further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Others included Sadbhav Engineering, Venky’s (India), Birla Cable, Ipca Laboratories, Minda Corporation, Pennar Industries and Future Enterprises.

On the other hand, only 10 stocks including Apollo Tyres, Aurobindo Pharma, Glenmark Pharma, Nava Bharat Ventures, Godrej Agovet, CCL Products, Crest Ventures, Mayur Uniquoters, Sanghvi Forging and The Grob Tea showed bullish crossovers on MACD charts on NSE, indicating a bullish bias. 

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD moves below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see a downward movement and vice versa. 



However, the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call based on this indicator alone, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio. 

Market veterans say the MACD alone is not good enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

“Since last few days, there has been no respite from the downward move, but looking at the broader picture we are still not convinced about the same. Hence, we advise traders not get carried away by this correction and stay prepared for an upward swing if buying emerges at lower levels,” said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst for Technicals and Derivatives at Angel Broking.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Bharti Airtel shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show an downward momentum and vice versa. 

On Monday, the stock fell 2.77 per cent to close at Rs 345.90 on NSE."

33,2019-06-21,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Thursday's buoyancy in domestic equities, owing to short-covering in recently oversold stocks, fizzled out on Friday, as a fresh spell of across-the-board selling left the benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty, deep in red.

Analysts said it is a sell-on-rise market, as lingering domestic as well as global concerns over liquidity crisis, trade tensions persist and geopolitical tension in West Asia have turned investors risk averse.

""Cautious global sentiment amid trade war and geopolitical tensions is weighing on investor sentiment. At home, concerns over the health of NBFCs and slow progress of monsoon kept risk appetite in check,"" said Siddharth Sedani, Head VP- Equity & Portfolio Advisory at Anand Rathi Financial Services.

The market is volatile and slightly nervous ahead of the Budget, but will stabilise after this major event, he added. 

Sensex ended the day 407 points, or 1.03 per cent, lower at 39,194, while NSE’s Nifty settled 108 points, or 0.91 per cent, down at 11,724. For the week, Nifty slipped 0.84 per cent while Sensex retreated 0.65 per cent. It was the third straight weekly fall for Sensex while Nifty slipped for the fourth consecutive week.

Maruti shares on a bumpy rise 
Shares of Maruti Suzuki declined 3.39 per cent to settle at Rs 6,412.45 after global brokerage UBS downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ from ‘buy’, slashing price target by 27.5 per cent to Rs 5,800 per share from Rs 8,000. The brokerage said it was surprised by the sharp 20 per cent drop in volumes during April and May. 


TaMo rebounds to settle flat
After falling nearly 3 per cent in morning trade, shares of Tata Motors rebounded smartly to close almost flat at Rs 159. Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday downgraded Tata Motors’ corporate family rating (CFR) and senior unsecured instruments rating, citing sustained deterioration in the company's credit profile mainly on account of its British arm Jaguar Land Rover's weak performances.


Aurobindo Pharma down 4%
Shares of Aurobindo Pharma fell 3.92 per cent to finish at Rs 602.35 after it said it received a warning letter from the USFDA for its manufacturing facility situated at Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh.

34,2019-06-22,Titan,"The benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty declined over half a per cent during the week gone by amid fears over India’s retaliatory tariffs on US goods, ongoing NBFC crisis, soaring crude oil prices and concerns over poor progress in monsoon. 

The Sensex slipped 0.65 per cent to 39,194 for the week ended June 21. The index was at 39,452 on June 14. Similarly, the NSE Nifty dipped 0.84 per cent to 11,724 from 11,823 during the same period. 

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week:


Top Nifty gainers


ICICI Bank: Shares of ICICI Bank rallied 3.12 per cent to Rs 430.80 on June 21 from Rs 417.75 on June 14. During the week, ICICI Bank and IndoStar Capital Finance entered into sourcing and servicing arrangement to partner in extending credit to small and medium fleet owners to purchase used and new commercial vehicles. Under this partnership, IndoStar Capital Finance will originate and service the customers through the entire loan life-cycle including sourcing, documentation, collection and loan servicing and in turn, ICICI Bank will provide funding to these customers.


Power Grid: Shares of the company advanced 2.72 per cent to Rs 199.90 for the week ended June 21. Power regulator CERC has allowed state-owned transmission utility PowerGrid to offer towers to telecom companies for BTS (base trans-receiver station) installation to improve mobile connectivity, especially in remote rural areas. The move will not only address the issue of deficiency of telecom coverage in the country, particularly remote areas, but this segment could also be a money spinner for Power Grid. Besides, the power distribution utilities will get a share of income, which would eventually reduce the tariff burden on consumers. 


Top Nifty losers

UPL: Shares of agrochemicals maker UPL dropped over 11 per cent to Rs 890.10 during the week. According to HSBC Global Research, UPL appears at risk due to its global diversified exposure, but the near-term impact should be non-material.


Yes Bank: The private sector lender remained under pressure after Moody’s Investors placed the bank's ratings under review for a possible downgrade citing it high exposure to the struggling NBFC and realty sectors. The agency said the ongoing liquidity pressures on finance companies will negatively impact the credit profile of Yes Bank, given its sizeable exposure to weaker companies in the sector. The scrip declined 4.74 per cent to Rs 109.60 on June 21 from Rs 115.05 on June 14.


Stocks that rallied up to 21%
As many as 12 stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 5 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Hexaware Technologies (up 21 per cent), Suzlon Energy (10.17 per cent), Oberoi Realty (7.86 per cent), Syndicate Bank (7.56 per cent) and Dr Lal Pathlabs (7.21 per cent).


23 scrips that cracked
More than 20 stocks on the BSE500 plunged in double digits during the past five trading sessions. Jain Irrigation (down 33 per cent), Eveready Industries (down 21 per cent), Graphite India (down 19 per cent), SREI Infra (down 15.86 per cent) and Manpasand Beverages (down 14.42 per cent) stood among companies that went down over 10 per cent during the week. 


IPO update
IndiaMart InterMesh, an online marketplace for business products and services, on Friday said it has raised more than Rs 213 crore from 15 anchor investors by allotting 21,95,038 equity shares at a price of Rs 973, the upper band of its IPO which will open on June 24. ICICI Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, Birla Mutual Fund, Hornbill Capital Advisers LLP are among the 15 anchor investors.


Stocks @fresh all-time high
As many as nine stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs during the week. The list included some of the blue-chip stocks such as Titan Company, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance and Tata Consultancy Services. SRF, Godrej Properties, PI Industries, City Union Bank and Maharashtra Scooters also scaled new life peaks.


Scrips at fresh life lows
On the BSE500 index, The New India Assurance, General Insurance Corporation of India, Manpasand Beverages, Laurus Labs, Central Bank of India, Reliance Communications, Jet Airways, SH Kelkar, Reliance Power, Vodafone Idea, Eris Life and Reliance Infrastructure reeled and touched new all-time lows.


Sectoral update
Sector-wise, the BSE Consumer Durable, Realty and Power rallied more than 1 per cent during the week. However, the BSE Telecom, Auto, FMCG, Healthcare and Oil & Gas indices weakened between 1 per cent and 2.20 per cent.


Jet Airways
Shares of beleaguered aviation firm Jet Airways remained highly volatile during the week. On the NSE, the scrip jumped over 100 per cent in a day on Thursday. Still, it settled the week 11.70 per cent lower at Rs 72.50. Jimeet Modi, CEO, Samco Securities & StockNote said, “This week gone by saw the biggest speculative displacement in stocks like Jet Airways, which were fundamentally weak but witnessed spine-chilling movements on both directions. The reasons? Demand-supply mismatch, greed and fear, hopes and expectations – a clear reflection of emotional responses from investors all at once.”"
35,2019-06-24,Titan,"After the initial euphoria over the return of the BJP government, the equity market is looking uncertain again. There are several reasons why investors are shorn of confidence. The domestic economy is facing a consumption slowdown. NBFCs are reeling under a liquidity squeeze, forcing many to scale back operations. Market breadth remains very narrow.The trade war between an increasingly bellicose US and an equally unyielding China threatens to escalate further. Crude oil prices remain vulnerable to tensions erupting afresh in the Middle East. Bond markets across the globe have been flashing warning signs in recent months.Yet, there are some positive signs too. Domestic inflation remains low and interest rates are on the decline. With several conflicting indicators and mixed trends, investors can’t be faulted for their diffidence.How should investors navigate this maze of information which can help them make better investment decisions? Firstly, it is critical that investors interpret this news flow correctly. ET Wealth identified six critical signals that are defining the market sentiment. In the pages ahead, we examine each of these trends in detail and interpret the same for readers. Hopefully, this will help them take timely decisions to adjust their investment portfolios to improve their returns.Market breadth continues to be narrowIn the past year or so, only a handful of stocks have actually gone up, while the broader market has been listless. The market breadth, which is the ratio of stocks that are advancing or declining, has turned decidedly negative in the past three months. The ratio of advances-to-declines on the NSE has dropped from 1.08 in March to 0.59 in June. So, more stocks are losing value than seeing an uptick.More stocks declining than advancingThe market breadth has further narrowed in the past few months.

Experts say this is an outcome of a highly polarised corporate earnings growth. “Only a handful of companies are delivering double-digit earnings growth sustainably. Money is chasing this select set of stocks,” says Kunj Bansal, CIO and Partner, Acepro Advisors. When the market breadth narrows, the markets typically gravitate towards this creamy top layer of ‘quality’ stocks.5 scrips gave 97% of BSE 100 gains in a yearWhen the breadth narrows, markets gravitate towards quality stocks.

Analysts expect this phenomenon to continue for some time. The corporate showing in the coming months will give a clearer picture. The festival season will be in full swing and the impact of government spending during the election season will seep through by then. Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market expert, feels broader market participation is not expected in next few months. “I doubt the market will react positively to announcements in the Budget. Investors are more likely to wait for green shoots to be clearly visible.”Mid-cap valuations revert to discountWhen Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, mid-caps were trading at a significant discount to large-caps. But Modi’s election sparked a multi-year uptick in mid-caps. Expectations of faster growth in mid-caps on the back of a business-friendly government sent valuations soaring to stratospheric levels. However, with earnings not keeping pace with the rise in stock prices, the sentiment has now soured against midcaps. With frontline indices delivering healthy return on the back of a select few bellwether stocks, the valuation differential to mid-cap index is now reverting to near pre-2014 levels. The Nifty Midcap 100 index now trades at a PE of 31.5 compared to 61 barely a year ago. With this sharp correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has now become attractive, say experts. Many are suggesting that investors use this window to hike mid-cap exposure.Mid-cap valuation premium almost erodedAfter the correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has become more attractive.

The PE multiples of several mid-cap stocks have slid sharply. However, investors should not jump in because the mid-cap segment remains vulnerable to the slowdown and any liquidity crunch in the system. As the market focus shifts back to earnings growth and economic realities, any disappointments will push share prices further down.Valuations of some mid-caps have declined sharplyDespite the correction, some mid-caps are still not cheap.     Company Current PE 1 year ago PE   Indian Hotels Co  61.1 156.2   Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail  51.7 90.9   Jubilant Foodworks  54.2 85.4   Dilip Buildcon  30.3 57.4   Quess Corp  35.3 58.7   Bharat Forge  20.0 43.1   Godrej Agrovet  29.2 50.3   Sterlite Technologies  13.3 33.3   Sun TV Network  15.0 33.6   Escorts  14.7 32.6 Experts say that investors should stick to quality mid-caps. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital insists the valuations in mid-caps seem cheap on a relative basis. “These were overvalued earlier, and have not really become cheap now. Good quality mid-caps are still expensive,” he says. Sankaran Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, insists that investors should only take exposure to mid-caps through the SIP route with a longer investing horizon.Consumption demand is moderatingFor years, India’s consumption story powered the economy even when private investment flagged or global demand waned. In recent months, however, this consumption engine has developed a snag. Weak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a slowdown in demand. “Even structural trends are subject to cycles and there is little doubt that consumption is now showing signs of strain,” says Vetri Subramaniam, Group President & Head-Equity, UTI Mutual Fund. Automobile sales have steadily dwindled since October 2018. Nearly all major carmakers have revised sales projections downward citing weak consumer demand. Vehicle makers are cutting back production to clear the piling inventory at dealers. There is also a visible slump in demand for discretionary items like refrigerators, washing machines and other appliances. Even low-ticket essentials like toothpaste, shampoo and hair oil are reporting weak volumes.Consumer stocks have had a tough time on the bourses. However, barring a few exceptions, valuations have not softened much from earlier levels. On the contrary, several consumer stocks have seen multiples expand. Britannia Industries, Dabur India, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Voltas, Havells India and Titan Company are now significantly more expensive than before. Most consumer stocks will be vulnerable if earnings growth does not match up to market expectations.Many consumer stocks have tankedWeak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a demand slowdown.      Company CMP (Rs) PE  1 year price change (%)   Zee Entertainment Enterprises   338  20.7 -39.72   Mahindra & Mahindra   624  24.2 -31.61   Hero MotoCorp   2,648  15.6 -27.83   Maruti Suzuki India   6,582  26.5 -26.82   Page Industries   20,039  56.7 -25.36   TVS Motor Company   458  32.5 -22.98   United Spirits   539  59.5 -19.07   Godrej Consumer Products   658  28.7 -15.01   Avenue Supermarts   1,298  253.9 -14.67   Tata Power Company   65  8.0 -14.16 The ongoing monsoon will play a key role in how the consumption story pans out. An abundant monsoon is a crucial driver of rural sentiment and discretionary consumption. A week’s delay in onset of rains in the country lends no relief. Further, the India Meteorological Department has suggested that the strong El Nino weather pattern, which will keep rains muted, will likely only fade by August. This doesn’t bode well for consumer discretionary stocks, as lower disposable incomes will keep demand for high-value items subdued. Says Gupta, “Much of the slack is actually pent-up demand that is bound to come through in the coming months. But things could get worse before improving.”NBFCs facing severe liquidity crunchExperts say the consumption slowdown has been precipitated by tight liquidity conditions— particularly the cash crunch that has crippled NBFCs. With banks and mutual funds refraining from lending money to many such shadow banks since the IL&FS blowout, these have had to scale down their operations. This has shackled growth as NBFCs accounted for nearly a quarter of the credit growth in the past financial year. Much of this lending was for purchase of vehicles, appliances and other items. The revival of consumption partly hinges on the time it takes for liquidity conditions to normalise going ahead.NBFCs are now reworking their business models to tide over the liquidity crunch. The central bank has also proposed norms that will introduce liquidity buffers for NBFCs. As part of the new rules, NBFCs may have to set aside 60% of their net cash flows in government securities starting next year and gradually step it up in a phased manner. This is to ensure that the lenders have enough liquidity to fall back on in case of liquidity stress. But analysts point out these tougher norms could further crimp NBFCs that do not have a well-managed asset-liability situation. “The financially better placed NBFCs with strong sponsor support and well-established positioning in the ecosystem may be able to withstand it better than others,” says Jinay Gala, Senior Analyst, India Ratings and Research.Shares of several NBFCs have taken quite a beating over the past year. The fear of a contagion has led many to dump NBFC shares. Equity mutual funds have also cut their NBFC exposure sharply in recent months. Analysts suggest that investors should stick to NBFCs with strong parentage and healthy asset-liability positions.Several NBFC shares have taken a beatingFear of a contagion from IL&FS episode has led many to dump NBFC shares.      Company CMP (Rs) PBV 1 year price change (%)   Dewan Housing Finance Corp   77  0.3 -87.7   Reliance Capital   71  0.1 -83.2   SREI Infrastructure Finance   21  0.2 -71.6   Centrum Capital   27  3.3 -51.1   IIFL Finance   161  1.0 -50.9   IFCI   8  0.3 -48.9   Indiabulls Housing Finance   655  2.1 -45.4   Edelweiss Financial Services   176  2.5 -44.8   Indiabulls Ventures   273  8.6 -42.9   Shriram City Union Finance   1,422  1.6 -37.9 Entities like Bajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Manappuram Finance, LIC Housing Finance, L&T Finance, among others are better positioned. Other analysts, such as Gupta, suggest investors stay away from NBFCs for now. “Several NBFCs have very opaque structures. These firms have a problem and we don’t know the full extent of it yet.”Deleveraging by Indian companies continuesIn the last few years, several highly indebted firms had consciously embarked on reducing their debt burden. India Inc continues on this deleveraging trend. For the third straight year in 2018-19, domestic companies’ net debt-equity ratio showed improvement. In 2013-14, 61 BSE200 index companies had a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one, while 24 firms exhibited leverage in excess of three times. According to latest available data for these companies, 57 companies have a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one and only 20 companies reported a ratio higher than three. Further, the solvency position of these companies has also improved. Bansal argues, “The deleveraging exercise will separate the men from the boys. Stronger names will emerge leaner and fitter.”Many companies deleveraged in recent yearsThe solvency positions of these companies have also improved.

Data as on 17 JuneMajor corporations including Reliance Industries and Tata Group have also kickstarted a deleveraging exercise. RIL has partially reduced its debt by transferring Jio’s fibre and telecom tower assets and liabilities to two Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). The conglomerate is also planning stake sales in its refining and telecom businesses. Tata Steel, which accounts for nearly 90% of the Tata Group’s debt, plans to bring down its Rs 1 lakh crore debt burden to Rs 70,000 crore over the next few years. This process of deleveraging will improve profitability, but will take some time to seep through, reckon analysts. Gupta asserts, “Deleveraging is a lengthy process. It is best to stay away from highly leveraged companies even if they take steps to repair the balance sheet.”Inverted yield curve indicates recessionIn recent months, a prominent indicator of economic health has been flashing red across countries. The yields on long-term bonds are now lower than on short-term bonds. The yield is the return an investor gets on a bond. Typically, investors demand higher yields from longer-term bonds to compensate for the higher risk of keeping their money tied up for a longer period. But when yields on shorter term bonds rise above longer term bonds, it signals that the bond market is expecting trouble ahead. Such yield inversions have preceded several recessions in the past. The recent inversion in the US yield curve is the first since 2007, when the subprime crisis sent the economy into recession.Some nations are witnessing an inverted yield curveCountries not showing inversion now have done so in the recent past.     Country 2 year bond yield (%) 10 year bond yield (%)   Lebanon 11.88 11.04   Mexico 7.86 7.64   Canada 1.38 1.43   Japan -0.21 -0.13   Czech Republic 1.45 1.54   South Korea 1.49 1.60   Taiwan 0.49 0.70   United States 1.87 2.11   Singapore 1.70 1.96   Philippines 4.94 5.23   Norway 1.10 1.41 Apart from the US, several countries are witnessing the inverted yield curve. The phenomenon is not limited to developed countries. Even developing economies like Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Philippines have all flashed red at some point. Indian bond markets have not ventured into this territory yet. Also, experts maintain that the yield curve inversion is merely a transient phase and bond yields should normalise in the coming months."

37,2019-06-27,Titan,"There is a stark divergence between Nifty constituents on both performance and valuations with one segment trading at a substantial premium and the other at a huge discount to the long-term average, said domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, adding that there is limited headroom for valuation re-rating at index level given the continued downside risks.

Some of the stocks where valuations are at a substantial discount to long period average are Eicher Motors, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Coal India and ONGC, said the brokerage.

Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries, Titan Company, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever and UltraTech Cement are trading at a substantial premium to their respective five or ten-year average price-to-earnings or price-tobook multiples, said Motilal Oswal.

Predicting the timing of fortune reversal for these names is always fraught with risks, more so in the current underlying economic scenario, the brokerage said.

“This polarisation on performance and valuations clearly underscores two things: one, investors taking continued refuge in the quality/earnings predictability theme in an environment of economic slowdown and two, there is a lack of pick-up in broader market’s earnings growth,” said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage said that the revival in Nifty earnings in FY20 is predicated on normalisation of credit costs in the banking sector. The banking, financial services and insurance space is expected to account for 70% of incremental earnings for the Nifty in FY20, the brokerage said.

“At 19.5x FY20E P/E, we do not see material room for further valuation re-rate,” said Motilal Oswal.

ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, Titan, L&T, Coal India, Infosys, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki India are top large-cap ideas of Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage’s mid-cap picks include Federal Bank, DCB Bank, Indian Hotels, Crompton Consumer, KEC International, Ashoka Buildcon, Aditya Birla Fashion and Zensar."

13,2019-07-05,Titan,"Mumbai: Morgan Stanley has downgraded watch-to-jewellery maker Titan to equal-weight from overweight and kept the target price unchanged at Rs 1,300. The firm said Titan remains one of its favourite long-term plays on urban discretionary consumption growth in India but the re-rating in the stock is complete after the stock’s gain of over 40 per cent in the last six months.

“Following the strong trailing performance, we are now reluctant to push multiples beyond current levels. We see balanced risk-reward at the stock price,” said Morgan Stanley.

Shares of Titan Company ended down nearly 3 per cent at Rs 1,290.65 on Thursday. Titan shares have gained 54 per cent in the last one year. The company is seen as one of the beneficiaries of shift to organised sector after implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. The stock has also been a favourite with well-known investors of Dalal Street. Billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his wife Rekha owned 7.04 per cent stake in Titan at the end of March.


Morgan Stanley said its downgrade is a valuation call and it is not forecasting a downside to the numbers. “Our FY20 earnings estimate is 4 per cent above consensus. Even as long-term holders may continue to do well with Titan stock over time, we see less room for positive surprises in coming quarters,” said Morgan Stanley.

The firm said it prefers Jubilant FoodWorks over Titan.

“At our price targets, F21 P/E would be 46 times for Titan and 38 times for JUBI (Jubilant Food-Works). This must be viewed in the context of 25 per cent and 29 per cent FY19-21 earnings CAGRs for Titan and JUBI, respectively, which underscores our preference for JUBI over Titan,” the firm said. Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Jubilant FoodWorks with a target price of Rs 1,525."

21,2019-07-09,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Shares of watch and jewellery maker Titan slipped 12 per cent in trade on Tuesday after the company said its consumption during April-June took a hit due to rising gold prices. 

The scrip was on course to extend its slide into the fourth consecutive session.

Titan in its quarterly update on Monday said it witnessed a tough macro-economic environment with consumption being hit during April-June quarter due to rising gold prices. 

""Against this background, the company's growth, particularly in the jewellery segment, was lower than planned even though the gains in market share were sustained,"" the firm said in an exchange filing. 

Revenue in the jewellery division (Tanishq) saw a muted 13 per cent growth in the first quarter as a sharp increase in gold prices dented consumer demand significantly. 

However, the watch division, which retails watches under a range of brands including the premium Titan and the economy brand Sonata, saw revenue growth of 19 per cent, partly helped by a large institutional order from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a group company. 

The eyewear segment grew 13 per cent, aided by semi-annual activation that covered both Titan and Fastrack brands. 

Recently Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equal-weight from overweight, with a target at Rs 1,300.

MUMBAI: Shares of Titan Company plunged 12.3 per cent on Tuesday — the highest single day fall in three years on worries about the slowdown in its jewellery business — a unit that contributes almost 82 per cent to the firm’s revenues.

The weakness in the share price could persist till demand for jewellery revives led by softer gold prices or stock valuations become cheaper, said analysts.

“Till the time jewellery growth comes back or maybe when the company gives you some guidance how the demand is going to be, the stock may remain under pressure or continue to languish,” said Amnish Aggarwal, head of research at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher.

Titan’s jewellery segment posted a 13 per cent growth in revenues in the June quarter, below its full year guidance of 22 per cent, said Credit Suisse. The jewellery retailer said higher gold prices impacted demand.

Analysts said the extent of the fall in revenue growth in the company’s main business in April-June was one of the highest in recent years, disappointing investors who have been used to its consistent performance.

“The company was doing extremely well in the sense that numbers were beating estimates. But it always remained an over-owned and a high–priced stock,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president, IIFL Securities.

Titan, considered one of the flagbearers of India’s famed consumption story, has been among the top performers on the bourses in recent years. In last five years, Titan returned 336 per cent, while the Nifty gained 153 per cent.

The run-up in the share price had made Titan’s valuations expensive, leaving little room for disappointments. Credit Suisse, which downgraded the stock to neutral after the first quarter earnings, said its priceto-earnings ratio — a key valuation measure — at almost 48 times 2021estimated earnings is even higher than that of other large consumer staples and discretionary companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Britannia and Asian Paints.

A revival in demand for jewellery will be critical for investor interest to return to Titan. “The stock can only do well only if there are significant earnings upgrades, which now look unlikely given the near-term softness in growth,” said Credit Suisse.

Bhasin said a fall in the stock closer to Rs 1,000 would be a buying opportunity. The stock closed at Rs 1,099.10 after touching a low of Rs 1,072. “We think that in 1-2 months there should be a revival in consumption. By the festival season Titan will be regaining its form and heading back to where it was,” he said.


Navin Kulkarni, head of research, Reliance Securities expects the slump to last for three to six months.

“It’s a quality company and it should soon bottom out between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,050,” he said."

58,2019-07-22,Titan,"If earnings fail to take off in the first quarter of 2019-20, there could be a strong market sell-off, say experts. Fears of economic slowdown, global trade wars, the NBFC credit crunch, and high unemployment are some of the other issues that have the market worried. Even the Budget failed to cheer the investors. In such a situation, how does one pick winning stocks?

One way is to invest in fundamentally strong stocks that have reached the most number of highs over a given period. Stocks reach new highs when there is strong buying interest due to their promising prospects.

Looking at the new highs that the market indices have touched in the past five years using daily closing price data—1 July 2014 to 9 July 2019—the BSE500 Index has failed to touch a new high in 2019. The last high it touched was 15,846 on 31 August 2018. The BSE100 and the BSE200 touched four and one new highs respectively, whereas the BSE Sensex scaled eight new highs in 2019. In terms of the constituent stocks, 418 or nearly 84% of the BSE500 stocks failed to touch new highs in 2019 compared to their highs over the past five years. For stocks whose price data was not available for the past five years, we looked at the period from their listing date to 9 July 2019.

We filtered out the companies with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore and whose stocks hit new highs more number of times compared to the BSE100, the BSE200, BSE500 and the BSE Sensex in 2019. To determine the fundamental strengths of such stocks, their annual results for 2018-19 were analysed and those with substantial improvement in sales growth, operating profits (including other income) growth and adjusted EPS growth relative to 2018-19 were selected.

Out of these, we looked at stocks whose 12-month blended forward ROE was more than the 12-month blended forward ROE of the BSE500 index, as estimated by Bloomberg. Two additional filters were applied to filter out stocks covered by at least five Bloomberg analysts and those expected to appreciate by more than 10% over the next one year. Only the following five stocks passed all our filters.


Stocks that touched new highs in 2019
Analysts believe that this portfolio of stocks could give 15% average return over the next one year.

1. Heidelberg Cement India
A subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement Group, Germany that manufactures cement, concrete and building materials. According to a latest report by AnandRathi, the company's concentrated measures to improve operational efficiencies, shorter lead distances, additional power generation capacity, increasing proportion of premium cement volumes and greater utilization will improve its performance going forward. Moreover, with no major capacity additions by other cement companies where Heidelberg has operations and its strong product positioning would aid its future growth.


2. Inox Leisure
This company is engaged in the business of film exhibition. Analysts are bullish on it due to its strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2018-19—revenue rose 48% and Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) margin improved 6.8%. Moreover, the decent growth momentum in advertisements is likely to aid margin expansion. The company is likely to be a key beneficiary of favourable structural changes such as reduced Goods and Services Tax rates, which have led to higher ticket volumes, lower content risks and aided investment in new technologies.


3. Titan Company
It operates in the lifestyle space and is present in 32 countries, besides India. Titan’s business segments include jewellery, accessories, and eyewear. According to a recent report by JP Morgan, the company’s medium-term growth outlook remains good. It is supported by various initiatives to drive higher sales of wedding and fashion jewellery. Moreover, the company will benefit from a higher market share as jewellery purchases shift to organised players and the unorganised segment becomes less competitive.


4. Varun Beverages
This is a franchisee of carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages sold under the trademarks owned by PepsiCo. According to a research report by Yes Securities, the company’s recent acquisition of the PepsiCo franchise in the South and the West will provide it access to these regions with lower product penetration, reduce seasonality and will improve revenue and earnings visibility. The brokerage house feels that the stock is available at reasonable valuations and expects its return ratios to improve on account of better economies of scale and higher asset turnover.


5. Atul
An integrated chemicals company, Atul’s business segments include life science chemicals and performance and other chemicals. Analysts believe that the company’s strong balance sheet, strong cash flows and improving return ratios make it an attractive investment opportunity. Rising demand from industries that use chemicals and recognition of branded products will drive the company’s growth. Additionally, a focus on higher margin products, cost and operational efficiencies, coupled with strong pricing environment, will help the company sustain its Ebitda margin."

8,2019-08-05,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Jewellery and watch maker Titan Company may manage to report a double-digit profit growth for June quarter, but investors would brace for signs of slowdown when the company board announces quarterly numbers on Tuesday.

The Tata Group firm reported a double-digit jewellery volume growth in the past three quarters. But in June quarter demand got impacted due to higher gold prices resulting in a miss on the internal estimates despite sustained market share gains, said Prabhudas Lilladher.

“We estimate 10 per cent Jewellery volume growth on muted demand scenario on the back of high gold prices and 11.5 per cent EBIT margins. We expect the near-term demand scenario to remain muted as consumers usually postpone demand in such a scenario,” the brokerage said. Adjusted profit for the firm is seen rising 12.4 per cent o Rs 392.40 crore on a 13.5 per cent rise in sales to Rs 4,900 crore.

In its pre-quarterly update, Titan reported 13 per cent jewellery sales growth in June quarter against a FY20 guidance of 22 per cent, as high gold prices in June and weak macro hurt demand.

“We expect Titan to report 14 per cent revenue growth, led by 13 per cent growth in jewellery division as higher gold prices impact consumer demand significantly, especially in June. Watches & Eyewear segment to see a healthy growth of 19 per cent and 13 per cent YoY respectively. With Ebitda margins remaining largely flat we expect Ebitda/PAT growth of 13 per cent/14 per cent YoY for the quarter.” IDFC Securities said in a note.

Watch sales rose 19 per cent, benefitting from a large institutional order. “But, Ebitda is likely to be flattish, as jewellery margin is aided by healthy growth in studded sales, while watch margin is impacted by a low-margin institutional order and biennial dealer meet costs,” said IIFL Institutional Equities.

This brokerage sees profit for Titan rising mere 1.7 per cent on 13.8 per cent rise in sales.

Ebitda margin is seen at Rs 10.1 per cent against 11.5 per cent each in March quarter and the year-ago quarter."
9,2019-08-05,Titan,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a zigzag show on Monday amid signs of further escalation in the trade war, a steep fall in the yuan, uncertainty over a major law change on Kashmir and weakness in the rupee.

19,2019-08-08,Titan,"Shares of watch-to-jewellery maker Titan Company hit a sixmonth low on Wednesday as its June quarter result missed estimates and brokerages cut target price on the stock following the result due to concerns on demand.

Technical analysts see the stock staging a bounce back as it has fallen 18 per cent in the last one month, but the rebound is not seen sustaining because of rich valuations.

“The stock has support at Rs 950-960 levels at which it can be bought for a upside of Rs 70- 80 in the short term, said Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities.

The stock fell 3.8 per cent to a six-month low of 998.7 during the session on Wednesday but it recovered most losses to end 0.8 per cent lower at Rs 1,029.50 on Wednesday. Titan reported a 6 per cent year-on-year growth in standalone net profit at Rs 371 crore in the June quarter which was lower than consensus estimates. Standalone total income rose 14.7 per cent to Rs 4995.64 crore.

Chartered Market Technician Abhishek Karande said there may be a temporary bounce back in the stock till Rs 1,100 as it is oversold. However, this may not be a trend reversal, said Karande. He pegs support level for the stock at Rs 990.



The stock has been one of the most favoured bets of ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. The investor himself increased stake in the company in the June quarter. Jhunjhunwala and his wife Rekha held 7.05 per cent stake in Titan at the end of June, marginally higher compared to 7.04 per cent stake a quarter ago. However, a weak performance in the jewellery business in the June quarter and rise in import duty on gold from 10 per cent to 12 per cent in the budget has been weighing on the stock. Titan’s jewellery business grew 13.3 per cent in June quarter, hurt by a general slowdown and a 3.9 per cent jump in gold price. The company has guided for 20 per cent growth in the second half of FY20.

“Titan is likely to be the biggest beneficiary of the shift to organised trade. While FY20 estimate would be impacted due to softening demand, we expect the impact to taper off in FY21 given the discretionary nature of the category,” said CIMB Securities."
22,2019-08-08,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices ended with robust gains on Thursday, buoyed by reports that the government was considering the option of doing away with the income-tax surcharge on the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) registered as trusts. 

The government is exploring various options in order to check incessant outflow of the foreign funds from Indian financial markets and infuse positive sentiment. Media reports suggested that a review of the long-term capital gains (LTCG) is also on the cards. 

ETNow reported that the Finance Ministry was studying implications of withdrawing LTCG levy on gains from equity if held for over three years. Even an easing of the dividend distribution (DDT) tax is under consideration.

The rupee's rise against the US dollar and improved global sentiment also influenced market sentiment. ""The market got a breather towards close on hopes that the government is likely to be lenient on a higher income-tax surcharge on FPIs, which influenced the bears to cover short positions. Prospects of lower interest rate and strength in the rupee boosted investor sentiment"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

21,2019-08-08,Titan,"ICICI Direct has given a buy recommendation on Titan Company with a target price of Rs 1,190.

Shares of Titan Company traded Rs 1,019.8 around 1:20 pm on 8 August, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage

First half (H1) of FY20 to remain muted; recovery from H2 onwards 
As guided by the management in its pre-quarterly update, Titan reported moderate overall revenue growth of 15.7 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 5,151.1 crore (well below their internal target of 20 per cent growth). 

A significant surge in gold prices, weak consumer sentiments dented demand for the jewellery space (mainly in June). 

With the jewellery division reporting revenue growth of 14 per cent in Q1FY20 and a muted Q2FY20, the company may fall short of achieving the 22 per cent growth guidance for FY20. 

However, the management expects festive demand and green shoots to drive revenue growth from H2FY20 onwards. 

Adjusting for the impact of Ind-AS 116 and expense incurred towards the biennial Business Associates Meet (BAM), Ebitda margins stayed constant YoY at nearly 10.9 per cent. Reported PAT grew 11 per cent YoY to Rs 364.7 crore.


Higher gold prices to subdue near term demand 
The jewellery division reported subdued revenue growth of 14 per cent YoY to Rs 4,164.1 crore (grammage growth 6 per cent YoY), with like to like sales growth of 10 per cent. 

A sudden surge in gold prices and slowdown in consumption impacted consumer demand significantly. The share of studded ratio was in line with previous year at 25 per cent. 

The management highlighted that jewellery revenues in second half of June witnessed a decline. The same trend has persisted in July with August also expected to be muted. 

For H2FY20, the management is targeting revenue growth in excess of 20 per cent on the back of higher wedding dates and festive season. 

However, the lower revenue growth in H1FY20 is unlikely to be recouped in H2FY20. 

The management has maintained its store addition plan of nearly 70 Tanishq stores despite slower pace of addition in Q1FY20 (12 stores) and visibility of nearly 15 stores in Q2FY20. Ebit margins for the jewellery segment stayed flattish YoY at 10.5 per cent.


TCS order provides uptick for watches segment
Revenue from watches segment grew 20 per cent YoY to Rs 716.1 crore on back of one time large institutional order from TCS (nearly Rs 56 crore). 

Adjusting for it, revenue growth came in at 11 per cent.

Ebit margins for the watches division declined 170 bps YoY to 16.6 per cent, primarily due to BAM expense. The division added two World of Titan, three Fastrack and five Helios stores in Q1FY20.


Valuation & outlook
""Given the recent headwinds, we revise our revenue and earnings estimates downwards for FY20 and FY21E,"" said the brokerage. 

A sustained increase in gold prices and weak consumer sentiments can lead to postponement of purchase, which may defer the revenue growth recovery in the near term. 

Titan has consistently displayed its ability to gain market share amid a tough industry scenario. 

Enriched jewellery portfolio with launch of new collections (wedding space) and sustained investment in brand building is enabling better than industry revenue growth. 

""We model revenue and earnings CAGR of 17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, in FY19-21E. We maintain our buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,190 at 49 times FY21E earnings per share (EPS) (earlier target price of Rs 1,250),"" said the brokerage."

34,2019-08-25,Titan,"Celebrating Parsis
A group of sharp legal minds and a few friends gathered on a rainy evening in Mumbai a fortnight ago to chat and celebrate the colourful, curious, eccentric and often bohemian lives of the Parsis. The occasion was the release of ‘Oh! Those Parsis’, a delightfully funny book by Berjis Desai, one of the top lawyers with a bagful of unforgettable stories. Amid the spicy and scandalous tales, the book, said the chief guest, senior counsel and fellow Parsi Darius Khambata, also sends out a subliminal message that it’s good to be different, particularly in a world where strife and intolerance cast a shadow on liberty and happiness. For the affable Berjis, once a journo, the new innings as an author carries an unmistakable sense of déjà vu.


A Reception to RememberThe event of the week in Mumbai was clearly the wedding reception of the young scions Neville Tata and Manasi Kirloskar last Saturday. Among family members, Ratan Tata made it a point to be there for his nephew. Old money and sheer class were on ample display on both sides, with women in resplendent but understated jewellery. Tata’s paternal and maternal grandmothers, Simone Tata and Patsy Mistry, were present and so were his maternal uncles Shapur and Cyrus. In case you are wondering, no, the Mistry brothers did not cross paths with Ratan Tata. While Pallonji Mistry, the patriarch of his family, could not attend due to his ill health, Isha and Anant Piramal, the young scion couple from the Ambani and Piramal family were there too. So were the Tata brass, with Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran present at the function, as was Noel’s mentor Noshir Soonawala.


Bidding Adieu to a TitanBhaskar Bhat, the managing director of Titan Company, bid adieu to investors at a recent analyst conference call. After 17 years at the helm, out of his 30-year tenure in the company, Bhat is synonymous with Titan’s success and wealth creation for its shareholders. One of the investors on call was Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who along with his wife Rekha owns close to 7% of Titan, which amounts to Rs 6,650 crore of his portfolio. “I’ll really miss him. It’s an end of an era,” said Jhunjhunwala, adding that it was difficult to imagine Bhat not being on analyst calls. Many others also acknowledged Bhat’s pivotal role in the expansion of the company from a modest watchmaker with two promoters, Tamil Nadu government’s TIDCO and Tata Sons, to a player now straddling jewellery and even eye-wear segments.


Seeking a Safe ExitThat a well-known fund’s many investments have gone kaput is common knowledge. But now speculation is rife that one of its executives is on the way out. Interestingly, these funds have a clause like ‘golden parachute’ for executives when they leave. What is particularly curious about this particular exit is that the payment of a speculated million dollars or more is not being made in India. The outgoing exec apparently prefers to have the money in a foreign account, especially the Swiss.


Talking Telecom
Telecom hotshots, senior Trai officials and bureaucrats from the communications ministry are bound for Budapest next month to participate in a global tech conclave hosted by the International Telecom Union. Discussions will range from forging partnerships to innovative funding models for cost effective 5G deployments. Experts will also wonder aloud on ways to control the use of AI and the data it generates and also creating a safer cyberspace. The government is likely to use learnings from the conclave to finalise 5G spectrum pricing for the next auction.


Making a PointLast Friday, the Tata Sons annual general meeting went off in a businesslike manner, without much ado. Except, that is, a long desultory eight-page note, read out by Shapoorji Pallonji veteran Jimmy Parakh, on behalf of the Mistry brothers, who hold an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons. Parakh is from the old school and therefore not prone to histrionics, and he made his points in a quiet way and later took his seat.

0,2019-09-03,Titan,"BENGALURU: Tata-owned Titan Company has trimmed its FY20 guidance for revenue growth in its watches division to account for the slowdown in demand, according to a top executive, even as the company expects recovery to begin in the next six months.

For the June quarter, the Bengaluru-headquartered company recorded 20% year-on-year growth in revenue in the watches segment, driven by a large order from another group firm, TCS.

However, according to Ravi Kant, chief executive of Titan Watches and Accessories, the management said the growth rate isn’t sustainable and its expansion rate for the rest of the year could taper to 12-15%. “In July, we faced some slowdown. There is a general consumer sentiment and we certainly have to tone down our expectations. While we will continue our investments, advertising and expansion, we will not be at 15-20% growth like the first quarter,"" Kant told ET. “The entire country is waiting for achche din, but it hasn’t happened. Market has been volatile.""

The watches division earned Titan a revenue of Rs 2,441 crore in 2018-19 and accounted for about 13% of the company’s overall sales, with gifting contributing more than half of it.

Titan is India’s largest watch maker, controlling nearly half its watch market which is worth about Rs 8,500 crore at consumer price. The company sold about 16 million watches last year including brands Titan, Sonata and Fastrack.

The company said the slowdown in discretionary consumption is not just visible in the automobile and real estate sectors but also in the watches and jewellery segments. Sale of high-priced watches, a popular gifting option in Indian weddings, usually dips when the wedding season is weak. Consumers generally buy lowerpriced watches.

“A weak wedding season largely affects our watch business in smaller towns besides our jewellery business. The sale of our Sonata brand, a range of timepieces targeted at smaller Indian towns, is primarily impacted. People trade down,” said Kant.

In the jewellery segment, Titan’s retail growth in July was about 9% year-on-year but declined in the second half of the month. The management expects demand to recover once gold prices stabilise.

In a recent investor note, JM Financial said, “Titan’s first quarter FY20 earnings report was expectedly weak, but the nearterm outlook appears to be even softer, with revenue down in July, and August expected to be muted as well. The (company’s) management is still maintaining an over 20% growth guidance for the second half, but that appears more a wish than a target as of now, given that there is nothing available so far to suggest that things will improve for sure.”"

10,2019-09-07,Titan,"NEW DELHI: This past week could not offer any clear direction to the domestic market. US and China accelerated trade war early in the week with tit-for-tat tariffs, only to schedule trade talks next month. Concerns over weak economic growth intensified following weak services and manufacturing PMI readings and August auto sales numbers and FPI outflows kept investors nervous.

The week saw BSE Sensex falling 351 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 36,981.77. NSE barometer Nifty50 declined 77 points, or 0.70 per cent for the week to settle at 10,946.20. 


Here are a couple of stocks which hogged the limelight all through the week: 


Simbhaoli Sugars, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar: Sugar stocks surged up to 51 per cent for the week after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a lump sum export subsidy of Rs 10,448 per tonne of sugar to mills for sugar season 2020. Simbhaoli Sugars led gainers with 51 per cent surge. The stock settled the week at Rs 5.6. Bajaj Hindustan remained another prominent gainer climbing 33 per cent to Rs 7.30.


Prabhat Dairy: Delisting talks lifted this stock 30 per cent to Rs 78.20 last week. The dairy company said its board would meet on September 10 to consider delisting proposal. It will also consider the appointment of a merchant banker registered with the Sebi for carrying out due diligence.


Indiabulls Group stocks: Shares of Indiabulls Group of companies dropped last week amid reports that a public interest litigation in the Delhi High Court seeking probe into alleged accounting irregularities at Indiabulls Housing Finance (IBHF) and diversion of funds by promoters. IBHF said no such PIL had yet been filed as per records.
For the week, Indiabulls Venutres plunged 12.7 per cent to Rs 155.60. IBHF dropped 6.5 per cent to Rs 425.80. Indiabulls Real Estate fell 3.7 per cent to Rs 65.30.


Indian Bank, Allahabad Bank: The scrip plunged 18 per cent to Rs 164.20 following announcement on its merger with Allahabad Bank. Indian Bank’s merger with the culturally and geographically diverse Allahabad Bank could be challenging, said Emkay Global. In addition, asset-quality performance for Allahabad Bank has been relatively weak vis-à-vis Indian Bank, which is a drag, it said. Allahabad Bank fell 6.5 per cent to Rs 33.


Shankara Building Products: This stock climbed 40.40 per cent to Rs 368 even as India Ratings downgraded the company’s long-term issuer rating to ‘IND A-’ from ‘IND A’. The rating agency, meanwhile, has maintained its outlook stable.


TVS Motor: This two-wheeler stock jumped 8 per cent to Rs 381.40 after the company reported 4 per cent month-on-month (MoM) rise in August sales. The company dispatched 290,455 units in August compared with 279,465 in July, and 343,217 units in the same quarter last year.


BPCL: This stock snapped its 9-day winning streak on Friday after . The stock gained 6.74 per cent to Rs 379.10 for the week.


Titan Company: Shares of this Tata Group company fell 3.32 per cent to Rs 1,068.20 after it trimmed FY20 revenue guidance for its watches division, following a slowdown in demand. Losses were restricted as the company expects recovery to begin in the next six months.


Hindustan Copper: This stock advanced 7.43 per cent to Rs 34 over news the government is likely to sell stake in state-owned companies through strategic divestments instead of an offer-for-sale or exchange traded funds (ETFs)."
11,2019-09-07,Titan,"Thanks and wishes came pouring in for Bhaskar Bhat during Titan Company’s earnings conference call in early August to discuss its first quarter numbers. This would, after all, be his last as managing director of the company before he retires on September 30. Among those who spoke was billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who with his wife owns 7% of Titan. “First of all, a very emotional byebye. We would not be having Bhaskar on the calls again. I’ll really miss him,” Jhunjhunwala said.

It is no secret that investors love Titan. And Bhat has played a key role in making the company a titan on and off the bourses. The Tata group company has been one of the storied stocks of the past decade and a half. Since Bhat took charge as MD on April 1, 2002, its shares have risen a remarkable 400 times, compared with an increase of nearly 11 times in the Sensex.

At the end of the hour-long call, Bhat — who speaks multiple languages, including Tulu, Kannada, Tamil and Gujarati — thanked everyone and said, “From an anpadh (illiterate) I became quite savvy at answering your questions.” 



The 65-year-old, who has often ditched his car for the airport shuttle, is known for his modesty. In an interview with ET Magazine at the company’s airy headquarters in Bengaluru’s Electronic City a couple of weeks later, the IIT-Madras and IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus continued in the same vein. “I don’t ascribe anything to myself. A company’s achievement is ascribed to its MD, unfortunately.” But it is difficult not to give him some of the credit for Titan’s growth, especially considering how big Titan has become in the last two decades.

When he took over the reins of Titan, the company’s market value was a mere Rs 220 crore, a 10th of Tata Power’s and around a 15th of Tata Steel’s and Tata Motors’. Now Titan is valued at Rs 95,000 crore — more than all those companies combined. It is the second biggest listed Tata company, after Tata Consultancy Services. Moreover, between 2001-2002 and 2018-19, Titan’s revenues and profits grew at an annual rate of over 20% and 30%, respectively. “We feel good, certainly, when the stock does well. At the same time, we don’t feel bad if the market cap goes from Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 95,000 crore,” says Bhat.

However, Bhat’s legacy goes beyond numbers. He turned a watchmaker with a jewellery business (Tanishq) into an enviable lifestyle company with brands in eyewear, accessories, perfumes and now sarees. The company even has a precision engineering subsidiary called Titan Engineering & Automation, a spin-off that caters to industries like aerospace, defence and electronics. The jewellery vertical contributed 83% to Titan’s standalone revenues of Rs 19,250 crore in 2018-19, with watches accounting for 13% and eyewear 3%, according to the company. Bhat was the first hire of the predecessor to Titan, The Watch Project of Tata Press led by Xerxes Desai, in May 1983, according to a recent book on Titan by Vinay Kamath, a journalist.



Bhat moved from Ahmedabad, where he was with Godrej & Boyce, to Mumbai, where he grew up, to take up the new job in sales. He saw the birth of Titan Watches a year later as a joint venture between the Tatas and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (Tidco), which was one of the few entities with a licence to manufacture watches back then. The company’s first plant was in Hosur in Tamil Nadu, around 40 minutes from Titan’s headquarters in Bengaluru. Titan was an acronym of Tata Industries and Tamil Nadu. Tidco owns around 28% and the Tatas 25% in Titan. The chairman of the board is nominated by Tidco. Interestingly, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das, an IAS officer from the Tamil Nadu cadre, was chairman of Titan between 2006 and 2008.

After it started selling quartz watches in 1987, Titan went on to eclipse the then market leader Hindustan Machine Tools, a state-owned company. Looking for new avenues of growth for the company, Desai led Titan into the jewellery business under the banner of Tanishq in the mid-1990s. But the foray would turn out to be more difficult than anticipated, as Titan found it difficult to prise Indians from their family jewellers. Things started improving slowly for Tanishq after it encouraged prospective customers to come to its stores to check for free the purity of the gold jewellery they own. This way, it was able to show the customers if their trusted jewellers were cheating them or not.

By the time the Titan mantle passed from Desai to Bhat in 2002, the jewellery unit was profitable. But there were still questions about the future of the business. In his book, Kamath quotes a senior executive saying the then Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata wondered whether Titan was a watch company with a jewellery business or the other way round. But after an external assessment of the business, Tata decided to give it some more time. Bhat and his team made the most of it. Now Tanishq is the country’s largest jewellery chain. “That we would succeed in this manner was impossible to dream of,” says Bhat, sitting in his office overlooking a lake. His cabin — and the most of the campus — is not air-conditioned. But it is kept pleasant using air cooled by evaporating water.

Rama Bijapurkar, a management consultant who was an independent director on the board of Titan in the early 2000s, credits Bhat for his perseverance. “Success does not come from just being a visionary leader and envisioning the future. It comes from getting there, which requires patient, calm and resilient leadership, which Bhaskar has shown.” Bijapurkar was a batch ahead of Bhat at IIM-Ahmedabad and remembers him as a “confident IIT boy whom everyone loved”. She, like anyone who knows Bhat, attests to his abilities as a mimic.



It was under Bhat that Tanishq pioneered a strategy to guard itself against volatility in the price of gold. Instead of buying gold, Titan leased it from international banks for a fee and bought the gold from the banks at the same time it sold it to a customer. Some of Tanishq’s competitors also use this risk-mitigation tactic. This ensured Titan’s valuable capital was not tied up as stock in stores. Other challenges that Bhat had to deal with as MD of Tanishq included handling a lockout at the Hosur plant in 2003 and winding down Titan’s loss-making European operations in 2004. The European operations had saddled the company with debt.

However, he has also guided Titan to identify market segments that are unorganised or underpenetrated. As a result, it launched the Fastrack watches in 2003, Titan EyePlus in 2007, accessories in 2010, Skinn perfumes in 2013 and Taneira, its saree chain, in 2017. “There was no hoo-haa when Titan got into a new business like eyewear,” says Bijapurkar. “They quietly did it. Individually, these businesses may be small but together they add up to a nice jewel string that is valuable.” Eyewear brought in revenues of around Rs 510 crore in 2018-19 and other businesses Rs 270 crore. Watches, which accounted for 13% of the standalone revenues, notched up Rs 2,440 crore.

Titan has also launched and acquired new brands to widen its offerings — for example the purchase of 62% in online jewellery seller CaratLane in 2016 for Rs 360 crore. “We focus on those businesses where there can be a design-led differentiation,” says Ajoy Chawla, senior vice-president of business incubation at Titan.

The focus now is to do to the saree business what Titan did to jewellery. Bhat says the saree business is largely unorganised like the jewellery market and the company can put its knowledge of managing the supply chain for Tanishq to good use in Taneira. Chawla says the special-occasion women’s wear market is Rs 35,000-40,000 crore. There are five Taneira stores spread across Bengaluru, New Delhi and Hyderabad and Titan plans to take it to 60-70 in five years. Taneira came out of an internal programme that invited ideas from employees around 2015, as did EyePlus earlier. Of the many ideas that were received, three were finalised. The teams that submitted these were given six months to hone their ideas and make a final pitch. Of the three ideas, the one on sarees was chosen.

Chawla is loathe to disclose the other two finalists, which could be possible future diversifications for Titan. CK Venkataraman, CEO of the jewellery business who has been named Bhat’s successor, says one of Bhat’s strengths has been harnessing the collective potential of the workforce. “Modern-day managers are focussed on shareholders to the exclusion of other stakeholders. Bhaskar was never a slave to that.” Venkataraman points to Bhat’s constant queries about Titan franchisees’ profitability as proof of that. Titan has 1,700 exclusive outlets across India covering 2.1 million sq ft.

Besides Titan’s stellar numbers, what has endeared the company to investors is its transparency. “Titan has been upfront about negative developments and Bhat’s overall communication with investors has been exemplary,” says Abneesh Roy, executive vicepresident at Edelweiss Securities. He adds that Titan’s practise of releasing a preview before announcing the results for the quarter is uncommon among companies in the consumer space. Despite the immediate concerns over a drop in demand for the company’s products, he remains upbeat on Titan’s long-term prospects.


Smooth Transition
While the departure of a leader of Bhat’s stature usually results in some hand-wringing at a company, the transition at Titan has been smooth. That could be because Bhat is being replaced by someone who has been with the company since 1990 and has built Titan’s biggest business, the jewellery segment. “When a leader leaves, you see a ship with many holes. But at Titan, the system will not skip a beat as it moves on. That is what Bhaskar has done,” says Das Narayandas, a professor at Harvard Business School and former independent director at Titan.



So what after September 30 for Bhat? He jokes that he is only relevant as long as he is running a company. “I’m happy to have all the time in the world now. I’m still on several boards. It was impossible to manage all these responsibilities but I still managed with sleepless nights and extreme strain. Now that will reduce.” Bhat is on the boards of Tata Sons, Tata Chemicals, Trent and Bosch. He is also the chairman of Vistara and Rallis India. For now, Bhat is bidding goodbye to his employees in groups of 50-60 each. Most sessions are spent exchanging anecdotes with the employees of the company he helped grow.

His lauded stint at Titan has not been without its missteps, including Titan’s delayed entry into the smartwach segment, which Bhat says the company has made up for. Titan’s smart products clocked Rs 100 crore in revenues in 2018-19. “The company’s fundamental urge to continuously explore adjacent categories in the personal lifestyle space will impel it forward.” His successor may be inheriting a stronger company than Bhat did, but Bhat is certainly a tough act to follow."

13,2019-09-10,Titan,"BENGALURU: Tata-owned Titan Company, country’s largest watchmaker, has got relief from the High Court of Delhi against sellers of counterfeit Titan and Fastrack watches on e-commerce major Snapdeal. Titan had recently filed a civil suit before Delhi HC against Snapdeal for not taking down various listings of counterfeit Titan and Fastrack branded watches, despite being notified of the same by the company. It had also filed a case against two sellers who were selling counterfeit watches by Titan on Snapdeal. Delhi HC has passed a decree today in favour of Titan granting permanent injunction against the said two sellers from selling counterfeit watches and granting costs of Rs 1,50,000 each.

According to a press statement issued by Titan, the court has directed Snapdeal to, besides filing its written statement within the prescribed time, also furnish an affidavit with particulars of all goods sold on its portal under the marks Titan and Fastrack, the sale price thereof collected and the amount appropriated by the etailer to itself and the amount disbursed to the so-called sellers of the said goods. The Court has directed the said particulars to be given with effect from January 1, 2018.

S. Ravi Kant, chief executive of Titan watches & accessories, said, “We welcome the Order passed by the High Court of Delhi. As stated in the past, at Titan, our primary focus is on safeguarding the interests of our consumers and we will not compromise on the quality and experience with our products.”

A Snapdeal spokesperson told ET, “Snapdeal welcomes the order of the Delhi High Court, which reiterates the crucial distinction between the marketplace and the sellers and its directions in this regard will help us expeditiously take action against offenders. The company remains committed to devising and implementing measures, which protect the interests of honest sellers, buyers and brands.”

The Court had, through its earlier Order dated July 29, 2019, directed Snapdeal, upon receiving a complaint from Titan, to remove the URLs selling counterfeit goods of the watch brand. The Snapdeal spokesperson said that the portal is “on the same side as Titan” and will be removing offending URLs as and when flagged off by the brand as part of their anti-counterfeiting program Brand Shield.

Launched in November 2018, the programme works with brands, including Titan, to report and take down listings identified as counterfeits from the portal. The spokesperson added that about 8000 such sellers were barred from the marketplace earlier this year.

Titan’s case against Snapdeal and the two offending sellers is sub-judice before Delhi HC. The next date in the matter is February 20, 2020."

46,2019-09-24,Titan,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax cut proved a shot in the arm for domestic equities, as aggregate market capitalistion of BSE-listed firms spiked by over Rs 10 lakh crore in just two sessions.

Analysts say the corporate tax cut and a supportive monetary policy should boost the sagging investment cycle. Brokerage Motilal Oswal said the measures announced are substantive and have the potential to kickstart the moribund investment cycle over time.

“Consumption stocks have been doing pretty well over the past four-five years. Consumption as a share of GDP has peaked and investment as a share of GDP is at the bottom. It will be going up from here on,” Mahesh Nandurkar, India Strategist, CLSA, told ETNOW.

Declining savings rate has been hurting investments in India. But a likely rise in corporate savings after the latest tax cut should help nudge the private capex cycle, analysts say.

The government on September 20 announced a Rs 1.45 lakh crore fiscal stimulus by slashing of corporate tax to 22 per cent from 30 per cent and lowering minimum alternate tax (MAT) to 15 per cent for companies putting fresh capital into manufacturing.

The reduced corporate tax rate of 22 per cent would apply on domestic entities that don't avail any other exemption and tax incentives. Also, these companies will not be required to pay any MAT. The effective tax rate, in this case, would be 25.17 per cent, including cess and surcharge.

“The sentiment booster provided by these measures, coupled with the transmission of the 110 basis points of rate cut already done by RBI, can at the margin provide a push to consumption in the midst of an all-important festive season. A significant recovery in monsoon should also aid rural consumption, albeit with a lag,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

The brokerage is bullish on ICICI Bank, SBI, L&T, UltraTech, Titan Company, Eicher Motors, ICICI Prudential and Bharti Airtel in the largecap space. On the other hand, it is positive on Indian Hotels, Federal Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Ashok Leyland, PI Industries, Aditya Birla Fashion, Trent, JK Cement and Oberoi Realty among the midcaps.

There are hopes that foreign institutional investors may respond positively to these announcements. Goldman Sachs is bullish on Indian equity market and has set a year-end target of 13,200 for Nifty, citing a mild cyclical recovery driven by supportive fiscal and monetary policy. The foreign brokerage likes domestic cyclical sectors like banks, industrials and autos.

Market capitalistion of BSE-listed firms zoomed to nearly Rs 149 lakh crore on September 23 from Rs 138 lakh crore on September 19.

“I would like my portfolio to be skewed more in favour of the investment cycle, a theme I would like to play through the capital goods names, some of the infra names and private sector corporate banks. One can take a selective bet on the state-owned banks as well. I would also like to take a look at the four-wheeler space, because this has got battered,” said Nandurkar."

• Edelweiss has initiated coverage on 
India Grid Trust and revised target price to Rs 113 from Rs 105. India Grid has corrected 12 per cent since its IPO, primarility due to thin liquidity and rise in interest rates, said Edelweiss.

India Grid Trust ended down 0.55 per cent at Rs 91.20 on Friday.


• ICICI Securities has retained buy rating on 
JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals and revised target price to Rs 498 from Rs 476. Recent meeting with the management has reinforced positive stance on the company, said ICICI Securities.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has retained add rating on 
Mahindra Logistics and revised fair value to Rs 400 from Rs 387. Mahindra Logistics in its recent analyst meet revealed its focus on deepening and mobilising capabilities and of using digitisation to bundle such capabilities with the core strength of network optimization, said Kotak Institutional.

His single-largest investment Titan Company reported a 2 per cent drop in revenue in its jewellery segment for September quarter, hurting the stock’s prospects and, thereby, over 50 per cent of the Big Bull’s known stock portfolio of Rs 13,000 crore. 

Jhunjhunwala and his better half Rekha owned 7.05 per cent stake in Titan as of June end, which was worth Rs 7,500 crore at Wednesday’s price. The scrip tanked 4.73 per cent to hit a low of Rs 1,199.

Goldman Sachs, which has a neutral rating, has a price target of Rs 1,108 for the stock.

At 48 times FY21 EPS, the scrip is pricing in a recovery in jewellery sales, it said, while lowering its FY20-22 estimates by roughly 1 per cent to reflect lower sales.

Another foreign brokerage Macquarie has a price target of Rs 1,078. It noted that September is generally a moderate quarter for the jewellery business. The targets by the two foreign brokerages suggest up to 10 per cent downside potential.

The scrip delivered a whopping 103.86 per cent return in last two years, which was 5 times Sensex’s 17 per cent return.

“We expect Titan to report flattish revenue growth for September quarter. Nevertheless, we continue to believe its long-term fundamentals remain intact. In the absence of higher investment opportunities in the sector, Titan would continue to command high valuations,” Dolat Capital said in a note.

This brokerage has an 'accumulate' rating on the stock, as it believes the company may manage to meet its 20 per cent jewellery segment revenue guidance for FY20.

“We estimated 14 per cent jewellery revenue growth for June quarter, but the actual growth was below our expectation. We attribute this to the gold price increase in mid-June and July (up 23 per cent YoY in Q2), which resulted in volume slowdown. Nevertheless, gradual improvement in sales (July to September) hints that the company would be able to meet its target of 20 per cent sales growth in H2FY20E,” it said.

While retail sales declined in July, retail growth was 15 per cent YoY between August and September, possibly due to higher promotions and schemes, the Tata group company told BSE. 

Retail sales or secondary sales rose 7 per cent in Q2 but revenues as per the financials declined 2 per cent YoY due to the adverse impact of the hedges that matured during the quarter, the company said.

“Titan has made disclosures time and again. They have been very transparent. The market actually understands that these are things, which are probably seasonal. It will going to be tided over. What one values is the franchise and sustainable ROEs that it can report, which I think is pretty good,” said Sameer Narayan, market expert.

During the quarter, the company’s Tanishq division added a net of 21 stores in Q2, and 33 in total for the first six months of the ongoing financial year.

Motilal Oswal Securities said Titan is a business that has best top-line growth visibility in the largecap retail space, prospects of a continued Ebitda margin improvement because of high same-store sale growth contribution and the likelihood of delivering a sustained RoCE improvement from 26 per cent in FY19 to 35 per cent."
9,2019-10-09,Titan,"Shares of Titan Company fell 3 per cent on Wednesday after the firm reported a decline in revenues in jewellery business in second quarter of 2019-20.

 The company said its revenue from jewellery business declined 2 per cent in September quarter despite 7 per cent growth in retail sales. 

""Retail sales (secondary sales) grew 7 per cent in Q2 FY'20 but revenues as per financials declined 2 per cent year-on-year in Q2FY'20 substantially due to adverse impact of the hedges matured during the quarter,"" the company said in a BSE filing on Monday. 

 The jewellery business saw a sharp fall in sales from mid-June on the back of surge in gold prices. The trend continued in July and resulted in considerable de-growth in sales during the month, it added. 

 However, the company saw a retail growth of 15 per cent year-on-year between August and September as compared to the same period of 2018-19. 

A report by Edelweiss Financial Securities said it expects second quarter to be 'soft' for Titan with an year-on-year growth of about 6.9 per cent. Also, for the jewellery business, the growth is expected to be around 6 per cent year-on-year. 

 ""We expect Q2 to be soft for Titan with almost 6.9 per cent year-on-year revenue growth. For jewellery business, we expect the segment to record about 6 per cent year-on-year growth on a base of 28.5 per cent,"" Edelweiss Financial Securities said.

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 49.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Reliance Securities has upgraded 
Ashok Leyland to buy from reduce and revised target price higher to Rs 111. The brokerage had downgraded its recommendation on Ashok Leyland to reduce due to expected down-cycle, post which it corrected by more than 31 per cent. Sharp correction in price captures most near-term negatives, while likely up-cycle in FY22 would bring back high earning growth and valuation expansion, which transforms into strong potential upside from the current level. Shares of Ashok Leyland ended up 7.4 per cent at Rs 69.10 on Wednesday.

• Anand Rathi has a buy rating on 
J Kumar Infraprojects with a buy rating and target price of Rs 256. The brokerage has re-introduced rating on J Kumar Infra projects after Sebi revoked its interim order of September 2018 wherein it had directed exchanges to appoint an independent auditor to carry out a forensic audit. With the regulatory overhang settled, core operations, would set the tone for stock performance, said Anand Rathi. Shares of J Kumar ended up 11.7 per cent at Rs 143.70 on Wednesday.


• Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on 
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries with a target price of Rs 505. The brokerage believes that the share price of Sun will rise in absolute terms over the next 30 days. This is because the stock has traded off recently, making short-term valuation more compelling. The brokerage believes that the stock can re-rate driven by an earnings recovery in the mid-term led by broad-based sales growth and margin expansion from positive operating leverage. Shares of Sun Pharma ended up 1 per cent at Rs 383.55 on Wednesday.

• Citigroup has downgraded 
Titan Company to neutral from buy and revised target price to Rs 1,370 from Rs 1,175. The brokerage said it believes in Titan’s market share gain story as management executes its strategic initiatives well, and business challenges for smaller competitors continue. But, the stock outperformance prices in midterm upsides; in fact, nearterm market weakness could adversely impact the elevated expectations. Shares of Titan ended down 2.4 per cent at Rs 1,229.65 on Wednesday.

• ICICIdirect has maintained hold rating on

But, the stock outperformance prices in midterm upsides; in fact, nearterm market weakness could adversely impact the elevated expectations."

16,2019-10-11,Titan,"Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala sold 49 lakh shares of watch and jewellery retailer Titan Company in September quarter.

A regulatory filing on Friday showed Jhunjhunwala’s stake in the company fell to 6.51 per cent, or 5,77,51,220 shares, at the end of September, from 7.05 per cent, or 6,26,51,220 shares, at the end of June quarter.

The data showed shareholding in the name of Rakesh Radhesham Jhunjhunwala declined to 5.10 per cent in September quarter from 5.75 per cent in the preceding quarter ended June 2019. However, his wife Rekha Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s stake increased to 1.40 per cent from 1.30 during the same period.

On a year-to-date basis, Titan’s share price has rallied 33 per cent to Rs 1,235 as of October 10 from Rs 927.60 on January 1.

Titan earlier this week said its revenue from jewellery business declined 2 per cent in September quarter despite a 7 per cent growth in retail sales.

“Retail sales (secondary sales) grew 7 per cent in Q2 FY20 but revenues as per financials declined substantially by 2 per cent year-on-year in Q2FY20 due to the adverse impact of the hedges that matured during the quarter,” the company said in a BSE filing on Monday.

The jewellery business saw a sharp drop in sales from mid-June on the back of a surge in gold prices. The trend continued in July and resulted in considerable de-growth in sales during the month, it said.

The company saw 15 per cent year-on-year retail growth between August and September compared with the same period of 2018-19.

Edelweiss Financial Securities in a report said it expects second quarter to be 'soft' for Titan with an year-on-year growth of about 6.9 per cent.

The shares of the company closed 0.55 per cent higher at Rs 1241.80 on BSE."

17,2019-10-12,Titan,"For many brands and retailers today, stores are a thing of the past, it seems. They want the passersby to step, not into an old-fashioned shop, but into a place referred to as an “experiential centre”, offering a sort of immersion into an enchanting world made up of a variety of products and services. 

The staffers do not frown if the visitor does not buy a thing; they know the visitor is taking home an “experience” and may, inevitably, return. Pooja Barthwal is one such staffer at Fabindia’s 10,000 sq feet experiential centre in the upmarket Vasant Kunj area of New Delhi. 




Posted at the interior design studio, she helps visitors not just find furniture but also seek consultation on layouts, mapping, furniture customisation and colour coordination. 
Barthwal, a trained interior designer, says she even visits customer’s homes and uses a software to virtually show the host how a certain piece of cabinet may look in their rooms, for a fee, of course. The place also has a café with organic menu, a wellness store with consultants, a free alteration studio and a kids’ play zone.

“The centres enable customers to engage with the brand in multiple ways, shifting from transactional retail to a more experiential and interactive one,” says
Viney Singh, managing director, Fabindia. The ethnic clothing and handicrafts retailer now plans to turn a quarter of its retail space into such experiential centres, says Singh. Similarly, Taneira, Titan Company’s saris and crafts brand, is creating “experiences” at its stores. “The concept is of India under one roof and customers can get an authentic experience of the products without any glass or counters to hinder them. It’s a concept of self-service with the staff
supporting the customer to understand the products,” says managing director Bhaskar Bhat, who retired on last month.





‘Touch’ Points
Such immersive zones have also become vital for online retailers whose customers long to size up, touch and even try the products before adding them to the cart. For innerwear brand Zivame, which went from online to brick-and-mortar in 2017, the experience studios aim to help women find the right fit and also try services such as recommendations based on body profiles. “The studios allow us to not only offer the customer a touch-
and-feel experience but also to serve her in real time,” says chief executive Amisha Jain. Meanwhile, Sang, a make-up artist at cosmetics brand Nykaa’s Luxe centre at The Chanakya shopping centre in New Delhi, has his hands full. He says there is a lot of demand for makeovers from visitors. He then offers some tips: “Natural tones and glows are the trend of this season.” “Make-up is a tactile touch and feel category and the physical presence of beauty advisors has helped in building the brand. While we leverage our online database and app to understand our customers, the experiential aspect at stores, which offer make-up stations, domes and zones, help enhance the customer experience,” says Anchit Nayar, CEO-retail, Nykaa.

CEO-retail, Nykaa. Shilpa Sharma, cofounder and head of products curation at online handicrafts brand Jaypore, explains it further. “For apparel brands, an experience centre provides more visual display space while for online players, the customers can experience, see, touch and feel the products, sometimes with the help of technology, rather than perhaps actually buy them and take them home.” Though none of the apparel retailers in India appear to follow the “guideshop” model of Walmart’s online menswear brand Bonobos, online furniture retailer Pepperfry is doing just that and not getting into the business of directly selling to customers. Its furniture studios are zones for visitors to interact with staffers who are architects and interior designers. 

We have deployed large screens and augmented reality for product displays. Visitors can also scan the QR codes on the furniture and place them in online carts.
However, there is no fulfilment since they cannot take the products home from the studio,” says chief operating officer Ashish Shah. The studios also host
stand-up comedy sessions and culinary workshops to pull in more visitors. Though it is not yet clear what the returns on investment are on such experiential zones for the retailers, customers can continue to enjoy the no-pressure shopping experience."

37,2019-10-24,Titan,"KOLKATA: In spite of economic slowdown, jewellers are expecting gold offtake to go up this Diwali with lightweight and diamond jewellery being the flavour of the season.

Tanishq, for instance, is extremely upbeat about this year’s Dhanteras and Diwali sales. Mr Sandeep Kulhalli, senior vice president, (Retail and Marketing), jewellery division, Titan Company Limited said, “at Tanishq, there has been a substantial growth all year through and we are confident of posting high volumes this year too. There has been a positive sentiment seen among consumers as everyone is gearing up for Dhanteras. The government’s recent announcement on bonus will also help boost sales this year. Wedding continues to be the big ticket purchase and we are receiving positive reactions with our latest Diwali collection. This year we have opened quite a good amount of stores and we are looking forward to see new walk-ins from new as well as from our existing stores.”

Aditya Pethe, director, WHP Jewellers said that his firm has witnessed a tremendous response in bullion sales on ecommerce. “At store level, so far the festive season has been average. Though we did sales on Dussehra, the wedding shopping is yet to pick up. We are optimistic that during Dhanteras our year on year targets will be met. Being festive season, like every year, we have seen rise in silver articles sales since Ganesh Utsav. Light weight diamond jewellery as well as diamond set under 3 lakh are popular among our buyers.”

Rohan Narang, managing director of Delhi-based Hazoorilal Legacy said they have entered the festive season with optimism and the outlook has been positive so far. “The bridal and wedding clientele is enthusiastic and have very warmly received our latest collections. Besides, with Dhanteras round the corner, we’re looking at an increased footfall at our stores,” he said.

Jewellers like Saurabh Gadgil, managing director, PNG Jewellers said that high gold price will not mar Diwali sales. “In terms of style and design, lighter pieces are in vogue this season. Though this is partly driven by economic considerations and a desire for pocket-friendly alternatives. The lower ticket value of individual purchases is compensated for by higher footfall. A positive, and surprising, development this season has been an uptick in the interest in diamonds and platinum, with studded jewellery making a comeback in a big way. Overall, we’re optimistic about the market scenario and anticipate good consumption for the jewellery industry as a whole,” said Gadgil.

Shreyansh Kapoor, vice president, Kashi Jewellers added that they are hoping buyers to come back to the stores to make jewellery purchases as it is a festive time. “Also, a lot of consumers who don't have weddings or occasions in the year, end up buying during Diwali. The love for the precious metal is still there, it all depends on the rate that customers are comfortable with,” he added."

8,2019-11-05,Titan,"Titan Company on Tuesday posted a 1.83 per cent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit at Rs 320.16 crore for the September quarter, failing to meet Street estimates. 

Analysts in an ET NOW had projected a net of Rs 358 crore.


Here are key takeaways from Titan’s September’s quarter earnings:

Jewellery business subduedThe jewellery business had a subdued quarter due to high gold prices, recording an income of Rs 3,528 crore compared with Rs 3,582 crore last year, a fall of 1.5 per cent. 

For the half year, the company said jewellery division continues to gain market share registering a growth of 5.9 per cent in revenue.


Other segments growThe watches business recorded an income of Rs 719 crore against Rs 676 crore in the previous year, registering a growth of 6.4 per cent. The Eyewear business grew 28.5 per cent YoY in the quarter, recording an income of Rs 154 crore as against Rs 120 crore last year. 

Other segments of the company comprising accessories, fragrances and Indian dress wear grew 33.2 per cent in Q2 recording an income of Rs 44 crore. The previous year income for this segment in Q2 was Rs 33 crore. 


Tax impact dents profitThe company recognised Rs 16.83 crore in deferred tax this quarter due to migration to the newly revised corporate tax rate. However, the current tax liability came down by 30 per cent compared with the September quarter last year."
6,2019-11-05,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Titan Company is likely to report a double-digit rise in net profit for the quarter ended September 2019 despite muted consumer sentiments during the period. There are hopes that the reduction in tax rates during the quarter may provide some comfort to the bottom line of the watch-to-jewellery major.

Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher foresees a 25.50 per cent jump in the bottom line in Q2FY20 on just 5 per cent rise in sales.

“Jewellery volume growth has been impacted by offseason and high gold prices with July seeing negative volumes. However, from Onam onwards, festive momentum is picking up and hence we estimate 13 per cent volume growth in Q2FY20. Other segments remain muted on poor consumer sentiments,” the brokerage house said.

With 20 per cent increase in gold prices YTD, Titan’s jewellery division (Tanishq) is expected to report a weak quarter in Q2FY20. The management had indicated that the performance in July was particularly weak (seeing revenue de-growth) while green shoots were visible in August and September.

“We expect the jewellery division to report muted topline growth of 4 per cent YoY in Q2FY20. Owing to the tough market environment and preponing of activation in June, we expect the watches division to report revenue growth of 7 per cent YoY. Reduction in taxation rate (25.2 per cent versus 31.3 per cent in Q2FY19) is expected to assist net profit growth. Profit after tax is expected to grow 11.5 per cent YoY to Rs 337.6 crore,” ICICI Securities said.

Shares of Titan were trading 1 per cent down at Rs 1,285.30 ahead of its financial result which is slated to announce later in the day.

An assessment by Edelweiss Securities showed 16.20 per cent and 6.90 per cent YoY growth in net profit and revenue, respectively, for Titan. It projected a 14 per cent YoY rise in EBITDA in Q2FY20.

For jewellery business, the brokerage house sees 6 per cent YoY growth on a base of 28.5 per cent. In the watch segment, Edelweiss estimated around 10 per cent YoY revenue growth on a base of 17.3 per cent. In eyewear, it expects 12 per cent YoY revenue growth on a base of 19.3 per cent."
7,2019-11-05,Titan,"Titan Company on Tuesday reported a 1.83 per cent year-on-year rise in standalone profit at Rs 320.16 crore for the September quarter. The company had posted Rs 314.38 crore profit in the year-ago period.

The Jewellery business had a subdued quarter on the back of high gold prices, the Tata group firm said. The segment reported revenue of Rs 3,528 crore against Rs 3,582 crore.

""Jewellery business has done better than most players in the industry. Both the watches as well as eyewear business have recorded good growth. For the second half of FY20 we are gearing up on all fronts to stimulate demand with innovative campaigns for new exclusive collections that are lined up for launch across all our brands,"" said managing director, CK Venkataraman.

3,2019-11-05,Titan,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market's seven-day winning streak will be put to test on Tuesday amid a host of quarterly earnings.

TRADE SETUP


Singapore trading sets stage for negative start
Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded 16 points, or 0.13 per cent, lower at 11,968, indicating a negative start for Dalal Street.


Tech view: Nifty forms indecisive candle
Nifty extended its winning streak into a seventh trading session on Monday, even as it formed an indecisive candle on the daily chart. Supports shifted higher. But the 12,000 level is posing a strong hurdle for the index, analysts said. A majority of the technical indicators reflect positivity, even as oscillators are either in the overbought zone or close to it, they said.

Asian markets near July peaks
Asian shares closed in on their July peak on Tuesday on increasing signs the United States and China are inching closer to a truce in their trade war and on optimism the US economy is well poised for solid, consumer-driven growth. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed in early trade. Japan's Nikkei rose 1.34 per cent to one-year high.


US stocks settled higher
Gains in energy and technology stocks helped Wall Street's three main indices close higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 114.75 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 27,462.11. The S&P500 index rallied 11.36 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 3,078.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 46.80 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 8,433.20.


China Oct services PMI at 8-month low
China's services sector activity expanded at its slowest pace in eight months in October as new orders slowed and business confidence hit a 15-month low, a private survey showed on Tuesday. The Caixin/Markit services PMI slipped to 51.1 last month, matching February's low and edging down from September's 51.3.


Oil prices edge lower
Oil prices slipped on Tuesday amid doubts over whether OPEC and other countries will continue to restrain output, edging lower after two days of gains on US economic data and hopes for a Washington-Beijing trade deal. Brent crude futures were down 14 cents, or 0.2 per cent, at $61.99 a barrel, having gained 0.7 per cent in the previous session.


TechM, Titan to announce Q2 results
Titan Company, Tech Mahindra, JSPL, PNB, Torrent Power, Berger Paints, Ajanta Pharma, Dabur India, Future Enterprises, Gillette, REC, NCC, Godrej Properties and Gujarat Gas are among some of the firms that will declare Q2 earnings later in the day.


DIIs sell Rs 500 crore worth stocks
Net-net, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 138 crore on Monday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 500 crore, data suggests.


MONEY MARKETS


Rupee: The rupee appreciated by 4 paise to close at a five-week high against the US dollar on Monday driven by sustained foreign fund inflows and hopes of a partial trade deal between the US and China.


10-year bonds: India 10-year bond yield rose 0.50 cent to 6.48, after trading in 6.45-6.48 range.


Call rates: The overnight call money rate weighted average was 4.86 per cent, according to RBI data. It moved in a range of 3.20-5.15 per cent.

India opts out of RCEP, for now
In an unusual twist to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) saga, 15 countries decided to go ahead with the trade agreement, giving India the opportunity to join at a later stage after “satisfactory resolution” of its concerns. “India has significant outstanding issues, which remain unresolved. All RCEP Participating Countries will work together to resolve these outstanding issues in a mutually satisfactory way. India’s final decision will depend on satisfactory of these issues,” the grouping said in the Joint Leaders’ statement on Monday after the third RCEP Summit in Bangkok.


China pushes Trump to remove more tariffs 
China is pushing US President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September ahead of the signing of the US-China trade deal, Politico reported on Monday, citing three people familiar with internal discussions. Beijing is pressing the US to remove a 15% tariff that was imposed on roughly $112 billion (£86.82 billion) worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 1, but no decision has been made, Politico reported citing sources. China is reviewing locations in the US, where President Xi Jinping would be willing to meet with Donald Trump to sign the first phase of a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies.

Bank loans to moderate to 25-year low: report
Non-food credit growth is expected to moderate to 8 to 8.5% in FY'20, amidst, low loan demand, according to ratings firm Icra. This will be the slowest growth since 1993-94 when loans rose 5.7%. Icra has forecast that non-food credit growth will slow down to 8-8.5% during FY'20 from 13.3% in FY’19, as fresh loans during the year have been very low. The ratings firm also expects bond market to grow at a slower pace as they remain risk averse towards NBFCs.

RBI cracks the whip on private bank CEOs
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has told private banks to raise the variable portion of remuneration to at least half of the total for chief executives and whole-time directors so that top management rewards reflect the 'pay for performance' principles. The RBI has also streamlined the clawback rules for whole-time directors and material risk takers to penalise them if future financial performance falters and discourage excessive risk taking for short term gains.


GDP growth may fall to 5.8%: BofAML
Despite efforts mounted by the government, demand has been ""muted"" during the festive time, and this leads to a 0.30% cut in FY20 GDP growth forecast to 5.8%, a foreign brokerage said on Monday. The Reserve Bank will cut key rates by a further 0.15% in February review, over the 0.25% expected after the December meeting, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said."

24,2019-11-06,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Titan Company tanked nearly 10 per cent in Wednesday’s trade after the jewellery maker lowered its revenue guidance to 11-13 per cent for the second half of the ongoing financial year from 20 per cent earlier.

The scrip declined to hit a low of Rs 1,150 on BSE, as a host of brokerages cut their price targets on the counter.

Goldman Sachs maintained neutral rating on the stock with a revised target of Rs 1,083 from Rs 1,108 earlier.

Analysts have largely cut their FY20 earnings forecast for the Tata Group firm by 4-10 per cent. 

Publicly available data with Reuters suggests a number of brokerages recommending ‘outperform’ on the stock has fallen to ‘nine’ compared with 17, three months ago. Brokerages recommending ‘Hold’ rating on the stock has climbed to 10 from just 4 a month ago and 3 three month ago.

The shares of the company closed 9.96 per cent lower at Rs 1156 on BSE."
23,2019-11-06,Titan,"NEW DELHI: High gold prices took the sheen off jewellery buying in the Diwali season, forcing Titan Company to lower its revenue guidance for the second half of this financial year to 11-13 per cent from 20 per cent projected earlier.

Indian jewellery businesses do bulk of their business during festivals and the spring wedding season.

The Tata Group posted poor numbers for the second quarter; profit grew at a tepid pace of 1.8 per cent to Rs 314 crore on a marginal drop in sales. 

The festive season of 33 days leading up to Diwali saw muted jewellery demand growth at 10 per cent for Titan, which faces the risk of further cuts in earnings estimates for the next quarter, as an early festive season may have pushed some buying to previous quarter.

Analysts said discretionary jewellery purchases, which contribute a meaningful share of Titan’s Tanishq volume, are likely to remain subdued till customer gets adjusted to the new gold price at Rs 38,000-40,000 per 10 gm.

This adjustment process may take 2-3 quarters, Phillip Capital said in a note.

Post Q2 earnings, most analysts have cut their FY20 earnings forecast for Titan by 4-10 per cent. Price targets for the stock too have been lowered accordingly, as the firm’s jewellery segment performed better than its peers. Long-term investors may look to add the stock on every decline, they said.

Among foreign brokerages, Goldman Sachs has maintained a ‘neutral’ rating on the stock, with a revised price target of Rs 1,083 against Rs 1,108 earlier.

Credit Suisse’s price target of Rs 1,110 factors in an 8-10 per cent cut in FY20-22 earnings estimates. Besides, Phillip Capital has cut price target on the stock to Rs 1,125 from Rs 1,165.

CLSA has even downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ rating with a fresh price target of Rs 1,025. UBS was the most bullish among all: it has maintained a ‘buy’ call on the stock, but revised the price target lower to Rs 1,525 from Rs 1,600 earlier.

Publicly available data with Reuters suggests a number of ‘outperform’ recommendations of brokerages on the stock have fallen to ‘nine’ from 17 three months ago. Brokerages recommending ‘hold’ rating on the stock have climbed to 10 from just 4 one month ago and 3 just three months ago.

Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s holding in the stock declined to 5.10 per cent at the end of September quarter from 5.75 per cent at the end of June quarter. However, his wife Rekha Rakesh Jhunjhunwala raised her stake in the jewellery maker to 1.40 per cent from 1.30 per cent QoQ.

Despite Wednesday’s 8 per cent intraday slide in the stock, the duo still holds Rs 5,340 crore worth of Titan shares, their biggest individual stock investment.

 “There are risks to meeting the lowered 11-13 per cent growth guidance for H2. The third quarter will be very challenging, as the festive season was early this year. Some primary sales to franchisees would have been pushed to Q2 in FY20. There is a Rs 200 crore institutional order on the Q3FY20 base. Also, H2 has a relatively larger base for margins in the jewellery business,” Credit Suisse said in a note.

Phillip Capital noted that Tanishq plans to set up only 60 stores in FY20 against 70 stores envisaged earlier. It expects the stock to remain sideways in the absence of any meaningful trigger for sales revival.

“We would turn constructive on the stock if it undergoes time correction or further corrects from current level, as long-term drivers remain intact, including increasing consumer shift to organised jewellery, aggression in the highly lucrative wedding jewellery market, increasing traction on the revised gold exchange programme, and continued traction for Titan’s Golden Harvest Scheme,” it said.

UBS said the stock could still be a long-term bet.

“Our top-down model indicates that Titan can grow market share in the wedding segment in the addressable market from about 6.1 per cent in FY19E to about 12.1 per cent in FY23E. Tanishq’s overall market share for this consumer segment is likely to grow from about 13.5 per cent in FY19E to about 20.5 per cent by FY23E. In our view, it is a compelling market share accretion and this is key to our Buy thesis on the stock,” the brokerage said. 

It feels any price correction post Q2 earnings would be a further opportunity to buy the stock."

26,2019-11-06,Titan,"Individual investors, including high networth ones, are seeking comfort in blue chips as the broader market has turned volatile.

The total number of individual shareholders in Nifty50 constituent companies increased to 2.33 crore as of September end, 2019 from 2.23 crore on June 30 and 2.16 crore as of March 31,.

As options dried up elsewhere in the market, these investors went for heavy buying in select Nifty stocks, trying to make the most of a market rebound. That, even when valuations of many of these stocks hit sky-high levels.

For instance, Bajaj Finance hovered at a price-to-earnings multiple of 51 times and a price-to-book value of 3.10 times on November 1 after the scrip jumped 130 per cent since December end, 2017.

Nestle India traded at a P/E of 85.40 against the industry average of 49.20. Its price-to-book value stood at 15 times on November 1. The stock has rallied 93 per cent in 22 months to trade around Rs 7,700. Nestle became a part of Nifty on September 27, 2019.

Are these valuations justifiable?

Sunil Singhania-led Abakkus Asset Management in a recent report, titled ‘The Big Call-Bubble in Quality?’ said some of the quality stocks have now reached the bubble zone and could give zero or negative returns over the next few years.

With over 22 lakh small shareholders, 10 per cent of Nifty’s individual investors were holding Reliance Industries, the country’s biggest firm by market value. The stock jumped nearly 60 per cent to Rs 1,457 on November 1 from Rs 921.10 on December 29, 2017. The domestic equity market has remained highly volatile during this period following Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps for mutual funds, credit crisis in the NBFC sector, general elections, unfavourable announcements in the Union Budget 2019, bleak macroeconomic data and adverse global cues.

More than 10 lakh retail investors held SBI, Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares each as of September 30. Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares have cracked more than 50 per cent since December 2017, while country’s biggest lender by assets SBI has largely been flat.

ITC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, TCS, HDFC Bank and Coal India were among other players in which more than 6 lakh individuals held a stake at the end of September quarter, 2019.

IDBI Capital Markets in October maintained a ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490. Among other largecap players, Emkay Global Financial Services is ‘overweight’ on Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Grasim, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, RIL and United Breweries.


Tables: Number of individual shareholders in Nifty companies
 
 
Among other ‘expensive’ Nifty stocks, industry heavyweights TCS, HUL, RIL, Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Titan Company, ICICI Bank, Britannia, Axis Bank and UPL are among other stocks whose P/Es hovered above their respective industry average as of November 1, 2019.

The P/E ratio measures the relationship of a stock price with its earnings per share.

Analysts say stock investing is never only about financials and there are always some qualitative and future growth aspects to it. “Every valuation methodology has one underlying principle: the value paid today should be justifying future earnings potential,” Abakkus said in a report.

The domestic money manager listed HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Titan, Siemens, Berger Paints and ABB among 27 perceived high-quality expensive stocks, where profit after tax and revenue growth stood at a CAGR of 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, in past nine years (See Table).

“We don’t think anywhere in the world at any point of time, companies have traded at P/Es of 50-100 for 10-15 years stretch,” Abakkus said in the report.



It said penetration levels of most of the products these companies produce are much higher today than what they were 9-10 years back, and hence, the growth over the next few years should be lower than what it was over the past few years.

On the other hand, the number of investors in the BSE Smallcap index stocks remained almost stagnant in last three quarters at 4.23 crore.

The number of individual shareholders in BSE Midcap index companies increased marginally to 1.37 crore at the end of September quarter from 1.36 crore at the end of the preceding quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed on November 1. The figure stood at 1.34 crore on March 31, 2019.

Analysts see more comfort in the second-rung stocks, which have been beaten down badly over the past 22 months. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have cracked 17 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC, says midcap and smallcap stocks are clearly giving more relative valuation comfort and that is where you will end up making more money than the largecaps over the medium to long term.

“We have been suggesting that investors should increase a little bit of allocation towards midcap and smallcap stocks. Even in our portfolios, wherever the investment mandate allows, we have been buying midcaps and smallcaps from across sectors,” he told ETNOW during an interaction."

28,2019-11-07,Titan,"Mumbai: Brokerages cut their target prices on Titan Company after the company lowered guidance for jewellery sales growth for the second half of the financial year. The company also reported a muted set of earnings for the September quarter.

Shares of Titan slumped 10 per cent to end at Rs 1156 on Tuesday, with its market capitalisation eroding by Rs 11300 crore. JP Morgan has downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘overweight’ and cut target price to Rs 1260 from Rs 1370. Prabhudas Lilladher and Emkay Global have cut ratings on Titan to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’. Credit Suisse and Phillip Capital have maintained ‘neutral’ rating. CLSA downgraded the stock to sell from ‘underperform'. Brokerages have cut target price by 2-20 per cent, with CLSA cutting the target the most.

""Titan’s 2QFY20 (September quarter result) was a disappointment on almost all fronts. Jewellery showed severe pressure, with an August/September improvement mainly due to higher promotions,” said CLSA.

After the fall, the value of billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his wife Rekha's holding eroded by Rs 670 crore from Rs 7350 crore at the end of the September quarter. Titan is the top holdings of Jhunjhunwala, who cut his stake to 5.10 per cent at the end of September quarter from 5.75 per cent at the end of June quarter. His wife Rekha raised her stake in the jewellery maker to 1.40 per cent from 1.30 per cent sequentially. The combined holding declined 0.5 per cent in the September quarter.


IDFC Securities downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’. The brokerage believes that valuation is full given the worsened growth outlook. ""Despite being a strong believer in Titan’s long-term story (low marketshare in a highly unorganised, large market with best in class consumer understanding and offering), we downgrade it to neutral as we await a pick-up in consumer sentiments and better entry point,” said IDFC Securities.

Morgan Stanley said visibility on near-term trends is murky, but a sharp correction in the stock price may offer an opportunity for long-term investors."

33,2019-11-08,Titan,"Friday marked three years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shock announcement of demonetization, through which he had tried to dig out unaccounted wealth lying in cash.

Days after the move, for many months there would be long queues of common men and women to deposit money in banks and withdraw cash from ATMs.

That dried up cash in the economy and sent stocks plunging to new lows, with some after-effects still being felt across segments of the economy.

Modi made the announcement banning currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations on November 8, 2016. In eight sessions following that, the benchmark BSE Sensex cracked nearly 7 per cent, or 1,800 points, to hit 25,765 on November 21.

Sensex has rebounded ever since, and gone through another roller-coaster ride to scale its new record high of 40,688 on November 7, 2019. In between, the 30-pack navigated many new headwinds, such as GST implementation, Sebi reclassification of mutual funds, credit crisis in NBFCs and global trade tensions.

The 30-share index has risen 47 per cent in last three years, with over 10 per cent of stocks in the BSE 500 index rallying more than 100 per cent.

Adani-group firm Adani Transmission has rallied the most during this period at 550 per cent. It was followed by HEG (490 per cent), Procter & Gamble (up 479 per cent), Indiabulls Ventures (up 445 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 330 per cent) and KEI Industries (up 308 per cent).

Investors on Dalal Street became richer by over Rs 43 lakh crore during this period, as aggregate market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms jumped to Rs 154 lakh crore from Rs 111 lakh crore on November 8, 2016.

Shares of Graphite India, NIIT Technologies, Venky’s India, Bata India, Vinati Organics, Deepak Nitrite, Jubilant FoodWorks, Honeywell Automation, VIP Industries, Adani Enterprises, Astral Poly, Sunteck Realty and Titan Company have advanced 200-300 per cent during this period.


Table: BSE500 stocks which rallied over 100% in 3 years 




Sectorwise, the BSE Consumer Durables index has been the best performer since demonetization, advancing 100 per cent. BSE IT, Bankex, Realty, FMCG and TECk indices have gained 40-58 per cent.

Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said he continues to be positive on consumer durables, despite the recent miss by Titan in Q2.

“Some stocks like Blue Star also have potential. We also like HUL, Godrej Consumer in the FMCG space. Once, the rural market revival comes in these companies will again pick up in terms of volume growth,” he said.

Shishir Baijal, Chairman & Managing Director, Knight Frank India said, “Demonetisation did leave many willing homebuyers cash strapped for a while but only to infuse the system with greater transparency. The buyer is confident now that builders or real estate agents cannot cheat him and cannot demand unaccounted money. The move also pushed banks to go in for home loan rate cuts, making buying homes cheaper.”

Telecom, Auto, Healthcare and PSU indices slid between 8-19 per cent in these three years.

The Sensex traded over 150 points down on Friday after Moody’s Investors Service changed the outlook on India’s ratings to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’, saying there was increasing risks that economic growth will remain materially lower than the past.

Some blamed that the ongoing slowdown on the after-effects of demonetisation.

In a survey conducted by online community platform LocalCircles, around one-third of the participants said the ongoing economic slowdown was the biggest negative impact of demonetisation, while 28 per cent said the move had no negative effects at all.

Around 32 per cent of respondents said the note ban caused loss of earnings for many unorganised sector workers."
34,2019-11-10,Titan,"It was a record-setting spree for the domestic equity market, as equity benchmark Sensex scaled a new high on hopes of more reforms to boost growth amid de-escalation of trade tensions between China and the US and better-than-expected financial results in Q2 so far.

Rising for the second straight week, Sensex added around 159 points, or 0.39 per cent, to end the week at 40,323. NSE barometer Nifty settled at 11,908, up 103 points or 0.15 per cent for the week.

19,2019-12-13,Titan,"Dalal Street mogul Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s success story with Indian stocks has all the stuff that legends are made of.

Often referred to as India’s own Warren Buffet, Jhunjhunwala was just another Mumbai chartered accountant until one day he decided to break ranks and plunged headlong into the stock market with just Rs 5,000 as capital.

By September 30, 2018, that capital had swelled to Rs 11,000 crore, marking out the trailblazing journey that he charted out to become one of India’s most successful stock investors.

Born in Mumbai on July 5, 1960, Jhunjhunwala is probably the perfect example of a common man with an exceptional intellect.

The Big Bull credits his father for developing his early interest in the stock market. RJ says he used to often hear his father, an income-tax officer, discuss stock market with his friends. As he grew up, RJ’s curiosity about the stock market grew, and he would often question his father about stock price fluctuations. His father advised him to read newspapers as he felt it was the news that made stock prices to fluctuate. “This was the first and a very valuable lesson that I learnt from my father about the stock market,” Jhunjhunwala reveals in a video now available on YouTube.

But this journey of becoming the king of Dalal Street hasn't been an easy one. It’s been an awe-inspiring tale of a boy hailing from a humble middle class household and his rise to the Forbes' List of billionaires. 

Jhunjhunwala's rags-to-riches story has been truly inspirational!


Where it all started?
The market honcho soon got fascinated by Dalal Street and expressed his desire to pursue a career in the stock market. However, his father asked him to first get a graduate degree. Jhunjhunwala graduated from Sydenham College in 1985.

After graduation he again discussed his plan with his father. His father permitted him to do so on the condition that he would not support RJ financially, nor should he ask any of his friends for money. He should earn and invest his own money.


Big Bull enters Dalal Street
Jhunjhunwala, also known as the ‘Big Bull’ of Dalal Street, entered the stock market with a meagre Rs 5,000 in 1985. Sensex traded at 150 points back then.

The Big Bull soon realised that to become a successful investor, he would need more funds. He requested one of his brother’s clients to lend him capital and, in return, promised to give higher returns compared with bank fixed deposits.

From the very beginning, RJ’s risk-taking ability, imagination and wisdom earned him huge profits. His first big profit was Rs 5 lakh which he earned in 1986. He bought 5,000 shares of Tata Tea at Rs 43 and the stock rose to Rs 143 within three months, giving him over three-times profit.

In the next few years, Jhunjhunwala made good profits on a number of such stock bets. During 1986-1989 alone, he earned Rs 20-25 lakh.

RJ’s major investments included Sesa Goa, which he had bought at Rs 28 and then increased his investment at Rs 35. Soon, the stock rallied to Rs 65. In 2002-03, he bought ‘Titan Company’ at an average price of Rs 3, and he is still counting his profits on that investment.

During his long career in the stock market, Jhunjhunwala has successfully invested in a number of multibagger stocks such as CRISIL, Praj Industries, Aurobindo Pharma and NCC.

But he has also had his share of failures. After the 2008 global recession and in the subsequent years, Jhunjhunwala's stock prices fell by 30 per cent, but he bounced back and recovered the losses by 2012.

RJ‘s life is a fitting example of the adage that one has to devise ways to solve problems through experiences and lessons learnt from life.

Jhunjhunwala today manages a privately-owned stock trading firm called RARE Enterprises – a name derived from the first two initials of his and his wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala’s names.

According to Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Big Bull’s net worth stood at over $2.5 billion (Rs 17,500 crore) at the end of August, 2019.

Often referred to as India’s own Warren Buffett, the Big Bull owns more than 1 per cent in over 30 stocks, valued at over Rs 13,000 crore.

Let's take a look at the top 10 stocks of the ace investor: NextTitan7 Oct, 2019Jhunjhunwala held 7.05 per cent stake worth Rs 7,837 crore in Titan as of June end, 2019. The company’s stock is up 34.41 per cent year to date. The billionaire investor has been hit due to an industry-wide slowdown on account of financing issues and delayed payments for ongoing infrastructure projects. NextLupin7 Oct, 2019The drugmaker is another company where Jhunjhunwala has over 1 per cent stake (1.71%) as per June quarter shareholding data. The stock has slipped over 20.08 per cent year-to-date. The total holding value in Lupin is over Rs 520 crore. NextCrisil7 Oct, 2019Jhunjhunwala’s other significant stock is Crisil with 5.49 per cent stake worth Rs 516 crore. The stock of the rating agency is down over 19.7 per cent this year.
 NextFederal Bank7 Oct, 2019Big Bull holds 2.93 per cent stake worth Rs 492 crore in the Kochi-headquartered lender. Federal Bank had reported 46 per cent jump in June quarter. However, shares of the private lender are down 9.5 per cent in 2019.

Big Bull’s philosophy
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala believes in order to become a successful investor, one has to make mistakes and learn from them.

“If you do not believe the markets are supreme, you will never admit that it was your mistake. If you don’t admit that it is your mistake, you will never learn. To succeed in the stock market, one not just needs the ability to learn from mistakes, but also to blame only oneself for it,” he says.

“I don’t blame promoters of companies. I blame myself. The promoter is what he is. I have to recognise it if he is not what I expect him to be,” he remarks.

Jhunjhunwala says there are no shortcuts to success. “One should always rely upon the knowledge readily available in the market to become a successful investor,” says he.

Jhunjhunwala’s knowledge of stock market and philosophy of investment has earned his shareholders huge profits.

Being a philanthropist, RJ believes in charity and tries to help the poor. He feels it should not be done with any expectation of good results.

24,2019-12-18,Titan,"NEW DELHI: Volatility could become the new normal for shares of Tata Group, at least in the short term, after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday ordered restoration of Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Sons.

Most stocks from the group ended in the red following the NCLAT order. Tata Motors, which traded higher throughout the session, saw fag-end selling and ended 3.05 per cent lower. Tata Steel fell 2.21 per cent and Tata Communications plunged 7 per cent.

Analysts say that there will be short-term fluctuations in the group’s stocks, but they don't see much impact in the long term.

Jitendra Nath Gupta, former Executive Director at Sebi said, “Shareholders are a temporary losers because of the knee-jerk reaction that generally happens. But in the long run, the companies will have to be valued by its business plans and governance.”

AK Prabhakar, Head of Research at IDBI Capital believes that there will not be a major impact as with Tata Group companies the thought process differs slightly. He sees the judgement as an opportunity for investors.

“I don’t think there will be structural shift, but short term negativity will be there. But that will be an opportunity to buy. Tata Motors will be the most impacted due to reinstatement of Cyrus Mistry,” he added.

A two-judge panel of the tribunal said that Ratan Tata’s actions against Mistry were oppressive and the appointment of a new chairman was illegal. The court also said Tata Sons’ move to turn private from a public company was unlawful and ordered a reversal. The order will take effect after four weeks and Tata has the option to challenge the ruling in Supreme Court.

Even if Mistry actually comes back at the helm at the group, market experts see no major reversal of decisions taken by the current chairman, Natarajan Chandrasekaran.

“I do not see rewinding of any of the decisions even if Mistry becomes the chairman now and sort of takes over the reins, which is highly unlikely. I do not think there will be too much turmoil really,” Prabal Basu Roy, market expert, told ET NOW.

Roy added that he does not think there will be too much disturbance in the stocks apart from short-term fluctuations in the next one or two weeks.

Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities said she expects volatility to continue for some more time. Though she added that she was positive on fundamentally strong companies from the group such as Tata Steel and Tata Motors.

“We advise investors to wait and watch before taking any new call on the Tata Group companies. Tata Steel and Tata Motors are expected to return more than 10 per cent in 2020,” Jain added.

Baring select names, the ongoing calendar year has not been very good for Tata Group companies. As per data available with Ace Equity, only seven of the 27 group stocks have given positive returns year-to-date. Among them are Tata Global Beverages (up 42 per cent), Trent (42 per cent), Titan Company (25 per cent), Voltas (18 per cent) and TCS (14 per cent).

Tata Steel, Tata Power, Oriental Hotels, Tata Elxsi, Tata Teleservices and Automotive Stampings & Assemblies are some of the stocks that have plunged up to 61 per cent in 2019.

Tata Group is likely to challenge the NCLAT verdict in the Supreme Court. JN Gupta said that the Tribunal’s order was not the final word.

“It will come from Supreme Court and no one knows in whose favour that will be. Investors will have to decide whether they want to wait and watch or act right now,” he added.
