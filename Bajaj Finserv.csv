0,2018-01-01,Bajaj Finserv,"MUMBAI: The Bajaj Group’s promoters have initiated the process of passing on their wealth to the younger generation as part of succession planning by realigning their ownership through the purchase and sale of stock in various listed group companies among themselves.

Trades took place last week among Madhur Bajaj and his wife Kumud; Nirav Bajaj, son of Niraj Bajaj; and Anant Bajaj, son of Bajaj Electricals chairman Shekhar Bajaj. More such swaps are likely. “It is just a minor restructuring within the family. Not a single share has been sold outside the family nor purchased from outside the family,” said Niraj Bajaj, who acts as treasurer of family wealth and is the youngest of the four promoters. “This is only one step. There will be some further transactions also. It is work in progress.” 

The Bajaj Group, which traces its history back 90 years to freedom fighter and founder Jamnalal Bajaj, is now owned by four promoters--patriarch Rahul Bajaj, along with Shekhar, Madhur and Niraj. The succession plan will see the assets pass on to their children. “The family has to keep thinking of succession and future planning for the group as well as the happy continuity of the joint family which comprises the families of four Bajaj brothers and their siblings,” said Niraj Bajaj. “We want the Bajaj group to continue its journey for a very long time so we need to keep taking steps.”





More than 4.5 million shares of Bajaj Holdings & Investment were sold by some entities to others from the promoter group for more than Rs 1,369.55 crore at an average price of Rs 2,993 apiece, according to exchange data. Similar transactions occurred in the shares of Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Electricals and Bajaj Finserv worth Rs 408.20 crore, Rs 103.55 crore and Rs 597.69 crore, respectively. Transactions valued at a total Rs 2,479 crore took place. Jamnalal Bajaj’s five grandsons--Rahul, Shishir, Shekhar, Madhur and Niraj--built and nurtured a business with interests in two-wheelers, insurance, sugar, steel, and household electrical appliances. However, Shishir Bajaj left the group and took ownership of Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd and Bajaj Consumer Care Ltd almost a decade back. Rahul and Shishir are brothers while siblings Madhur, Shekhar and Niraj are their cousins. The promoters refer to themselves as brothers.

Shishir Bajaj’s demand for separation had roiled the family and shareholders in 2001. The dispute was settled after seven years of uncertainty.

“Shareholder realignment is to ensure a certain principle of equity maintained across generations and branches ,” said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at Indian School of Business. “This is good to keep different branches or members satisfied both in terms of wealth inheritance and power balance.”

Bajaj became a household name thanks to its scooters, tempo vans and electrical appliances. The Hamara Bajaj jingle of 1990s became synonymous with Indian middleclass dream of owning a scooter. The total wealth of the family is pegged at about Rs 70,000 crore and the Bajaj Group companies have a combined market value of Rs 3.25 lakh crore.

“Indian family businesses are increasingly becoming sensitive to these strategies and are proactive,” said Ramachandran. “Most often wealth is transferred in terms of shares across various companies if there are more than one company involved.” Some family members may opt out of continued ownership, in which case there could be other means of settlements, including funds or other properties, he said."
1,2018-01-17,Bajaj Finserv,"Select smallcap and midcap stocks created huge wealth for investors over the past five years. While largecaps delivered up to 1,500 per cent return during this period, some smallcaps gave up to 8,000 per cent. 

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex spurted 75 per cent during this period, with TVS Motor soaring 1,486 per cent to Rs 768 on January 10, 2018 from Rs 48 on the same day in 2013. 

It was followed by non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, which rose 1,223 per cent to Rs 1,800 from Rs 136. Vakrangee advanced over 1,200 per cent in the same period.

Other stocks that advanced over 5 times in last five years included Eicher Motors (up 906 per cent), Britannia Industries (up 842 per cent), Aurobindo Pharma (up 606 per cent), Motherson Sumi (up 539 per cent).

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher are positive on Britannia and Aurobindo Pharma with price targets of Rs 5,226 and Rs 877, respectively.

Market experts believe Britannia is on the cusp of significant profit growth thanks to a gradual recovery in volume growth, strong tailwinds from the decline in sugar prices and SMP even as wheat and palm oil prices remained stable and competitive advantage after higher GST rate prompted Parle to increase prices. Sustained gains from cost efficiency programmes in the coming quarters will also boost bottom lines. The company’s product portfolio remained robust and re-launch of Treat has been received well in the market. 

Brokerage Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Motherson Sumi with a target price of Rs 459. The scrip traded at Rs 379 on January 17.

“Motherson Sumi offers strong earnings visibility along with improving capital efficiencies. We estimate the company’s consolidated revenues, Ebitda and PAT to grow 22 per cent, 30 per cent and 33.5 per cent CAGR, respectively, during FY17-20E,” the brokerage said.

Shares of Maruti Suzuki, HPCL, Bharat Forge, UPL, Bajaj Finserv and MRF jumped between 430 per cent and 500 per cent between January 2013 and January 2018.

Motilal Oswal is also positive on the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 11,026. Nirmal Bang Securities has a ‘sell’ rating on HPCL with a target price of Rs 321.

Most of the largecaps on the list have been reporting a rise in bottomline numbers year after year. For instance, Maruti Suzuki’s profit grew from Rs 2,469 crore in FY13 to Rs 7,511 crore in FY17. It posted profit numbers of Rs 2,852 crore, Rs 3,807 crore and Rs 5,497 crore for FY14, FY15 and FY16, respectively.

Motherson Sumi, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Eicher Motors, Vakrangee, Aurobindo Pharma, TVS Motor and Bajaj Finserv have also reported sustainable PAT growth during this period.

The BSE Smallcap and Midcap indices climbed 163 per cent and 149 per cent, respectively, during this period. With 7,980 per cent and 5,925 per cent returns, Avanti Feeds and Fiberweb (India) stood among the top gainers in the smallcap space.

At present, BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are hovering at levels never seen before. Market experts are bullish about further movement in these stocks. 

“We expect volatility to increase in the Indian stock market in 2018, as corporate earnings growth expectations seem to have built in some optimism. On the contrary, with market valuation at around 17 times FY19E consensus earnings, the downside is expected to be limited. We expect Sensex and Nifty to be closer to 37,500 and 11,500, respectively, in 2018,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Securities."
2,2018-01-22,Bajaj Finserv,"Rahul Bajaj, Chairman, Bajaj Group and Sanjiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Finserv talk to ETNow on expectations of PM Narendra Modi's address at Davos. Edited Excerpts:

ET Now: He (PM Modi) is coming armed with a World Bank ranking that has gone up. He is coming armed with a Moody's upgrade. He is coming armed having rolled out the GST. Yes the teething troubles are there, but a reform like that waited for 10 years is out. Do you believe that is ammunition enough for him at Davos to woo the audience. What is it that the globe is expecting from Modi?
Sanjiv Bajaj: It is difficult to say what the overall world is expecting, but the theme of the conference this year is how to stay connected in an increasingly fractured world. We saw last year President Xi of China talk about China's role in getting the world together and I hope we see the Indian Prime Minister talk about how India can play that role as well. Over the last few years there are number of measures India has taken and what you have just talked about to make India more attractive place. But along with that India has a larger opportunity and I would say responsibility with the size that we are now to play a role in the larger world as well. So I hope he has something about that.


ET Now: But who do you believe he is addressing at Davos. Is he addressing global leaders, is he addressing the multinationals here to come and invest in India or is he keeping an eye on the Indian audience and by that I also mean Indian industry and what is it that in that context would you hear him say?
Sanjiv Bajaj: My assumption is that he will address the global audience. He will address the global business leaders who will be here. There is a very large, the single-largest group of heads of state and heads of government over the next few days over here in Davos and I am sure while he is just there for 24 hours, he would be meeting many of them. I do not think this is only about the Indian community, because he has already been doing that and we are there in India, so we can see that. So I hope it is to the larger audience.


ET Now: You mentioned Deve Gowda, you mentioned Narsimha Rao, they came in 1997 last and India was a very different market, a very different country, our place in the world was very different. How do you believe the three prime ministers now compared. Mr Modi is the first prime minister in liberalised India to have full majority. He comes armed with the political mandate as well as the economic reforms he has undertaken. In that sense, how do the prime ministers in the past and him compared?
Rahul Bajaj: You cannot even compare. It is not fair to compare people and comparison is odious. Having said that as you said 1997, 1999 something and 2017, they are very different people. What would you expect from Deve Gowda, he comes with all his family here, what the hell are we talking about. I am very sorry. I know him. I met him. He is a nice guy but nice guy is not what we need here.

Narsimha Rao did not do so badly and do not forget now it is very different but this was after 1991 liberalisation which he started of course with the help of Manmohan Singh but Manmohan Singh could not do anything political, but for the support from Narsimha Rao. So he had a good image at that time and he did, I am told, I do not remember now, he did okay but the way he was you cannot compare with Narendra Modi, his communication, the way he communicates. We as an Indians are expecting a lot for India. He has done enough for India in terms of his reputation all over the world, and we just think it should be another further icing on the cake and I am not worried about May 2019. He I am sure is concerned as he should be but that what he does he is not going to affect that, I do not think so."
3,2018-01-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), India’s largest domestic institutional investor, was busy shopping on Dalal Street all through December quarter and handpicked shares from across the sectors such as banking and financial services, FMCG, upstream and downstream oil and gas, ports as well as IT. 

Among the largecaps, LIC increased its holding in IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to 4.17 per cent as of December 31, 2017 from 4.03 per cent as of September 30, 2017. 

TCS posted 1.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase in net profit at Rs 6,531 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, largely meeting Street estimates. 

LIC also increased holdings in Sun Pharma (from 4.36 per cent to 5.53 per cent) and Punjab National Bank (from 12.20 per cent to 13.94 per cent). 

In the FMCG space, it bought into Britannia and Hindustan Unilever (HUL), raising its holdings in the two firms from 3.53 per cent and 2.08 per cent to 3.79 per cent and 2.55 per cent, respectively.

HUL reported a 27.74 per cent jump in December quarter profit at Rs 1,326 crore on volume growth and margin improvement across categories. The company had posted Rs 1,038 crore profit for the October-December quarter a year ago.

Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, says HUL’s volume growth number was better than Street estimate as there was a pick-up of close to 6 per cent in realisations. The brand extension of Ayush as well as Indulekha can yield results in terms of new brands being created, and the market rewarding it.

“If you look at competition vis-a-vis Patanjali, the intensity is reducing. On the detergents side, one can see margin improvement. So, there has been some kind of price improvement. We would recommend an ‘add’ rating on HUL with a target of close to Rs 1,450,” Sofat said.

Overall, LIC hiked its stake in 40 companies in Q3. From the listed universe, it has investments in more than 200 companies from those listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), data available with corporate database Capitaline showed.




Among the upstream and downstream oil companies, LIC took its stake in BPCL to 3.46 per cent at the end of Q3 from 2.43 per cent in Q2FY18. It also increased holdings in ONGC and Oil India to 9.23 per cent and 11.27 per cent, respectively, from 9.20 per cent and 11.07 per cent in the year-ago period.

On January 20, ONGC announced the acquisition of government’s entire 51.11 per cent stake in refiner HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, paying a premium of over 10 per cent. Shares ONGC surged more than 3 per cent on the bourses on January 22.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes this acquisition will bring synergies in terms of larger balance sheet to take on overseas assets, better funding for HPCL’s projects, lesser volatility in ONGC’s earnings and most to fend off possible competition from private players in marketing of auto fuels if there is any threat to margins. 

“The lower-than-expected premium also does not put any overdue pressure on ONGC’s balance sheet. We continue to recommend ‘Buy’ rating on HPCL with a target of Rs 576. There is no significant change in valuation of ONGC eigher. We reiterate ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 234,” Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Rating agencies ICRA, CARE and Crisil too remained LIC’s favourites. Its stake in ICRA jumped to 7.45 per cent at the end of October-December 2017 from 6.75 per cent in the July-September period. It hiked stake in CARE Ratings and Crisil to 9.85 per cent and 5.45 per cent from 9.78 per cent and 4.68 per cent earlier.

Adani Ports, Asian Ports, Bajaj Finserv, Bharat Forge, Castrol India, Rajesh Exports, Marico, Lupin, Zydus Wellness, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and UltraTech Cement were other companies that managed to attract LIC investment in Q3 FY18.

On the other hand, LIC dumped shares of Bajaj Auto, Bank of Baroda, Balrampur Chini, Cipla, ICICI Bank, MMTC, NBCC, Mastek, Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Copper, Volta, Vijaya Bank, Welspun Enterprises and Videocon Industries."
4,2018-01-30,Bajaj Finserv,"Mumbai: Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan Company are likely to replace Bosch, Ambuja Cement and Aurobindo Pharma in the Nifty50 index soon, said analysts at Edelweiss Securities and IDBI Capital Markets & Securities.

These changes are likely to be made in the upcoming semi-annual review of the Nifty index, the brokerages said. The index is reviewed on a half-yearly basis and a fourweek notice is given to the market before making changes to the index. Edelweiss expects the index changes to be announced by the third week of February and the same to be effective on March 30.

The inclusion of Grasim, Bajaj Finserv and Titan will lead to buying of 59.8 lakh shares, 9.2 lakh shares and 63.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

At current prices, it would mean buying of Rs 707.2 crore in Grasim, Rs 451.8 crore in Bajaj Finserv and Rs 567.9 crore in Titan.

Conversely, the exclusion of Bosch, Ambuja and Aurobindo Pharma will lead to selling of 1.4 lakh, 1.13 crore and 43.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

There are certain criteria that determine the inclusion and exclusion of a stock from the Nifty index, including liquidity, float adjusted market capitalisation, domicile and trading frequency.

For inclusion in the index, a security should have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less during the last six months, for 90 per cent of the observations for portfolio of Rs 10 crore. Impact cost is a measure of liquidity of a stock and reflects the costs faced when actually trading an index.

Companies will be included if free-float market capitalisation is 1.50 times the freefloat market capitalisation of the smallest constituent in respective index. These stocks must be available for trade in the futures and options segment and the company must be domiciled in India.

The company’s trading frequency should be 100 per cent in the last six months.

Following these changes, the weightage of sectors in the Nifty is also likely to change. The weightage of financial services will increase to 35.9 per cent from 35.5 per cent and that of cement and cement products will rise to 2.3 per cent from 1.6 per cent, said IDBI Capital in its report.

The weightage of consumer goods will rise to 10.1 per cent from 9.4 per cent, while that of pharmaceutical sector will come down to 3.5 per cent from 4 per cent, the brokerage added.

The last revision in index constituents took place on September 29, 2017, when ACC, Bank of Baroda, Tata Power and Tata Motors DVR shares were excluded. They were replaced by Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and UPL."
5,2018-01-30,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: With the Nifty50 rejig likely in the third week of February, brokerage Edelweiss Securities has come up with a list of possible stocks up for inclusion in the NSE barometer.

The list included Titan, one of Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's favourite stocks.

Jhunjhunwala and his better half, Rekha Jhunjhunwala, together held 8.45 per cent stake in the maker of jewellery, watches and eyewear as of December 31 (up from 8.06 per cent in September quarter), which at Monday's price was worth Rs 6,700 crore.

Other analysts, too, are gung-ho on the stock. As many as 25 of 31 analysts tracking the stock on Reuters' Eikon either have a strong ‘buy’ or ‘buy’ recommendations, four have ‘hold' and just two of recommend 'sell' ratings.

Analysts said the owner of jewellery brands such as Tanishq, Zoya and Mia has a strong balance sheet. Besides, it has healthy cash flow from operations, robust return ratios and has no debt on its books.

Rising share of studded jewellery, cost optimisation and operating leverage are likely to aid margins at the firm, analysts said.

The recent aggression to capitalise on opportunities across divisions is heartening. Earnings CAGR is likely to be a massive 36 per cent over FY17-20. The sheer scale of top-line opportunity demands premium valuations, Motilal Oswal Securities said in a recent note.

The stock has surged 146 per cent in last one year. Yet, analysts see scope for further upside.

Titan has been a key beneficiary of migration from unorganised to organised players driven by recent regulatory changes such as gold hallmarking and GST, which is evident from sustained market share gains, ICICI Securities said in a note.

Its business model has the inherent strength that would enable it to capitalise on larger opportunities like wedding jewellery and gain significant share in the segment, thereby providing impetus to revenue, profit growth, the brokerage said in a note.

Ambit Capital expects the jewellery maker's earnings to grow at 33 per cent annually over FY17-22. Even after this, Titan would still command only 8 per cent market share in the jewellery space and 5 per cent in wedding jewellery. This long growth runway implies Titan will continue to command punchy valuations and, hence, current valuation of 53 times FY19E EPS is inexpensive, the brokerage said.

The jewellery industry has grown at 13 per cent CAGR over FY07-17 and its size is pegged at Rs 2,50,000 crore, compared with Titan’s FY17 revenue of Rs 10,400 crore.

Besides jewellery, Titan retails watches and accessories through World of Titan, Helios and Fastrack stores.

The company also offers sunglasses, contact lenses and frames and retails them through Titan Eye Plus stores. The review looks at liquidity, free-float market cap, trading frequency, domicile and availability on the F&O segment as some of the criteria to pick stocks for the Nifty50 pack.

Bajaj Finserv and Grasim Industries are other two stocks, which are likely to be included in the February rejig. Bosch, Ambuja Cements and Aurobindo Pharma are the three stocks that may make way for the likely new index constituents."
2,2018-02-01,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Stocks opened on a bright note today, shrugging off worries over long term capital gains (LTCG) tax making a likely comeback in the Budget. 

There are expectations that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may not give in to the temptation of big doleouts in his last full Budget -- due later in the day -- before 2019 general elections.

ONGC and HPCL were in focus after the former bought government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in the latter for Rs 36,915 crore. ONGC in fact purchased 77.88 crore shares in HPCL for Rs 473.97 per share, which was much higher than Rs 396.50, the closing price of HPCL on Wednesday.

7,2018-02-16,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: This microcap stock is bound to change your perception about things ‘penny’! And it indeed proves the adage: big things come in small packages.

From Rs 4.5 a share (adjusted share price) in 2003, this stock has transformed itself into one of the biggest largecaps on Dalal Street in last 15 years.

With a market capitalisation nearly Rs 1,00,000 crore (from sub-Rs 100 crore in 2003), non-banking financial company (NBFC) Bajaj Finance has made it to the list of biggest 30 listed firms in value terms on BSE.

In the process, the stock delivered 37,000 per cent return to investors in this duration. On Friday, the stock traded at Rs 1,690 level. Bajaj Finance is a subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv. 


The NBFC’s strong consumer financing business and renewed focus on mortgage and payment segments may help it ward off any near-term macro challenges, say analysts, who expect the stock to deliver up to 40 per cent return over next two years. 

Asset under management (AUM|) of the company grew to Rs 60,194 crore in FY17 from just Rs 2,478 crore in FY08, suggesting an annual growth rate of 43 per cent. At its recent conference call with analysts, the top brass said the Bajaj Group firm should end FY18 with a balance sheet of Rs 80,000 crore to Rs 83,000 crore.



Its net interest income (NII) has risen 38 per cent compounded annually, while profit after tax and interest earned have grown 39 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, in last 10 years.

For the first nine months of FY18, interest earned grew 38.2 per cent, while profit rose 44 per cent. The NBFC firm expects its mortgage and payment businesses to be the key growth drivers over the next three to four years.

Managing Director Rajeev Jain said the businesses should grow much faster than that of Bajaj Finance over the next few years.

“Bajaj Finance, within the consumer financing business, has demonstrated its ability to cross-sell, as is evident from the strong growth seen in the personal loans portfolio in last three years. Its focus on SME and commercial lending may depress margins and RoE, but will keep the growth strong,” said brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which has a target of Rs 2,330 on the stock, suggesting a 40 per cent upside potential.

From a base of 25 million currently, the company aims to reach 75 million customers over the next five years. “The company already has a database of 30 million people, who are mass affluent, but not yet customers of the company. The management would like to tap at least half of them. A tieup with RBL Bank is showing strong traction and it has already issued 0.25 million cards. It targets to end CY18 with 1 million cards,” Motilal Oswal said.

The stock trades at 4.8 times FY2020E book value, which experts believe is reasonable.



That said, brokerage Sharekhan said despite strong positive factors such as a strong growth outlook, relatively less competitive pressure, impressive operating metrics and strong return ratios maintained over time being in its favour, near- term macro factors are stacked adversely against the economy and, thus, for the company.

“Rising bond yields may potentially impact margins and growth for the NBFC. Hence, pragmatism is warranted. We maintain a buy rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 1,900, a 14 per cent upside,” the brokerage said.

The company remains well-positioned to deliver sustainable profit growth going forward.

“We value the company at 5.1 times March 2020 BV, implying a target of Rs 2,050 (an upside potential 23 per cent),” says JM Financial."

Singapore trading sets stage for negative opening
At 7.45 am, Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 41.50 points, or 0.40 per cent, lower at 10,360.50, indicating a negative opening for the Nifty50 in India.


Nifty50 forms Hammer on daily chart
The NSE barometer formed a 'Hammer' pattern on the daily chart. In such a chart pattern, the lower shadow is at least twice as big as the real body. Analysts stay cautious but do not rule out a follow up buying going ahead.

""Nifty recovered smartly from day's lows and made a Hammer Candle on the daily scale, which indicates that decline is being bought after the recent sharp decline in the market. If the index manages to hold above 10,430, then the short-term bounce could be seen towards 10,480-10,500,"" said Chandan taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.


February F&O series to expire today

Rollovers in focus

Coal India: At 35 per cent, Coal India 
rollovers are lower than expected. Akin to the trend seen in last expiry, dividend expectations have led to futures trading at a discount to cash, the brokerage noted.

""The stock has seen reverse arbitrage positions (sell cash and buy futures) being set up. With the street expecting a hefty dividend payout, the counter is rolling at -645bps (cost to short roller). With the expectations of dividend in the next month, long future holders will opt to buy the inventory in the VWAP,"" the brokerage said. VWAP stands for volume weighted average market price. 


Vedanta: At 52 per cent rollovers on this counter too are low. A total 21.9 million shares are outstanding in the near month, which is 2.1 days' average daily volume in cash the market. With the street sensing dividend in Mar or April, Edelweiss expects long future holders to convert the positions to cash. 


ICICI Bank: At 44 per cent 
rollovers, the counter has fresh arbitrage positions (buy cash and sell futures). Roll levels in the counter are 39 basis points (profit to short rollers) which is lower. If levels don’t pick up, we expect short rollers to sell cash in the VWAP, the brokerage said. 


Maruti Suzuki: Fresh arbitrage positions (buy cash and sell futures) have been set up. Roll levels in the counter are 48 bps (profit to short rollers) which is lower. If levels don’t pick up, we expect short rollers to sell cash in the VWAP, Edelweiss Securities said. The counter has seen 52 per cent 
rollovers so far."

15,2018-02-22,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Financial Planning Standards Board India (FPSB) and Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow have released the “Navigator of Responsible Lending- India” – a report on the state of Indian consumer lending sector with respect to responsible lending practices. Focusing on small ticket (up to Rs 15,000) personal and consumer durable loans across both banks and NBFCs, the research aims to introduce the Indian consumers especially first time borrowers to the concept of responsible lending practices, according to a release.

Conducted from July 2017 to December 2017, the report evaluates the performance of industry along five parameters of loan application process, lender’s public information, fees & charges, loan servicing and financial inclusion on the basis of information that a consumer would be able to access in public domain, through his loan journey.

The first edition of the Navigator of Responsible Lending- India seeks to set the standards of responsible lending in India, identifying the key parameters and creating an industry-wide institutional matrix and tool for self-regulation that will serve as the defining contours for responsible lending. Industry players have been evaluated through secondary research of customer touch-points such as website, Points of Sale experience and company literature as well as by speaking to market players across a few geographies for qualitative inputs. It was unveiled at a gathering where eminent names from the industry deliberated on the topic of Responsible Lending: Expectations and Challenges in India.

In the personal loan category, Axis Bank, Fullerton Credit India, Home Credit India, Standard Chartered Bank excelled in following a higher degree of responsible lending practices than peers through the `loan application process’ whereas Standard Chartered Bank and Tata Capital stood out for the `financial inclusion’ parameter. Almost all the evaluated industry players performed well in the parameters of `Fee and Charges’ and `Loan Servicing’.

For consumer durable loans, Bajaj Finserv, HDBFS and Home Credit India were the best performing players for loan application process.

Commenting on the research Ranjeet Mudholkar, vice chairman and CEO, FPSB India said, “Within the context of lending and borrowing, both the parties have mutual responsibility towards each other, to fulfil their respective obligations, with overall objective of making seamless experience for all. The aim of the study is to establish a framework of responsible and healthy relationship, which could result in secured and pleasant experience mutually.”

Speaking on the key outcomes of the research, Devashish Das Gupta, associate professor of marketing management, Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow who led the study said, “The consumer lending industry in India is growing at a remarkable pace, with banks and NBFCs offering “easy” finance options for consumers to buy anything from a mobile phone to a car within minutes. While this is a sign of a progressive and growing economy, we wanted to look at the phenomenon through the prism of globally accepted practices of responsible lending, in light of the customer’s best interest and positive borrowing experience.”

Responsible lending is about transparent processes, ensuring affordability, transparency of terms and conditions and supporting a borrower to repay loans comfortably. “Through this study, our aim has been to explore, evaluate and educate the sector and “Navigate” them towards these best practices. We hope to make this report a regular study and look forward to better industry participation in the future,” he added."
13,2018-02-22,Bajaj Finserv,"The National Stock Exchange (NSE) is undertaking an index rejig that will see inclusion of Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan Company into the benchmark Nifty 50 from April 2. 

These stocks will replace Ambuja Cements, Aurobindo Pharma and Bosch.

17,2018-02-28,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: 
After the exclusion of Aurobindo Pharma, it seems that the weightage of pharmaceutical sector in the Nifty50 could slide further this year.


A study by Centrum Broking on potential Nifty50 
exits suggested that three pharma names Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Lupin could be shown the door in the forthcoming index reviews.


Aurobindo
Pharma would cease to be a Nifty50 component from April 2.

""The removal of 
Aurobindo Pharma from Nifty reflects the ongoing pharma sector downturn resulting in only 4 pharma stocks Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy's and Lupin remaining in Nifty50, with aggregate weightage of mere 3.2 per cent,"" the report said.

Meanwhile, with Bajaj Finserv's entry, the NSE barometer will feature 11 stocks from BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector. This will take BFSI stocks weightage in the index to 33.7 per cent from 33.3 per cent at present, the brokerage said.

Meanwhile, Hindustan Zinc, JSW Steel, Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, Motherson Sumi are some of the stocks that have potential to be a part of Nifty50 going ahead.

Piramal Enterprises MRF, Shriram Transport Finance and Shree Cement are a few other potential Nifty50 stocks.

The 
index is a diversified 50-stock index, which accounts for 12 sectors of the economy. The index reconstruction after considering several criteria such as the free-float market caitalisation of the company, average impact cost during the last six months, trading frequency and so on.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects Hindustan Zinc to deliver healthy volumes going ahead to strong management focus, investment in drilling and human resources. ""We maintain a bullish zinc price outlook and expect LME to average at $3,800/t in FY19 and little lower at $3,200/t in FY20. Ebitda is expected to increase 45-50 per cent, driven by volume growth, cost reduction and favorable LME,"" the brokerage said.

Another brokerage JM Financial likes JSW Steel given its lowest conversion cost and premium realisation for its products against products of peers. ""We factor in Ebitda per tonne at Rs 8,500/8,700 for FY19E/20E, respectively. We roll forward to FY20 to arrive at our SOTP fair value of Rs 300 per share,"" the brokerage said 
after the company's Q3 numbers.

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher noted that the rural demand has been recovering and Britannia Industries has been gaining market share from both organised and smaller players. The company is expected to launch 50 new products/ variants in FY19."

Supported by Nanoo Pamnani, a career Citi-banker who had retired and returned to India, as well as some of our senior leadership across these companies, we developed a plan that would leverage the strengths, credibility, and experience of the Bajaj Group to provide a unique platform for consumers.  We set four business principles for running our businesses. First, focus on building long term profitable businesses which meant not getting trapped in quarterly numbers cycles and short term distractions. Second, in a fairly commoditized market, build a mentality of disruptive innovation so as to provide greater value to customers. Third, build lean operations across companies to become the country’s most efficient financial services provider. Lastly, build a culture of entrepreneurship by practicing accountable empowerment across senior and middle management. Applying these principles over the past 10 years has helped us create a unique culture and build a set of high-quality businesses. This has resulted in the combined market cap of our listed companies viz. Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance growing from less than INR 4,000 crore in 2008 to almost INR 2,00,000 crore today.  What did you do differently to succeed in a competitive marketplace? Bajaj Finance was a small captive for our motorcycle and 3 wheeler business with a book size of INR 1,500 crore. We completely transformed the company to a full-fledged lender. We built a new team and implemented a new technology platform that was cloud enabled from the first day. Importantly, we looked at business lines where our competitors were not delivering enough value and built specific capabilities there. For example, it took three days to get an approval for consumer durable loans before 2008. By 2010, through the use of smart technology and analytics, we had brought this down to three hours. By 2012, this reduced to three minutes and now we approve in less than 30 seconds. In general insurance, we were the first to have an in-house team of doctors and engineers for health and motor insurance claims respectively, thereby providing customers with fair and quick resolution. Another example is our virtual sales office channel where individuals work on hand held electronic devices close to their customers can issue policies and settle claims completely digitally. All these examples have helped us create a brand that thinks of our customers first.  How successful has your strategy of following profit share over market share been? Market share without focusing on profits is only a mirage since such businesses cannot last long. Bajaj Finserv has grown significantly over the last ten years and in FY 17 we reported consolidated revenue just below INR 25,000 crore and profits just under INR 2,300 crore. Our market cap is around INR 85,000 crore and separately, Bajaj Finance was around INR 1,10,000 crore recently. While both our insurance companies are unlisted, in general insurance we contribute to over 50% of the industry’s underwriting profit. These results have vindicated our strategy of following profit share.  Where do you think you are currently in the journey that you envision for Bajaj Finserv? We are in a good place where we have created the right teams, built an enabling and entrepreneurial culture, and established the right business lines – thereby creating a solid financial services platform for our customers. Our current focus is now on digitalization across our businesses, leveraging data further for better customer insight, and establishing appropriate partnerships for our teams to leverage and create new opportunities in an increasingly dis-intermediated world. A recent example is our investment in Mobikwik whose capabilities we will use across our companies."

1,2018-03-22,Bajaj Finserv,"Corrective phase persisted on Dalal Street a
s Indian equities continued with its modest slide on Thursday. The NSE benchmark Nifty once again failed to sustain above the 200-DMA despite enjoying a modestly positive opening.

The index ended the day with a loss of 40.50 points or 0.40 per cent. In volatile moves, the session remained capped in a range.

As we approach Friday, the analysis remains once again on similar lines. The Nifty has resisted to the 200-DMA, which stands at 10,171 now, and unless Nifty moves past this level, it will continue to pose resistance to the market on a closing basis.

We expect a quiet opening once again. However, the levels of 10,170 and 10,135 will continue to offer strong resistance area for the market. Supports continue to remain at 10,040 and 9,980.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 36.4130 and this continues to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. Daily MACD stays bearish, while it trades below its signal line. No significant formations were observed on the candles.



Having a look at the pattern analysis, the Nifty dipped below the 200-DMA at close, and while attempting to pullback, this level has offered a stiff resistance.

Any pullback will be seen only after the Nifty moves past and closes above the 200-DMA. Having said this, the oscillators have begun to turn upwards for the Index on the daily charts, while being still oversold on the weekly charts.

The level of 10,040 will continue to offer a strong pattern support for the market. However, it would still remain important to note that in spite of any strong opening that the market may see at opening of during the session, unless it ends itself above 200-DMA, it will continue to remain vulnerable to selloffs.

We continue to recommend approaching markets on a very cautious note until it throws an imminent pullback taking it above 200-DMA at close.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Good technical set up was observed on counters such as Bajaj Finserv, CG Power, Vedanta, Hind Zinc, IndusInd Bank, IDFC, Reliance, Tata Power, Tata Motors, Hindalco and NTPC.

4,2018-03-26,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: The Sensex slipped below the crucial 33,000 level and NSE’s Nifty below the psychologically important 10,000 level on Friday, as first signs of emergence of a global trade war roiled equity markets around the world

BSE’s 30-pack tumbled 1.7 per cent during the week gone by while NSE’s Nifty lost 2 per cent.

“The price-wise correction is over for the market; maybe another 100-200 point fall in Nifty is all that we anticipate,” says Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President & CEO, Yes Securities.

But the time-wise correction is going to be a lot more painful and individual stocks will keep on moving up and down. So this is going to be a phase which will be terrible for traders, but will be a good time for investors to hold on to stocks and build a portfolio for the long run, he said.


Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver handsome gains over the next three weeks or so.


Sagar Doshi, Technical Analyst, Edelweiss Investment Research


Hexaware | Buy | Target Price: 400 | Stop loss: Rs 360

Out of all sectoral indices, the IT sector is the one which is not participating in the current fall. While the Nifty has made lower lows, the IT index has not yet broken its previous lows of Feb 2018. Out of all the IT stock, midcap firm Hexaware stands strong, with the stock trading just 3 per cent away from its lifetime high. It has also sustained above its 20DMA and is nearing a breakout.


Bajaj Finserv | Buy | Target Price: Rs 5,340 | Stop loss: Rs 4,965

While the market is down 4 per cent in March, this stock is up 5 per cent. Trading in a tapering range and near a trendline breakout, the stock could further continue its outperformance against the market and resume its long-term uptrend. On the longer timeframe chart, the stock is forming a FLAG pattern on a monthly basis.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research &amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


NTPC | Buy | Target Price: Rs 187 | Stop loss: Rs 160

This counter appears to have registered a durable bottom at the recent low of Rs 158 hit last February and since then a fresh leg of upswing is in progress. Interestingly, after hitting the said low, it has consolidated in a narrow range for four weeks and then witnessed a sustainable breakout. As long as it sustains above Rs 160 level, one can look for a higher target at Rs 187.


Zee Entertainment | Buy | Target Price: Rs 619 | Stop loss: Rs 547

The way this counter has recoiled after testing its 200-day EMA is suggesting that this counter has bottomed out around Rs 550 level, but can also head to much higher levels in the course of time. In the near term, the Rs 581 level may act as a hiccup but once that level is conquered, it can almost retest its life time highs placed around the Rs 619 level. Positional traders should buy now and on declines in the zone of Rs 560-555.


JSW Steel | Buy | Target Price: Rs 320 | Stop loss: Rs 273

It is very interesting that this counter from the metals pack registered new lifetime high on February 27, when there was turbulence both in the market as well as in the entire metal sector. This is clearly suggesting that this counter has successfully decoupled from the uncertainty related to metals pack and capable of going higher on its own inherent strength, irrespective of market conditions.


Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical/ Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities


ICICI Prudential Life Insurance | Buy | Target Price: Rs 400 | Stop loss: Rs 370

This stock has bounced from its support level at Rs 368, which roughly corresponds to the previous intermediate lows, thereby implying a double bottom formation pattern. We also observe that the intense selling seen recently has been reduced in the process, which is encouraging. With the stock on the verge of moving above its 13-day SMA and momentum readings like the 14-day RSI in rising mode and not overbought, we believe the stock has more upside potential.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher


Gujarat State Petronet | Buy | Target price: Rs 204 | Stop loss: Rs 170

This stock recently witnessed a steep correction from the Rs 210 level and has bottomed out at Rs 172 level. The counter has the potential to rise further in the coming days. Chart patterns look attractive and with the RSI indicating a trend reversal from the oversold zone. A buy signal has been triggered to maintain a positive bias. 


Jubilant Life | Buy | Target price: Rs 890 | Stop loss: Rs 780
This stock has taken a support around Rs 780 on two occasions to indicate a strong base at this mark. “We anticipate Jubilant Life to be in the recovery mode from here on and scale further upside targets in the coming days,” said Parekh. Positive candle patterns indicate a positive bias. Also with the RSI turning positive from the oversold zone, the stock is poised for a bounce.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA


GE Power India | Buy | Target Price: Rs 895 | Stop loss: Rs 838

This stock completed its corrective move after testing the high of Rs 1,044. It attempted to find a base in the Rs 810-840 range and is not seen breaking out from this congestion. The prices have ended outside the upper Bollinger Band on the daily chart. The band remains 43 per cent narrower-than-normal and this further increases the chance of a decisive move. MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The RSI is seen breaking out from a formation while marking higher highs. It also shows bullish divergence against the price.


PNB Gilts | Buy | Target Price: Rs 38 | Stop loss: Rs 33.50

This stock has remained in a dominant downtrend for the major part of the previous year. Currently, after testing low of Rs 34, the stock is seen possibly accumulating in the Rs 34-35 zone and might attempt a reversal. A buy signal has emerged over Stochastic with a bullish divergence against the price. MACD remains in continuing buy mode. On the weekly charts, the prices appear to have taken support at the 200-period moving average. The weekly RSI shows a bullish divergence against the price.

2,2018-03-26,Bajaj Finserv,"Since February, the Sensex has shed over 3,000 points. As investment values erode, a sound strategy would be to hold fundamentally strong stocks. Even if hit by short-term volatility, such stocks revert to their fair values once the market settles. The net profit margin is a good indicator of a stock’s strength. It is calculated by dividing the net profit (or PAT) by sales revenue. For instance, a net profit margin of 15% implies a company is generating a net profit of Rs 15 on every Rs 100 sales. Net profit is the residual profit available after paying manufacturing, sales and distribution expenses, depreciation, interest costs and taxes. 

Companies with rising net profit margins are efficient and better equipped to survive economic contractions. Accurate pricing and effective cost control are some of the features of such companies. There are nine companies in the BSE500 universe whose net profit margins have risen rising consistently in the past five quarters between December 2016 and December 2017. The nine as a group outperformed the BSE500 by 4.9 times. Of the nine, we take a look at the top five companies that have displayed the maximum efficiency.


Himadri Speciality Chemical: According to a Antique Stock Broking report, Himadri Chemical will benefit from a demand recovery in the aluminum industry for coal tar pitch. Moreover, company is likely to diversify into higher value added products in future. In the third quarter of 2017-18, the company’s operating profit grew 100% y-o-y to Rs 62.68 crore. It reported 248.8% y-o-y growth in net profit helped by substantial reduction in interest costs.



Tata Sponge Iron: The company produces sponge iron by the direct reduction method. According to a Karvy research report, demand for steel will be strong on account of improving macros and increased investment in infrastructure by the government. While the top line of the company grew by 49.4%, the bottom line grew by 228.2% y-o-y. The stock gained 70.9% point-to-point returns between December 2016 and March 2018.



Gujarat Alkalies & Chemicals: The chemical manufacturing company deals in caustic soda lye and caustic soda flakes. Rising caustic soda prices are likely to benefit the company going forward. In the third quarter of 2017-18, the operating profit jumped by 97.9% y-o-y helped by decline in total expenditure. It reported a healthy bottom line growth of 137.1%. The stock delivered over 100% point to point returns.



Phillips Carbon Black: Engaged in the manufacture and sale of carbon black, the company enjoys a 46% market share. Its net profit margins went up from 2.76% in the December 2016 quarter to 9.24% in the December 2017 quarter. According to a research report by SKP Securities, Phillips Carbon is well positioned to capitalise on the positive structural changes in the industry. Strong demand from the auto sector, continued anti dumping duty on Chinese imports, stable international crude prices and improvement in operational efficiencies will help it further. In the third quarter of 2017-18, its topline and operating profit grew 13.7% and 50.4% y-o-y respectively. The stock delivered 371.5% point to point returns between 30 December 2016 and 19 March 2018.



Bajaj Holdings & Investment: It holds Bajaj group’s investments in Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finserv and is registered as a NBFC. The company focuses on earning income through dividends, interest and gains on investments held. The outlook of the company is promising as both Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and Bajaj Finance are likely to maintain high growth trajectory in the future. In addition, improved visibility of Bajaj Auto in the exports and global markets will prove beneficial. In the third quarter of 2017-18, operating profit grew 62.3% y-oy, helped by substantial decline in total expenditure. The net profit margins went from 45.02% in December 2016 quarter to 84.5% in December 2017. The stock delivered 38.3% returns between 30 December 2016 and 19 March 2018.

0,2018-04-01,Bajaj Finserv,"MUMBAI; Global tech major Microsoft is looking at investing in Indian tech startups through its venture funding arm, a senior official has said. 

""Microsoft Ventures is not here yet. We intend to come to this market...there will be an explicit commitment for India,"" its executive vice-president for business development Peggy Johnson told recently. 

Johnson, who reports to the company's India-born chief executive Satya Nadella, however, did not quantify the overall commitment that will be made to India, saying an announcement on the same will be made shortly. 

Microsoft Ventures invests at an early-stage in start-ups and currently has offices in London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Tel Aviv. 

The company already services about 5,000 Indian startups through its various programmes, including seven accelerators, with partners like an arm of Reliance Industries and 24 third-party accelerators, she said. 

Johnson said engagement with the startup world is very important for her company. 

Reacting to recent media reports, she said there has been a change in the leadership of the accelerator programme but affirmed that the commitment to the startup community remains unchanged. 

The company looks at India both as a hub for its research and development, and engineering activities, and also as a market for its products, and has 11 offices in the country now employing 8,000. 

Johnson said the firm feels its three data centers in the country are ""sufficient"" and expressed satisfaction at its presence in the market, which is witnessing heavy competition. 

Amid the growing instances of frauds at banks, like the over Rs 13,000-crore Nirav Modi scam at PNB, Johnson said technology can help prevent such frauds. 

""Because they have vast amounts of data, we can help. We have seen interest from banking sector the world over and I think it can help them be more efficient with some of their processes and take out some of the manual parts that can introduce error into the process,"" she said. 

The company already works with Bandhan Bank and Bajaj Finserv, another company official said. 

On the ongoing difficulties faced by the tech sector following the Cambridge Analytica revelations that have put social media giant Facebook in a spot, Johnson said Microsoft has a history of compliance and will adopt any new regulations as well. 

She also said technology tools like blockchain can help resolve the current concerns on the data security and privacy front."

4,2018-04-03,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: It is good to be invested in insurance companies, both general and life, says Prateek Agarwal, Business Head & CIO, ASK Investment Manager.
The penetration levels in the space will allow for a significantly longer period of growth and profitable growth as well, Agarwal said in an exclusive interaction with ETNow.
Apart from this, Agarwal is also bullish on select private lenders and NBFC players.
""We are not trying to find newer names, but we are sticking with the earlier ones, which have done very well.""
Some of the NBFCs that have given handsome returns in the last three years include Bajaj Finance (up 346 per cent) Bajaj Finserv (289.36 per cent) and Edelweiss Finance (up 298.51 per cent).
Among private lenders, he is positive on HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Agarwal says his firm has been invested in these banks for the last several years.
""In finance building, credibility is of extreme importance because it is very tough to look into numbers and find out anything given the fact that the raw material and the finished product both is cash, money,"" he said. So, the credibility of the management, how they have performed over a long period of time is extremely important and very few businesses offer that and in combination with strong growth. So, we are just focussed on that space and we continue to be invested there, he added.
Last two months have been really hard for investors in financial segment owing to a series of negative news for both public and private sector banks. The thread started by India's second largest PSU bank Punjab National Bank (PNB) with Rs 13,000 crore fraud got lengthier as more banks came into the spotlight. The Nifty Bank index has slumped 4 per cent so far in CY2018 while the Nifty PSU Bank has tanked 22 per cent during the same period. 
Speaking on the horrors of February and March in stock market, Agarwal says, ""The horrors happened after the Budget as it increased cost of capital for investing into equities and we made a point on this show that one should have expected around 10-11 per cent correction from the highs given that the globe was looking fine."" Now, we have got that. If there is further downtick, it would be an overshoot.”"

5,2018-04-04,Bajaj Finserv,"Midcap and smallcap stocks outpaced blue chip companies on Dalal Street all through financial year 2017-18. The BSE Smallcap index rallied 16 per cent to 16,994.36 as of March 28, 2018 from 14,620 on April 3 last year.

The BSE Midcap and Sensex climbed 12 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

Despite the correction in February-March this year, market experts do not expect any rally in midcaps and smallcaps like the one seen in calendar 2017.

“One needs to be very selective and must focus on quality names rather than chase momentum or news-driven stocks. One can start gradually accumulating carefully chosen stocks from the midcap space,” said Gaurav Dua, Head of Research at Sharekhan.

Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty corrected nearly 10 per cent from their respective all-time highs scaled in January 2018.

“We believe bulk of the price damage is perhaps behind us, though it is not easy to call a bottom and perfectly time the market,” Dua said.

The BSE Sensex was trading 118 points up at 33,489 in the morning trade on 
April 4, 2018, whereas NSE Nifty index was up 29 points at 10,273.
As a new financial year dawns, ETMarkets.com spoke to top market analysts and collated a list of stocks that can potentially double investor wealth if the bulls take charge from here on.

Recommendations by: Rusmik Oza, Head-midcaps, Kotak Securities

Tata Motors: As forex hedges reduce, this company can potentially double net profit between FY18E and FY20E. If this materialises, then return on equity (RoE) – which now stands at 12-13 per cent – can move up to 18-20 per cent. On potential FY20E, the stock is trading cheap at less than 7 times FY20E PE and around 3 times FY20E EV/Ebitda. The stock is suppressed on account of weak numbers. As the numbers improve in future, the stock should deliver good gains.


Federal Bank: Once NPA issues get resolved, this bank is expected to report earnings growth at a CAGR of 25 per cent over next two to three years. The stock trades cheap at around 1.1 times FY20E book value. At its peak, the stock traded at 2 times forward price/BV. “Better valuation and a rise in earnings could provide the necessary push for the stock to double over the next three years,” said Oza.


Jindal Stainless (Hisar): After GST rollout and imposition of 18.95 per cent countervailing duty (CVD) on Chinese imports, Kotak expects Jindal Stainless (Hisar) to garner higher market share in the coming years. “We expect revenue and PAT to grow at a CAGR of 15 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, during the FY17-FY20E period with a return ratio in the range of over 20 per cent. The stock trades at less than 4 times FY20E EV/Ebitda. On SOTP basis, the stock is expected to trade at 7 times forward EV/Ebitda in future and derive value from its 36.6 per cent stake in Jindal Stainless,” Oza said.


UPL: This company has the potential to grow earnings at a CAGR of 17-18 per cent over next three years. It is the best diversified play in the agro-chemicals space. “UPL deserves to trade at higher multiples then the sectoral average. The company’s FY18E net profit is likely to be 5 times higher than its second biggest competitor, but still it trades at 15 times forward PE when the sectoral average is around 20 times forward PE. At 20 times forward earnings and assuming earnings growth at 18 per cent CAGR, the stock can double 
in three years,” said Oza.


Recommendations by: Gaurav Dua, head of research, Sharekhan

Jubilant Foodworks: This company should be one of the key beneficiaries of the improvement in the consumer discretionary environment in the domestic market. Jubilant Foodworks’ management is confident of maintaining the double-digit same-store sales growth (SSSG) on the back of sustained focus on product innovation and digitisation. Further reduction of losses in Dunkin Donuts and sustained operating efficiencies will drive its profitability going ahead.


Sundram Fasteners: Sundram Fasteners (SFL) is moving up the value chain and has successfully introduced new products, viz. engine components, pump assemblies, powder metal parts andshafts, which enabled it to diversify its product portfolio and increase content per vehicle, thus reducing dependence on fasteners. The company recently gained foothold to the fast emerging electric vehicles space with orders from Tesla. With the introduction of high-margin value-added products and improvement in subsidiary performance, Sharekhan expects SFL to outgrow the industry with a strong 16 per cent earnings CAGR over FY2018-2020


Bajaj Finserv: The company is an attractive play on our long-term structural theme of financialisation of savings in the economy. It is the holding company for Bajaj group’s life insurance (Bajaj Allianz) and lending (Bajaj Finance) businesses. Bajaj Finance is the leader in its segment and has revolutionised the retail lending business in India, whereas the life insurance segment is progressing well to emerge out of the investment phase and has already become an industry-leading player. Both businesses have excellent operating metrics in their respective segments and are likely to continue the growth trend going forward.


Recommendation by: Prateek Jain, Director, Hem Securities

ITC: ITC is among the preferred picks of Hem Securities given 17 per cent rise in bottomline in Q3 of FY18. “The FMCG market in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.6 per cent and should reach $103.7 billion by 2020 from $49 billion in 2016 which provides ample opportunity for this company,” said Jain.

7,2018-04-05,Bajaj Finserv,"Equity investors on Dalal Street became richer by over Rs 2.50 lakh crore on Thursday, as the equity market rejoiced RBI’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged and the leeway it gave to domestic lenders to absorb their loan losses.

Firm opening in European markets, positive services PMI data and buying across the sectors also supported market mood. The BSE Sensex climbed 577 points, or 1.75 per cent, to end the day at 33,596, whereas NSE’s Nifty index jumped 196 points, or 1.94 per cent, to 10,325

Following the rally, total market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies soared by Rs 2.62 lakh crore to Rs 146.74 lakh crore from Rs 144.12 lakh crore at Wednesday’s close.

As many as 48 stocks closed in the green in the Nifty50 pack, with Hindalco gaining the most at 6.52 per cent, followed by Vedanta (up 5.56 per cent), State Bank of India (up 5.46 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (up 5.19 per cent). Cipla and Bharti Airtel declined 1.72 per cent and 0.27 per cent, respectively.

In the money policy review, RBI kept the key policy rate unchanged at 6 per cent for the fourth consecutive time since August last year in view of uncertainties around inflation.

Indian services sector activity returned to its growth track in March, driven by greater inflows of new work, following which firms increased their staffing levels at the fastest pace in 7 years, says a monthly survey.

The seasonally-adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index improved from 47.8 in February to 50.3 in March, indicating that business activity stabilised during the month. The index slipped below the 50-point mark, that separates expansion from contraction, in February.

 “Keeping interest rates unchanged has been as per expectations. This along with the leeway given to banks to absorb loan losses (done over last few day) has provided fuel to the stock market. RBI has been conscious of lower inflation risk and uncertain global trade environment,” said Prateek Agrawal, Business Head and CIO, ASK Investment Managers.

Metal stocks were top gainers on BSE. The Metal index rallied over 4 per cent. It was followed by Bankex (up 2.78 per cent), Realty (up 2.55 per cent) and Consumer Durables (up 1.85 per cent). Other sectoral indices on the stock exchange also ended in green.

Other Asian peers also bounced from recent lows on Thursday, taking cues from a stronger session on Wall Street as investors judged recent trade war fears were overblown. Dow Jones Industrial Average index settled 230.94 points, or 0.96 per cent, up at 24,264 in the previous trading session.

Devang Mehta, Head of Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management said there has been consistent improvement in certain macros and important data points like better than expected 3rd quarter GDP, pick up in the manufacturing sector and industrial production, excellent auto sales numbers and pick up in credit growth.

“With revised lower inflation trajectory by RBI, Equity markets were clearly enthused. We continue to be bullish on domestic themes where there is good predictability of earnings growth,” he said."
8,2018-04-09,Bajaj Finserv,"The equity market got off to a better start on Monday, showing resilience along with the Asian peers despite weak overnight closing of US Markets.

 In a rangebound session, the Nifty remained relatively steady, and ended up rising 47.75 points or 0.47 per cent.

 We expect this upmove to continue on Tuesday. However, market is showing some signs of impending consolidation, but despite such intermittent mild consolidation moves, the Nifty is all likely to advance towards its 100-DMA and 50-DMA zones, which remain in close vicinity of each other.

 Tuesday will see the levels of 10,430 and 10,450 will play out as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports will come in at 10,330 and 10,275 zones.



 The RSI on the daily chart is 54.7432, and it has once again marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish. RSI stays neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD is bullish, while it trades above the signal line. Apart from a white body that was formed on candles, no significant pattern was observed.

 If we analyse the overall structure of the charts, the market is comfortably placed in a 27-month long upward rising channel on weekly charts. On daily charts, it has broken out from a small falling channel, which it had created since the beginning of 2018.

 Overall, though chances of some consolidation, sooner or later, cannot be ruled out, we expect the Nifty to continue with its advancement.

 We expect this upside to continue, and will see market taking breather between 10,430 and 10,450, where the 100-DMA and 50-DMA converge. We expect some consolidation happening there. Until this happens, with each move that result into consolidation or a mild corrective wave, these opportunities should be utilised to make select purchases.

 The underlying structures of the market remains stable.

11,2018-04-17,Bajaj Finserv,"Chennai: MobiKwik announced a partnership with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) through which subscribers can pay their utility bills digitally using the MobiKwik wallet. This partnership will benefit 280 lakh subscribers of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB), the company said.

Bipin Preet Singh, founder and CEO of MobiKwik, said: “With the the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) going live, residents of Tamil Nadu can now pay their electricity bills with a single tap on their smartphones. Our efforts to digitise utility payments in Tamil Nadu are being acknowledged and we are receiving a positive response.” 

The BBPS is a tiered structure for operating bill payments in India.

This is MobiKwik’s latest tie-up following its partnerships with BSNL, Bajaj Finserv Ltd and IndusInd Bank in 2017.

The BBPS allows transactions worth $1 million every day. According to a KPMG report, Rs 2.69 crore was transacted through 19.21 million transactions in December 2017, up 46% from April 2017, when the pilot was launched.

 “BBPS is significant in enabling a digital India and will facilitate a cashless society through migration of bill payments from cash to digital channel,” Singh added."
12,2018-04-24,Bajaj Finserv,"Indian equity market consolidated for yet another session on Tuesday, as the NSE benchmark Nifty50 ended with a modest gain of 29.65 points or 0.28 per cent. 

On expected lines, the market saw a quiet opening, and just when it started to correct in late morning trade, short covering gave it a lift. Bulk of the short covering was rollover in nature.

Wednesday is the penultimate session of the expiry of the current derivative series. We once again expect a tepid start to the trade. The rollovers will continue to dominate, and we expect the market to trade, while continuing to resist the 10,650 zone.

The levels of 10,650 and 10,695 will act as key resistance zone. Supports will come in lower at 10,585 and 10,510.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 65.4201, and it has marked yet another 14-period high, which is bullish. RSI shows no divergence of any kind against the price. The daily MACD stays in bullish mode while trading above its signal line. No significant formations were seen on candles.

Pattern analysis shows that despite showing buoyant undercurrent, Nifty has not yet achieved a clear breakout from the broad rectangle trading range. A clear breakout will be achieved once the Nifty moves past 10,650 level with some conviction.
Overall, despite buoyant undercurrent, traders should tread the market with some caution.

India VIX has dropped to its lowest value in recent time and the Nifty PCR (Put to Call Ratio) still continues to remain at elevated levels. These factors are likely to keep upmove capped on the upside. In other words, with each upmove, Nifty remains more and more vulnerable to profit taking bouts.

Apart from this, we will continue to see sector and stock specific performances occurring as well. We continue to reiterate to keep protecting profits vigilantly at higher levels while adopting a cautious view on the market.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Good technical set up is observed in stocks like GATI, Snowman Logistics, SBI, Canfin Homes, Bajaj Finserv, Godrej Properties, Reliance, ONGC, Bharat Financial, and RAYMOND.

But, we would like investors to be watchful of this concern, said Sanjeev Zarbade, Vice-president-PCG Research at Kotak Securities.While better-than-expected earnings from IT firms and a couple of banks have kept market sentiment elevated, weak numbers from other sectors can weaken market sentiment, Zarbade said. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially see good gains over the next three weeks.Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP ParibasPTC India | BUY | Target Price: Rs 102 | Stop loss: Rs 86.70PTC’s daily chart shows a three-wave correction after a five-wave rise. The correction retraced nearly 78.6 per cent of the rise, which proved to be a crucial support. Over there, the daily lower Bollinger Band also offered support to the counter. Consequently, the stock has taken off thereon. As per the Elliott Wave Theory, PTC is expected to form another set of a five-wave rise from current level. Thus, this is a high probability level to initiate a fresh buy position.Piramal Enterprises | BUY | Target Price: Rs 2,900 | Stop loss: Rs 2,550PEL witnessed a multi-month correction from the high of Rs 3,070 registered in June last year. The correction looks over in the last month at the low of Rs 2,275. Thereon the stock seems to have embarked on a fresh rally, which can last for several months. Thus, the stock looks positive from short term as well as medium term perspective. The stock is moving up along with a rising trendline. The recent structure shows that the stock has formed a consolidation above the trendline and has broken out from the consolidation on the upside.CEAT | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,787 | Stop loss: Rs 1,508CEAT has been forming an Inverted Head & Shoulders, which is a bullish pattern. The pattern is spanning over several weeks so the implication of the pattern breakout is likely to be significant. Currently, the stock is forming right shoulder of the pattern. Hereon it is expected to head towards the neckline and can eventually breakout on the upside. The risk reward ratio at this level is very attractive to take a fresh long position.Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTAIIFL HOLDINGS | BUY | Target Price: Rs 835 | Stop loss: Rs 720This stock tested the high of Rs 874 and since then it has been under a corrective retracement. It has tested the 100-DMA level twice and is seen taking support and bouncing back from this significant support area. A buy signal has emerged over Stochastic on the daily chart. The RSI is seen forming a higher bottom and is seen inching higher showing a bullish divergence against the price. On the candles, a candle with a long lower shadow emerged near the support area of 20-WMA. Some pullback and upward revision in prices cannot be ruled out.Bajaj Finserv | BUY | Target Price: Rs 5,650 | Stop loss: Rs 5,340This stock has formed a classical rounding bottom formation followed by a double top. After a minor attempt to break above this price level, the stock presently remains under sideways consolidation. A couple of signals have emerged which point towards likely upward revision in prices over coming days. RSI is seen taking support at a pattern and is seen moving higher. The weekly MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The stock remains in leading quadrant when compared against the financial services pack on the RRG.Gajendra Prabhu, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC SecuritiesIRB Infra | BUY | Target Price: Rs 290 | Stop loss: Rs 248This counter has started a fresh rising leg from the low of Rs 249 which is end of either “wave b/ii”. Price is finding support at the key moving average i.e. 21-day EMA. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed long legged doji candle pattern which is significant bullish reversal formation. In addition, the price is rebounding from 50 per cent retracement level of last rise from Rs 214 to Rs 282. Also, the stock has been forming higher top and higher bottom formation in larger degree which is a bullish development. In bigger picture, price is in internals of major ‘wave C’ and has good upside potential.Wockhardt | BUY | Target Price: Rs 910 | Stop loss: Rs 765This stock has been forming an Inverted Head & Shoulder pattern on daily chart and price is hovering at the neckline. The stock is likely to breakout in next few days as the stock is trading above all key moving averages of 21-, 50- & 200-day EMAs. Apart from this, it is in progress of attempting to cover the down gap witnessed on January 30, 2018 placed at the Rs 910 level. Major ‘wave C’ is in progress and the stock has fair potential to make new 52-week high in the long run.Aditya Agarwala, Technical Research Analyst, YES SecuritiesApollo Tyres | BUY | Target Price: Rs 314-Rs 323 | Stop loss: Rs 280On the weekly chart, Apollo Tyres has broken out from an Ascending Triangle pattern triggering an extension of the uptrend. On the daily chart, the stock has broken out from a pennant pattern suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions. RSI on weekly chart has turned upwards, currently trading above the 60-level affirming the strong bullishness dominant in the stock. It can be bought in the range of Rs 291-Rs 294 for targets of Rs 314-Rs 323, keeping a stop loss below 280.Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.inL&T Finance Holdings | BUY | Target Price: Rs 185 | Stop loss: Rs 160This counter appears to have formed a nice base around Rs 163 levels in recent correction after testing its 200-Day Moving Averages. If a fresh leg of upswing is in progress from Rs 163 levels, then with a pickup of momentum in broader markets and fresh breakouts in this counter above Rs 170 levels, it shall ideally head towards Rs 185.Power Finance Corporation | BUY | Target Price: Rs 97 | Stop loss: Rs 81In Friday’s session, this counter made a dramatic turnaround by trapping the bears with a false break down below its range bound move of Rs 83–Rs 90 in which it was consolidating for a couple of weeks. This reversal of last session resulted in a Hammer formation on weekly candlestick charts which shall have a bullish connotations going forward. With this renewed strength this counter shall head to much higher levels going forward with fresh breakouts above Rs 90 levels.(Views and recommendations given in this article are the analysts’ own and do not represent those of ETMarkets.com.

Where are We? The market saw positive start to the May series with the Nifty gaining 0.7% to close at 10,692. The index had been facing resistance at 10,630 odd levels. Nifty has seen consolidation in a narrow range last week and it has given a breakout above 10,630 level with a rising gap and continued to show strength throughout Friday’s session.


What is in Store? The index has closed above the resistance with bullish candlestick for the day and continues to hit higher highs for the rally. Though some profit-booking was seen above 10,700 and closed below it. Here 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the whole fall from 11,171 to 9,951 levels is seen. Also, the falling gap area of 10,702-10,736 will act as resistance for the market. Thus, resistance can be expected in this region of 10,700-10,736 levels. Crossing above this level on a sustainable basis, the index can rally towards 10,850-10,910 levels.


What can Investors Do? In the Nifty, maximum open interest (OI) for put stands is 10,500, while for call, it is at 11,000. OI addition was seen strike price 10,500, 10,600 and 10,700 while in call options strikes of 11,000 and 10,900 witnessed OI additions, suggesting the range is shifting higher for the market. On the downside, market needs to hold above 10620 odd levels for the rally to continue. Breaking below this index can test levels of 10540-10500. India VIX currently at 12, has witnessed steady decline throughout the April month. Investors may buy Bata, Hindustan Zinc, Tata Global, Dabur and Bajaj Finserv.

The underlying trend of Nifty is positive, as per daily and weekly charts, and more upside up to the level of 10,750-10,800 could be expected over the next couple of weeks, according to technical analysts. India VIX has witnessed steady decline throughout April, which will bring stability in the market, they pointed out, recommending stocks like Bata, Hindustan Zinc, Tata Global, Dabur and Bajaj Finserv.


Where are We? Starting April, the market turned bullish again, because of record short positions built up by FIIs and retail investors. This has been behind the five-week rally that has continued post expiration. The one-month rally comes after a two-month crash in the Nifty that had most market participants concerned about the market trend. The rally has absorbed a lot of recent headwinds like rising rates and a weaker rupee.


What is in Store? The headwinds that have bothered the market have not clearly abated.

The INR is likely to remain under pressure and so are bond yields. Unless those trends change, the Nifty might find it hard to go very far. 10,720 is 61.8% of the two-month decline and a common retracement watched by technicians. A lot will depend on how these macro factors shape up. There is also a gap left behind during the markets decline at 10,709-10,736. Gap areas also act as resistance levels. Failure to go above these levels will result in the resumption of a bear market in stocks.


What can Investors Do? Banking has been the weakest sector and bounced the least with not even a 50% retracement of its losses. On the way down, banks and NBFCs should lose the most ground. The decline will most likely be broad based in general. Investors should generally create cash to re-enter at lower levels. If you want to play defensive, buy pharmaceutical stocks, such as Biocon, Wockhardt or Sun Pharma.

This is Prachi Sharma, your market jockey, with the morning briefing to get you up and running for a busy day on Dalal Street. 

The bogey on carry trade unwinding continues to haunt equity and currency markets and US bonds are simply not relenting.

Back home, the Karnataka saga is turning out to be a thriller of epic proportions, straight out of Bollywood. The latest twist was the Supreme Court’s refusal to stay swearing-in ceremony of the new chief minister. It's advantage BJP, for now.

As the political drama unfolds with nail-biting episodes, the market is really getting nervous -- very, very nervous. 

That's the trade setup this morning.

Nifty futures in Singapore were barely changed early this morning. That should add to the worry of Dalal Street.

Asian markets traded mixed, shrugging off a stronger close on Wall Street. US bond yield topped out at 3 per cent. And that's scary for investors. 

US stocks ended higher in overnight trade, riding on retail stocks and solid results from department store company Macy's. 

Meanwhile there is no letup in geopolitical tensions. But thankfully, oil prices seem to be getting steady


The dollar index, which tracks the currency movement against a basket of rivals, was little changed too. 

Just look at the rupee which is going nowhere. Thanks to RBI's rescue act, it rebounded and ended the day with a half a per cent gain.

In Q4 earnings, Voltas, ICRA, Central Bank, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are among a few names to report their numbers today. 

Now, some corporate news. The government is acting tough with PSU banks. It's looking to impose strict deadlines on banks for their turnaround plan. 

In a new twist to the ongoing Fortis Healthcare saga, the group’s former co-promoter Shivinder Singh, in a letter to the board, has raised objections to the way the bidding process has been run.

SoftBank is said to be exploring a possible investment in restaurant discovery and food delivery firm Zomato. The talks are at a very preliminary stage.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the liquidation process of Jaypee Infratech subject to Jaiprakash Associate (JAL), its parent, depositing Rs 1,000 crore with the court’s registry by June 15.

That’s it for today. Thank you for listening in. Do log on to www.etmarkets.com for round-the-clock market coverage, lots of investment tips and dozens of stock recommendations from top brokerages.

5,2018-05-17,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extended losses for the third consecutive session on Thursday owing to selling in select FMCG, telecom, bank, financial and auto stocks amid a surge in global crude oil prices and mixed global cues.

Market sentiment remained subdued on weakening macro situations as Brent Crude rose to $80 per barrel, fueling concerns over broadening fiscal deficit and rising inflation.

The Sensex index finished at 35,149, down 239 points or 0.67 per cent, with 10 stocks advancing and 20 declining. One stock remained unchanged in the index.

The Nifty50 settled 58 points, or 0.54 per cent down at 10,683, with 13 stocks in the green and 36 in the red. One stock remained unchanged in the Nifty pack also.

Bajaj Finance surged nearly 8 per cent, leading the pack of Nifty gainers.

It was followed by Bajaj Finserv which jumped 4.49 per cent.

Coal India and Sun Pharma climbed nearly 3 per cent in the Nifty index.

Bharti Infratel, Tata Motors, Wipro and ONGC rose pocketed gains of over 1 per cent.

Hindalco Industries, falling over 3 per cent, emerged as the top loser in the Nifty index. 

UPL, ITC, Axis Bank and HDFC suffered losses of over 2 per cent in the Nifty index."
6,2018-05-17,Bajaj Finserv,"The NSE benchmark Nifty on Thursday opened on a mildly positive note, but soon after this, it slipped into the red and spent the rest of the session in a narrow range. The index got weaker during the fag end and ended the day with a net loss of 58.40 points or 0.54 per cent.

The Thursday’s session saw the Nifty extending weakness, but it continued to trade comfortably above its critical supports.

As we approach Friday’s trade, expect some stability to come in the market. Even if there is a tepid and tentative start to the trade, 10,630-10,650 levels are likely to provide cushion to the market. Nifty at present rests at its short-term supports. Expect the levels of 10,745 and 10,785 to provide resistance to the index. Supports are expected to come in at 10,650 and 10,610 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 54.4640, and it has just reached its lowest value in the last 14-days, and this is bearish. Nifty also showed bearish divergence against the price. Daily MACD has shown a negative crossover, and it is now bearish while trading below its signal line. A big black candle emerged on the candles. However, in the present context it is likely to be less harmful, as it has not occurred immediately after an upmove.



The pattern analysis shows the steady retracement of Nifty after it attempted to breakout from the 10,500-10,600 levels, which represented the upper and the multiple resistance areas for the market.

NIFTY at present rests at the short term 20-DMA, and is likely to seek some support in the vicinity of this zone. Overall, the rising crude prices and ever-strengthening US 10-year bond yields are doing more damage to the market than the external political events.

With the political events behind us, the market in general is focussing more on legitimate technical setups than anything else.

The elevated levels of Nifty PCR too point towards some more consolidation.

That said, we will continue to see sector-specific outperformance. With no structural damage as of now, focusing on right stocks with sound setups will likely be rewarded in such a volatile market.

20,2018-05-19,Bajaj Finserv,"Manav Chopra, Head - Research, Indiabulls Ventures, sees selling pressure at 10700 on the upside. Chopra tells ET Now that on the lower side, a short-term correction could take the markets to 10400 or 10450 in next few weeks.


Edited excerpts:


 In terms of technical, where are the markets headed?

The markets have breached key support levels after a sustained retraced rally from the levels of 10100 towards 10800. After extending its move, the market had started to correct from its overbought zone. Usually such a move looks to be more or less corrective in nature. 

We expect a series of selling pressure at 10700 on the upside which was its previous support levels. On the lower side, we could see a short-term correction which could take the markets towards the levels of 10400 or 10450. That is the immediate target that we are looking at, for the next couple of weeks.


What is your view on Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv?

Bajaj Finance has seen a very good uptrend. After a good sideways consolidation in the stock, a breakout has been observed on a weekly and monthly basis. This was accompanied by good volume backed by good news event. 

Going forward, the momentum will be there in the stock, I recommend a buy-on-dips approach. There is an immediate support at 2100 on the intraday basis. One should definitely look to buy on any dip towards the support levels. Going forward on a medium-term perspective, the stock could rally towards 2180 and possibly even 2250. Overall. the oscillators and the trend is still bullish in this stock.


Any call on PNB? That is a stock which went down this week?

The stock has been a complete underperformer and with the kind of decline it has seen, I do not recommend initiating any fresh longs in this stock. It is in very deep oversold levels. There could be some sort of a bounce back or a dead-cat bounce, but I do not see the stock exceed Rs 85-86 levels.

Even though it is an important level, it has to be watched in a medium-term perspective. But given a choice, one should avoid getting longs as this PSU space settles down for the near term. So far, the PSBs and PNB in particular, have been observing a series of declines. We could see more pain and the oscillators on high time-frame charts are indicating some more downside. I sense that PNB could even touch the levels of 68 to 65 in the near term.


Do you think the pharma sector is coming to a bottom?

I do not think so. At the current levels, we have definitely observed a series of declines since past couple of months and in fact majority of the stocks have already witnessed a sharp decline from its all-time peaks. At the current levels, from a weekly and monthly perspective, there is no sense for any bottom formation. 

There are some short-term formations, which are hinting for a bounce but when we are looking at the long-term support lines or channels, they are yet to be reached. In such a phase, it is very difficult to call for a bottom. We could still see some pain at least in the near term. The momentum is still bearish and stocks like Lupin, Sun Pharma could see another decline of another 10% in probably next few weeks or months."
21,2018-05-21,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Going is getting tougher for Dalal Street by the day. Rising oil prices, a falling rupee, surging US bond yields and now more political uncertainty following the BJP’s setback in Karnataka, many say, would unite opposition forces, making it harder for Modi to return in 2019.

Headline equity indices Sensex and Nifty shed 2 per cent each during the week gone by, registering their biggest weekly fall in 10 weeks. On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex closed at 34,848, down 301 points or 0.86 per cent. The broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended below the 10,600 level at 10,596, down 86 points or 0.81 per cent.

The market will be volatile in the short term on the back of political uncertainty, higher oil prices and weak global markets, says Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan. “We continue to be positive on select counters such as financials and consumption with Bajaj Finance, Britannia, HUL and YES Bank being on our buy list,” he said.

Like Jani, many other analysts feel any dips in this market should be used for picking stocks.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock ideas that they say can potentially deliver gains over the next three weeks.

37,2018-05-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Mumbai: Bajaj Finance has managed to weather the storm on Dalal Street in the past few weeks as investors lapped up the stock on expectations the finance company’s strong earnings will help it standout in difficult market conditions. The stock has gained 9.2 per cent in the past month while the Nifty has lost nearly 1 per cent during the same period.

The nervous mood among investors is because of concerns over surging oil prices, weakening rupee and rising bond yields.

Analysts said the strength in the stock despite concern over rich valuations is because of the increasing demand for companies with steady earnings prospects amidst a challenging business environment.

“Their numbers are good. They will be affected by rising rates but the growth aspect is likely to overshadow that. That’s why the market is willing to pay a premium to it,” said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research at Macquarie.

Bajaj Finserv, which derives a significant value from Bajaj Finance, has also risen 7.4 per cent in the past month.



Shares of Bajaj Finance have outperformed the Nifty index not just in the last one month, but also from a one year, three-year and five-year perspective. In the last one year, shares of Bajaj Finance have gained 66 per cent compared to Nifty gaining 10.6 per cent in the same period. Bajaj Finance’s shares ended up 0.7 per cent at Rs 2,092.65 on Thursday while Bajaj Finserv ended up 0.6 per cent at Rs 5,833.60.

“These companies have delivered on the numbers consistently. Bajaj Finance has seen strong growth on loan book front and has operating leverage. The profit growth of 60 per cent was far above estimates. Its relative impact is being felt in Bajaj Finserv as it is parent company of Bajaj Finance,” said Kajal Gandhi, analyst at ICICI Securities.

The latest round of outperformance came on the back of strong growth in the March quarter. Earlier this month, Bajaj Finance reported a 61 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 721 crore for the March quarter while Bajaj Finserv reported a 36 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,113.83 crore for the March quarter.

Bajaj Finance’s profit grew to Rs 2,674.11 crore in the financial year ended March 2018 from Rs 719 crore in FY14.

Analysts say that the premium that Bajaj Finance commands over its peers is likely to be sustained going forward as well."

45,2018-05-26,Bajaj Finserv,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first four years in office have been anything but smooth, with the economy witnessing its own share of ups and downs. 

Benchmarks Sensex and Nifty breezed past 36,000 and 11,000, respectively, this January -- that's a first. And investors smiled. 

But macros worsened from time to time. Expectations were skyhigh when Modi came to power in May 2014. Things have just got a little harder since. 

To give the credit where it's due, planning and policy execution have been the talking points in a few cases. 

Which is to say, there are hits and misses. Let's map them. 


Sensex, Nifty and other major indices

Midcaps as well as smallcaps created huge wealth for investors on Dalal Street during the past four years. The BSE Midcap rallied 87 per cent whereas the smallcap index soared 92 per cent during the same period. Benchmark NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex advanced 44 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, during May 26, 2014, and May 25, 2018.





Top largecap multibaggers


As many as 15 largecap stocks from FMCG space, NBFCs and auto sector rallied more than 3-fold during the past four years. Bajaj Finance skyrocketed 964 per cent during the last four years, followed by Bajaj Finserv (581 per cent), Britannia Industries (570 per cent), Ashok Leyland (355 per cent) and TVS Motor (354 per cent).


Top small and midcap money multipliers


Small and midcap stocks rallied up to 9,577 per cent during these four years. Ducon Infratechnologies jumped to Rs 30 on May 25 this year, from Rs 0.31 on May 26 in 2014. Other stocks, including Uniply Industries, Medicamen Biotech, V2Retal, Minda Industries, KEI Industries, Avanti Feeds and Indiabulls Ventures, rallied up to 7,234 per cent during the same window.


Institutional investments
 

Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) overtook foreign portfolio investors (FPI) in terms of net investment in domestic equity markets over the past four years. DIIs pumped in Rs 2.11 lakh crore in equities since 2014 whereas FPIs invested Rs 1.86 lakh crore. This year, DII inflow is 45 times higher than FPI inflows. FPIs have poured Rs 1,027 crore in equities in 2018 so far whereas DIIs have invested Rs 46,649 crore.


Reforms
 
Jimeet Modi of Samco Securities sees implementation of goods and services tax (GST), IBC and recapitalisation plan for addressing the NPA issue, FDI in defence and railways, controlled inflation and improving business environment as hits for Modi. On the other hand, he believes demonetisation, slower GDP growth, lacklustre growth in jobs and lagging private investment as misses.


GDP
 
India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.3 per cent between fiscals 2015 and 2018, a tad lower than 7.5 per cent in the previous five years, according to a Crisil report. This is in spite of the two big domestic disruptors of demonetisation and GST which pulled down growth in fiscal 2018, and an environment of monetary and fiscal restraint. 

“While the economy had witnessed higher growth rates before the NDA government’s regime, it was on the back of unsustainable policy stimulus,” said Crisil.


Fiscal deficit
 
Barring the stress in fiscal 2018, when the fiscal deficit slipped to 3.5 per cent of GDP from the budgeted 3.2 per cent, the NDA regime has seen fiscal consolidation. According to Crisil, from an average 5.2 per cent of GDP between fiscals 2010 and 2014, the figure came down to 3.8 per cent between fiscals 2014 and 2018, helped by fortuitous winds from lower crude oil prices, which reduced the oil subsidy burden and hike in excise duties on petrol and diesel. In the absence of such hikes, the fiscal deficit between fiscals 2014 and 2018 would have been on an average 80 bps higher.


Current account deficit



India’s current account deficit (CAD) has almost halved in the past four years, compared with the previous five. While most of the decline in CAD can be attributed to good fortune, given a decline in oil and commodity prices, some policy measures such as curbs on gold imports also helped moderate the deficit, Crisil said. 

However, with oil prices trending up, CAD has started rising again from 2017-18. A rise in core imports (non-oil, non-gold imports) has also exerted upward pressure as domestic industry – hit by the twin disruptions of demonetisation and GST – could not cater to the demand.


Investments
 
Investments have remained weak in the past few years. The investment rate or share of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in GDP has come down from an average 33.6 per cent between fiscals 2010 and 2014 to 31 per cent between fiscals 2015 and 2018. The slowdown is largely attributed to lower household investments in housing and subdued private sector investment due to poor capacity utilisation and debt overhang.


Lower export growth




Export growth on average has tumbled to -0.2 per cent on-year in the past four years compared with 14 per cent in the preceding five. Both external and domestic -- mainly GST-led -- factors contributed to the slowdown."
46,2018-05-28,Bajaj Finserv,"Over the past 18 months, fund managers faced two structural disruptions — demonetisation and GST — which posed a challenge in selecting companies. Besides, while the micros improved, a few key macro indicators — crude oil and interest rates — showed signs of deterioration. A few largecap and midcap funds sailed through these challenges and delivered more than 15 per cent returns. Buying into financials, consumption, consumer discretionary and playing themes like unorganised to organised and spotting good investment ideas in IPOs helped these fund managers create alpha.


INVESCO INDIA GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FUND

Fund Manager: Amit Ganatra and Taher Badshah 

Assets Under Management: ₹484 crore 

Top Holdings: HDFC bank, Reliance and Indusind Bank

Return: 21.31 per cent
A mix of large- and mid-cap stocks, style neutral, with 75 per cent of its portfolio allocation to growth, and 25 per cent to value, helped the fund emerge a winner post demonetisation. Buying growth at a reasonable price and rarely buying a high price stock have helped the fund come up with stellar returns. Buying IT as a contra play with stocks like HCL Tech, Cyient and Infosys ahead of others along with participation in IPOs such as Mishra Dhatu, Shankara Building and Apex Frozen helped deliver higher returns.


AXIS EQUITY FUND

Fund Manager: Shreyash Devalkar 

Assets Under Management: ₹1,989 crore 

Top Holdings: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti

Return: 20.42 per cent
A stickler to quality and growth, the fund manager picks up companies with high ROE, superior quality cash flows and corporate governance. Post demonetisation, the fund manager was quick to spot money coming into the formal banking system and went overweight on banks and NBFCs, like HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance. This along with being overweight on consumption and automobiles, participation in IPOs like Avenue Supermarts and Endurance Technologies helped the fund deliver superior returns. The fund avoided value traps like PSU banks, pharmaceuticals and information technology, which helped it stay ahead of its peers.


ICICI PRUDENTIAL FOCUSED BLUECHIP EQUITY FUND

Fund managers: S Naren, Rajat Chandak 

Assets Under Management: ₹17,142 crore 

Top Holdings: ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Infosys

Return: 16.64 per cent
Post the demonetisation announcement, a key mantra which the scheme’s managers followed was sticking to the leader in a given sector. This strategy worked especially well when normalcy returned. The fund managers focused on buying companies in the consumption space, especially discretionary, such as Maruti, TVS Motor, Motherson Sumi and Bajaj Finserv. The fund managers already owned these in their portfolio. Post demonetisation, they enhanced exposure to these stocks. The fund also made profitable gains in IPOs such as Avenue Supermarts.


KOTAK SELECT FOCUS FUND
Fund Manager: Harsha Upadhyaya 
Assets Under Management:₹19,228 crore 
Top Holdings: HDFC Bank, L&T, RIL
Returns: 15.33 per cent
One of the key themes which helped the fund manager sail through demonetisation times is revival in the rural economy. Keeping this in mind, he bought in FMCG and auto companies. Besides rural recovery, he also focused on the consumer discretionary theme. Some of these companies which he bought in due to cheap valuations include Britannia, Godrej Consumer Products, Bata, Mahindra & Mahindra and Hero MotoCorp. To insulate the scheme’s portfolio from any downfall, the fund manager was prompt enough to stay away from stocks which have been facing adverse business situation.


RELIANCE LARGE CAP FUND

Fund manager: Sailesh Raj Bhan 

Assets Under Management: ₹9,833 crore 

Top Holdings: SBI, HDFC Bank, ITC

Returns: 16.37 per cent
After the announcement of demonetisation, a large number of quality companies were available 30-40% cheaper than what they were trading before. This fall in premium in valuation of quality companies attracted high interest from fund managers. The fund manager focused on companies which could generate aggressive growth largely because of their size and market share. These were Eicher Motors, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Larsen & Toubro. He stayed away from defensives and enhanced exposure to companies which captured the consumer discretionary theme quite well. These include Bajaj Finance and Chola Finance.

12,2018-06-08,Bajaj Finserv,"Smart investors, who spotted the trend early and shifted focus to largecaps in early 2018, have not only managed to protect their wealth in the recent carnage, but have made money too! Some have done it even in midcap and smallcap stocks, and how! 

Nifty Smallcap100 and Midcap100 indices are down up to 20 per cent this year, while the benchmark Nifty50 is still holding its head above water. 

A couple of largecaps drew investors’ attention this year, with IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surpassing the $100 billion market capitalisation in April, and stocks like HUL, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints scaling fresh all-time highs over the past one month. The Infosys stock is hovering around its highest level in two years. 

The theme is pretty clear: it’s a year for fundamentally strong businesses and those that have been trying to tap demand revival.

Most analysts are bullish on the largecaps despite the depression in the broader market in recent times. They are advising investors to add some stocks from this segment to protect their portfolios against volatility ahead of the general elections in 2019.

There are expectations that the largecaps may provide some cushion to investor portfolios as their valuations are lower compared with those of midcaps and smallcaps.

As many as 21 stocks from the Nifty pack were trading in the green so far this year, with Tech Mahindra up 37.50 per cent till June 6, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 31.58 per cent), Tata Consultancy Services (up 30.46 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 25.21 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 22.78 per cent), Infosys (up 19.73 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 18.23 per cent).

The 50-share index moved from 10,435 on January 1 this year to trade at 10,684 on June 6. 

Largecaps look attractive compared with midcaps and smallcaps at this point of time, Sankaran Naren, Executive Director, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, told ETNow in an interview.

Brokerage Sharekhan prefers HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS. HCL Tech has advanced over 3 per cent on a year-to-date basis. Managements of most IT companies have indicated that CY2018 would be better year compared with the previous one, thanks to some large deal wins, improving macro environment in key geographies, demand in certain industry pockets, emerging demand in digital, higher outsourcing demand from European clients and benefits of a weaker rupee.

Shares of HUL, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints and HDFC have gained between 10 per cent and 17 per cent in this period.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse has a ‘buy’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,750. Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target of Rs 2,251.

“Largecap valuations are far more reasonable than the second-rung stocks. Select largecap companies with rich valuations are also among the top picks right now when it comes to future growth visibility,” said Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director, Ladderup Wealth Management.

Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says the margin of safety is better in largecap names than in midcaps and smallcaps.

“There is certainty in terms of how the numbers will pan out,” he said.

More than 70 stocks from Nifty Midcap100 index gave negative returns to investors in 2018. Vakrangee, PC Jeweller, Adani Power and Suzlon Energy have plunged up to 93 per cent.

On the other hand, select midcap names like Mindtree, Indiabulls Ventures, Jubilant FoodWorks, Mphasis and Gruh Finance have risen up to 67 per cent in the same period. Gruh Finance hit an all-time high of Rs 381 on June 7.

There are takers for quality in any market. “I think it is time to buy into some of the quality companies in the midcap space, where the comfort level is on the higher side. Forget the index, this correction is a welcome opportunity for investors,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Smallcap stocks like Gitanjali Gems, Diamond Power, Bombay Rayon and Electrosteel Steels have slipped up to 91 per cent. 

There are specific pockets in the midcap and the smallcap segments, which are qualitative in nature, and earnings growth in this space can still be far better over the next two years, said Joshi of Angel Broking.

Coal India, YES Bank, L&T, Titan Company, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, ITC, Power Grid and Eicher Motors are other largecap stocks, which have been trading in the green so far in 2018.

On the other hand, shares of Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, HPCL, Vedanta, Bharti Infratel, BPCL, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Wipro are down up to 30 per cent between January 1 and June 6."
13,2018-06-11,Bajaj Finserv,"You could have been forgiven for not putting all your money on Brazil and Ronaldo in 2002. Much like the richly-valued stocks on offer now. The seemingly safe bet on Brazil had not paid off in 1998. But class always tells. Ronaldo shrugged off the meltdown in France to lead Brazil to a fifth World Cup in 2002. The market has been volatile of late, and the fear of losing money on equity bets is not misplaced. Yet select stocks, though expensive, have outperformed amid the turbulence on the Street.

Could ‘richly’ valued stocks act as effective insurance shields in a falling market? The answer is ‘yes’, provided the chosen company has sufficient revenue and profit visibility, and promises to offer superior margins than its peers.

That explains the limited downside for richly valued scrips such as Bajaj Finserv, Britannia Industries, Avenue Supermarts, Jubilant Foodworks, Colgate, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, and Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in a market where receding liquidity could easily call into question growth stories premised on less proven business models. This club of richly valued stocks has, therefore, outperformed the Sensex by 22 per cent since the January high.



For the record, Britannia, Avenue Supermarts, Jubilant Foodworks and HUL are trading at more 50 times their projected earnings of FY19, while Kotak Mahindra and HDFC Bank are trading at more than three and half times their book-value, levels significantly higher than the sector average. Returns on these stocks suggest that high P/E alone would not be the criterion for exiting them. Sustained high valuations for these scrips show that investors give due weight to sustainable earnings growth, brand moat, and a strong franchise.

Higher earnings predictability also dictates how mid and smallcap outliers are valued. In May, when small and midcap indices dropped nearly 10 per cent, Colgate-Palmolive, Varun Beverages, or Jyothy Lab gave returns of 10-16 per cent.

Earnings growth in these stocks has significant predictability, with most of these companies expected to report 20 per cent expansion in profits in the next two years. For instance, Avenue Supermarts’ earnings growth was driven by same-store growth (SSG) and new store additions. The operator of D’Mart stores has increased its outlet count to 155 at the end of FY18 from 55 in FY12, and the impact of store addition is visible in the earnings growth and revenue per square feet.

The revenue per square feet increased to Rs 33,000 in FY18 as against Rs 15,000 in FY12.

The palpable impact of new store additions and double-digit SSG reinforced investor confidence in D’Mart’s earnings growth. Analysts expect D’Mart will add 27 and 30 stores in FY19 and FY20, respectively. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, earnings growths for FY19 and FY20 are expected at 31 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. Avenue Supermarts is trading at 92 times of FY19 projected earnings.

Furthermore, these stocks also have what is called the ‘moat’ premium, meaning a dominant market share in an expanding pie. For instance, HUL has been consistently benefiting from selling more premium products. Similarly, new launches and premiumisation are driving earnings growth at Britannia, which is focused on expanding its bailiwick beyond just cookies to a wide range of food items."

At present, Indian companies can list their shares through depository receipts abroad, while foreign companies need to go through the Indian Depository Receipt route for listing of equities.

15,2018-06-14,Bajaj Finserv,"The bull run, which began in September 2013, has produced many winners on Dalal Street.

35,2018-06-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Global trade wars between top economies, surging oil prices, high interest rates, and an uncertain domestic political environment in the run-up to the general elections next year have made the stock markets choppy and volatile. Hence, wealth managers believe investors should look at multi-cap schemes which invest across market capitalisations. Currently, most multicap schemes are tilted towards large caps with reasonably good exposure to highgrowth investment ideas in the midcap space. ET takes a look at five multicap schemes, which have performed better than their respective benchmark indices by a fair margin and have been able to sustain their performance.


Motilal Oswal Multicap 35 Fund
Top 3 holdings: HDFC, HDFC Bank, Maruti 
Assets under management: ₹13,181 crore 
3 year return: 14.52 per cent 
Fund Manager: Gautam Sinha Roy 
Top 10 holdings: 56.03 per cent

The fund manager has built a concentrated portfolio and looks for long-term secular growth stories. He is overweight on financials with NBFCs, housing finance, insurance and private banks accounting for about 45% of the portfolio. As the global environment improved, he added TCS and Infosys to the portfolio. The fund manager has stayed away from telecom, pharma and PSU banks, which helped the fund deliver superior returns. Stocks such as Bajaj Finance, HDFC Standard Life and Eicher Motors have worked well for the scheme.


Axis Focused 25
Top 3 holdings: Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, TCS
Asset under management: ₹4,217 crore
3 year return: 15.44 per cent
Fund Manager: Jinesh Gopani
Top 10 holdings: 55.5 per cent

The fund manager implemented three basic ideas: one, he focused on secular growth stories, which took him to companies with high credit ratings. These companies have been naturally blue chip, which, to a large extent, ensured high growth given their leadership position in their sectors. Two, he generated alpha by focussing on Initial Public Offerings and some listed companies which have a unique positioning in a given sector in comparison with their peers. Lastly, he focused on cyclical themes, and companies that embarked on capex. A few prominent companies which have helped lift the scheme’s performance are Bajaj Finance, Endurance Technologies, Bandhan Bank, Gruh Finance and Kotak Mahindra Bank.


Aditya Birla Sun Life Equity 
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, ITC
Assets under management: ₹9,376 crore
3 year return: 13.92 per cent
Fund Manager: Anil Shah
Top 10 holdings: 35.7 per cent

One of the key variables the scheme’s fund manager has kept in mind while selecting companies in the portfolio is free cash flow. Besides, having a large-cap bias which ensure high-growth sectors. Shah has been prompt enough in buying companies which have shown noticeable improvement in cash flows either through selling non-core assets or reducing debt. This has largely worked for the scheme. Also, the fund has preferred companies which have high earnings visibility, rather than being particularly concerned about their valuations. These factors have helped the fund in creating a diversified portfolio which would largely cover high-growth stories. A few prominent companies that have spruced up the scheme’s returns are Tech Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Tata Steel.


Tata Equity PE Fund
Top 3 holdings: HDFC, Yes Bank, Reliance Industries
Asset under management: ₹3,924 crore
3 year return: 16.3 per cent
Fund Manager: Sonam Udasi
Top 10 holdings: 49.9 per cent

Following the scheme mandate, the fund manager has selected 70% of stocks whose trailing price-to-earnings (PE) multiple is lower than the Sensex’s PE multiple. The remaining 30% of the portfolio can have companies whose PE multiples may be higher than that of the Sensex. The fund manager’s focus on companies with encouraging return ratios, quality management and high visibility of earnings has paid off well in the past three eyars. Winning ideas in financials, such as Yes Bank, City Union Bank and Bajaj Finserv have helped it post a stellar performance.


Invesco India Contra Fund
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, HDFC, Reliance Industries
Assets under management: ₹1,689 crore
3 year return: 14.90 per cent
Fund Manager: Amit Ganatra, Taher Badshah
Top 10 holdings: 46 per cent

Companies that trade below intrinsic value, are in a turnaround phase or have been de-rated due to a temporary change in sentiment are the stocks the fund manager looks out for. These strategies play out over a three-year period. The fund is fairly concentrated, even though it has a long tail, with the top 10 stocks accounting for 40-45% of the portfolio. Early entry into the IT space with exposure to stocks like Infosys, Cyient and HCL Tech has worked well for the fund. IPO bets like Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Apex Frozen gave handsome returns to the portfolio over the past year. The fund was one of the early entrants into the IT space. Higher allocations in IPOs of Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Apex Frozen Foods helped it earn extra returns."
36,2018-06-25,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Investors woke up to cautious trade in stock markets on Monday amid weak global cues owing to trade war worries.

Last week, the S&P BSE Sensex advanced 67 points, or 0.18 per cent, to end at 35,689 while the 50-share Nifty pack gained 4 points, or 0.03 per cent, to settle at 10,821.

Analysts say global clues will continue to dominate proceedings on Dalal Street in the absence of any major domestic trigger. Also, there will be volatility as traders roll over positions ahead of June series F&O expiry on Thursday.

On the technical charts, Nifty is getting support from the 10-day EMA placed at 10,686 on the weekly chart, posting a sharp recovery from this level a couple of time.

“Nifty managed to form a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart, indicating a positive bias going into the June expiry,” says Gaurav Jain, Director Hem Securities.

While the market outlook may be mixed, top brokerages still see opportunity to make money on select stocks. Based on their recommendations, here are 15 stock strategies that can potentially deliver gains over the next three weeks.

Swati A Hotkar, Senior Equity Technical Analyst - Research, Nirmal Bang Securities


Sun Pharma | BUY | Target Price: Rs 605 | Stop loss: 545
Sun Pharma has broken out above important resistance of Rs 525, indicating a positive bias. The stock has witnessed positive divergence on weekly chart and increase of volumes on breakout, which can lead the stock upwards towards Rs 605- 630 levels in a week or two. One can buy the stock at current levels and on dips with a closing stop loss of Rs 545 and target of Rs 605


Godfrey Phillips India | BUY | Target Price: Rs 810 | Stop loss: Rs 740

The weekly chart of this stock shows the RSI has a positive divergence indicating a bullish view. Also, the fact that stock is trading in oversold zone and showing a positive crossover by RSI. After a big fall, we may witness a pullback rally towards Rs 810- 820 levels.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


Can Fin Homes | BUY | Target Price: Rs 390 | Stop loss: Rs 330

Since the past couple of weeks, price action with somewhat horizontal moves on weekly charts is suggesting that this counter is making an attempt to bottom out around Rs 340 levels. Friday’s swift recovery from lower levels is suggesting that this counter may be in for a pullback move. Hence, positional traders are advised to buy into this counter with a stop of Rs 330 for a target of Rs 390.


Gateway Distriparks | BUY | Target Price: Rs 216 | Stop loss: Rs 170

Recent price behaviour in this counter after witnessing a price and volume breakout a couple of weeks back is looking very promising and pointing towards the possibility of a sustainable pullback move in the near term. Hence, positional traders in anticipation of such a move should go long for a target of Rs 216 with a stop placed below Rs 170 on closing basis.

Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher


Larsen & Toubro | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,390 | Stop loss: Rs 1,260

This stock has witnessed a decent correction recently from the peak of Rs 1,396 and has now shown indications of bottoming out at around Rs 1,285 levels which is also where the significant 200-DMA moving average lies. The RSI has hit the highly oversold zone and has indicated a reversal to maintain a positive bias and has the potential to rise further in the coming days.

India Cements | BUY | Target Price: Rs 124 | Stop loss: Rs 106

This stock has eroded much of its gains in the past 4-5 months from the peak of Rs 205 levels and has shown signs of bottoming out at around Rs 105 levels where a good support is maintained on the daily chart.

21,2018-07-09,Bajaj Finserv,"The equity market had a buoyant start to the week, as NSE benchmark Nifty ended the day with a gain of 80.25 points or 0.74 per cent. Monday’s session remained technically important, as the Nifty officially reversed the negative breakdown that it suffered a couple of days back from a large symmetrical triangle formation. 

Further to this, with the Monday’s upmove, the index has further attempted to move past the falling trend line pattern resistance.

As we approach Tuesday’s session, there is a high probability that Nifty will see an upward breakout from the pattern resistance. A modestly positive start to the session is expected, and even if market consolidates at higher levels, it will do so with a positive bias.

The levels of 10,875 and 10,930 will play out as immediate resistance levels for Tuesday. Supports may come in at 10,810 and 10,760 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 58.5325. It does not show any divergence against the price, but it has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish.



Daily MACD has also shown a positive crossover. It is now bullish, as it trades above its signal line.

If we look at the pattern analysis, it suggests that the Nifty has finally attempted to move past the falling trend line pattern resistance. This falling trend line started from the high of 11,170 and joined the subsequent lower tops. If the market manages to hold itself up above the 10,850 mark, we will see higher chances of this culminating into a breakout with the Nifty inching higher.

Overall, Monday’s upmove was much in line with what was expected. Some technical indicators remain slightly overstretched, which might make the market consolidate at higher levels. Still, the underlying current remains bullish.

The Bollinger bands remain nearly 48 per cent narrower-than-normal. This further increases the chances of volatility increasing with sharp moves in prices over the coming days.

Even if Nifty consolidates at the higher levels, we would strongly recommend refraining from creating shorts as long as the Nifty stays above the 10,800 mark.

Continue to make select purchases with each consolidation. Overall, a positive outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen being built in stocks like Asian Paints, YES Bank, Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, Reliance, Tech Mahindra, Sun Pharma, Larsen & Toubro, Bajaj Finserv and Kotak Bank.

22,2018-07-10,Bajaj Finserv,"In a technically significant session on Tuesday, the NSE benchmark Nifty ended the day with yet another decent gain of 94.35 points or 0.87 per cent. The Nifty has shown a breakout from a large symmetrical triangle formation and has officially failed the downward breach that it had suffered a couple of days back.

From the present structure of the charts, though there may be a likelihood of some minor consolidation at higher levels, Nifty has set a stage to move towards its lifetime highs again.

We expect a positive start on Wednesday, and are likely to see the Nifty extending its upmove with some possibilities of minor consolidation happening at the higher levels.

Wednesday is likely to see the levels of 10,985 and 11,150 acting as resistance area for the Nifty. Supports may come in at 10,850 and 10,800 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 63.32, and it has marked its fresh 14-period high, which is bullish. The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. On the candles, a Rising Window occurred. It is essentially a gap and usually transforms into continuation of the upmove.

The pattern analysis confirms that the Nifty has broken on the upside of a symmetrical triangle formation and has broken out above the resistance of the falling trend line and has created a stage an upmove ahead.

Overall, the Nifty has closed above the upper Bollinger band and this signals continuation of the present rally. Though some pullback inside the band and some minor consolidation is likely, the overall stage is set for the Nifty is to move near its lifetime high once again.

We continue to recommend using each consolidation that the market to make fresh purchases. Overall, a positive outlook is advised for the day.

Another feel good is a report that India has become the world’s sixth largest economy overtaking France. The 30-share index hit its previous record high of 36,444 on January 29 this year.

The NSE Nifty too reclaimed 11,000-mark for the first time since February 1.

On the further movement of markets, Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking, said, “Key domestic macro events like May IIP, June CPI inflation data and corporate earnings season will provide further direction to the markets in the near term. Stock or sector specific volatility will remain high. The progress of monsoon, movement of crude oil prices and global developments will continue to be monitored by the market participants. The rising trade tensions between the US and China could induce high volatility across the indices globally. Traders should avoid risky leveraged positions.”

Foreign institutional investors have offloaded shares worth Rs 5,470 crore on a year-to-date basis till July 11 while domestic institutional investors poured more than Rs 64,000 crore.

On the oil dip, Vandana Hari, a market analyst and founder of Vanda Insights, told ETNow, “There was almost a simultaneous plunge in a lot of metals as well as crude yesterday. The biggest bearish factor right now for the crude market is economic headwinds. The trade battle between China and the US, the world’s two largest economies, is set to get far worse before it gets better. That was the biggest factor that knocked crude off its perch yesterday.”

“I would differentiate crude from the other industrial commodities. There are opposing pulls on crude right now. There is a question mark on what happens to global oil demand growth if the Chinese and US trade sparring continues which is a little bit of concern but is very hard for oil markets to quantify. The opposing pulls, the bullish forces on crude, on the other hand are very much intact and Iran is the biggest of them,” she added.

She further said one probably can expect some impact on oil demand growth as a result of the trade wars but on the other hand, there is clear and present danger to Iranian crude exports. 

“I do believe that despite the overnight slump, crude will remain supported and probably will start picking up again from this point, but it is going to be several months in my view before we can actually see any tangible impact on demand growth. In the absence of that tangible figure, the bullish factors are going to assert themselves much more,” added Vandana."

Godrej Consumer Products, HDFC, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mphasis and Sanofi India too joined the pack of stocks that touched 52-week highs on NSE.

Frontline equity indices Sensex and Nifty extended losses to the second consecutive session on Monday owing to losses in metal, pharma, auto, bank and energy stocks, while weak macroeconomic indicators and mixed global cues kept investors' mood subdued. 

Sensex registered a muted start in the light of tepid Asian cues after an official data showed that China's economy slowed a little in the second quarter. 

Moreover, a set of weak macroeconomic numbers eroded market optimism.

Market's risk appetite was dealt a blow after India's trade deficit widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee. 

The market mood got further hit as a government data released today showed that the inflation based on wholesale prices shot up to 5.77 per cent in June on increasing prices of vegetables and fuel items.

Earlier, a government data last week had revealed that the retail inflation jumped to a 5-month high of 5 per cent in the month of June on rising fuel prices.

Surging inflation may push India's central bank to hike key rates in its next policy meet in August.

The BSE Sensex tanked 218 points, or 0.60 per cent, to settle at 36,324, with 10 stocks advancing, 20 declining and one unchanged.

54,2018-07-20,Bajaj Finserv,"In general insurance business, we have grown 23% on gross premium and in life insurance, our gross premium has grown by 18%, S Sreenivasan, CFO, Bajaj Finserv, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

Could you walk us through the big picture for Bajaj Finserv and for the insurance industry? What kind of growth do you see in the life insurance sector now?
This quarter has been quite favourable for our general insurance business. We have grown about 23% on gross premium. We have seen reasonable growth in terms of life insurance. Our gross premium has grown by 18%. Overall, this quarter has been muted, especially for life insurance, because most of the life insurance business happens in the last second half, particularly in the last quarter because that is the tax season. Bajaj Finance growth has been strong. We see considerable demand for consumer loans; we have grown strongly in SMEs, in commercial lending and particularly in our rural lending portfolio.


I want to start by talking about general insurance profits. That has been strongly aided by premium growth and improvement in combined ratios. What led tothat growth and are these numbers sustainable?
Premium growth would depend on the external factors, particularly sales of motor cars. We are seeing good traction on our health business both on the retail side, on the corporate side and even on the government health schemes. There is slight muted growth in corporate lines like property, engineering and other businesses which companies write. 

But generally, on the retail side, we are seeing strong growth. Bajaj Allianz has always been more retail focussed. We are very strong in motor and health insurance and that has aided us. Whether that will be sustainable over the next three quarters or not, one has to wait and see. This is also a business of selection and that is why our combined ratio is one of the best in the industry, probably the best. 

Last year, we recorded the highest profits among all private insurers, this year again the combined ratio has improved. Our expectation is that we should be probably the most profitable general insurer this year as well. Our company works with a lot of discipline in terms of underwriting. There are some businesses that you may have to forgo on the top line side in order to maintain the profitability and we have a very strong and stable management team which is really focussed on executing the business with discipline.
This year of course, we have seen lower claim ratios in the first quarter.


What could be the market share growth that you are aiming for general insurance in particular? Which are the segments that a year from now could really aid that bump-up?
We see more growth coming over the next two to three years. I cannot really comment on what will happen now. On the liabilities side of corporates, things like cyber-crime are picking up, directors and officers are picking up. But they are still a small proportion of the market. 

On the personal lines, we see strong growth continuing in health insurance. Asset insurances like car and property insurance would follow the asset creation in the economy and usually there is a lag. Once capital formation and car sales pick up after a lag, you would see that they translate into growth for the general insurance industry. Even when GFP growth was quite low, general insurance growth rate was about 10%. In good times, they grow at about 18-20% because the market is seriously underpenetrated, particularly on areas like health, on liability, on various segments of the general insurance business.


For a long time, we debated whether one should follow an agency-based model or focus on the direct model involving online and direct acquisition of customers. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Which way are you likely to focus because that will decide the way your cost and margins would be mapped in three to five years?
Globally, agency is always a very strong component of distribution of any insurance company -- be it life or general. There are products which require explanation. In case of life insurance, the agent is actually a sort of investment consultant as well to the extent that they need to explain the investment linked products. 

In the case of general insurance, if people are buying health insurance, if they are ensuring anything other than simple things like motor cars, they need advice. So, agency will definitely continue to be the mainstay of the business. Direct channels are emerging in India. The type of products that people sell direct are mostly standardised, commoditised type of products like term life and car insurance. 

As of now, the traction is not very significant. But as we go forward, direct as proportion should grow. In the long run, there will be three channels which will dominate distribution of all insurance companies. One would be agency, second is distribution through corporate agents like banks -- what is called bank assurance and the third is emerging direct sales. 

Direct sales can either be online or offline through the sales force. In terms of cost, it is a weighted average cost and how the mix pans out. Ultimately, the customer will decide which channel they want to come to and both our companies are multi-channel companies. We offer all the channels of convenience for customers to come in and choose which channel they want to come to.


Let us understand the dynamics of the life insurance sector now. One is term, second is ULIP. Where do you see growth coming from ?Also, are you likely to grow because of the sectoral growth or are you likely to grow because of market share gain?
Beyond term and ULIP, there is a bigger segment of the market. It is what is called traditional savings products which consists of participating and non-participating. They are mostly guaranteed products. United linked are open ended products which also give direct equity exposure so to some extent they are comparable with mutual funds and the third is term insurance which is either done through the group mode or retail direct individual sales to customers. 

As we go forward, retail individual sales is a very small portion of the market. Both the online and offline put together will not be more than 5% of the market. The group term life is also a profitable segment and that is growing and they are largely done through banks. They are sold to protect the banks interest when they lend to customers, if something happens to the customer, the loan gets repaid. Those are big segments of the market. 

We do a lot of group insurance also through microfinance and regional rural banks where we are the largest player in the private sector for a number of years now. Between ULIP and traditional, it is function of the markets. We have seen in the past that when equity markets underperform or have a negative performance which is fairly long, then you tend to see that people want guarantees. If the risk environment deteriorates, we find that people tend to go for traditional products. 

As a company, we are looking at a sustainable product mix. This quarter our ULIP exposure is reduced from 78% to 61%. We have increased our traditional product mix. The balancing would depend largely on the external factor and again on the customers segment you are targeting traditional products typically have a lower ticket size so the premium growth may not seem large but they are from a margin and profit perspective they can be quite profitable. 

If you are in tier 3, tier 4 towns where we are fairly strong. There you tend to have a greater mix of traditional business. ULIP is like ice-cream, there is flavour of the month for a few years. When equity markets are doing well, everybody wants an ULIP; market comes down, people want guarantees. 

Our life insurance company did not perform well between 2012 and 2015 because of product regulations and various other factors but last three years we have been growing very strongly on the individual side. We would be depending on: a) market growth, b) return of financial savings into life insurance and c), our own increase in market share."

49,2018-07-20,Bajaj Finserv,"IT is top sectoral preference followed by select pharma with select private sector banking in the third place, Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Both Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have been performing stocks. We pay a lot of attention discussing Bajaj Finance but do you think Bajaj Finserv also deserves an equal attention because Bajaj Finserv is the holding company of Bajaj Finance and the insurance business of late has done rather well?
Both of them have been enormous wealth creators. In the top end of the market, high quality names and high pedigree managements are getting high valuations and Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are good examples of that. The market cap of both the companies put together has surpassed many frontline banks as well. That shows the kind of wealth that the companies have created in the last 10 years. 

Since Bajaj Finance is an operational company it gets more attention. Bajaj Finserv as a holding company understandably will always get second priority and be at a discount. But between these two, there is probably some valuation at Bajaj Finserv but I am sure the market will be keeping Bajaj Finance as the top priority.


Between HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank, which one would you like to buy?
Both are high quality banks with proven track records. HDFC Bank is the market’s favourite. In terms of valuation, both are fully priced and priced to perfection. And that may be a little bit of concern even. HDFC Bank will be rock solid and if you have to choose between the two, probably HDFC Bank will score at this moment.


Is this decline a time to buy or would you say the heydays for metals are over?
The January sentiment is not there anymore and will take time to come back. At this moment, we maintain a neutral view on the metal space. In terms of capital allocation, one has to be very selective and preferably be with the largecaps and large midcaps. If you are even slightly off in terms of the stock selection, markets have become quite unforgiving.

In terms of sectoral preferences, IT understandably will score top and select pharma will come second and the third will be select private sector banking. 

Metals do not feature in the top three in terms of at least capital allocation at this moment. Their time will come but not now. Of course, there’s Hindalco and some deal specific things may make news. Stocks remain under pressure with the fear that any extra bit of debt will come in on to their books. Even in terms of Tata Steel, understandably the Bhushan Steel deal has created some hiccups and additional debt."

56,2018-07-20,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Market got back its winning touch as headline indices took the no-trust motion in their stride and rose on Friday, backed by gains in heavyweights such as RIL, Infosys and ICICI Bank.

Stocks had been in decline for the past two days. Asian shares turned positive today.

The Sensex made a cautious opening on Friday as there appeared no end to the rupee's pain against the dollar. The local currency had crashed to a life low of 69.05 on Thursday, triggered by an emerging market currency sell-off. 

The no-trust motion against the Narendra Modi government came as a major overhang on market.

As it turned out, the market rode on a fresh spell of buying in IT stocks, which made merry because of the rupee depreciation. Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services all climbed up to 3 per cent. 

The Sensex added 145 points, or 0.40 per cent, settling at 36,496. As many as 19 stocks had a positive close and 12 lost.

The NSE counterpart Nifty climbed 53 points, or 0.48 per cent, to settle the day at 11,010. A total of 29 stocks advanced and 21 declined.

For the week though, the Sensex slipped 0.12 per cent and the Nifty 0.08 per cent. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices added 0.73 per cent and 0.41 per cent, respectively.

Sun Pharma, Infosys and Reliance Industries led the pack of Sensex gainers. Bajaj Auto, Vedanta and Hero MotoCorp gave a poor account of themselves.

Two-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto tanked 8.73 per cent as the company on Friday reported a 20.71 per cent rise in standalone net profit for the quarter to June, missing Street estimate. 

Financial services companies Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv shot up to record highs on Friday, driven by their solid June quarter numbers. Bajaj Finserv settled 5.70 per cent up while Bajaj Finance zoomed 8.10 per cent.

BSE Oil and Gas, Metal, Auto, Consumer Discretionary Goods & Services and Basic Materials had a hard landing. The rest of the sectoral indices landed in the green zone.

Global stocks were mostly in the green. Shanghai Composite moved up over 2 per cent. Hang Seng climbed 0.76 per cent, but Nikkei eased 0.29 per cent."
58,2018-07-21,Bajaj Finserv,"Clearly, the heat on stocks is on. The trade contagion is spreading like wild fire. US President Donald Trump is turning up the rhetoric with his latest tariff threat on Chinese imports.

The domino effect is there to see. Domestic equities logged their first weekly loss in three weeks. Domestic macros are sending bearish signals. The rupee is taking a tumble though Friday was a little respite that offered cold comfort. FIIs are pulling out in hordes.

The Sensex slipped 0.12 per cent to 36,494 for the week ended July 20. The index reading was at 36,542 on July 13. Similarly, the NSE Nifty dipped 0.08 per cent to 11,010 from 11,019 during the same period. 

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week.


Stocks that rallied up to 24%As many as five stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Adani Power (up 24.18 per cent), 3M India (16.72 per cent), Bajaj Finance (10.61 per cent), Sterlite Technologies (10.06 per cent) and Indraprastha Gas (10.06 per cent).


30 scrips that crackedMore than 5 per cent of stocks on the BSE500 plunged in double digits during the past five trading sessions. PC Jeweller melted 32 per cent, followed by Dilip Buildcon (20 per cent), Ashok Leyland (19 per cent), Kwality (17 per cent) and Inox Leisure (17 per cent). Vakrangee, ITI, HFCL, V-Mart, HCC, Jindal Stainless, Magma Fincorp, Dr Reddy’s Labs, JSPL, Manpasand and Jain Irrigation are among other firms that went down over 10 per cent during the week.


IPO updateThe initial public offering (IPO) by women's apparel maker TCNS Clothing, which hit the capital markets on July 18, got oversubscribed 5.27 times on the last day of bidding on Friday. The Rs 1,125-crore public offer received bids for 5,79,79,780 shares against the total issue size of 1,09,99,828, data available with the NSE showed. The category reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) was subscribed by over 13 times. Now, IPO of HDFC AMC will be open for subscription on July-27.


Brokerages back Kotak Bank, post Q1Top global brokerages remained upbeat on Kotak Mahindra Bank, post its June quarter financial results. The private lender on Thursday posted 12.29 per cent jump in standalone net profit at Rs 1,024.94 crore for April-June. The figure was Rs 912.73 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. 

Brokerage CLSA maintained ‘Outperform’ on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 1,500 while Citi increased target price to Rs 1,565, from Rs 1,430. Shares of the private lender, however, closed at Rs 1,333.50 on Friday, down 5.08 per cent against Rs 1,404.90 on July 13.


Running out of steam?Bajaj Auto came off more than 8 per cent on Friday after the company reported lower than expected results for Q1 FY19. The two-wheeler maker reported a 20.71 per cent rise in standalone net profit for the quarter to June. 

The Q1 profit figure stood at Rs 1,115.23 crore against Rs 923.93 crore in the same quarter last year. ETNow poll had predicted a net profit of Rs 1,249 crore for Bajaj Auto in April-June.


New axle load norms hit CVsFor the week ended July 20, shares of commercial vehicle makers, led by Ashok Leyland, slumped up to 19 per cent after the government brought in new axle norms for load carrying capacity that experts said could hurt demand. Escorts plunged nearly 7 per cent while Tata Motors declined 4 per cent. 

The load carrying capacities of heavy vehicles, including trucks, have been increased by 20-25 per cent at par with global standards, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said on July 17. 

""We believe the Street is overly concerned about the new load-per-axle norms. Demand in the near term is thus likely to be subdued due to confusion around the applicability and implementation of norms,"" Edelweiss Research said in a report.


Stocks @fresh all-time highAs many as 22 stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs during the week. The list included some of the blue-chip stocks such as Reliance Industries, Infosys, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Britannia, Nestle, HEG, Bajaj Finserv, Jubilant Foodworks and Asian Paints also scaled new life peaks.

Sectoral updateSector-wise, the BSE Oil and Gas as well as IT indices rallied more than 1 per cent during the week. However, the BSE Metal, Realty, Healthcare, Auto and Capital Goods indices weakened up to 5.94 per cent.


On a rollTyre firm Ceat rallied over 7 per cent on Friday after the company reported a multi-fold increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 71.44 crore for the June quarter. This compares with Rs 1.37 crore in the year-ago period. The tyremaker rode on robust demand from commercial vehicle makers."
59,2018-07-21,Bajaj Finserv,"Speaking to ET Now, Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research, IIFL, says it would be interesting to see how private sector banks report their numbers.

Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Some solid earnings coming in from Bajaj Finserv as well as Bajaj Finance, do you sense that this flight to quality has been backed by a solid growth?


Abhimanyu Sofat: Yes, absolutely. I think, you can see the divergence in terms of stock performance of Bajaj Finance relative to Kotak Mahindra. We have seen in the case of Kotak that despite a decent loan growth of around 22 per cent, because the deposit growth was just 16 per cent, we saw an impact in margins. In the case of Bajaj Finance, with a new Indian accounting standard, you are likely to see a significant uptick despite the 5 per cent reduction in net worth, which happened in last year's numbers because of this change in accounting. 

Going forward, I think, with a lower cost of funds for the company as well as benefits, because of transferring of business to the housing finance subsidiary, I think going forward numbers are likely to be robust for Bajaj Finance. Similarly, if you look at other sectors as well, like in the case of IT, one is clearly seeing the numbers and guidance are good. Market is likely to give a premium over other stocks.


ET Now: What caused this disappointment for Bajaj Auto and should this decline be bought?


Abhimanyu Sofat: Honestly, before the result we were a bit bearish on Bajaj Auto and the reason for that was that in the month of March they had reduced the pricing of CT 100 bike by close to around Rs 2,000 per bike. 

Now, the margins are hardly there in this bike, because it is a lower end bike and because of Bajaj's policy of gaining market share, we saw a 50 per cent bump up in the sales of this bike. The estimates with what market was working with, around 19.5 per cent, were clearly higher than what we felt was likely to happen. So, I am not at all in the camp which feels that numbers are lesser than expectation. From my standpoint, this is the real margins which Bajaj should be hitting now going forward, considering its focus on gaining market share rather than protecting its margins.


ET Now: HDFC Bank, steady as always, no surprises, always the compounder and the best story amongst private banks?


Abhimanyu Sofat: Yes, sure. HDFC is one stock which is quite consistent relative to others. I think that would be the expectation going forward as well. So, let us see if there are certain challenges like what Kotak faced in the numbers, but my guess would be that HDFC should be quite consistent.


ET Now: What is it that you are going to watch out for, YES Bank, L&T, ITC, Hero MotorCorp, Maruti, it is a long list of numbers there?


Abhimanyu Sofat: If you look at this list for the next week, YES Bank is clearly one of the stocks that one needs to watch out for. The earnings growth momentum is strong and though there have been some quarters where there has been some disappointment in terms of provisioning and all, considering the growth traction and with the PSU banks giving more space to the private sector banks, I think this is one stock where one can clearly look at delivering a good set of numbers. 

In case of Maruti, I think the numbers are likely to be decent. They are going to benefit a bit in terms of a lower base relative to last year, and because of premiumisation, numbers are likely to be better. Though there could be slight impact on the margins as we are seeing it happening in Bajaj. 

Regarding Hero, I think it is a better pick for us relative to Bajaj Auto. I think after Friday's crash in the price of Bajaj Auto, the valuations are somewhere close to around 16x for both. Earlier Bajaj was trading at a premium. Since the rural economy continues to do well, in this kind of election environment, we clearly believe that Hero could be one stock which provides a decent risk reward at current market levels.


ET Now: One key trend that you would look out for the next week?


Abhimanyu Sofat: The interesting thing going forward would be how these remaining private sector banks report their numbers as I think there is a pressure because of the bond yield going up. However, we are seeing a lot of market opportunity happening in terms of tightness in growth, thus leading to market share gains for the private sector banks. 

So, if we continue to see an improvement in those numbers, it is likely that the next leg of move from the index could happen from these. In addition to what HDFC and all are doing, especially these mid-tier banks, we would be keenly watching even ICICI Bank, because we believe that a large part of the problem that are there are likely to get sorted over the next couple of quarters."

60,2018-07-23,Bajaj Finserv,"It is better to be with a leader like Infosys which on a valuation perspective is quite cheap compared to TCS, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP- Research, IIFL, 
  
  tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 



What do you make of UPL buying Arysta Lifescience for $4.2 billion. What does it mean for their market share globally, as also what it means for the stock which has underperformed over the last three months?
The deal is more or less as per expectations and the synergy benefit with the management I have been talking about is completely possible. There could be some initial hiccups. From a valuation perspective, the stock has corrected from a high of around Rs 900 to around Rs 550 odd. If there is any weakness in the stock because of this particular deal, one should look to accumulate it in terms of geographical strength as well as the crop mix. This particular deal is pretty interesting for UPL and equity element added at the international subsidiary level where a dilution will take place. Overall, it appears to be a decent deal for UPL and will help it gain a significant market share. The market share of UPL is going to be close to around 9% globally which is quite a decent number.


In Friday’s session, there was traction in Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv. What would be a good strategy to approach the business -- buy a Bajaj Finance or a Bajaj Finserv or take exposure to all of the entities within the Bajaj Group by buying into Bajaj Holdings?
It is better to buy the company directly rather than routing your investment through Bajaj Holdings because typically when there is a bull market, the discount to the value of investment comes down to close to around 45% to 50% and in a bear market scenario that discount goes up to around 60-65%. 

If you want to be in the financial space, Bajaj Finance is the right company to be in, considering that the growth opportunity there is best in terms of growth. Going forward, the cost of funds is also going to come down. Within the group, our preference should be for something like a Bajaj Finance, then Bajaj Finserv and then at number three Bajaj Auto. In case of Bajaj Auto, we feel most of the price cuts which they are doing at the entry level were not profitable businesses. They are selling some of these entry level bikes at some kind of a loss. We will be more bullish on Hero in the two-wheeler space.


From the NBFC space, what do you make of L&T Finance? Where does it stand within your pecking order?
It is more of a midcap kind of an NBFC. L&T Finance numbers were pretty good. The cost to income ratio could see a significant reduction in that as well as on the gross NPA levels. Also, one could see significant reductions happening. Overall, we would be positive on L&T Finance. However, right now, within the NBFC space, we are more focussed on the microfinance company where we see the earnings growth opportunity to be pretty robust over next three to four quarters.


We were discussing the IT sector a little while back. Now we have seen a slew of numbers come in from the IT space. Things are looking up for the business in a meaningful manner whether it comes to deal wins, or pricing of some of these deals. Look at Wipro’s earnings. While the other parameters looked lukewarm, the margin performance is fairly interesting to note. How do you review the earnings of all of the IT majors in lieu of what Wipro has also reported?
Wipro’s numbers were slightly better than expectation. However, the disappointment was that the Q2 guidance of 0.3 to 2.3% was below our expectations. If you look at the BFSI space, clearly Wipro has seen a lot of improvement over last six quarters with Q on Q growth for six quarters. So that is a positive. But with bankruptcy happening on the telecom space for two of its clients, plus the issue that it is grappling on the healthcare business, it is better to be with a leader like Infosys which on a valuation perspective is quite cheap compared to TCS. 

There were lot of one-offs in Infosys results. Overall, we are positive on the result despite the market being a little bit negative. From our perspective, the pecking order should be Infosys, TCS and then Wipro."

This was the record high levels for both the indices on a closing basis. Yet, technical data suggested half of the stocks trading on the exchanges are still trading below their 200-day moving averages.


Here's a look at the stocks that hogged limelight this past week:

Symphony: This stock plummeted 15 per cent last week to settle at Rs 1,113.20 on Friday. The weakness was seen after the consumer durables company reported a 48.71 per cent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit at Rs 20 crore for the quarter to June. The figure for the corresponding quarter last year stood at Rs 39 crore.


Bajaj Finserv: The NBFC piped private sector lender Axis Bank in terms of market capitalisation on Friday. At close, the m-cap of Bajaj Finance stood at Rs 1,35,119 crore while Axis Bank’s was at Rs 1,34,725 crore. Bajaj FInserv gained 3.8 per cent while Axis Bank fell 5.7 per cent during the week.


ITC: With a 10 per cent surge for the week, ITC managed to topple Hindustan Unilever to become the most valued FMCG firm on Dalal Street. ITC's m-cap at the end of the week stood at Rs 3.69 lakh crore compared with HUL's Rs 3.58 lakh crore. With stock offered no return for the week.


Hexaware: The company's inline June quarter results failed to enthuse foreign brokerages, which continued to remain underweight on the stock. Credit Suisses maintained its 'underperform' rating on the stock but raised target price to Rs 380 from Rs 360. Macquarie downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'buy' but raised its target price to Rs 500 from Rs 476. The stock plunged 9 per cent during the week to Rs 457.40.


Vijaya Bank: This stock surged 22 per cent during the week as it became the first state-run lender to report a drop in bad loans in many quarters and improved the cushion against loan losses. While the bank reported a 41 per cent drop in net profit, CEO R A Sankara Narayanan is confident that his bank will show 20 per cent growth in credit and deposits as well as earnings by the end of this year. 


Bajaj Auto: Bajaj Auto fell 6 per cent for the week after the company indicated that it wants to bolster its market share which some analysts believe may come at a cost. Investors felt that were the company to continue with aggressive pricing stance, others such as Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor will follow the suit, which would hurt margins for the two-wheeler maker. 


Cigarette stocks: No bad news is good news. Who knows it better than cigarette makers. No changes in cigarette taxation by the GST Council in its recent meeting lifted cigarette stocks. ITC gained 10.5 per cent, VST Industries (13.26 per cent) and Godfrey Phillips (16.31 per cent) during the week.


Cement stocks : These stocks were in focus during the week on reports that the Supreme Court of India conditionally allowed petcoke import. The Q1 results of many cement makers too came in healthy. ACC soared 19 per cent while Ambuja Cements gained 15.75 per cent for the week. Meanwhile, Union Minister Arun Jaitley said that GST rates on cement will be cut as tax revenues increase. 


Idea Cellular: This stock climbed 10.47 per cent this week after the telecom firm and Vodafone together paid Rs 7,200 crore to DoT and got government approval for the merger deal.


Liquor stocks: These stocks rallied after the GST Council overlooked extra neutral alcohol (ENA), the main ingredient for spirit makers, during its meeting on Saturday. Radico Khaitan soared 20 per cent."

5,2018-08-02,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: If you have managed to make money in stocks this year, consider yourself lucky. Reason? 

Disparity on display is at its best on Dalal Street this year, and the number of haven’ts have far outnumbered the haves!

For instance, 14 top gainers in terms of market capitalisation have this year swelled their market value by Rs 10 lakh crore, while 2,900 stocks have lost the same amount in this period.

Half of this humongous loss was contributed by 950-odd constituents of BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices, which fell 10-15 per cent in the first seven months. 

Analysts say such disparity is abnormal and would not last long. 

Some 2,300 of the 2,900-odd stocks have seen value erosion so far this year, and barring the top 14, the ones that have created wealth for investors have failed to wipe out this loss.



The total market value of the BSE-listed stocks stood at Rs 153 lakh crore at the end of Wednesday’s trade against Rs 152 lakh crore on December 31, 2017.

“Historically, whenever a meltdown has happened in smallcaps and midcaps, it has lasted 2-3 years. But I do think the current selloff that started in January will last beyond 6-8 months,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research & Advisory.

He said the top performing largecap stocks are trading at 5 to 10 times price-to-book value, which is not sustainable.

Data shows TCS alone has added Rs 2.26 lakh crore to its market value. At the end of July, it was the most valued firm on Dalal Street at Rs 7.43 lakh crore.

Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HDFC and IT are some of the bluest of the blue chips that have contributed most to BSE's market value this year.

Others, such as Bajaj Finance, Avenue Supermarts, Bajaj Finserv, Nestle India and Indiabulls Ventures, too, have made significant contribution. 

While companies such as Bajaj Auto, Punjab National Bank, NTPC, ONGC and OMCs have led the laggards, there was no dearth of midcaps that erased investor wealth. 

Popular names such as Vakrangee, HPCL, Bharat Electronics, PC Jeweller, TVS Motor Company, NBCC (India), Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals and Sun TV Network are among the midcaps that have seen heavy value erosion in past seven months. Data suggests 53 per cent of BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap stocks were down in excess of 20 per cent this year.

Risk aversion was the biggest reason for the shift in investor focus towards largecaps. Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps triggered a selloff in midcaps and smallcaps by many of the largecap-oriented mutual fund schemes, which weighed on market sentiment.

The bearishness only intensified with Sebi’s trading curbs on several lower-rung stocks. 

Ace investor Shankar Sharma in a recent tweet called it a technical factor. “Two types of bear markets: fundamental & technical. Fundamentals in smallcaps are intact. So what’s caused the meltdown? Technical factors, i.e. trading curbs, hence low liquidity, hence forced selling into illiquidity, leading to a domino effect collapse of the entire segment,” Sharma said.

 A few brokerages have noted that despite Nifty's outperformance vis-à-vis the midcap index, several midcaps are still trading at up to 8 per cent premium. 

This, even as Nifty’s earnings estimates have got upgraded by 4.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent for FY19 and FY20 and Nifty Midcap100 earnings downgraded by 1.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.

One should strictly stick to quality stocks at this point, they said. 

Elara Capital said it continues to prefer largecaps over midcaps and within midcaps investors should stick to quality."

12,2018-08-16,Bajaj Finserv,"The pecking order among the best-performing schemes in mutual funds has changed in the past three years. It has been observed that quite a few schemes of mid-sized fund houses have been featuring in the list of the best-performing plans across categories. Veteran fund managers and distributors give four key reasons for the rise and almost domination of schemes of mid-sized fund houses in the top five best-performing schemes.

The first reason, these veterans point out, is that long and sustained investments of several large fund houses in underperforming sectors have not paid off. They say these fund houses have, to a certain extent, entered a value ‘trap’. Second, investments of fund houses large in size in low quality stocks in the smallcap space have not been remunerative. Third, several large fund houses had high focus on hybrid funds since the markets turned expensive. They functioned with the line of thought that hybrid funds would be suitable for first-time investors. It was also observed that a large number of first-time investors opted for hybrid funds. Fourth, Asset Under Management (AUM) of several large-sized fund houses has shown tremendous growth in the past three years. This has shifted their focus more to beating the benchmark index of their schemes rather than accumulating stocks with high conviction and bottomup approach.

A combination of these four factors worked in favour of schemes of midsized fund houses which played different strategies. Here is a lowdown on strategies played by schemes of midsized fund houses that helped them climb the ranks of best performing schemes across categories:


Large and midcap

Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund
(Takes only SIP, no lump sum)
Fund manager: Neelesh Surana 
AUM: Rs 5,730 crore 
3-year return: 16.5% 
3-year category return: 10.7% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 13.4%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank

Surana has proved to be exception among the list of fund managers from mid-sized fund houses. Consistently maintaining the enviable top spot in the list of best performing schemes, especially in largeand mid-cap category across various market cycles, has earned him the faith of distributors and investors alike. His ability to pick stocks and stay away from momentum themes and follow high-conviction bets has paid off. Rising cashflows, relatively low debt, dominant nature of market share, quality management and scalability of business are strict checklists of variables that play a crucial in his stock selection. These variables have ensured consistency in performance. Three prominent stocks which have boosted the scheme’s performance are HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Havells India.


Large-capAxis Bluechip Fund
Fund manager: Shreyash Devalkar 
AUM: Rs 2,568crore 
3-year return: 12.39% 
3-year category return: 10.3% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 12.03%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC

After a long patch of ordinary performance, schemes of Axis Mutual Fund are featuring in the list of best-performing schemes. Prominent among these is Axis Bluechip. The scheme is back in the reckoning in the past one year. Fund manager Shreyash Devalkar, who joined the scheme in November 2016, follows a roadmap that is in sync with the fund house’s overall strategy. He focuses on growth companies that exhibit quality and attractive return ratios. As markets have become extremely focused on quality companies, Devalkar’s bets have paid off. Factors he kept in mind have been high return on equity (RoE), revenue and margin growth and penetration in market. Three sectors that met these criteria include financials, especially retail-focused banks, auto and auto-ancillaries and consumption. Prominent stocks that helped enhance the returns include Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors, and L&T.


MidcapKotak Emerging Equities Fund
Fund manager: Pankaj Tibrewal 
AUM: Rs 3,327crore 
3-year return: 12.61% 
3-year category return: 9.9% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 12.03%
Top 3 holdings: Bharat Financial, RBL Bank, Schaeffler India

Tibrewal looks for growth strategies and avoids value traps. Companies that have made their way into the scheme’s portfolio are the ones with good cash flows, capital allocation, and sound management with ability to scale up. The fund manager prefers structural growth stories where earnings can compound by 20-25%, and avoids cyclical stories. The fund has a sharp focus on risk management, with no stock constituting more than 5% of the portfolio. Churn in the portfolio is low at just 30-35%. Stocks like Whirlpool, Atul, Ramco, Finolex Cables have helped the fund throw in stellar returns.


ValueTata Equity PE Fund
Fund manager: Sonam Udasi
AUM: Rs 4,669 crore 
3-year return: 15.8% 
3-year category return: 11.2% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 11.6%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Yes Bank

Udasi diligently follows a simple strategy that has turned out to be extremely profitable in volatile phases. He selects 70% of the stocks in his portfolio that quote at price to earnings multiple (trailing) lower than the Sensex. For the remaining 30% of the portfolio, Udasi is comfortable to have companies which quote PEs higher than the Sensex. But these companies must have high visibility of earnings and attractive return ratios. This strategy has paid off in the past three years. A few prominent companies that have lifted the scheme’s performance are Yes Bank, City Union Bank, and Bajaj Finserv.


MulticapMotilal Oswal Multicap 35 Fund
Fund manager: Gautam Sinha Roy 
AUM: Rs 13,861crore 
3-year return: 13.11% 
3-year category return: 10.3% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 12.11%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC, HDFC Bank, Maruti

Gautam adopts a bottom up approach to stock picking and is benchmark agnostic. Long-term secular growth stories fit into the portfolio and he does not mind paying a premium for valuations where growth prospects are high. The fund manager has been overweight on financials with NBFCs, housing finance, insurance and private banks accounting for 45% of its portfolio, which has yielded good returns. TCS and Infosys have been recent additions to the portfolio. Avoiding value traps like telecom, pharma and PSU banks has helped it deliver superior returns. Stocks like Bajaj Finance, HDFC Standard Life, Eicher have delivered high returns."
14,2018-08-18,Bajaj Finserv,"Turkey’s financial issues and a falling rupee back home did create a scare for equities, but benchmarks Sensex and Nifty stood firm and ended the truncated week in the green. The NSE index, in fact, summoned courage to hit off a new record in the end.

For the whole week, the 30-share Sensex notched up 79 points, or 0.21 per cent, closing at 37,948. As for the Nifty, the record high came at 11,471, up 41.25 points, or 0.35 per cent, against a close of 11,430 on August 10.

Overall, fortunes seesawed the whole week. The beginning was on a downbeat note, with Fitch Ratings’ latest report that its outlook on the Indian banking sector is likely to remain negative until the banks address their weak core capital positions against mounting bad loans and poor financial performance. 

In between, India’s trade deficit soared to a near five-year high of $18 billion. But it was the final day of trade that helped markets regain composure and settle the week in positive territory.

But there are top stocks and sectors that were up and running the whole week. A look.


@fresh all-time high: More than 25 stocks on the BSE 500 index scaled their fresh all-time high during the week gone by. Some of the stocks on the list included Varun Beverages, Jubilant FoodWorks, 3M India, Havells India, Berger Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Exide Industries, Bata India, Graphite India, Page Industries and Tata Consultancy Services.


Nifty top gainer: Sun Pharma played to the gallery, gaining the most, on the Nifty50 index. The scrip jumped 12.55 per cent to Rs 623.50 on August 17, from Rs 554 on August 10. The drug major got traction on better-than-expected results for the first quarter to June on the back of stronger sales in the US. It posted consolidated net profit of Rs 982.51 crore for Q1 FY19 against net loss of Rs 424.92 crore for Q1 FY18. In a separate development, the company received approval for CEQUA (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution) 0.09 per cent, from the USFDA. CEQUA is indicated for treatment of patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye).


Booster dose: Most pharma stocks advanced on the back of a weak rupee. The local currency plunged more than 9 per cent on a year-to-date (YTD) basis and around 2 per cent in August. A weak rupee boosts revenue of pharma firms in rupee terms as the sector derives a major share of revenue from exports. Besides Sun Pharma, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Cipla advanced up to 8 per cent last week.


Rupee impact: Oil marketing companies (OMCs) came under pressure as the rupee went below 70 per dollar for the first time. Loss in the rupee against the dollar makes oil imports costlier for these companies. The sharp decline in the currency can be attributed to a weak external position with respect to current account deficit as well as an unstable political and currency environment in Turkey. HPCL, IOC and BPCL declined 4.09 per cent, 5.98 per cent and 6.50 per cent, respectively, during August 10-17.


Top gainers of BSE 500: With a rally of 47 per cent, Housing Development & Infrastructure stood out in the crowd. It was the top gainer on the BSE 500 index for the week ended August 17. It was followed by Apollo Hospitals (up 25 per cent), Kwality (21 per cent), United Breweries (15 per cent) and Rain Industries (13 per cent).


Top losers of BSE 500: Reliance Naval (down 17 per cent), Sobha (down 12 per cent), IL&FS Transportation Networks (down 11 per cent), Chennai Petroleum Corporation (down 10.76 per cent) and Allahabad Bank (down 10 per cent) ended up being top losers of the index during the week gone by.


Order boost: Shares of Ion Exchange (India) hit upper circuit of 5 per cent on Friday after the company signed up a job contract from a Vedanta unit. The company informed bourses that it has signed a contract for engineering, procurement, supply and construction of water treatment plant worth of Rs 438.84 crore from Cairn Oil & Gas, a division of Vedanta Ltd.


Apollo Hospitals: The stock spurted over 25 per cent after the healthcare company posted 71.02 per cent increase in its standalone PAT at Rs 60.2 crore for the first quarter ended June. Revenues grew by 16 per cent to Rs 1,910.4 crore for the first quarter from Rs 1,650.4 crore in the same period a year ago."
15,2018-08-20,Bajaj Finserv,"It took seven months for NSE’s Nifty index to move from 11,000 to 11,500 level. This period remained highly volatile for the domestic equity market amid trade war tensions, sustained outflow of foreign portfolio money, rising crude oil prices and a depreciating local currency. 

After scaling the 11,000 mark for the first time on January 23, the index hit a low of 9,951 on March 23. However, buying in 22 index stocks took it above 11,500 on August 20.

Shares of Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have rallied 67 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, since January 23. Twenty other blue chips – HUL, TCS, M&M, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank and ITC – have rallied between 10 per cent and 30 per cent during this period. 

In terms of valuation, the index is looking expensive compared with its long-term moving average. The 50-share index traded at a P/E of over 28 times on Monday compared with its 10-year average of 20.90. 

Basant Maheshwari, Co-Founder & Partner Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers LLP in a tweet said, “Comparing the average Nifty P/E across stocks is like comparing the average salaries of a scientist, doctor, engineer and part-time gardeners & drivers – high quality secular growth and low quality cyclicals. Nifty has more scientists, doctors, engineers now, than it did 20 years back.”


Comparing the average Nifty P/E across stocks is like comparing the average salaries of a Scientist, Doctor, Engine… https://t.co/HufSl5pFWE&mdash; Basant Maheshwari (@BMTheEquityDesk) 1534725838000
Among other Nifty stocks, GAIL, YES Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, Eicher Motors, Titan, Cipla, Axis Bank, HCL Technologies and HDFC have gained up to 10 per cent since January 23. 

On the other hand, Tata Motors, Vedanta, HPCL, Bharti Airtel and UPL slipped up to 38 per cent between January 23 and August 17.

The BSE Sensex also hit a fresh record high of 38,266 in early trade on Monday. Gains in capital goods, metals, realty and banking stocks amid firm Asian cues aided the market. 

From a valuation perspective, analysts are not too comfortable with the current level of the market.

Even though the Sensex typically trades at a premium to its peers, it is currently trading at a higher-than-normal premium relative to its emerging market (EM) peers. For instance, from a five-year average perspective, India typically traded at a premium of 18 per cent to the median P/E of nine emerging markets. However, today India trades at a whopping 37 per cent premium to median P/E of EMS, Ambit Capital said in its recent report.

The 30-share index currently trades at a 21 per cent premium to its 10-year average P/E ratio, Ambit said.

The recent rally in the stock market has more support from domestic flows than FIIs. On a year-to-date basis, foreign portfolio investors have taken out some Rs 1300 crore, while domestic institutional investors have poured in more than Rs 68,300 crore.

“Many emerging markets, maybe not so much in India, are under severe distress. I’m talking about some very high-growth economies, like those in Eastern Europe. And we have economies like Poland, which are doing well. Yet, these stock markets relative to the US are at multi-decade lows. Liquidity in markets like the Philippines and Indonesia has completely dried up.

Many heavyweight stocks of yesteryears have since lost their say on the Indian benchmark indices, even as others have come to acquire clout and become titans in Dalal Street’s new power equation.

Take for instance, ONGC, a Nifty heavyweight from 2004 to 2006 with 12-13 per cent weightage. Today, its index ranking is 24 and the energy firm commands just 1 per cent weightage in the index.

HDFC Bank, which was not even among the top 10 Nifty50 stocks a decade ago, enjoys the highest weightage today at 9.5 per cent.

This broadly reflects the changing contours of the Indian economy, which financials have surpassed every other segment, growing at breakneck speed. Since 2002, when HDFC Bank had a mere 1.8 per cent weightage in Nifty50, the stock has compounded annually at 28 per cent backed by strong earnings.

A change in the methodology used to compute Nifty50 weightage to free-float basis in 2009 has also brought about a complete overhaul in the index composition, brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a report.






Baahubalis today
The more weight a stock holds in the index, the more clout it carries in swinging the index. This is best reflected in Nifty’s recent spurt to 11,500 level, which has been fuelled by only a handful of index heavyweights. That is the main reason behind the disparity in market behaviour, wherein the Nifty has risen some 9 per cent year-to-date against a 7 per cent drop in the Nifty Midcap index. 

“Nifty, in particular, has been running up because of a select few stocks. Outside of it, the market has actually seen a good beating down in the recent months,” Nitasha Shankar of Yes Securities told ETNow.

At present, HDFC Bank (9.5 per cent), Reliance Industries (9.4 per cent), HDFC (6.8 per cent) and Infosys (6 per cent) alone account for nearly one-third of Nifty50 weightage. All these stocks have outperformed the 50-pack this calendar.

Shares of RIL have risen 36 per cent this year, while Infosys has risen 33 per cent and HDFC Bank and HDFC 12 per cent each.


Baahubalis yesterday
Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which was the second biggest Nifty heavyweight in 2002, has slipped to 10th rank in clout with just 2.8 per cent weightage. This stock has delivered 16 per cent return CAGR during this period, which has been in line with Nifty50 return during the same period. Wipro was the third biggest Nifty heavyweight in 2002. It is on the 41st slot now.

Reliance Industries has remained in the top 10 club within Nifty50 for last 16 years, though even it has often witnessed swings in clout. The stock's weightage in the index has declined from 12.3 per cent in December 2002 to 12.7 per cent in 2009, 5.2 per cent in 2014 and 9.4 per cent this August.

There are 46 stocks outside Nifty with market capitalisations higher than the lowest market-cap Nifty stock. They belong to emerging sectors such as insurance. The weight of the financial sector has seen a secular rise in the benchmark indices over the years, said the Motilal Oswal study.

Private financials now hold 34.3 per cent weightage (grown 5 times in 16 years) in the Nifty50. ""It can expand even further, given that the index doesn’t have any representation of the insurance sector yet. Technology’s weightage (13.7 per cent) is reviving after slipping to a five-year-low of 11.4 per cent in 2017,” the brokerage noted.

Interestingly, 13 stocks that got listed since 2003 have since become part of the Nifty50, replacing older members. They include Maruti (listed in July 2003), TCS (August 2004),UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), Yes Bank (July 2005), TechM (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infra (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013).

TCS and Maruti Suzuki still have high weightages in the index."
17,2018-08-24,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: One beautiful thing about India’s stock market is that even the layman on the road can give you a 10-minute lecture on the most dominant investment theme: consumption.

It’s the demographic dividend, he would boast, and then go on to add rising incomes and superfast growth rate to do the math.

Problem is, he does not know there is a caveat: India’s household savings are falling and debt rising.

Some analysts on Dalal Street are already red-flagging what they call unreasonable volume growth expectations for consumer players, which may have led to frothy valuations. A peek into the household balance sheet of the average Indian family tells the story.

RBI’s recent consumer confidence survey (CCS) found around three-fourth of Indian households thought their income levels either decreased or remained same. More than half of them believed their income would either remain the same or deteriorate in next one year.

Income growth confidence, price projections and spending projections are key determinants of spending power of the average consumer.

Most respondents in the RBI survey felt their spending would increase in next one year, especially for non-essential items. And a large 77 per cent of those polled believed inflation will rise in the coming year.

Others
June quarters numbers of consumption-lined companies met Street expectations. 

Consumption stocks, too, have performed well. Shares of passenger vehicle major Maruti Suzuki have climbed 21 per cent in last one year. M&M, which makes tractors and utility vehicles, has risen 40.43 per cent. 

The BSE FMCG index, meanwhile, has risen 26 per cent in last one year compared with a 21 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex. Retail-linked NBFCs such as Bajaj Finserv (up 32 per cent), Shriram Transport (up 34 per cent) also have performed pretty well in last one year. With exceptions like Symphony, stocks of most white goods companies such as Bajaj Electriacals, IFB Industries and Havells India have gained between 40 per cent and 80 per cent. Two-wheeler stocks, though, have failed to pick up pace. Hero MotoCorp is down 16 per cent in last one year; Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors and TVS Motor are down up to 8 per cent.

The real test for corporate earnings from a growth perspective will come from second quarter onwards, Suhas Harinarayananan of JM Financial told ETNow.

""If you look at all the consumer companies, which actually outperformed in terms of volume growth, for a whole host of those companies, the two-year CAGR growth is actually not-so-impressive. You had a good run rate for Q3FY18, Q4FY18 and Q1FY19, but these were quarters that had some form of disruption or the other. Let us see how the numbers look from Q2 onwards. Harinarayananan said.

He said there is a sense of optimism because one of the key engines, which have driven this growth, has been better liquidity in rural India and that continues to be strong. ""But will companies achieve Q1 numbers of very high-double digits, high-teen numbers going ahead? I would be a little cautious on that,"" he said. 


Economic data tells a story
At a broader level, consumption growth of Indian households is outpacing income growth. This has come at the cost. Household savings have fallen to the lowest level in more than two decades.

Here household is a broader term that includes resident households, not-for-profit institutions and quasi-corporate houses. 

As real income growth lagged consumption growth, total household debt has also climbed to an all-time high level. Such a trend is not sustainable, Mumbai brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities said in a report.


Consumption on a rise, but at a cost
In five years till FY18, the growth in personal consumption expenditure (PCE) outpaced the growth in personal disposable income (PDI) in India.

PDI is the income available with a household for spending and saving after accounting for income-tax, while PCE is the expenditure incurred on the final consumption of goods and services by the households. 

Recent trend shows a drop in household savings to 21 per cent at $370 billion of PDI in FY17 from 29 per cent of PDI at $431 billion in FY12.

Households didn’t have to rely initially on debt to support higher consumption growth, and thus, their debt (institutional and non-institutional) hovered around 42 per cent of PDI between FY09 and FY15, the Motilal Oswal study showed. 

This was the initial phase of higher-than-income growth in consumption, when households had almost entirely depended on their savings. This phase was reflected by a continuous drop in household savings since FY12, even as institutional debt of households broadly remained unchanged between FY09 and FY14.

But over the past three years, a combination of higher debt and weak income growth has pushed this ratio to 48 per cent at $950 billion in FY18, the report said. 

This (total debt) estimate takes into account the fact that households also borrow from non-institutional sources such as professional money lenders, relatives/friends, agricultural money lenders, and thus, data for non-institutional debt is added with institutional debt to arrive at the figure, the report said. 

Unlike in FY18, in FY19 nominal income will grow faster, but that will mostly be offset by higher inflationary pressures. Real income could grow only slightly faster in FY19 at around 6 per cent vis-à-vis 5.8 per cent in FY18. This would mean household savings would fall further to 15.7 per cent of GDP in FY19, the lowest level in three decades since liberalisation. Household debt will also continue to grow unabated supporting consumption growth, the brokerage said.

""With investments and fiscal spending likely to grow slowly in FY19, we believe a pick-up in the consumption growth should be the key determinant of FY19 real GDP growth. Although, household income is expected to grow faster this year, rising household debt, falling savings and limited rise in assets are likely to cap consumption growth,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said. 


Flows to stock market at risk?
Meanwhile, should inflation rise as expected, domestic flows to the stock market may come under pressure. India’s household savings-to-GDP ratio currently stands at a 20-year low.

If inflation rises from here on owing to the fiscal pump-priming, then not only will the household savings ratio come under greater stress, but worryingly the proportion of financial savings to total savings would fall, limiting domestic flows into the Indian stock market, brokerage Ambit Capital projected in a report."
18,2018-08-28,Bajaj Finserv,"Investors on Dalal Street became richer by nearly Rs 15 lakh crore in just 40 trading session, as sustained buying in largecap stocks as well as fund inflows by domestic institutional investors supported market sentiment.

The total market capitalisation of all the BSE-listed firms soared to around Rs 159 lakh crore on August 28 from Rs 144 lakh crore on July 2. However, falling rupee, US-China trade war concern and weakness in emerging market currencies kept market participants cautious.

Benchmark equity index BSE Sensex closed at a fresh record high on Tuesday, while the NSE Nifty index ended above the 11,700-mark for the first time ever.

On further movement of the equity market, Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities in an interaction with ETNow said, “Nifty is inching towards 12,000 and medium to long-term, we are very bullish on the market and as well as the economy. But yes, there will be short-term jerks coming in betw een. We are advising our investors to keep pumping money on all these jerks and triggers.”

In terms of wealth creators, oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries added over Rs 2.25 lakh crore to its market capitalisation during the period. Share price of the company jumped 37 per cent to Rs 1,318.20 on August 28 from Rs 961.10 on July 2. 

Still, brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities has reiterated ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 985. 

“Our reverse valuation exercise suggests that investors have not only priced in a robust energy segment performance in RIL’s current valuations, but also ascribed the enterprise value (EV) of leading players in key sectors that are being targeted by RIL’s platform narrative—Bharti’s India business (telecom), Avenue Supermarts (retail), Flipkart (e-commerce) and key players in the media sector (content ecosystem),” Kotak said in a report.

Tata Consultancy Services has added Rs 80,381 crore to its market cap since July 2. ITC (Rs 59,890 crore), State Bank of India (Rs 40,919 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 39,591 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 38,027 crore), Bajaj Finance (Rs 36,788 crore) were among other top grossers in terms of m-cap. 

Also, market capitalisation of HDFC Bank, HUL, ONGC, Coal India, Bandhan Bank, Indiabulls Ventures, Infosys, Bajaj Finserv, Dabur Maruti Ultratech Cement, HCL Technologies, Wipro, Nestle India, Larsen & Toubro, Godrej Consumer Products, Sun Pharma, JSW Steel, NTPC, Havells, Piramal Enterprises, M&M, HDFC, Asian Paints and Shree Cement increased by over Rs 10,000 crore during the period.

In terms of share price, companies such as Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, SORIL Infra Resources, Adani Enterprises more than doubled investors wealth during July 2-August 28. 

Other names including Atlas Jewellery Sharp India, Tiaan Ayurvedic & Herbs, Alora Trading Company, Sawaca Business Machines, Birla Cable, Danube Industries, Sport King India, SPL Industries, Gangotri Textiles, Zenlabs Ethica, Diamines & Chemicals and MM Rubber rallied 100-191 per cent.

All the sectoral indices on the BSE moved northwards since July 2 with FMCG index rallying 13 per cent, followed by Oil & Gas (up 11 per cent), Healthcare (up 11 per cent), Power (up 10 per cent), Bankex (up 9 per cent), IT (9 per cent). 

Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, “On the earnings front Q1FY19 numbers have been above expectations and we remain confident that rural demand will pick up in the coming quarters. With government focusing on cleaning up the banking sector there may some short-term pressure on banking names, but the worst is behind.”

Jani prefers stocks in the private banking space and feel that they will outperform their PSU peers. Stocks such as HDFC Bank and RBL Bank remain among preferred picks. He also believes that market will continue to be volatile in the short term on the back of global fund inflows and general elections in 2019. “Any correction should be used by investors to add quality companies,” Jani said.

Capital Goods, Teck, Consumer durables, Metal, Auto and Realty index also rallied up to 8 per cent during the past 40 trading sessions.

Foreign portfolio investors have poured over Rs 4,000 crore in domestic equity markets since July this year. However, they offloaded shares worth Rs 6,000 during the first half of 2018. On the other hand, net investment of domestic institutional investors stood over Rs 71,000 crore on YtD basis.

For investment perspective, global brokerage CLSA has recommended few largecap stocks for investors. The financial services firm sees value in HDFC (target price: Rs 2,480), IndusInd Bank (Rs 1975.95), Infosys (Rs 1,560), ITC (Rs 390), Mahindra & Mahindra (Rs 1,120), Maruti Suzuki (Rs 11,300) and Sun Pharma (Rs 750)."
19,2018-08-29,Bajaj Finserv,"Smart money chases smart stocks.

Take this: Those who had shown faith on country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki in the early days must be sitting on healthy profit today. The stock, which got listed on the bourses in July 2003, has rallied over 5,400 per cent in last 15 years. One major milestone for the stock was its entry into the elite Nifty50 club in 2004.

There are 12 other stocks which all got listed after Maruti and have seen similar fortunes after entering Club Nifty. They include TCS (listed in August 2004), UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), YES Bank (July 2005), Tech Mahindra (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infratel (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013). 

Data suggested that one of every four debutants of last 15 years, which made it to Club Nifty, gave handsome returns to investors.

Barring Coal India (down 17 per cent), all other stocks from Club Nifty have delivered positive return to investors since their listing. YES Bank has rallied nearly 3,200 per cent since listing, UltraTech Cement 1,551 per cent and TCS 1,528 per cent.

The Nifty topped the 11,700-mark for the first time ever this week coming from sub-1,500 level 15 years ago, logging a 750 per cent rise.

Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, Power Grid, NTPC, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Bharti Infratel have climbed 396 per cent, 96.30 per cent, 86 per cent, 110 per cent, 357 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto have soared 1,300 per cent and 805 per cent, respectively, since their listing in 2008.

JSW Steel, which on Tuesday qualified to enter the Club Elite, advanced over 3 per cent in early trade on Wednesday. NSE Indices said it will replace Lupin in the Nifty 50 index from September 28, 2018. 

“Change is the only constant and index structure is no exception. Over the years, the representation in Nifty50 has undergone a sea change in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy: new sectors have evolved, while some have lost relative importance in the New India,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market experts are looking bullish on most of the above-mentioned stocks. Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) with a target price of Rs 10,805. The automaker expects double-digit growth in FY19, driven by continued strength in rural markets. The company remains fully committed to launching fully electric vehicles in India in 2020, supported by access to technology from Toyota. In the interim, it will launch a strong hybrid vehicle. Shares of Maruti Suzuki traded at Rs 9,413 on Wednesday.

Country’s biggest IT major Tata Consultancy Services is among the preferred picks of brokerage Sharekhan. TCS recently reported higher-than-expected margin performance in Q1FY19, while Infosys and HCL Tech delivered on expected lines, according to Sharekhan.

BofAML recently upgraded Tech Mahindra to ‘buy’ from ‘underperform’ and raised the target price to Rs 800 from Rs 600 earlier. “We expect operating profit to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 18 per cent over FY18-21. Such growth to provide more qualitative stock rally,” the brokerage said.

Phillip Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Ports with a target price of Rs 475. “The strong cargo growth story remains intact, driven by inclusion of new ports (Ennore in FY19, Vizhinjam in FY20) and growth in logistics business. We also expect strong cash flows in FY19 and beyond, with capex peaking out and operations stabilising across assets. We view the current price as an excellent opportunity to own a superior cash-generating asset portfolio,” it said.

Motilal Oswal also has ‘buy’ ratings on Bajaj Auto, Coal India, NTPC and Power Grid."

0,2018-09-01,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Market kept its slate clean on Friday by rallying for the sixth straight week on the back of select heavyweights. But the rupee's rapid descent towards 71-mark against the dollar came as a rude jolt. 

The Sensex advanced 1.03 per cent to 38,645.10 for the week to August 31, from 38,251.80 in the previous one. The NSE Nifty added 1.06 per cent at 11,680.50, from 11,557.10 during the same period.

More than 30 stocks in the Nifty index ended the week in the green, with UPL, Hindalco, Tech Mahindra, PowerGrid and Tata Steel rising up to 10 per cent. YES Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance Industries, Eicher Motors and GAIL were not as lucky, slipping up to 8 per cent.

Rupee's diminished clout remains a big worryline. The slide is mainly a fallout of elevated crude prices, worsening current account deficit (CAD), spike in inflation and fears of foreign portfolio outflow.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes, according to Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management, show that the benchmark finished the week below the 11,700 level. However, the index bulls failing to take out 11,760 might be a point of concern on a short-term basis. Hence staying cautious on rise is advised. 

Breaking out 11,760 may unfold a fresh leg of upmove towards 11,880 levels. Further, Nifty broader trading range for the coming week is expected to be 11,880-11,520.

When Sanjiv Bajaj, the younger son of Bajaj Group chairman Rahul Bajaj, took the reins of the group’s newly spun off financial service division 10 years ago, the business was completely new to him. Yet, over the past decade, he has turned the business, comprising Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, into a moneymaking machine for the group.

“I am both excited and humbled to be awarded the Business Leader of the Year,” said Bajaj, managing director at Bajaj Finserv. “I accept it on behalf of all my colleagues at Bajaj Finserv and our operating companies. This award is a significant recognition of our 10-year journey of providing innovative, high-quality loans and insurance products to over 100 million Indians and becoming a small enabler in their daily lives.”

That’s a journey most entrepreneurs would envy, and would love to emulate. The combined market capitalisation of Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance, the two listed companies he heads, stood at Rs 2.6 lakh crore as of end June 2018 — about 32 times higher than what it was at the end of fiscal 2008 — as Bajaj diversified the business into consumer and SME finance, insurance, financial advisory and wealth management, from primarily auto finance in 2008.

Market cap of Bajaj Finserv, the holding company, has grown to Rs 1.03 lakh crore from Rs 7,445 crore as on March 31, 2008. Its non-banking arm Bajaj Finance is a bigger success story, having turned around from a loss-making company in 2007-08 to post a profit of Rs 2,646 crore for the last financial year. The company’s market cap expanded to Rs 1.57 lakh crore from Rs 1,207 crore on March 31, 2008.

Bajaj Finserv’s insurance businesses, both life and general, are doing extremely well. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance is one of the most successful private players in the industry, and is the only general insurer that has been reporting an underwriting profit.

Sanjiv Bajaj has also made his share of mistakes, but he was quick to correct them. When the tide turned, he pulled back from equipment financing and cut exposure to loans against property.

While selecting Bajaj as the Business Leader of the Year, the jury pointed out he entered a highrisk business category and fundamentally altered the consumer finance business both through the use of technology and through execution, with even leading banks later replicating his model.

He is an extremely humble leader and willing to learn, and has brought about the phenomenal increase in Bajaj Finserv’s valuation, the jury concluded."
2,2018-09-10,Bajaj Finserv,"ET Wealth together with Morningstar India have selected and ranked India's best equity fund managers, across categories, based on their five-year risk-adjusted returns. Here are the top 5 in the small and mid cap category. These managers have proved their mettle while dealing with stock market volatility and have delivered consistent returns over the years. Read about each of these managers, their top stock and sector picks and what they think is the promising theme for the next few years.


Should you start sips in small cap funds?
The correction in mid- and small-cap stocks has led several fund houses to reopen their doors for fresh investments in schemes focused on these segments of the market. Several small- and midcap funds, which had stopped taking fresh investments, are now open for investments. For instance, DSP Mutual Fund has started accepting SIPs or STPs in the DSP Small Cap Fund. However, the fund will not accept lump sum investments. 

“We still expect the market to remain volatile in the run up to the election in mid-2019. The earnings cycle may be picking up, but broad valuations continue to be high,” said Kalpen Parekh, President, DSP Mutual Fund, in an interview to a financial portal. Another small-cap fund, L&T Emerging Businesses Fund, opened its doors to fresh SIP investments last week. 

Earlier, the SBI Smallcap Fund (previously known as the SBI Small & Midcap Fund), which had stopped taking new investments in October 2015, reopened for fresh SIPs in May. But there is an investment cap of Rs 25,000 per month per individual. Though many investors may rush to start SIPs in these reopened funds, experts advise caution.

1. Neelesh Surana, Mirae Asset Mutual Fund
 Age: 45 Years

Education: B.E. and MBA
Experience: 19+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 30.33%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 2,036 crore


Profile
Neelesh Surana has consistently ranked among the best fund managers in all previous editions of these rankings, which is a testimony to his investing prowess. With the fund house’s other flagship offering, the mid-cap oriented Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip, he replicates his impeccable track record of consistent outperformance every year since the funds inception, beating both the benchmark index and peers. 

The initial exuberance around the mid-cap space few years ago made handling this segment a tricky affair, but Surana has focused on being in the right pockets within sectors, rather than playing on sector rotation. Being a stickler for quality, he has contained risk by focusing on the larger mid-caps and avoided hunting lower down the market-cap ladder to generate alpha.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“We are coming out of a period of subpar earnings growth—reflected by low profit to GDP ratio—compared to longterm averages. We expect corporate earnings to improve over the next few years. This will help mitigate the macro-economic challenges.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Our focus remains on individual businesses. In the current environment, the large disparity in valuation across sector and stocks offers good opportunities in businesses whose long-term prospects are intact, while their near term performance is impaired.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“We remain positive on the consumption side of the economy, subject to reasonable valuations. In the long-term, structural growth drivers related to favourable demographics, rising income levels and urbanisation will lead to higher demand, particularly in the under-penetrated consumer goods and services segment.”


2. S.N. Lahiri, L&T Mutual Fund
 Age: 51 Years

Education: B.E.and PGDM
Experience: 28 years

5-year asset weighted return: 27.51%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 1.634 crore


Profile
While recognising that the mid- and small-cap space provides ample opportunity to beat the index comfortably, S.N. Lahiri stresses that his focus is on consistent returns. He is passionate about new ideas and believes that if a company is part of the index, its growth has been discovered and is likely to be captured in its price. 

Lahiri prefers quality businesses with differentiated offerings and a significant competitive edge over peers. To contain risk, he insists on healthy diversification, limiting exposure to individual bets. Lahiri recognises that selling right is often more important than buying right.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“Volatility has returned—but it is integral to equity markets. Although popular indices have scaled new highs, mid- and small-caps remain sluggish and this divergence is throwing up opportunities.”


b) Navigating current environment
“The recent correction in midand small-caps has taken away some of the froth and we are looking at some of these stocks that are available at cheaper valuations. We are looking to use the market volatility as an opportunity to raise our stake in some of the quality companies, with a long-term perspective.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Consumption due to urban and rural demand remains a strong theme. We are also looking at quality infra stocks. Another theme we are quite positive on is the digital transformation in various fields and the use of technology as it looks to disrupt traditional business models.”

3. Ravi Gopalakrishnan, Canara Robeco Mutual Fund
 Age: 50 Years

Education: MBA and MS
Experience: 21+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 31.16%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 1,136 crore

Profile
Ravi Gopalakrishnan asserts that navigating the mid- and smallcap segment successfully requires discipline so as to not deviate from the investing style. He is happier when volatility is high as it yields good bargains, but insists that trying to capture the volatility through market timing is a futile exercise.

Gopalakrishnan has chosen not to have more than 3-4% in individual bets, which has helped de-risk his portfolio while pushing him to find new, better investment ideas. Performance during drawdowns is critical in the mid-cap space, he argues. 

Gopalakrishnan prefers a portfolio mix with a sizeable chunk of high potential alpha generators with a smaller portion in steady compounding businesses with a sound track record. His portfolio comprises firms that can maintain and gain market share across cycles, are moving up the value chain and show balance sheet improvement.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“This year, interest rates and commodity prices have switched from being tailwinds to headwinds. Further, changes in political equations have also raised concerns on economic reforms. While volatility is likely to remain elevated, we are likely to see markets in a bull phase over the next 3 to 5 years, most likely led by improvement in the earnings growth.”


b) Navigating current environment
“With the market in a consolidation phase, the best strategy is to focus on quality stocks that have seen large corrections and accumulate them taking advantage of the ongoing volatility.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Both discretionary and nondiscretionary consumption themes are expected to immensely benefit over the long term, as the economy gradually shifts from the unorganised to the organised sector. The other theme that will most likely see opportunities is the investment theme. However, this theme requires careful selection.”


4. Anoop Bhaskar, IDFC Mutual Fund
 Age: 48 Years

Education: B.Com and M.B.A.
Experience: 23+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 26.08%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 4,419 crore


Profile
Anoop Bhaskar has helmed schemes across two fund houses during our selected period. He takes a conservative approach and has derived strength from a low beta (low volatility) portfolio that ensures better downside protection. 

Apart from bringing healthy diversification, he has emphasised on a healthy liquidity position that can withstand stress. He has leaned towards stocks offering relative value for the most part, with the rest of the portfolio comprising quality companies. Bhaskar has opted for a mix of leaders in smaller sectors, not part of frontline indices, but with strong potential. He has backed unconventional ideas that offer growth visibility.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“Investor sentiments have shifted from a preference for return on capital to return of capital. This is because of uncertainty around the 2019 general elections, RBI’s hawkish policy stance, fears of a protracted trade war, interest rate hikes by US Federal Reserve, rising dollar and crude oil prices. Domestic earnings, thankfully, have been fairly strong.”


b) Navigating current environment
“We remain focused on identifying companies and sectors where growth could surprise market expectations. We are rebalancing our sector weights with a focus on reducing overall beta of the portfolios.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“The infra theme looks promising. But the high beta of this theme makes it eligible only for informed investors. Domestic consumption, however, is suited for investors with longer investment time horizon.”


5. R. Janakiraman, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund
 Age: 47 Years

Education: BE and PGDM
Experience: 21+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 25.78%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 7,108 cr


Profile
In the mid- and small-cap segment, cutting down on mistakes in the portfolio itself helps deliver healthy alpha over time. This, according to R. Janakiraman, is far more valuable than being among the first to identify new ideas. His effort during the past few years has been to reduce the risks significantly without hurting the fund’s return profile. 

With positive macro factors losing traction recently, along with a shift in market focus to earnings, emphasis on quality businesses will work favourably going forward, he insists. After the recent correction in this segment, he finds many quality stocks have become more reasonable—earlier, the risk in these stocks was due to their price and not the business. Janakirman insists that a portfolio built around quality, growth and sustainability will have a better probability of generating alpha over a cycle, even if it doesn’t fare well in certain stretches of the cycle.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“Demand continues to strength. A pick-up in monetary signals (total credit, currency in circulation) bodes well for a durable economic recovery. The micro factors indicate a sustained momentum in growth recovery even as the macroeconomic indicators remain in check. Growth should be led by consumption, exports, amid improvement in investment growth.”


b) Navigating current environment
“We focus on identifying promsing companies. Quality stocks never go out of style, regardless of the market environment due to their fundamental strength and long-term growth potential. Corrections offer opportunities to increase exposure to such companies.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Opportunities in consumer cyclicals is promising. This includes auto, durables, branded garments, big retail, entertainment, leisure and travel etc. Interim pockets of overvaluation don’t tend to diminish the long term potential of the theme.”

Here are five factors that pulled domestic equity market lower on Monday:

Falling rupeeA persistent fall in the rupee dampened market sentiment. The local currency weakened further to hit a fresh low of 72.61 against the US currency, dropping nearly 90 paise in the afternoon trade on Monday.


Weakening macrosIndia's current account deficit (CAD) widened to $15.8 billion in April-June in value terms this year as against $15 billion in the same quarter of 2017-18, mainly due to a higher trade deficit, according to RBI data released on Friday.

Sentiment also got affected with a report saying that the total liabilities of the government increased to Rs 79.8 lakh crore at end-June 2018 from Rs 77.98 lakh crore at end-March 2018. Public debt accounted for 89.3 per cent of total outstanding liabilities at end-June 2018 with internal debt accounting for 83 per cent share. Nearly 24.9 per cent of the outstanding dated securities had a residual maturity of less than five years.

Boiling crudeHigh oil prices were a spoiler for both the rupee and bonds. India imports more than two-third of its crude requirement and any rise in global prices impacts not only pushes up dollar demand by importers, but also raises inflation concerns back home.

Crude oil prices climbed further, as the US drilling for new production stalled and the market eyed tighter conditions once Washington's sanctions against Iran's crude exports kick in from November.

Brent crude was hovering above $77 per barrel in the international markets on Monday.


Spike in bond yieldsThe benchmark 10-year bond yield is hovering around 8.11 per cent, highest since November 2014. When macroeconomic indicators turn weak, bond yields push higher, resulting in a drop in prices. Investors then tend to seek more returns on bonds to compensate for the risks involved.


Bearish global cuesAsian peers were mostly trading lower after the US President Donald Trump declared he was considering tariffs on an additional $267 billion Chinese goods, ratcheting up tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The development overshadowed a strong US jobs report that kept the US Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates. Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite were down over 1 per cent in the late trade."

Subdued global cues coupled with widening of trade deficit on continuous fall in the rupee against the dollar weighed on market sentiment. Selling pressure remained visible across the board as almost all the sectoral indices ended in the red.

Index-wise, the 30-share BSE Sensex dipped 467.65 points, or 1.22 per cent to 37,922.17, while the 50-share NSE Nifty closed 151 points, or 1.30 per cent down at 11,438.10.

Trade war concerns dragged Indian rupee to a record low of 72.67 against the US currency in day trade. The local currency pared some losses to settle at 72.45 against dollar, down 71 paise against the US currency.

“The persistent weakness in the rupee is now starting to show its impact on all asset classes including the equities. The “sentiment risk” is now the major challenge for stock markets. At this time, investors need to be careful and try to get into export-oriented sectors and zero-debt companies as even Indian bond yields have sharply climbed to 4-year highs. The Indian macros have come under the sharp scrutiny of the market, and we have to see how the government and Reserve Bank of India will deal with the dual challenges of the rupee and bonds,” said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior VP and Head of Research (Wealth), Centrum Broking said.

Meanwhile, bond yield posted its biggest single-session jump since May 9, 2018. It settled 13 basis points higher at 8.16 per cent, its highest level since November 2014.

Sentiment also took a hit after Moody's Investors Service said sustained weakening of the rupee was “credit negative” for Indian companies, which generate revenue in rupees, but rely on the US dollar debt to fund operations.

“With Lok Sabha elections due next year, stock market could be spooked by political uncertainty. Rising crude prices, rupee depreciation are macroeconomic concerns in the near term. Over the long term, we remain optimistic on Indian equities. India is likely to grow faster than many nations. Investors can expect decent returns from equities over a long period in future. Valuations, however, leave moderate upside in the near term. Investors at this point should continue to invest in equities through SIPs,” said Atul Kumar, Head, Equity Funds, Quantum AMC said."

21,2018-09-13,Bajaj Finserv,"IIFL has a buy call on Bajaj Finserv with a target price of Rs 7,680.

The current market price of Bajaj Finserv is Rs 6,411.65.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Bajaj Finserv price can reach the defined target.


View of the brokerage on the company:
We resume coverage on Bajaj Finserv (BJFIN) with a BUY rating and 12-m target price of Rs 7,680. BJFIN is a retail financial services conglomerate with a trinity of assets in the underpenetrated markets of financing and insurance. We expect the financing business (BAF) to continue to drive value for BJFIN over the medium term, similar to the past five years. However, we believe franchise value of insurance businesses remains under-appreciated. Divestment of stake in the insurance businesses to JV partners could unlock further value.


Insurance: Non-life doing well but life needs a lifeline: We expect the general insurance business (BAGIC) to sustain its robust performance as the second largest private player but with the best combined ratios in the sector. We forecast 21 per cent EPS Cagr over FY18-21ii with 23 per cent RoE. A gradual improvement in the growth outlook for the life insurance business (BALIC) via higher VNB margin could provide additional upside after the underperformance during FY12-17.


Financing- Key value driver for long term: BJFIN has established a well-diversified financial services firm – Bajaj Finance (BAF) – with stron g franchises in consumer and small business lending. It has delivered significant value over the past five years and is scalable enough to sustain the robust AUM growth. Cost competitiveness would drive strong earnings growth in the medium term. Hence, contribution to earnings and franchise value from financing would continue to rise.


Initiate with BUY, insurance story under-appreciated: We value BJFIN using SoTP methodology to arrive at our 12-month tar get price of Rs 7,680, implying 21 per cent potential upside. We believe 22 per cent rally YTD in BJFIN has largely been fuelled by strong performance at BAF (up 56 per cent YTD, 64 per cent of SoTP) while the insurance businesses remain under-appreciated. Potential corporate actions in insurance businesses including divestment of stake sale in favour of a JV partner or high dividend payout are potential catalysts."
22,2018-09-14,Bajaj Finserv,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty extended their gains for a second straight session on Friday after CPI-based inflation came in at 10-month low of 3.69 per cent for August amid positive global cues.

The local currency was hovering nearly 23 points up at 71.96 against the US dollar in the late afternoon trade.

Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking said, “Nifty continued its recovery and reclaimed 11,500 today, thanks to upbeat macroeconomic data and supportive global cues. It opened gap up and gradually moved higher as the session progressed. Indications are in the favour of consolidation ahead thus traders should focus on stock specific trading approach and prefer hedged positions.” 

“We may see some profit taking in IT and pharma after the recent rally while banking, financials and select auto should do well. Apart from the local factors, participants should closely global markets for cues,” he added.

23,2018-09-15,Bajaj Finserv,"Independent market analyst Kunal Bothra is guarded in his response as he stops short of calling the latest market rally a strong uptrend. It all depends on how the market behaves next week, he told ETNow.


Edited excerpts:


What is it that you have made of the rebound that the market staged on Wednesday and Friday? Do you see the momentum continuing or do you think this was a dead cat bounce on an oversold market?

Yes, I believe it is a dual nature kind of a rebound on the indices. On the one hand, a lot of midcap stocks have recovered quite well, the Nifty managed to come back from its extremely oversold territories breaking out of that 11,500 mark. 

But when you look at it from the other spectrum, there were large cap stocks such as Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance, ITC and Bank Nifty which sort of underperformed the Nifty relatively. There have been a lot of missing parts in this phase of the market rally, which is why I believe that the journey now going forward -- at least for the very near term -- could be difficult to anticipate. Because a) you are heading to strong resistance points on the indices and b) you need a lot of support from the erstwhile stronger stocks and if that does not happen, then these rallies could be feeble in nature and you might see the index coming back into a downward spiral once again. 

So, it is going to be tricky first half next week whether the market reacts to the kind of events over the weekend and if it manages to break those resistances, only then you could establish a case that the index is coming back into its stronger uptrend.


Considering Friday itself that saw a massive jump on just about any and every sugar stock, would you say one has already missed the boat if you did not buy any sugar name on Friday? Or do you think this is just the beginning of it all, one of oversold stocks which is why the move is getting so exaggerated almost double digit across the board and one can still go out and buy these names?

Kunal Bothra: One can still go out and buy even though you have seen one day of strong price gains and it is very much possible that the stocks may remain more or less sideways. But then looking at the kind of conjunction in volume patterns in the last one and a half or two weeks, these stocks were trying to test their resistance levels and the volumes were just about increasing every time the stocks were trying to break those resistances. On Friday, we saw the breakout finally happen. 

So, it was more of a breakout which was getting anticipated and now when you look at it in terms of setup on the weekly charts, most of the sugar stocks have been showing some strong bullish RSI divergent setup on the weekly charts. I expect that this should not be a short term oriented move, this should be more of a weekly or a monthly positional move which one can spot and I would not be surprised if the stocks rise another 25-30 per cent in a short span of time as well.


What is the more near term outlook on both the index as well as banks because I guess they are very critical to the recovery of the market?

Kunal Bothra: So, on the index front, I believe that the recovery pattern is quite positive because when you scan through the weekly charts for the index and then on candle stick pattern, you see some good buying which is happening at every lows the indices hit on a weekly basis. So net-net, at the end of the week, there is a recovery pattern which is giving spurt on the index. That itself is a strong enough sign. 

But on the other hand, when I scan through the internals, I think it is just that Bank Nifty has not been able to find its exact mojo back when you are looking at the mix of private sector and the PSU banks as well. The Bank Nifty underperformance is the only nagging part for the index rally. 

If the Bank Nifty manages to make a comeback, then the index targets could be revised much higher than the previous lifetime highs or the recent highs which it made. But if the Bank Nifty continues to underperform, the pressure would be much larger on the rest of the other large cap stocks to try and give you that better alpha or better price performance. 


Any individual stocks that you think are worth a trade on Monday?

Kunal Bothra: One of the stocks which I am recommending is from the sugar pack. We discussed this stock extensively last week as well and that is a buy on Balrampur Chini. I would recommend a buy with a target of 100, stop loss to be kept at 83. And Eicher Motors, I think, the stock is on the verge of a breakout of a weekly resistance. So, that also remains a buy with targets of 30,500 and stop loss at 28,780."

33,2018-09-21,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Shares of housing finance companies came under sudden heavy selling pressure on Friday as investors raised concerns over rising cost of borrowing for the companies amid continuing financial crisis at IL&FS.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). The company lost nearly Rs 10,000 crore worth in market cap.

Tightness in money market and a lack of clarity on IL&FS exposure has led to a sudden sell-off in NBFCs. 

""There is pressure on short-term money both in the short-term and longer-term debt flows. The cost of money has escalated and there is tightness in the money market. The lack of clarity about IL&FS exposure is leading to the knee-jerk reaction. There is no clarity on government's bailout for the company so far. However, the fear will subside after the government steps in. Once there is stability in the money market, things will be as usual,"" Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, India Infoline told to ETMarkets.com. 

""The cost of borrowing for NBFCs is going to shoot up and they may face challenge in raising money in the light of recent news on IL&FS. However, this knee-jerk reaction is baffling,"" Hitesh Agrawal, EVP & head - retail research at Religare Securities told ETMarkets.com.

The entire NBFC space looked like a red sea. Shares of VLS Finance (down 16.73 per cent), L&T Finance Holdings (down 15.81 per cent), Crest Ventures (down 15.66 per cent), Centrum Capital (down 15.36 per cent) and SREI Infrastructure Finance (down 15.35 per cent) cracked over 15 per cent.

R Varadarajan, MD, Repco Home Finance denied any liquidity concerns, sayingcost of funds is increasing because of the bond market price. 

""I feel that most of the NBFCs are capable to take it and pass it on to the customers without much affecting the quality of the assets as well as the growth,"" Vardarajan added. 

However, few stocks such as India Cements Capital (up 11.28 per cent), Mukesh Babu Financial Services (up 9.78 per cent), Meenakshi Entp (up 6.97 per cent), AIIL (up 5.67 per cent), First Custodian Fund India (up 5.00 per cent), Jindal Capital (up 4.99 per cent), GILADAFINS (up 4.97 per cent), Times Guaranty (up 4.92 per cent), Suchitra Finance & Trading Company (up 4.90 per cent) and Gogia Capital Services (up 4.89 per cent) were in the green around that time.

Investors who got their thesis right must have been able to pick at least a couple of the 45 stocks from the BSE500 index, which have rallied over 1,000 per cent between September 2013 and this month. This means each of these stocks multiplied investor wealth by over 10 times in five years.

The list included stocks like Indiabulls Ventures which has surged 6,600 per cent to Rs 729.10 as of September 17, 2018 from Rs 10.90 on September 17, 2013. An investment of Rs 10,000 on this stock in 2013 would have become over Rs 6 lakh today.

It was followed by a cable firm KEI Industries (up 5,019 per cent) and pharma company Caplin Point Laboratories (up 4,096 per cent).

Supported by growth in cables business, KEI’s Q1 FY19 performance was broadly in line with analysts’ estimates. 

Brokerage firm Anand Rathi Financial Services said it expects the company to clock 18 per cent, 25 per cent and 31 per cent growth (CAGR) in revenue, Ebitda and PAT, respectively, over FY18-20 owing to a strong EPC order book, rising revenue share of EHV cables and retail sales.

Further re-rating of the stock would depend on free-cash flow generation, it said.

The brokerage retained a ‘buy’ rating on KEI with a revised target price of Rs 510. Shares of the company traded at Rs 377 on September 18. 

Among others, Minda Industries, Phillips Carbon Black, Avanti Feeds, HEG, Bajaj Finance, IFB Industries, Dalmia Bharat and Navin Fluorine International also gained between 2,000 per cent and 4,000 per cent during this period.

Global brokerage Macquarie recently initiated coverage of Minda Industries with an ‘outperform’ rating and set a target price of Rs 550. The company is a leading supplier of automotive switches, lamps and horns. In recent years, Minda acquired global players in lamps and horns, which enhanced its market position and technological capabilities.

Firstcall Research is ‘overweight’ on IFB Industries, a company is engaged in engineering and manufacturing of diverse and accessories for motor vehicles. It is also engaged in the business of manufacturing and trading of home appliances, and manufacturing of fine blanking components.

Meghmani Organics, Aarti Industries, Tata Metaliks, Nilkamal, Sundram Fasteners, Sterlite Technologies, Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation, TVS Motor Company, Aegis Logistics, KNR Construction, Johnson Controls – Hitachi Air Conditioning India, Tata Elxsi were among the other stocks that rallied over 1,500 per cent in last five years.

IDFC Securities has an ‘outperformer’ rating on Aarti Industries (AIL) with a target price of Rs 1,572. Aarti Industries is a leading player in benzene-based intermediate products, and an integral part of value chain for several global chemical majors.

The company’s backward/forward-integrated and diversified business model, which involves the supply of around 125 products to 700-800 customers across geographies, underpins its competitiveness.

“Despite significant forex and crude volatility, AIL posted 15 per cent and 20 per cent Ebitda and PAT CAGR over FY14-18 with 21.6 per cent RoE in FY18, which reflects its robust business model. We anticipate a step-up in growth with steady 12-15 per cent volume growth in core benzene segment and diversification into toluene compounds, after the company recently signed two long-term contracts worth Rs 14,000 crore. We estimate 22 per cent and 24 per cent revenue and PAT CAGR, respectively, over FY18-21E, with potential upside from new contract wins,” IDFC Securities said.

Dolat Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on KNR Construction with a target price of Rs 418, indicating an upside of more than 100 per cent from the current market price of Rs 199. KNR maintains its market position by continuously focusing on engineering excellence, improving and sharpening competencies, adapting latest construction technologies, deployment of sophisticated construction equipment and timely delivery.

“We expect KNR to witness healthy revenue growth over FY18-20E, supported by healthy margins and return ratios coupled with well-managed balance sheet, comfortable working capital and low debt-to-equity ratio,” Dolat Capital said.

Shares of KRBL, Sonata Software, Indo Count Industries, Sudarshan Chemical, TVS Srichakra, Jamna Auto, Graphite India, CanFin Homes, V-Mart, Vinati Organics, Sundaram-Clayton, SRF, Nocil, Ceat, Welspun India, Eveready Industries, Deepak Nitrite, Relaxo Footware, Bajaj Finserv, VIP Industries and KPR Mills have advanced between 1,000 per cent and 1,500 per cent in these five years.

Macquarie Research on September 4 gave an ‘outperform’ rating to Graphite India with a target price of Rs 1,410. “The management does not see needle-coke supply easing. The company is confident that it can pass on cost pressures, and is not worried about a drop in price in China. We expect a gradual re-rating for the stock with rising comfort on the longevity of the current upcycle and prudent capital allocation,” Macquarie said.

Citi Research is bullish on Ceat with a target price of Rs 1,690. “Our positive stance is predicated on our expectations of strong 12 per cent earnings CAGR over FY18-21, vs -1 per cent over last three years (FY15-18),” Citi said."

34,2018-09-28,Bajaj Finserv,"SAN FRANCISCO: Customer relationship management (CRM) software maker Salesforce will comply with Indian government’s final ruling on data localisation even as it waits for the debate to reach a conclusion, according to a top executive. The development comes as India has emerged as one of the fastest growing markets for Salesforce, with the number of customers and revenues increasing 100% year-on-year.

“It is an interesting debate. We are hoping that in the next few months when it gets tabled in Winter Session of Parliament, things will get settled in India. If we have to do business anywhere in the world, we have to respect what the local government is talking about,” said Sunil Jose, country head of Salesforce India.

Opening a data centre in India may be one of the options, although the company has not finalised any plans for it. Jose said the cloud-based software company opened one in Australia with Amazon Web Services (AWS) when data residency laws required it.

“It’s a good thing as this is the first time Indian government is thinking about privacy. We will put together a strategy once it gets decided. We have been thinking about it and this happened in other geographies too,” said Jose, at the sidelines of the company’s Dreamforce event.



Data localisation or data residency was part of the recommendations made by Justice BN Srikrishna on the privacy laws in India. The proposed law, which is seeking recommendations right now, would bar the cross-border transfer of all critical personal data. It also asks for a live copy of data pertaining to Indian citizens be kept on servers in the country by all companies, at all times. In April, banking regulator RBI also mandated that all payment data of Indians have to be stored in servers located only in India and fixed deadline of October 15.

Salesforce was founded in 2001 by Marc Benioff and has a market capitalisation of around $120 billion. The company expects global revenue to increase from $8.39 billion in 2017 to $13.18 billion in 2018.

While Salesforce has had a presence in India for about a decade, it has seen a pick-up in growth in recent years as companies are focusing more and more on providing personalised services.

“Customer experience today is at a very different level as a large part of the population is getting used to the Uber and Amazon kind of service. Personalisation is becoming key,” said Jose.

Some of its clients in India include financial services company Bajaj Finserv, IT companies like HCL and diversified conglomerate Godrej Group. Besides corporates, Salesforce is also banking on small and medium businesses to drive growth in India. The company has around 1,000 employees in India with a development centre in Hyderabad, where it plan to double the employee base in the next 5 years.

7,2018-10-10,Bajaj Finserv,"The oversold market witnessed a relief rally on Wednesday, as Nifty saw across the board pullback with all the sectors except IT ending with gains of up to 5.5%. The NSE benchmark Nifty sustained gains throughout the session and ended 159.05 points or 1.54 per cent higher.

We step into Thursday’s trade with optimism, as there are greater chances that the market may continue with its pullback. In event of any consolidation, it would be critically important for market to trade above the 10,400 mark.

The most interesting thing that was seen on Wednesday was that the pullback has not yet entirely come on the back of short covering. The market saw buying at lower levels as well as open interest was seen being added.

Thursday is likely to see the levels of 10,495 and 10,560 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in at 10,400 and 10,350 zones.

The RSI on the daily chart is 30.9745. Though it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price, it has just crossed above the oversold area, which is bullish.

Daily MACD is now seen flattening its trajectory. Apart from a white body that emerged on the candles, no significant formations were observed.

ETMarkets.com
Of late, the market had got deeply oversold and more so during the last couple of sessions, and the pullback that we saw on Wednesday was in fact long overdue.

It is a positive sign that the pullback has not come just on account of short covering. For Thursday and subsequent sessions, we expect the market to continue its pullback and also consolidate in a broad range with a positive bias. If market is to form a base in the current zone, some broad consolidation cannot be ruled out.

We recommend keeping making select purchases in event of any consolidation. The levels of 10,350-10,400 would be crucial and Nifty will have to trade above this to prevent weakness from creeping in again. While continuing a cautious approach, positive outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Long positions were seen being added in Ashok Leyland, NCC, Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, National Aluminum, IOC and Kotak Bank.

13,2018-10-13,Bajaj Finserv,"Kunal Bothra, independent market analyst, believes the 11,650-11,700 could be a near-term target for Nifty. What made him conclude this? Read on to find out:


ET Now: One up day, one really down day and then another up day; where do we stand for Monday?

Kunal Bothra: All of the five market days this week were completely different in texture of the market mood and the net result at the end of the week is that Nifty managed to end that five weeks of straight declines and close on a positive note. 

There are a lot of positives which came back into the market, especially on Friday - the India VIX ebbed, crude came back to the $80-mark from those multi-year high and rupee recovered to close below the 74-level. 

And then when you look into the markets internally, there have a lot of positives because of defensive stocks or sectors like IT and pharma. They were the ones which saw a bit of correction which shows that the risk appetite is coming back to the markets and that is a positive sign. Overall, the next couple of weeks you should see the markets stabilising and gradually inching up higher. From a one-week perspective, the 11,650-11,700 could be a near term target for Nifty.


ET Now: Do you sense a further rise in any of the OMCs?

Kunal Bothra: There should be a continuation of an up move because the last two weeks have been extremely volatile. Last week, the stocks were down 40-50 per cent and this week most of them have managed to recover more than 50 per cent of their losses. 

Generally, when there is a sharp V-shape kind of a pattern there is some level of extension which happens but this could only be just a short-term trading extension. This is because these stocks have not just corrected over the last two or three weeks but rather this correction is ongoing since last one year approximately. 

Last year, same time, we were talking of multiyear highs for these OMCs. So, there should be more consolidation which one can spot in the long-term. However, on an immediate basis, the next couple of weeks should bring some positivity back into the OMCs.


ET Now: Do you sense any trading opportunity in any of the NBFCs?

Kunal Bothra: There now two completely demarcated territories for the NBFCs when I scan through those price appreciation - the open interest data and the volumes which panned out. And the more favoured names are the ones on the largecap side, especially Bajaj Finance or even a Bajaj Finserv as they both have shown strong recovery patterns.

What has transpired in names like DHFL and most of the other NBFC stocks is that the correction was extremely sharp and then there was a shallow recovery in comparison to what happened for the largecap names. So, now if a short-term trader or an investor is trying to act bullish then the bias would be more on the largecap front. 


ET Now: What is looking tradable for Monday morning?

Kunal Bothra: Last week Maruti made a very good comeback after almost three or four weeks of straight correction. It managed to close on a positive note and in that process, it has formed a Bullish Hammer Pattern on the candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframe. The stock should make or rather continue this uptrend for at least the next one or one and a half week. 

I would suggest a ‘buy’ on Maruti with a target of Rs 7,600 and a stop loss at Rs 7,100. 

And the other chart which is very interesting is Godfrey Phillips. Over the last four or five months, the stock has made a pattern of lower highs and lower lows but when you scan through those indicators on weekly and monthly charts, those indicators have in fact made a higher bottom every time. 

This stock could be in the process of a big reversal from the current levels. Last week was a sign of that. The stock should see a continuation on the upside. Godfrey Phillips is also a ‘buy’, with a target price of Rs 800 and a stop loss of Rs 700."

16,2018-10-19,Bajaj Finserv,"Heavy selling pressure since the morning kept the bulls out of the scene on Friday, leading to an over 1 per cent drop in the benchmark Sensex and Nifty amid subdued global cues. 

The 30-share BSE Sensex closed 463.95 points, or 1.33 per cent, down at 34,315, while the 50-share Nifty declined 149.50 points, or 1.43 per cent, to 10,303.

On the other hand, HPCL, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC gained between 1.50 per cent and 4 per cent.

Let’s walk you through the key highlights of the session: 


Rs 1.60 lakh cr investor wealth gone
Freaky Friday’s selloff wiped off Rs 1.60 lakh crore of equity investors’ wealth, as market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms declined to Rs 137.04 lakh crore from Rs 138.64 lakh crore.


This aviation stock flew high
Shares of Jet Airways rallied over 5 per cent after

Why RIL plunged 4% played spoilsport
Shares in Reliance Industries (RIL) skidded over 4 per cent even after the company reported record second quarter results on Wednesday. Company’s heavy debt and a delay in the $5 billion petcoke gasifier project disappointed investors. The refining-to-telecom conglomerate posted a record consolidated quarterly profit of Rs 9,516 crore, driven by growth in its core petrochemicals division and consumer businesses of telecom and retail.

Q2 earnings impact

UltraTech Cement: Shares of Ultratech Cement plunged over 3 per cent after it reported a 10.87 per cent fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 376.82 crore for the July-September quarter on account of increased energy and logistics costs.

17,2018-10-21,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: The week gone by induced further pessimism in the market, as the benchmark indices saw deep cuts amid concerns over financial health and liquidity crisis in the NBFC sector, rising oil prices and a fast weakening rupee.

The BSE Sensex dropped 417.95 points, or 1.20 per cent, for the week to settle at 34,315 on Friday, while the Nifty50 tanked 168.95 points, or 1.61 per cent, to end at 10,303. Friday’s selloff wiped off Rs 1.60 lakh crore of equity investors’ wealth.

Even some solid earnings numbers from blue chip firms like Reliance Industries and Infosys failed to lift the mood. Sustained capital outflow has created a gloomy atmosphere, dealing a body blow to risk-appetite. Every rise in market is meeting with a wave of profit-booking. Overseas investors have pulled out roughly over Rs 20,000 crore from the domestic markets so far in October.

Going into a new week, things do not look any better. Going by analyst observations, here is a list of factors that will influence market movement next week.


Liquidity and NBFC issuesA perceived liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) has made investors wary despite a slew of measures from the government and RBI to address the issue. After the IL&FS crisis, even the slightest indication of problem in an NBFC has led to a selloff. “RBI is trying to inject liquidity, but confidence needs to be restored in the system to ensure that it continues to function,” Sudip Bandyopadhyay, group chairman, Inditrade Capital, said in an interview with ET Now. “If the liquidity crunch is allowed to continue unabated, it may lead to solvency issues and that will be disastrous. We will have to see how that gets handled over the next 10-15 days,” he said. The efficacy of RBI’s decision to relax liquidity norms and allow more bank lending to NBFCs will be assessed in the coming days. 


F&O rolloverOctober series futures and options will expire on Thursday and rollover of positions will dominate proceedings through the week. “Friday's data showed maximum Put open interest was at 10,000 followed by 10,200, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,600,” said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. “There was meaningful Call writing at 10,400 followed by 10,600, while Put writing was seen at 10,200 followed by 10,100. The option band signified a trading band between 10,200 and 10,500 levels. On Friday, Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,314 with a loss of 1.24 per cent,” he said. F&O rollovers may increase volatility in the market.


Rupee remains a big worryThe rupee settled 29 paise higher at 73.32 against the dollar on Friday, amid selling of the US currency by exporters and foreign fund inflows. The domestic unit has been on a bumpy track of late owing to unstable crude oil prices, a stronger dollar, capital outflow and rising bond yields in the US. The rupee will remain a key factor to watch in the coming days. 


The course of crude oilCrude oil prices rose in international markets on Friday. Brent crude futures rose 49 cents to settle at $79.78 a barrel amid a surge in demand in China. The market is now focussing on US sanctions on Iran, which will come into force on November 4. Crude has a direct impact on the rupee’s health and ultimately it influences the mood of the market, as higher crude oil prices raises worries of a spike in current account deficit and fiscal deficit, distorting country’s macroeconomic mathematics. As per RBI estimates, every $10 a barrel rise in oil price reduces country’s GDP growth by around 0.15 per cent. 


Key Q2 earnings aheadThe earnings season is on in full swing now. ITC, Asian Paints, Adani Ports, Ambuja Cements, Kotak Mahindra Bank, YES Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Wipro, HCL Tech, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are among the heavyweights that will release their September quarter numbers during the week. The earnings numbers have been mixed so far. Any positive surprise should prove a booster dose for the market. 


ECB’s rate decisionThe European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday amid chaos around Brexit. While no change in monetary policy is expected as of now, the ECB will have to calculate the risk that Brexit poses to eurozone economy. “Brexit is the big elephant in the room for the euro area’s economy. A lot of people are trying to guess the nitty-gritty of interest rate increases that are still about a year out, but are ignoring one of the region’s key economic risks,” Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J Safra Sarasin in Zurich, told Bloomberg. 


Global macro-meterThe Bank of Japan’s core CPI will be out on Tuesday. The US new home sales report for September will be out on Wednesday. Besides, markets will closely watch third quarter GDP growth numbers of the US on Friday. On the same day, data on US’s real consumer spending will also be released. Italian budget will also be in focus this week. 


Technical outlook weakOn the technical charts, the bears appear on the driver's seat. “As per the weekly timeframe chart, Nifty has formed a negative candle with a long upper shadow, which indicates a sharp negative reversal from the recent highs. The weekly RSI is also sending out negative signals,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. Technical indicators still show more scope of downside, though in between a short bounce cannot be ruled out. The support for Sensex/Nifty during the week is seen at 33,350/10,000 and resistance at 35,100/10,550. Bank Nifty would have a range of 24,150-25,860, said Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher."
18,2018-10-23,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finserv on Tuesday posted a marginal 0.83 per cent rise in profit at Rs 704.01 crore for quarter ended September 30. The NBFC had posted a profit of Rs 698.20 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for the various financial services businesses under the Bajaj group.

In a regulatory filing, the company said, “Rising interest rates and default by a large financial institution in September resulted in difficult conditions for NBFCs. Despite this, Bajaj Finance Ltd produced its best ever quarterly profit after tax while recording a 38 per cent growth in its Assets Under Management. BAGIC and BALIC have also recorded strong growth in their core businesses; however, losses from floods in Kerala affected the profit after tax of BAGIC.”

BAGIC and BALIC stands for Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company, respectively."

Century Textiles, UltraTech Cement: Thursday’s voting for the merger of Century Textiles’ cement business with UltraTech could be far from a routine round of balloting, with a section of the minority shareholders likely to express their displeasure due to what they believe is rather inadequate compensation for the former’s plants.

22,2018-10-24,Bajaj Finserv,"It was a deluge of a different kind. India's biggest institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) found itself in the middle of a major stock churn in the September quarter.

To bring in some perspective, the said quarter was also marked by heightened volatility over the IL&FS default crisis. 

LIC, which holds stake in over 320 companies, was seen reshuffling its portfolio heavily in financials, healthcare, oil & gas, chemical and information technology sectors, shareholding data for the September quarter suggests. 

Close to 30 companies caught LIC's fancy during the quarter gone by. The insurance behemoth raised its stake in auto majors Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki to 6.45 per cent and 6.55 per cent, respectively, from 6.40 per cent and 5.76 per cent in the preceding June quarter. 

LIC also upped exposure in TVS Motor to 1.75 per cent from 1.12 per cent during the same period. However, it offloaded some shares in Bajaj Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra, according to data available with ACE Equity till October 23. 

BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty plunged over 6 per cent in September even though for the quarter both the indices gained around 2 per cent. 

The insurance company also bought additional shares in select public sector banks, including Allahabad Bank (to 9.90 per cent from 9.89 per cent), Bank of Baroda (to 3.86 per cent from 3.18 per cent) and Indian Bank (to 1.89 per cent from 1.82 per cent). On the other hand, it slashed stake in Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Vijaya Bank and YES Bank during the quarter under review. 



In the oil and gas space, it scooped up additional shares in GAIL, BPCL, Chennai Petroleum and Oil India for the quarter to September. 

Among FMCG majors, LIC further increased its holdings in Britannia Industries, Gillette India, Hindustan Unilever and Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Healthcare. However, it sold some shares of Colgate-Palmolive and Nestle during the quarter under review.

Piramal Enterprises, OFSS, Wipro, Blue Dart, Tata Consultancy Services, Crisil, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle, General Insurance Corporation of India, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation and Grasim featured among companies where LIC increased its holding during the quarter under review. Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have plunged over 65 per cent in 2018 so far.

On the other hand, NTPC, Tata Power Company, Peninsula Land, Bata India, Arvind Ltd, National Aluminium, Larsen & Toubro, Sun Pharma, Merck, Cipla, REC, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Rajesh Exports, Voltas, Pidilite, Chambal Fertilisers and Seshasayee Paper & Boards are a few where LIC reduced stake in July-September."
21,2018-10-24,Bajaj Finserv,"E-commerce companies, Amazon and Flipkart, are now offering their customers instant credit of up to Rs 60,000 and 'No-cost EMIs', subject to terms and conditions. 

If you were avoiding a big ticket purchase due to cash crunch and are tempted to avail this facility, before you sign up, here are the details of the offers from these companies.


Pre-requisites
In order to know the amount of credit/loan you are eligible to take under these 'instant credit' offers, you have to undergo a KYC process. 

Earlier KYC process mandatorily required Aadhaar and PAN details. However, the Supreme Court in its recent landmark judgement on use of Aadhaar has disallowed use of Aadhaar data by private firms. Queries as to how the e-commerce companies were asking for Aadhaar post this judgement were emailed to Amazon and Flipkart. While Flipkart has not responded to them on email, Amazon has said that, ""Complying with local regulations is a top priority for us. In compliance with the Supreme Court Judgment, our lending partners have stopped Aadhaar based new registrations and are in process of seeking clarifications on means to do KYC as per the ruling."" 

Once KYC process is done, it will let you know if you are eligible to avail these loans and how much you can borrow. There is no pre-requisite of having a credit card to avail these offers. However, you are required to provide your bank details in order to repay the loan.


EMI tenure options
Both e-commerce companies are offering this credit under EMI plans of four different tenures, i.e., three, six, nine, and 12 months with zero down-payment. Additionally, Flipkart also has a 'Pay later next month' option for those customers who do not want to repay the amount through EMI. Under the 'Pay Later Next Month' option, the customer is required to pay the amount by the 15th of the next month. Information about these offers has been gathered from the mobile apps of these platforms, a press release and emailed replies from Amazon.


No pre-payment option
According to the FAQ sections of the mobile apps, Flipkart does not have the option to prepay the loans. On the other hand, Amazon Pay EMI provides the capability to pre-pay outstanding loan amount, at any point of time.

Let us have a look at the terms and conditions of these options.


Amazon Pay EMI option
You can only avail this facility via the Amazon app. Amazon Pay EMI is available to selected customers only therefore, at present not all customers will be able to avail this facility. 

Under the credit offer, you can only buy one item at a time, with a minimum value of Rs 8,000. You can make multiple purchases using this credit. You cannot avail it on exchange offers or on instant bank discounts.

Currently, this facility by Amazon is available with debit cards/net-banking of six banks which are - HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Canara Bank, Citi Bank, Axis bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

The interest rate charged on the loan taken by you will be communicated to you on the payment page depending on the EMI plan chosen by you. ""The interest rate charged on these EMI plans is 18 percent, ""says Vikas Bansal, Director, Emerging Payments, Amazon India.

According to FAQs mentioned on the app, Amazon can run promotional offers with no-cost EMIs, which will be communicated on the payments page. According to terms and conditions of the scheme, the interest on Amazon Pay EMI will be waived off for the said customer. The scheme will work as a no-cost EMI offer. Read on to more about 
how a 'No-cost EMI' works.

The item you are buying using the instant credit facility should not be from the restricted product list. The restricted list includes jewellery, gift card, Amazon pay balance top-up, products from Amazon Global store, and Kindle e-books.

The repayment of your loan will start from fifth of the second month after the month in which the purchase is made. For example, if you bought the product in May, then your first EMI will start from the July 5. The date cannot be changed. To repay the loans, you are required to provide your bank/debit card details. Rupay cards are supported for auto payment setup.

If you miss any payment or delay the payments, penalty will be levied on you depending on the overdue amount and number of days past the due date.

*DPD refers to Days past due date of repayment as mentioned on the Amazon App


Flipkart 'Cardless Credit' option
On the similar lines, Flipkart is also offering 'cardless credit' to its selected customers. After the KYC is done via Aadhaar based OTP, you will know the maximum amount of loan you are eligible for. Here also you cannot use credit facility to buy gold and jewellery.

According to FAQs section of the Flipkart app, there is no minimum order value to avail the cardless credit. However, the EMI option will only be available for purchases of at least Rs 3,000. The interest rate charged on credit varies between 14 per cent and 25 percent, as per the Flipkart app.
On missing a payment or delay of payment, a late fee of Rs 200 or 3 per cent of the total due amount is charged, whichever is higher, as per FAQs answered on Flipkart app.

However, Flipkart did not answer our questions regarding criteria for selecting customers for 'cardless credit' option, repayment process, and the date on which EMI will start and if the date can be chosen by the customer as per his convenience. These questions, including request for verification of above information, were emailed to them more than a week ago but remained unanswered till the time of publishing this article.


Should you take it?
Remember, instant credit or no-cost credit offers, where available, are likely to come either with minimum value or/and other conditions attached. Consequently, the interest cost of the credit may be actually recovered by not giving a discount on the product which you may otherwise get if you buy the product from other sources or by paying the cost upfront. Before buying a product on these EMIs, check whether it is available for a lower price on other shopping platforms and offline too.

Before you avail the credit facility on the online shopping platforms, it is important to make a visit to your local shopkeeper as well. These days even local shopkeepers have tied up with various financial institutions such as Bajaj Finserv, Capital First and others. Compare the cost of the product and EMI you are likely to pay online and offline before taking any buying decisions in this festive season."

23,2018-10-25,Bajaj Finserv,"ET Intelligence Group: After the recent sharp fall in stock prices, valuations of nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs) look attractive once again. But investors need to be selective. NBFCs with strong parentage, prudent practices and efficient return ratios can be considered for long term investments. However, housing finance companies may take some more time to stabilise and therefore analysts advise investors to avoid them until clarity on their asset quality and liquidity emerges.

The stocks of Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, M&M Financial Services, and Shriram Transport Finance have fallen by 23-27 per cent from their respective three-month peak prices. Housing finance companies (HFCs) including Can Fin Homes, Dewan Housing Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance, and PNB Housing Finance reported an even sharper drop of 35-72 per cent.

Falling liquidity or availability of funds and doubts over the quality of loan assets has intensified the current turmoil in the NBFC sector. “FIIs (foreign institutional investors) have been in the selling mode for the past few months whereas domestic banks and mutual funds have turned cautious while lending to NBFCs. This has reduced liquidity thereby making it difficult for NBFCs to rollover their short term borrowings,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities. According to him FIIs have been net sellers in seven out of ten months in the bond market and sellers in six out of ten months in equity in 2018.

The situation may not improve anytime soon according to some industry trackers.

“Low liquidity has increased the default risk Also, sub-par underwriting by some of the NBFCs in the past will likely increase credit risk. The turbulence will continue for at least six months,” said Dhananjay Sinha, head of research, economist and strategist, Emkay Global Financial Services.



The sharp fall in prices has resulted in cheaper valuations for majority of the NBFCs. But, experts caution against getting caught in a valuation trap.

“Valuation multiples become secondary when sentiments are low and liquidity in the financial system dries up. What becomes important while deciding potential investments is to evaluate companies on the basis of their parentage, their corporate governance history, ease of fund flow, process efficiency and availability of talent,” said Jasani of HDFC Securities.

Emkay prefers Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Cholamandalam Finance, and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services from the NBFC pack.

In case of housing finance companies, experts say investors should wait and watch for signs of recovery before making fresh investments.

“Housing finance may take a little longer to recover given the liquidity crunch, asset-liability mismatch, heightened competition with aanks and questionable asset quality,” said Jasani."
24,2018-10-26,Bajaj Finserv,"Sharekhan has a buy call on Bajaj Finserv with a target price of Rs 6,500.

The current market price of Bajaj Finserv is Rs 5,314.95.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Bajaj Finserv price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by Sharekhan:

Modest operating performance: In Q2FY2019, Bajaj Finserv (BFS) posted modest numbers overall. Though the lending business’ performance was satisfactory, profitability of the insurance subsidiaries -Bajaj Allianz General Insurance (BAGIC) and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance (BALIC) weakened. Consolidated income from operations grew by 25.9 per cent y-o-y to Rs 5,065 crore while premium and other income increased by 9.2 per cent y-o-y to Rs 4,632 crore. Net profit remained flat at Rs 704 crore, rising by just 0.8 per cent y-o-y.


Lending business continues to outperform: The lending subsidiary Bajaj Finance (BFL) posted strong numbers, with net interest income rising by 41.8 per cent y-o-y to Rs 2,729 crore. Net profit jumped by 54.3 per cent y-o-y to Rs 923 crore. Assets under management (AUM) grew at a healthy 38 per cent y-o-y, driven by, a 44 per cent y-o-y rise in consumer B2C loans; a 32 per cent rise in the mortgage lending business and a 38 per cent y-o-y growth in commercial loans. Asset quality remained healthy, with a gross non-performing asset (GNPA) of 1.49 per cent and a net NPA (NNPA) of 0.53 per cent.


Outlook: BFS is an attractive play on the long-term structural theme of financialisation of savings in the economy. We believe that in Q2, one-off events such affected business, which need to be seen in perspective. Events such as the Kerala floods affected the insurance business, but we expect it to normalise in the medium term. We expect BFL to maintain its loan book trajectory in the medium term. BAGIC is expected to continue clocking healthy operating metrics and profitability going ahead. BALIC focuses on strengthening the life insurance distribution channel and the protection business, which would add to margins in the long run; the life insurer has seen its persistency ratio improve and has a healthy solvency ratio, both of which are positive.


Valuation: We expect BFL to maintain its growth momentum. However, as the current environment for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) has turned challenging, with asset quality pressures clouding the sector outlook is likely to be an overhang on BFL in the near term. For BAGIC, profitability is expected to normalise in the medium term. The life Insurance business would see a shift towards the high-margin protection business. If, however, the equity markets come under pressure, a slower growth in unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) could stretch the road to recovery. Considering the above, we maintain our Buy rating on BFS with a revised price target of Rs 6,500."

27,2018-10-29,Bajaj Finserv,"Mumbai: Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) reported a strong quarter of operating performance with net profit rising 25-30 per cent in the three months to September, driven by robust loan book growth and steady asset quality despite headwinds in the shape of floods in Kerala and an across-the-board increase in interest rates.

Yet, the next half of the financial year is expected to be challenging. Industry expects growth to slow down in the third quarter given the liquidity squeeze following the default by IL&FS. Margins are likely to be crimped as cost of funds goes up.

Funding is expected to become expensive for companies dependent on the debt market, with relatively shorter duration financing sources. Also, companies are likely to focus on less risky asset classes and conserving liquidity.

In the second quarter, Mahindra Finance said its net profit more than doubled, aided by improvement in asset quality. L&T Finance reported a 66 per cent increase in net profit due to higher interest margins and growth in retail book. There has been a contagion effect of IL&FS and mutual funds are assessing the balance sheets of NBFCs closely before they start lending again. “Within NBFCs, well-run business models with stronger balance sheets, and prudent risk management practices will emerge stronger,” Edelweiss said in a recent report.



Bajaj Finance reported a 54 per cent increase in net profit in the second quarter, with assets under management growing 38 per cent. The company focused mostly on shorter tenor loans, and is looking to cut longer-tenor commitments.

“We have had a very conservative and robust approach to liquidity,” said S Sreenivasan, chief financial officer at Bajaj Finserv, the holding company for Bajaj Finance. “We may slow down the long tenor loans that are a smaller proportion at the NBFCs. We had raised Rs 20,000 crore in 2017-18. We maintain a (strong) cash position in the company.”

On an incremental basis, most NBFCs have seen the cost of borrowing increase by 20 basis points to 100 bps from the last quarter. Companies have passed on the increase in costs.

“Our internal understating is that the company will continue to grow 20 per cent, while we have grown in the last two years a tad faster - 30 per cent- plus - on the loan book side,” said Ashwini Hooda, deputy managing director, Indiabulls Housing Finance."
26,2018-10-29,Bajaj Finserv,"The stocks from the 2014 and 2015 list have fared remarkably well. Both the portfolios have massively outperformed benchmark indices. Atul and Vinati Organics, featured in the 2014 portfolio, have been standout performers. While returns from Shriram Transport Finance and KPIT Technologies have been moderate, the aggregate return from the 2014 portfolio has been dragged down by two stocks—Gateway Distriparks and McLeod Russel. 

The former has been under pressure owing to lacklustre operating performance amid muted container volumes. McLeod Russel has been selling off its tea estates across states in a bid to pare down its debt, which will also bring down its total production capacity.


2014: Outperformed the market by a good margin
 
From the 2015 list, Finolex Cables, Bajaj Finserv and Coromandel International have delivered stellar returns while Axis Bank and Apollo Tyres have seen tepid gains. Redington India has not performed as per expectations with its mobility business showing weakness.

2015: Delivered almost twice the benchmark returns
 
Stocks from the 2016 list have also shown mixed results: Exide Industries and Voltas have seen healthy appreciation while Finolex Industries, Cholamandalam Finance and Schaeffler India have clocked single digit returns. CARE and PI Industries have disappointed. 

The weak credit growth on the back of slowdown in private sector capex has hurt CARE’s revenue. PI Industries has witnessed some margin pressures and weakness in global agrichem market has hurt its custom synthesis and manufacturing business. However, analysts remain positive on the stock due to its robust order book and strong product pipeline.


2016: Two stocks dragged down overall performance
 
Last year’s portfolio has taken a hit amid the overall market downturn. Dewan Housing Finance and Repco Home Finance have been caught in the eye of the storm around NBFCs. 

Both banks and mutual funds have turned cautious on lending to NBFCs in this environment, making it difficult for them to roll-over their existing short-term borrowings. Analysts expect housing finance companies to take some time to stabilise as liquidity conditions are likely to remain tight.

28,2018-10-30,Bajaj Finserv,"Any fall in crude oil prices is definitely a benefit for OMCs but it is better to go for Reliance rather than the state- 
  

owned ones, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, tells ET Now. Also, Choksey remains confident on Cipla, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finserv as well as HDFC Life and would like to add these in a corrective downside.  Edited excerpts: 



Would you buy ICICI Bank and Axis Bank?
A few things have gone favourably in case of ICICI Bank. They are sitting on liquidity. They have got a shot in arm by buying the assets of NBFCs which is helping them to create a lending portfolio and at the same time, help in deployment of funds and bring clarity about the earnings. 

The third important aspect is that NCLT-led proceedings are helping most of the banks at this point of time. Given the scenario in which NCLT auctions are happening, a lesser haircut would working very positively for banks in general and some of the banks in particular. 

From all those perspectives and given the kind of valuation at which ICICI is quoting currently, one feels confident about the protection on the downside, as a result of which there could be a buy opportunity. However, the market is not very certain at this point of time

There are strong headwinds. Global markets are definitely bothering us because funds are being withdrawn from the system currently, particularly by those ETFs operating out of the country. As far as the market upset is concerned, that is where one will have to be a little bit more careful in adding stocks into the portfolio. Do not go aggressive, go gradual in your buying approach at this point of time.


Would you recommend buying anything at the current levels?
We have been selective about looking at the area and we found insurance is one area where we felt confident. At the same time, it is the life insurance business which is showing a higher traction. You are finding higher amount of growth coming into the new business premium collection and as a result, these companies are showing the CAGR possibilities of around 20% plus in their businesses. 

Given that kind of situation, the insurance business remains a favourable pick at this point of time. HDFC Life with the current embedded value to EBITDA and Bajaj Finserv with the insurance twins in their portfolio are also attractively positioned, given the growth and valuations. I would think that this is an opportunity to buy into some of the quality stocks in insurance basket, also some NBFC companies which have been affected because of the sentiment in the market.

But their books are really qualitative and we like companies like Bajaj Finance in this particular space and we like to hold this company. 

Selectively, we also find some of the auto companies demand merit. Both Maruti and Bajaj Auto are looking interesting. If there is a soft Brexit and if China starts helping Tata Motors, it could be seen as attractively positioned. Ashok Leyland has a good order book. BS-VI regulations are coming into play from next financial year. This is where companies like Ashok Leyland should be favourably looked at. So, yes, we have been selectively looking at the companies. I mentioned some of the names. We find they are attractive enough to consider them into the portfolio.


What is your view on OMCs?
Any fall in crude oil prices is definitely a benefit for OMCs and the kind of cut that they have been asked for would to a greater extent get neutralised with the fall in the oil prices. I have not got the exact calculation right now with me but I believe if we have a $10 fall, then you can easily absorb the excise cut that the government had asked for. 

In this kind of situation when the government start dictating to the oil marketing companies which are public listed companies, it is not in keeping with good corporate governance spirit and is bad for retail shareholders. So, I am a bit unhappy about it. 

I do not think that in a sector where the government intervention is regular, a ) company would demand or command higher amount of valuations. The oil marketing companies are going to be victim of this kind of situation. We have been keeping our views reserved on this subject and we have been saying that OMCs are a safe bet to avoid and that is where we are validated today. 

A better focus should be with likes of Reliance where you have larger clarity because of their ability to export their petroleum and refining products. That is where Reliance could be a better choice rather than the state OMCs.


Give me a flavour of your top three holdings.
Currently, we are invested in some of the pharma companies. The portfolio carries weight in the Cipla kind of companies, We are confident that this company would have relatively better time in the coming six months where some of the new products will get launched. You will have a better visibility of revenue coming in from their side. This is one company we are most confident about. 

The other company where we are confident now is Bajaj Auto after price correction. We believe that the company is playing its strategy right. They are systematically using their balance sheet with Rs 15,000 crore cash in the portfolio to command this particular market share. 

This company is positioning itself very well with exports and the three-wheeler, four-wheeler portfolio that they have. In the next 12 months, they would have the electric vehicles in the form of three-wheelers, four-wheelers and two-wheelers. The stock is appearing really interesting from investment perspective. 

Bajaj Finserv which I mentioned earlier, is another favourite. We continue to like the insurance businesses and that is why we put higher weight on Bajaj Finserv and HDFC Life. 

These are the few stocks which we hold in the portfolio and we would like to add in the corrective downside if the market gives further opportunity."
0,2018-11-18,Bajaj Finserv,"‘Unstoppable’ is the term that can be used for non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, whose shares have rallied 1,318 per cent, the most in the largecap space, in last five years.

This break-neck rally shrugged off everything, from a painful downturn in domestic equities since February 2018 to a major demand slowdown in the economy that pulled down India’s GDP growth.

With more than 20 per cent holdings by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and over 7 per cent holding of domestic mutual funds, the scrip turned out to be the apple of the eye for big investors.

There were many factors at play throughout.

Net profit of the company grew over 40 per cent annually (CAGR) during these five years, while return on equity jumped to 22.60 per cent in FY19 from 19.60 per cent in FY14.

The company’s bottom line expanded to Rs 3,995 crore for the financial year ended March 2019 from Rs 719 crore in 2013-14. JM Financial projects 54.80 per cent profit growth for Bajaj Finance in FY20 and 30.10 per cent in FY21.

Despite a challenging business environment in FY2019, Bajaj Finance signed off the year with 41 per cent growth in consolidated assets under management (AUM) and a 60 per cent expansion in consolidated profits. The company’s cost of fund increased by about 5 bps in FY2019 over FY2018.

“Bajaj Finance (BAF) has a strong risk management framework with a large client base and best practices in terms of measures in keeping strong asset quality confidence. In a declining interest rate regime, BAF has strong pricing power and is better placed to tap growth,” JM Financial said.

Of late, a couple of developments drove the share price to its all-time high of Rs 4,277 on November 6 despite a slump in India’s economic growth rate due to consumption slowdown, which has dampened demand for consumer durables also.

On October 22, Bajaj Finance posted a 63 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,506 crore for the quarter ended September 30. The figure stood at Rs 923 crore in the same period of the previous year.

Net interest income of the country’s largest consumer durables lender grew 48 per cent to Rs 3,999 crore from Rs 2,708 crore in Q2 FY19.

Meanwhile, the company raised Rs 8,500 crore by issuing over 2.17 crore equity shares at an issue price of Rs 3,900 to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Going by reports, BlackRock, Nomura, GIC of Singapore and others lapped up these shares.

Majority of analysts are still bullish on Bajaj Finance. The stock had six ‘buy’, five ‘outperform’, seven ‘Hold’, one ‘Underperform’ and one ‘sell’ ratings as of November 15, data available with Reuters showed.

Brokerage Antique Stock Broking on October 23 gave a ‘hold’ recommendation on Bajaj Finance with a price target of Rs 3,960.

“Bajaj Finance has created one-of-its-kind customer franchise and the journey keeps on getting better with newer products, newer geographies and newer delivery mechanisms. Using its size to its advantage, both on borrowing cost and cross-sell front, operating leverage benefits can continue for longer than we expect.” It said, adding that the current slowdown in the economy could have a rub-off effect on the NBFC and any major price corrections should be looked as opportunity to build long term positions.

With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 55 times, shares of the company are looking dearer against their five-year average of 38.60 times. P/E is a valuation ratio that measures the company’s current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS).

Yes Securities on October 22 gave ‘reduce’ rating to Bajaj Finance.

“In the medium-to-longer term, we expect Bajaj Finance’s AUM growth to gravitate towards 30 per cent YoY considering a large asset base and sustained deceleration in few products. The flexibility in cost structure and rising digitisation in loan origination and collection will help the company in delivering a tight cost/income ratio. Despite assuming an elevated credit cost in FY20 and FY21, we estimate Bajaj Finance to report 45 per cent earnings CAGR over the next two years and an average RoA and RoE of 4.5 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. Valuation is lofty at 6x FY21 P/ABV,” the brokerage said.

Following in the footsteps of subsidiary Bajaj Finance, group holding company Bajaj Finserv (up 777 per cent) stood the second-biggest gainer among the bluechips in last five years. It was followed by Britannia Industries, Biocon, Pidilite Industries, Titan and Reliance Industries which advanced 200-300 per cent between November, 2014 and November, 2019."
1,2018-11-19,Bajaj Finserv,"We have revised our price target for Bharti Airtel upwards to about Rs 440 and we think that the next couple of years are going to be extremely positive for Bharti, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The telecom sector is in trouble but the Bharti stock is up 52% in the last one year. What is your view?Telecom stocks particularly Bharti has really shot up. There are two or three factors behind this entire rerating and up move. One is that definitely there is a possibility of the government giving some kind of a moratorium to the telecom companies on the payment of the Rs 28,000 odd crore AGR dues that they have to pay to DoT. 

Secondly, sanity returns as we are hearing the news that both Vodafone and Bharti would consider a price hike. We do not yet know the quantum but when you see a price hike after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it. 

Most importantly, for a company like Bharti, there is an under-ownership both at the retail and institutional level because of the issues that they were grappling with. There could be a sense of urgency as far as some of the institutional investors are concerned to own stocks like Bharti. 

So, a combination of these factors are playing out. We too have revised our price target upwards to about Rs 440 and we think that the next couple of years are going to be extremely positive for Bharti.


What is happening in Glenmark?We have seen that people have turned positive selectively in the pharma stocks, either because of some revival in the US business or the fact that even the domestic market for some of these companies is huge and after the price controls, we have seen some kind of a stabilisation. We have seen some pharma companies including Sun Pharma, Divi’s Lab and Aurobindo Pharma all going up. 


When you see a price hike in telecom sector after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it.-Hemang Jani
As far as Glenmark Pharma is concerned, the stock has gone up in the last couple of days but our view has been that because of the kind of debt that they are sitting on and the fact that whatever guidance the company had earlier given in terms of growth, the actual performances have been far lower. Recently we have booked out of Glenmark Pharma so we would be more comfortable buying into a Divi’s Lab or a Cipla or a Biocon.


What are you reading into the aviation data? Finally, a positive tick has come in for October as domestic passenger traffic has grown by roughly about 4%. Would you still avoid aviation or could one buy into these stocks?When we look at the aviation sector what has really surprised me is that despite the fact that there are only two or three meaningful players, the growth has come off. Overall, because of Jet moving out of the system and the fact that the market share has gone to Indigo and maybe SpiceJet and Go. We are not able to see any meaningful performances either from Indigo or SpiceJet, even when crude prices are at a more reasonable level. 

Also, post Jet, the prices had really shot up. Insane pricing was prevailing both for the domestic as well as international market. Even when the best of the situation is there in the pricing and crude oil prices, if these companies are not able to report any worthwhile performances, then you know what is the point of trying to give them any sort of a valuation or why would one really want to go for those companies? My sense is because of certain season coming in, you might see good data points etc. but operationally none of these companies have been able to demonstrate the ability to grow EBITDA on a sustainable basis. That keeps us away from the airline space for a while.


All insurance stocks are going higher but nobody is able to tell me why at a time when the private insurance or growth numbers have declined from 20 % to 7-8%, these stocks are rising and how! SBI Life is 76% higher in last one year, ICICI Lombard 50% higher in last one year and ICICI Life , 40% higher in the last eight months?There is a preference for the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) where one can really look at a structural growth story. In terms of the growth rates having come down, I agree with you but given the fact that we have gone through so much of pain for some of the banks and particularly PSU banks and NBFCs, the investors have preferred companies where there is a non-funding exposure. 

Of course, when you look at the insurance sector per se -- be it life or general insurance space -- there is definitely a case for a significant growth from here on and typically the business model of insurance is such that initially for about five years, companies do not make profit, but after that, there is a significant ROE that one can really expect. 

Most of the companies have gone through that curve plus a lot of M&A 2 has happened. This sector overall looks quite promising. We as a house have a preference for an HDFC Life and Bajaj Finserv, because these are the two companies where we are seeing much higher visibility and much better pedigree of promoters etc. We would continue to be positive on those names."

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week highs were Accelya Solutions India, Agro Phos India, Alkem Laboratories, Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, Dynemic Products, Dr. Lal Path Labs, Sirca Paints India and Visesh Infotecnics.

Benchmark NSE Nifty index was trading 17.80 points up at 11,902.30 while the BSE Sensex was trading 75.40 points up at 40,359.59. 

Overall, 22 shares were trading in the green in Nifty50 index, while 27 were trading in the red.

In the Nifty 50 index, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Cipla and Tech Mahindra were among the top gainers. 

While Zee Ent., TCS, UPL , M&M and Vedanta were trading in the red."
4,2018-11-19,Bajaj Finserv,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."

5,2018-11-20,Bajaj Finserv,"BENGALURU: Fintech company Lendingkart Technologies has announced two key senior appointments as part of its continuing strategy to grow services and outreach - Mohit Bajaj as chief financial officer for the group’s NBFC arm, Lendingkart Finance, and Bharat Aggarwal as the senior vice-president of operations. 

With extensive industry understanding and strong past experience, Bajaj and Aggarwal will further aid the company’s vision of growing its geographical footprint, leadership team, and enabling financial inclusion for MSMEs across India. 

“With the fintech industry and the emerging entrepreneurship spirit in the country growing at a rapid pace, it is becoming increasingly important to fuel this progress and build an exceptional team that will support us in fulfilling our commitment towards empowering MSMEs,” said Harshvardhan Lunia, co-founder, Lendingkart.

Bajaj has spent a considerable amount of time at Media Guru as their group chief financial officer. With an experience of over 17 years, he has also worked with Religare Macquarie Wealth Management, Fullerton Securities and Wealth Advisors, Actis Global Services, Fortis Healthcare, and Dixon in varying capacities. He specialises in corporate finance, business planning, investor relations, treasury management, core accounting and diverse industry verticals.

6,2018-11-26,Bajaj Finserv,"BENGALURU: Bajaj Auto, the world’s third-largest motorcycle company, has invested $8 million (about Rs 57 crore) in bicycle and electric scooter rental startup Yulu. 

As a part of the deal, Bajaj is also going to manufacture customised electric scooters for the Bengaluru based startup. The Rajiv Bajaj-led company, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 92,615 crore, will also consider facilitating the vehicle finance needs of Yulu, through its financial services arm Bajaj Finserv. 

“At BAL, we believe that the two factors of congestion reduction and pollution control will drive the segment of shared micro-mobility in the future. That coupled with the expansion of Mass Rapid Transport System like Metro in large cities will further boost the demand for flexible last-mile connectivity,” said Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, said.

Yulu plans to increase its fleet size to 100,000 electric two-wheelers by December 2020. It currently has a fleet of 15,000 vehicles. The Bengaluru-based company claims to do between 30,000-35,000 rides a day, of which 12,000-13,000 comes from its electric scooters.

In June, Uber partnered with Bajaj Auto to launch UberXS, a new category of rides on its platform using quadricycles called Qute. Interestingly, Uber has also partnered with Yulu, where users can book its vehicles using the ride-hailing major’s app.

“Shared mobility is an ecosystem play. We started working with cities, corporates and citizens to solve for safe parking..metro authorities to solve for public transport..on the private mobility side we partnered with Uber...same way as a part of the ecosystem we needed an OEM, that is where Bajaj comes in,” said Amit Gupta, chef executive of Yulu, said.

Yulu is a dockless, lithium-powered scooter focusing largely on the sub-5 km first- and last-mile connectivity, the same market which Ola backed Vogo and Sequoia, Accel backed Bounce are targeting. 

This also comes at a time when investor interest in two-wheeler startups have continued to remain strong. In 2018, two-wheeler startups raised $2.6 billion across 67 rounds globally, 2019 year-to-date, the number has touched $2.1 billion across 52 rounds to date, according to data collated by Tracxn.

“In the Indian EV ecosystem, electric two and three-wheelers will be the first form factors to scale rapidly,” Anand Ayyadurai, chief executive of Vogo Automotive, which competes with Yulu, told ET. Separately, Bounce, also a leading player in India’s still-nascent mobility space, is also piloting with a fleet of 1,000 EV scooters."

0,2018-12-04,Bajaj Finserv,"Value investing is all about selecting stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values. Besides, when value investing is coupled with the strategy of selecting stocks based on how cheap or attractive they are with respect to broader indices, it adds a solid edge to such investing as it gives better view of valuations.

Among schemes that follow this strategy, conservative investors can consider investing is Tata Equity PE. The scheme’s fund manager Sonam Udasi selects 70% of the stocks in his portfolio that quote at price-to-earnings multiple (trailing) lower than that of the Sensex. The remaining 30% is invested in companies, which may quote at price-to-earnings multiples higher than that of the Sensex, but have higher earnings visibility and attractive return ratios. This strategy has worked for the scheme’s performance. The scheme has given 14% and 22% returns in the past three- and five-year periods, while its peers have given 10% and 18% returns during the same period.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers Sonam Udasi and Amey Sathe have stuck to their conviction bets, which strictly follow the value investing theme. These companies are Coal India, Bajaj Finserv and ITC.

1,2018-12-06,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Key stock indices had a terrible time on Thursday, taking their losing streak to the third straight day, derailed by a global selloff.

Weakness showed up almost everywhere. Asian shares plunged on fears of a flare-up of tension between the US and China after the arrest of a senior executive of Chinese company Huawei at the request of the US.

European STOXX 600 index skidded 1.8 per cent to its lowest level since December 2016, according to a Reuters report.

FII outflow went on unabated as the RBI poured cold water on any hopes of a special liquidity window for NBFCs in its fifth bi-monthly policy meet on Wednesday. 

Investors avoided fresh bets and sold across sectors to avoid further casualties ahead of state election results.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell in sync with Sensex, closing 1.54 per cent and 1.36 per cent down, respectively.

Nifty forms a Bearish Marubozu candleThe Nifty breached its 200-DEMA and formed a Bearish Marubozu candle on the daily chart. The index has been making lower highs and lower lows for the last three sessions, and on Thursday broke two crucial supports of 10,777 and 10,650 levels."
2,2018-12-11,Bajaj Finserv,"As if Diwali was not enough, the seduction starts again in December. Flipkart claims its offers har na ko haan mein badal de. Amazon too will make sure Christmas comes early this year and continues into the next.

Splurge on half-priced electronics or shoes. Kitchen and home appliances will be shipped to you at a 75% discount, with free installation thrown in. You can also ‘claim’ a fancy iPhone or Apple Watch at the special shopping fest or simply ‘grab coupons’ and spend at the ‘carnival’ that in any case, will be offering bargain basement prices.

And in case you missed the fine print, certain credit cards will also give you cashbacks.

In reality though, these bumper selloffs are becoming a round-the-year phenomenon.

Over the course of your average workday, you streamed your chosen music and got credits into your account when you used an e-wallet to pay for those downloads. A gourmet meal ordered over an app came with mouth-watering cashback offers and your movie ticket was bundled with free snack options. All the mobile data you consumed for all of this was also free. You only paid for some premium offerings such as live TV or a Netflix subscription. Actually, pretty much every transaction, including buying your next car from a suburban auto dealership, came at a far lower cost than the rack rates.

Some call it habit creation, others mind mapping. Some dismiss it as a race to the bottom that first burns cash and then businesses all together. Yet, fast fashion, groceries, pharma retail, ride-hailing, financial services and even fine dining have huge discounts, subsidies or teaser payment plans that have changed the rules of engagement forever.

Traffic too is getting exponentially bumped up as is penetration beyond the top 8 metros.

In January-August, fashion etailers recorded a spike of 417% in orders during special sale events that lasted for 26 days in those eight months, says a 2018 report, How India Buys Fashion Online, by ecommerce solutions provider Ace Turtle.

Flipkart alone clocked $1-1.1 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) in five Big Billion Days, up from $660 million last year. Clearly, deal-drunk consumers — many of whom are stepping on to the consumption ladder for the first time — aren’t complaining about this great discount bazaar.

“It’s great for consumer psychology. That is how they tell themselves they are smart buyers,” feels Abraham Koshy, professor of marketing, IIM-Ahmedabad.

“Seasonal discounts have always been there,” says Sanjiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Finserv, a retail-focused non-banking finance company. “It’s just become more obvious because of large scale advertising by major brands, online marketplaces and their fight for growth.”


Winner Takes AllSome businesses in the aggregate economy — financial services, ecommerce or travel — thrive on scale and make money only after. “There is no fun and no point in building small scale profitable businesses in the technology space. We know that in the long term, costs and power to reduce prices on the supply side will be so much that we can pass on those discounts in the future,” Flipkart cofounder Sachin Bansal told ET recently.

For them, short-term discount is a kind of marketing cost to drive volumes. How short that short term should be will depend on market size. Drawing parallels with WhatsApp, Bansal argues that it doesn’t make money and has started monetising after reaching a billion users. “That’s how you build large businesses.” Food tech or ecommerce are still to reach that inflection point.

The sources of capital chasing these cash machines are also doing so to support market leadership and domination, which they believe will eventually turn into a bonanza.

Paytm, for example, is serving about 20,000-plus pincodes and gives discounts to first-time users. “They are an important factor for a company to expand scope,” feels Amit Sinha, chief operating officer, Paytm Mall. “Most people shopping online for repeat items want discounts. This isn’t always the case for lifestyle and fashion products. Less than 50% of our products are discounted.”

Discounts do win brownie points but it’s temporary. First-time users are arguably not loyal. Travel site ixigo spends less than 1% of funds on ads and repeat loyalty is high. With over half the population not connected and only about 100 million transacting users, it’ll be at least another 4-5 years until it’s a 100% customers market.

“If discounts create irreversible customer behaviour, it’s alright. But if they don’t, maybe it’s not (necessary),” Sriharsha Majety, cofounder, Swiggy, admitted in an earlier chat with ET. “There should be value for consumers. How we do it, discounts or otherwise, (it doesn’t matter).”


Singe, Burn and CharIt actually does. Remember what happened to Snapdeal when it tried to edge past Flipkart with unplanned freebies? It simply sank.

“If one ecommerce company gives a discount, the other follows suit. That is a race to the bottom. Companies put up an average product experience,” says Sandeep Murthy, partner, LightBox VC, early investor in InMobi and InfoEdge.

That is exactly what happened to TaskBob last year. The Ivy Cap-backed home services company was unable to increase margins. Hyperlocal grocer PepperTap, which shut shop in 2016, was losing cash on every order because of discounting. TaxiForSure, Runnr or MorningCart — all consolidated and were acquired by larger players such as Ola, Big Basket or a Zomato.

The madness spirals out of control when two well-capitalised balance sheets compete. And after a brief hiatus of two years, venture dollars are once again back in the game, only more. Thus, even players such as Zomato that refrained from discounting are now playing the game while expanding into adjacencies such as logistics and events.

For those dependent solely on competitive pricing, it’s getting impossible to jump off. Take telecom, for example. Reliance Jio Infocomm shook up tariffs right from its 2016 launch. Today, mobile internet rates have plunged as much as 93% and usage per consumer surged over 25x in the three years to 2017, as per government data.

Peers Airtel and Vodafone Idea retaliated in kind. They slashed prices and started bundling value added services such as time-bound subscriptions to Amazon Prime and Netflix. “The customer thinks freebies and discounts are great. They are, but only in short run, as service quality, investments and innovation will all suffer,” warns Balesh Sharma, chief executive, Vodafone Idea.


Only those with cheap sources of capital (SoftBank) or aligned with strategic players (Walmart) can sustain monthly cash burn of $30-40 million. Both Amazon and Flipkart are bleeding, with Amazon’s losses mounting to Rs 6,287 crore even after infusing Rs 25,090 crore just in its India marketplace. Combined losses for the two Flipkart entities — Flipkart India and Flipkart Internet — were also well over Rs 3,200 crore in FY18.

“Clearly, for well-funded big boys of ecommerce, profits can wait, but discounts and cashbacks can’t,” says Kishore Biyani, founder, Future Group. “The honeymoon will end soon as someone else is paying for the discounts and equity investors are willing to take the losses. In the long term, a business cannot be built on price or discount strategy.”

In this survival of the fittest, pricing mechanisms work differently. Retailers offer advertising space, cash discounts, sponsorships or different incentive schemes to get a better price. Some share discounts with large brands. Often, brands take a hit on unit level margins but try to offset with volume share.


Pay Me and ChillSome like Netflix are the outliers, having completely opted out of discounting and instead choosing a premium subscription model.

Last month, its chief executive Reed Hastings ruled out lowering its subscription in hypercompetitive India. The company has three pricing tiers in India. “It’s true that YouTube is free, Amazon is basically free and cable is extremely inexpensive because it’s ad-supported. To some degree, that creates a consumer expectation,” he said. But he added that the cost of Netf lix in India was “like 2-3 movie tickets a month, but you get to watch a lot more.”

Some such as OTT platforms Hotstar and Zee5 are ‘freemium,’ where only the exclusive content stays behind paywalls. Tarun Katial, chief executive, Zee5, agrees with the Hastings hypothesis when he says quality products, not mere discounts, build markets. “The breadth and depth of our content bouquet give us the confidence that our customers derive utmost value,” he explains.

For such players, strategic partnerships are another key focus area, enabling expansion and more viewers. “Our partners help in creating multiple touch points along with expansion of our user base through nontraditional avenues,” says Katial.

In food tech, logistics players such as Swiggy are actively seeking out payment partners. Swiggy is running eight cashback deals through partners to promise more discounts when peers move to a subscription-based model.


Unit Economics MatterThere are also industries that believe this party will not go on forever. With self-drive cars, the average ticket size is quite high at about `4,000 per transaction and overall supply, quite constrained. “So you don’t see much focus on discounts or heavily subsidised product offerings. This gives better margins to companies than in businesses such as traditional ecommerce or food delivery,” says Greg Moran, chief executive, Zoomcar. Moran believes business type decides discounting. “For us, there’s more trust in the digital ecosystem in 2018 than 2015. That’s probably the major difference.”


The Future of DiscountsNeeraj Roy, managing director, Hungama, which has various streaming services, has a unique take on unit economics of online businesses.

He says that by 2023, there will be 500 million Indian consumers who should be willing to pay about Rs 100 a month for entertainment. This could come in the form of micro-transactions, potentially adding up to Rs 60,000 crore a year. “This is equal to the size of the entire broadcast industry as it stands today and five times the size of Bollywood right now. This `100 transaction is extremely doable… Investments they have made should yield by 2023,” says Roy.

Recent reports peg India’s online shoppers at about 30 million, projected to increase to about 200 million by 2025. Based on an estimated lifetime value of customers, “these businesses calculate ideal cost of customer acquisition they should incur. In this, they often factor in the deep discounts they offer,” says Swati Bhargava of cashback website CashKaro. (See survey graphic)

“The idea is that price is marketdetermined and will stabilise at some point,” adds Pradeep Dadha, founder, Netmeds Marketplace. Sectors where discounts reign supreme certainly can’t last forever. Ride hailing is a perfect example. Uber and Ola have been consistently increasing prices of late, whi le growth has slowed. Certain industries simply have different demand and supply curves and freebies cannot be uniform.

But even in today’s feeding frenzy, some notice a slight change in buying-selling behaviour. “Pricing initially drove traffic but now, ease of discovery, convenience and accessibility are big influencers. The pendulum has swung from the seller to the buyer,” argues Nitin Chabbra, chief executive, Ace Turtle. “So even if there was a 5x spike in volumes, our survey shows the delta between average discounts on non-sales and sales day is a mere 3 percentage points – from 50%, it came down to just 47%.”

Still, there are many with the gumption to focus on profitability while fending off well-funded gorillas. Their moats matter and though they too are chasing growth, it is through bettering their products, brands and user experience and making it difficult for others to replicate. “Not everyone has to chase 10x growth,” quips Karthik Reddy of Blume Ventures. “There are many who will create decent-sized consumer companies even with 2-3x growth. As long as the market supports you, you know you are on the right path.”

Specialised sub sectors have always been relatively easier to manage and scale up. There are enough examples — be it furniture, fashion, eyewear, mattresses or early morning delivery platforms. “Segments are opening up where growth is not crazy and they have arguably better aggregate capital deployed because they can be built more efficiently.”

Some would still insist today’s burn is for posterity. “You are burning $3-4 billion today but creating infrastructure, logistics and changing consumption habits forever. Nobody questions Mukesh Ambani on why he spending over $25 billion on Jio. They are creating a backbone they can milk for the next 2-3 decades,” argues a founder whose company has just recently joined the rarified unicorn club. “Ambani’s refining business is his cash cow. For SoftBank, it’s their stake in Alibaba or Vision Fund’s petro dollars. But for the moment, every consumer is benefiting. Then who are we to play God?”

3,2018-12-12,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks soared for the second consecutive session on Wednesday, as the major unknown of state elections got over, the government appointed a new governor for RBI and there were signs of thaw in US-China trade relations.

Investors appeared to have cheered the appointment of former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das as RBI governor and hoped that the new governor would address some of the pain points such as relaxing the Prompt Corrective Action framework and other stiff rules that had stifled the financial system.

India Inc gave a thumbs up to the appointment of a seasoned bureaucrat as new RBI governor, and several industry leaders said his experience in handling economic affairs will play a critical role in dealing with various issues at the central bank.

These and other factors pushed the Sensex 629 points, or 1.79 per cent, higher to 35,779, while Nifty jumped 188 points, or 1.79 per cent, to close at 10,737.

5,2018-12-15,Bajaj Finserv,"The domestic equity market ended the week in the green on better-than-expected macroeconomic data. The BSE Sensex advanced 289 points, or 0.81 per cent, for the week to end at 35,962 on December 14, and Nifty gained 111 points, or 1.05 per cent, to 10,805.

The market kicked off the week on a pessimistic note after assembly poll results in five states showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity may be on the wane. However, sentiments turned positive after Asian Development Bank (ADB) retained Indian growth forecast at 7.3 per cent for this financial year and at 7.6 per cent for FY20. 

On the economic front, industrial production measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) surged to an 11-month high of 8.1 per cent in October against 4.5 per cent in September 2018 and 1.8 per cent in October 2017. Retail inflation cooled to a 17-month low of 2.33 per cent in November from 4.88 per cent in the same month last year. 

Here is a look at the stocks and sectors that created buzz in the market through the week. 


Fortis Healthcare: Shares of Fortis Healthcare posted its biggest intraday fall in over 8-1/2 months on Friday after the country’s top court put its sale to Malaysia's IHH Healthcare on hold. The scrip closed 6.75 per cent down at Rs 141.65 on Friday.


IndianOil: State-owned Indian Oil Corporation on Thursday announced a buyback of 3.06 per cent equity shares at a price of Rs 149 per stock for a consideration not exceeding Rs 4,435 crore. The buyback decision was taken by the company's board meeting held on Thursday. The stock closed nearly 3 per cent higher at Rs 141 on Friday.


YES Bank: The private sector lender remained under pressure as market participants awaited the outcome of board meeting on Thursday. The the bank said the ‘Search & Selection Committee’ (SSC) and the board are “on track” to complete the CEO selection process within the stipulated timeline given by RBI. The stock advanced 8.58 per cent to Rs 180.35 on BSE for the week ended December 14.


@fresh 52-week highs/lows: In the BSE500 index pack, PVR, Ipca Labs, Wipro, Colgate-Palmolive, HUL, Muthoot Finance and Line India scaled fresh 52-week highs during the week, while Tejas Network, IL&FS Transportation, Orient Cement, Inox Wind, Bajaj Corp, Va Tech Wabag and Oil India hit 52-week lows.

Bandhan Bank: Shares of the lender hogged limelight after the Reserve Bank allowed the private bank to open new branches. The scrip jumped nearly 13 per cent to Rs 533 on December 14 from Rs 472 on December 7.


Sectoral update: Among the sectoral indices on BSE, the BSE Auto index gained 4.50 per cent during the last five sessions, followed by Consumer Durables (3.40 per cent), Oil & Gas (3.40 per cent) and FMCG (2.70 per cent) indices. Other indices also ended the week in the green.


ADAG stocks: Shares of Reliance ADAG companies hogged limelight on Friday after the Supreme Court said it didn’t find any wrong doing in the procurement of the 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from France. Shares of Reliance Naval and Engineering closed 16.34 per cent higher at Rs 16.59.


Hero MotoCorp: Shares of the two-wheeler major advanced nearly 10 per cent in last five sessions. Hero MotoCorp gained traction on planning to launch a new fully faired motorcycle. This new motorcycle will be powered by the 200cc motor seen on the Hero Xtreme 200R. This will be Hero’s fourth motorcycle based on its 200cc engine platform. Of the four, the Xtreme 200R has already been launched while the XPulse 200 and the XPulse 200T adventure bikes will be launched in early 2019. Moreover, in an interesting possibility, the new bike might carry the Karizma tag.


Bajaj Finserv: The scrip rallied over 5 per cent during the week. Most of the financial stocks rallied last week on expectations that the new RBI governor would announce steps to ease liquidity, amid worries that shrinking liquidity will hurt their earnings. According to reports, the new governor could adopt a more lenient stance on liquidity issues the NBFC sector is facing. Besides, possible interest rate cuts and softer monetary policy, both will benefit NBFCs."
6,2018-12-17,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Around 25 stocks fell to touch their 52-week lows on NSE in Monday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows were Amtek Auto, Damodar Industries, Healthcare Global Enterprises, IL&FS Transportation Networks, Rolta India and Tara Jewels.

Raj Rayon, Nagarjuna Oil, Gayatri Highways, Gitanjali Gems and Viji Finance also featured among the stocks that touched 52-week lows on NSE.

On the other hand, Hindustan Unilever, NRB Bearing, PVR, Vinati Organics and Proseed India were the stocks that hit their fresh 52-week highs today.

Domestic benchmark index NSE Nifty was trading 60.20 points up at 10,865.65 while the BSE Sensex was trading 254.73 points up at 36,217.66. 

In the Nifty 50 index, Tata Motors, PowerGrid, Vedanta , Wipro and ICICI Bank were among the top gainers on the NSE. 

However, Bajaj Finserv, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Kotak Bank, Infosys and Hero MotoCorp were among the top losers in the Nifty index."
8,2018-12-19,Bajaj Finserv,"The year gone by clearly did not belong to equities. And equity mutual funds are heading into the year-end, looking like jilted lovers.

With the benchmark indices looking on course to end the year with below 5 per cent return, this asset class suffered a severe blow during the year, especially over the past three months, as it reeled from a weak rupee, crude price volatility, liquidity woes and political concerns.

Returns from most of the top stocks held by mutual funds do not paint a pretty picture either. Out of the 20 top MF holdings, most of which are largecap stocks, 16 fell over 30 per cent between August 29, the day Sensex hit its all-time high level, and December 11, and 40 per cent on a year-to-date basis.

Sun Pharma topped the list, with a 30 per cent fall during this period. The scrip has declined more over the past three weeks following allegations of insider trading.

SUV and tractor maker M&M, comes next, falling some 21.48 per cent, while Maruti Suzuki and Bharti Airtel trailed with a loss of 17.15 per cent and 15.39 per cent, respectively. 

On a year-to-date basis, Airtel is down 40.09 per cent and Maruti 20.28 per cent. While Airtel continues to nurse the wounds inflicted by Jio’s disruptive entry, Maruti has taken a hard knock due to weak operational outlook in recent months led by rising fuel prices, increase in financing rates, a weakening rupee, and high input costs.

Even among other, last year’s high-flier Bajaj Finserv is down 11.76 per cent, NTPC 10.96 per cent, Tata Steel 11.29 per cent, Reliance Industries 12.21 per cent and Vedanta 8.34 per cent between August 29 and December 18. Bajaj Finserv and Reliance Industries are, however, up 17.40 per cent and 23.39 per cent, respectively, on a year-to-date basis. 

ITC, GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have lost 11-3 per cent since Sensex’s August high point.

HDFC gained 0.15 per cent, and its twin HDFC Bank 2.79 per cent.

The only other stocks besides the HDFC twins that managed to gain marginally were L&T and ICICI Bank; the latter mainly due to the steady bounce ever since the private lender named new CEO.

Everyone else’s pain due to a weak rupee resulted in gains for IT stocks.

No wonder then, equity largecap funds have gained just 2.68 per cent for the year. Pharma, multi-cap, ELSS, value-oriented and infrastructure funds have delivered negative returns on an average, dipping 1 per cent to 17 per cent. Schemes focused on overseas stocks gained 1.66 per cent. Technology stood out as the only oasis for mutual fund investors this calendar, as tech funds delivered double-digit returns over last one year.

But among specific IT stocks, Infosys and TCS, which figured among top 20 holdings of top mutual funds, are down 4.40 per cent and 3.30 per cent, respectively, since August end.

Vidya Bala, Head of Mutual Fund Research, FundsIndia, said largecap funds -- except for 2017 -- have underperformed benchmark indices for the second time in a row. Largecaps and multicaps together have struggled while funds in the midcap space have arrested the decline much better. 

""Funds that took a cautious view in 2017 have managed to contain the decline much better in 2018,"" Bala said, adding that the lacklustre show in the largecap space is attributable to sluggishness in a majority of stocks.

Thankfully, SIP investor sentiment appears unperturbed by this depression and continued market volatility. Monthly SIP inflows remained strong at Rs 7,985 crore as of last available dfata and the industry added over 1.5 lakh new investors in November, alone. 

""Retail investors showing remarkable maturity by staying invested in markets, in spite of the volatility
over the last few months,"" said NS Venkatesh, Chief Executive, Amfi. He is confident of more inflows to mutual funds over the next year.

“We are hopeful many more investors will choose mutual funds as their preferred option to grow wealth next year too,"" Venkatesh added.

Outlook for domestic equity for the next calendar is mixed, thanks to worries of a possible growth slowdown, political tension in the runup to the general elections and many global headwinds seen on the horizon.

JM Financial says earnings expectations from India Inc remain elevated for the midcap and smallcap indices, and thus, it continues to prefer largecap stocks."

9,2018-12-27,Bajaj Finserv,"Slow and steady may not quite win the startup race. In 2009, when Bipin Preet Singh and Upasana Taku founded MobiKwik, it was the first independent, digital-only payments startup. Surprised? If one were to guess, you thought Paytm was the first, a common misconception considering the SoftBank and Alibaba-backed company boasts 200 million-plus users at present.

And while FreeCharge is part of Axis Bank and PhonePe is with Flipkart, MobiKwik — which should have led the pack — has just watched rivals scale or become part of larger companies.

Now, it’s trying to reinvent—away from digital payments and into financial services such as loans, mutual funds (MFs), insurance, wealth management et al. “We want to be a digital bank without the overheads of being a bank,” says Singh, who missed out on a payments bank licence.

Since start, the Gurgaon-based startup has raised around $120 million from a long list of marquee investors that include Sequoia, Amex, Cisco, South Africa’s Net1 and Bajaj Finance. The last name on the list picked up 12.6% late in 2017 and is often seen as the one that will eventually acquire the digital payments startup — though both companies deny it at present.

Ganesh Mohan, head of strategy, Bajaj Finserv Group, says, “Our equity position in MobiKwik is primarily intended to ensure we are a strategic investor and agendas of both organisations are aligned.” Mohan sees the investment as “an important capability investment” and will stay invested at a level “that ensures continued engagement from both sides.”



BRUTAL COMPETITION
While MobiKwik looked to build on digital transactions, global players like Google Pay — riding on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) — literally ran away with the market, given a large and sticky user base and attractive cashbacks. In fact, after Google Tez (later renamed Google Pay) launched in 2017, UPI transactions saw hockey stick growth. In a few months, Google had over 10 million transacting users. A month later, Paytm started UPI payments and in April this year, WhatsApp rolled out its beta version for payments. Any hope of competing with global majors means deep pockets to retain users (via cashbacks) and abide by the expensive physical know-your-customer (KYC) checks mandated by the regulator.

MobiKwik is looking like an also-ran. “It doesn’t have an anchor like others,” says a former honcho of the startup, who did not want to be named. “It missed the bus. Users will do one wallet KYC and not multiple. They’ll have one fintech app and not multiple. MobiKwik will be acquired.” However, the startup is now looking beyond the high-volumes, high-risk and high-cash burn digital payments business.


SWIMMING WITH THE SHARKS
The positive in lending, insurance, financial products or wealth management is the low market penetration. But the biggest negative for MobiKwik may be well-entrenched players such as banks, startups it failed to compete with in mobile payments, others such as PolicyBazaar and a host of fintech companies.

Vivek Belgavi, leader, fintech, PwC India, says, “The top five to six payments companies are diversifying into third-party products. There’s a huge uncovered market — penetration for insurance is less than 5% and for MFs, less than 2%. Product innovation will be key. Can you give a loan to a roadside vendor?”

The easy business has been taken –keeping costs and non-performing assets low is the key now. Abhishek Agarwal, cofounder and chief executive, CreditVidya, says, “Digital players are more tech-savvy than traditional banks. Their cost of customer acquisition is low and this is where they score over banks. However, they do face monetisation challenge.”

But can the MobiKwik couple compete? The answer to that unicorn-sized query rests on how it plans out the transition and goes about becoming the must-have financial services app. Or even gets just 15-20% of its claimed 100 million-plus user base to transact regularly, as Singh sees it.

“Both founders are hard-working,” says the former MobiKwik executive quoted earlier, “But lacked aggression at the start unlike Vijay Shekhar Sharma of Paytm. Now, with global players also in the market, the founders’ lack of risk-taking ability could prove an Achilles heel.” No doubt, Singh and Taku face the most testing time of their nine-year-old startup.


BEHIND THE SCENES
Taku is the finance pointsman. She worked at PayPal in the Valley and launched the payment platform in several European countries. She also did a stint with HSBC in the US. Singh has nothing to do with finance. The engineer, who has worked at chipmakers Freescale, Nvidia and Intel, is the brain behind the MobiKwik platform.

The duo met at a friend’s party at a time they were both looking to ‘start up’. Within six months, MobiKwik was born. It was a critical advantage, as in the next six to 12 months, Sharma started Paytm and Kunal Shah cofounded FreeCharge, a platform to prepaid recharges.

For the first three years, MobiKwik was bootstrapped. It got to a million users before Sequoia invested. That was also the time the founders got married. They established roles — Singh is the techie, responsible for the app’s nuts and bolts, user experience, building new use cases and capabilities while Taku is the business person responsible for financial partnerships and acting chief financial officer (till they hire one).
MobiKwik users form the big use cases of recharge, bills payments and peerto-peer (P2P) payments. UPI, launched around demonetisation, made such transfers easier and attracted global companies, making user acquisition tougher domestic firms.

But as Singh, who answers most of the questions, says, “Our focus is not to build something to burn cash. When you do that (like in payments), you have to keep raising capital and if you are unable to raise, you have to sell out. There’s no other end to that and that’s not where we want to be.”

Payments is important to attract users but stickiness means banking largely on cashbacks. To monetise users, MobiKwik is betting on financial services. “Penetration of credit, insurance, wealth management is less than 10% in India. Even if we get 12-15% of users to access financial services from our platform, we will be able to make a big and profitable business,” Singh explains.

Gold, loan against securities, insurance, mutual funds and wealth management services are among products MobiKwik is selling or planning to sell now. It claims to have processed loans, with a total value of close to Rs 350 crore. Funds come from non-banking lenders such as Bajaj Finance. “We deal only with triple-A rated companies which don’t have liquidity issues. We offer 3-12 month loans, for which interest rates can be 20-40%,” says Taku.


CHASING THE MICRO MARKET
MobiKwik is betting on the fact that large banks aren’t interested in chasing people for loans below a certain income level as customer acquisition costs are higher. MobiKwik believes 50-60 million Indians seek loans of, say, ?15,000-25,000, for an emergency spend or a mobile phone. “We are going after people with relatively smaller incomes, who are not (currently) served by the right size loans,” says Taku.

Harsha Razdan, head, consumer markets, KPMG India, says, “To compete with digital payments platforms, traditional banks are moving online and providing an omnichannel experience, while diversified digital payments players are targeting micro and small entrepreneurs.”

MobiKwik does it all on the platform; it doesn’t run call centres or have employees to complete a loan process. It claims to sell 10,000 policies a day. MobiKwik is working with Bajaj, ICICI Lombard and has recently introduced a policy where a user can get Rs 1 lakh coverage for Rs 20 — for accident or death. “We target users who may not be able to pay Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000 a year premium,” says Taku.

Unlike insurance aggregators that offer a choice of policies, MobiKwik only offers one after analysing user needs. “The more choice you offer, the more confused is the buyer. We are able to offer tailormade products depending on needs,” she adds. Lending is now 20% of its business, insurance has just started. For wealth management, MobiKwik acquired Mumbai-based Clearfunds, with around $40 million assets under management, in October.

But Bajaj Finance is key to ensuring this model works. In fact the two will play to each other’s strengths. Bajaj was born of traditional, offline financial services. MobiKwik is helping them get their customers on digital platform. Some 40% of Bajaj customers are already using MobiKwik, claim the founders, for loans, recharging wallets and P2P transactions. The idea is to offer a digital bank-like experience to these ‘credit-tested’ users.

Mohan of Bajaj says, “The partnership enables a digital frontend for our customers. We intend to have 10 million of our customers using the app by March 2019.” Besides, MobiKwik wants to make itself relevant for more traditional banking services users. “In India, there are 30 million credit card users and more than 500 million debit card holders. That’s the physical world which will go digital,” says Singh.

According to Mahesh Makhija, leader, emerging technologies, EY India, the ecosystem in India could become like China, where startups like — WeChat, AliPay, PingAn — sprung up to cater to daily cash needs across various categories of users.



SECOND TIME LUCKY?
But can MobiKwik make a business of financial services, a space already looking crowded? “Digital credit is very tough. It doesn’t work on cashbacks. You have to compete on user experience, technology, partnerships models with lenders etc. That’s something we have built in the past year. We don’t believe credit will be a winner-takes-all model; it will have multiple players,” says Singh. The company has a 2019 target to be profitable —with 200 million users, of which at least 10% transact regularly. “We will be a full-stack fintech platform with no other distractions like m-commerce (Paytm has it) and very low cash burn. That’s the aim,” Singh clarifies.

While chalking out a blueprint, the startup lost key executives. For the CFO’s position, the founders are looking for a tech-savvy executive who can be a leader parallel to them. “The combination is a little hard to find,” he quips wryly.

As for replacing other CXOs, the company has restructured into verticals, each led by a vice-president or senior vice president. The verticals include recharge, bill payment, insurance and loans, among others. “This way, you have the business head, product, technology, sales and marketing costs loaded in that vertical. Then you don’t need a chief business officer. I’m the overall CBO,” says Singh.

MobiKwik’s founders see regulation, not competition, as a challenge. Taku says, “ Regulatory upheavals have a significant cost. First, Aadhaar was allowed; then not. Somebody needs to take a call, let companies adapt to changes.”

So did regulation prompt the shift away from payments? “Payments by itself was never going to be profitable,” explains Taku. “The reason why Google or WhatsApp are into it is not the same as for us. Cashback-driven P2P on UPI is what they do. That’s very misleading.”

By FY19, the founders hope 12-15% of their business will come from Bajaj Finance while Clearfunds continues to grow. The challenge will be to occupy real estate on the smartphone screen — particularly middle-income customers that MobiKwik is targeting. Why would a user choose MobiKwik? Paytm is almost omnipresent while for ecommerce, users prefer the respective company platforms for cashback or reward points. There are positive like interoperability, which is helping connect with third-party users. But here again, MobiKwik faces competition. Its first-mover advantage long gone, it remains to be seen if MobiKwik can be a prime mover now.

12,2018-12-31,Bajaj Finserv,"The year 2018 was tough for most fund managers. But some of them, such as Jinesh Gopani of Axis Mutual Fund, Taher Badshah of Invesco Mutual Fund, S Krishna Kumar of Sundaram Mutual Fund and Vetri Subramaniam of UTI Mutual Fund, navigated choppy markets, stayed away from companies with poor corporate governance and spotted a few bright sectors, which helped their equity schemes perform better than others in 2018. 

This outperformance came in a turbulent year when fund managers were caught off guard as stocks of many mid- and small-sized companies halved. Also, 2018 turned out to be the third year when earnings growth and capex did not recover. It has also been a rare year when despite the Nifty gaining 3.5%, a number of large-cap schemes were unable to beat their respective benchmarks, delivering flat or marginally negative returns. Mid- and small-cap stocks fell considerably — the Nifty Midcap 100 Index lost 15%, and the Nifty Small Cap 100 index declined 29%. 

The sharp bounceback in the IT sector with TCS rising 43%, Infosys 25% and Tech Mahindra 38% due to a depreciating rupee and growth prospects caught a large number of fund managers off guard as they had gone underweight on the sector. The funds which outperformed their respective benchmarks are the ones which shunned oil-marketing companies (OMCs), pharmaceuticals and metals. These winners found safe havens in the IT space, Reliance Industries and a few private banks.


Taher Badshah, CIO, Invesco Mutual Fund

Strategy: Badshah spotted an opportunity in IT stocks in late 2017, which played well for the fund house. With PE ratios of several technology giants less than that of the Nifty, the fund manager built an early position in IT stocks Infosys, TCS, Mphasis and HCL Tech, which helped his funds in 2018. Sticking to the investment mandate of not overpaying for high growth companies and bias to large caps due to higher valuations in mid and small cap stocks helped the fund house respond better to the crash in mid- and smallcap stocks. He added Reliance, reduced exposure to OMCs and exited Maruti in the contra fund and stayed away from troubled companies, which helped his schemes come out as winners in 2018.


Winner stocks: Reliance Industries, TCS, Infosys 

Top-performing schemes: Invesco India Growth Opportunities, Invesco Midcap


S Krishna Kumar, CIO, Sundaram Mutual Fund
Strategy: Kumar benefitted by going overweight on IT and avoiding oil-marketing companies, cement and pharma. His ability to steer clear of troubled stocks, timely reduction in midcap allocation to its key scheme, from 45% to 35% along with deft stock selection helped the fund house. Despite many analysts turning positive on pharma, he continued his underweight stance and chose not to ignore FDA issues and pricing concerns. He added TCS, Infosys and L&T Technology Services early to its portfolio to clock higher returns. Also, East India Hotels and Cummins helped its portfolio.


Winner stocks: East India Hotels, Cummins, TCS, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank 

Top-performing schemes: Sundaram Large and Midcap, Sundaram Select Focus


Vetri Subramaniam, Head of Equity, UTI Mutual Fund
Strategy: Overweight IT and private sector banks did the job for Vetri Subramaniam. Sensing an opportunity, the fund manager increased exposure to mid-sized IT companies such as Mphasis and NIIT Technologies in the last quarter of 2017, which paid off handsomely. Besides, a slightly diversified exposure to specific consumption stocks such as Jubliant Foodworks and Aditya Birla Fashion has also contributed to the performance of his schemes. Adding corporate banks in the second half of 2018 helped the performance of its schemes. Long exposure to the trio — HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank — too helped his schemes perform relatively better than its peers.


Winner stocks: NIIT Technologies, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank 

Top-performing schemes: UTI Equity (Multi-cap), UTI Value Opportunities, (value)


Jinesh Gopani, Head-Equities, Axis Mutual FundStrategy: Gopani followed a strict mandate of looking at companies on the basis of transparency in communication of vision and strategy, the quality of management in terms of adhering to corporate governance (factors such as dividends to shareholders, taxes to exchequer) and how a company has performed in different markets and sectoral cycles. After looking at long performance record of such companies, the fund house has stuck to such quality companies which helped its scheme perform better than its peers. Following such a strategy scrupulously has helped the fund house bag a large number of schemes which feature in the list of best performing ones across categories.Among the new stories, the fund house benefitted from its exposure to Avenue Supermart and Bandhan Bank. And in the old and time-tested themes, it has benefited from its steady exposure to well-performing financials such as HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance and certain consumer stocks such as Pidilite and TTK Prestige.

1,2019-01-04,Bajaj Finserv,"Consumer centric stocks are moving at high valuations, but in an election year, these are difficult to avoid, says Dhirendra Tiwari, head of research (HoR), Antique Broking. He is of the view that momentum should continue in 2019 as far as Indian equities are concerned. He spoke to ETNow. 


Edited excerpts:
Is that a happy feeling that we have managed to outperform the rest of the world stepping into 2019 or is it a scary feeling that we may just fall in line?

Exactly, it is a very happy feeling because not many times we see Indian markets outperforming for the whole of the year. It's good and not scary at all. 

Overall momentum remains pretty positive and therefore, there are events during this year which can be material on the market’s performance. Yet, we are pretty constructive and momentum should continue in the rest of 2019 also as far as Indian equities are concerned.



What is your big theme for 2019? What is it that you are advising clients to be on this year?

If you look at 2018, the big theme was consumption and exports. We had FMCG, staples doing pretty well. IT sector also performed very well. One can argue that the valuations sort of moved even ahead of earnings expectations. 

We have been contemplating for the last few quarters that probably the revival investment cycle will be the theme that is going to play out in 2019-20. The overall view is that while consumption remains a decent theme for the industry whether it is a good investment opportunity, one has to be cautious as valuations are trading significantly higher than the mean and averages. Recovery in investment cycle can lead to significant earnings growth in sectors dependent on the cyclical recovery and that becomes a very interesting area to look at for 2019.



Where do you find opportunities within consumption?

In consumption, retail for example remains a decent area of growth and valuation. If you look at staples, that has probably been trading at pretty high valuations. That is an area which is a market performer for us. In consumption, one would be a little more focussed on retail than staples. 

On the discretionary side, we are sort of cautious to negative on automobiles whereas we are positive on consumer discretionaries like air conditioners and consumer electricals and the like. There are certain opportunities in the consumer discretionary space, particularly retail, consumer electrical and electronics.



Where you would spot opportunities within investment-led themes? Do you think that the government’s increase in spending on infrastructure and engineering space would lead to a greater bias in buying stocks there?
I will just give you some background here. Look at the capex part of the country, which is GFCF, gross fixed capital formation. This has three components. One is private investment, the second is government and PSU investment and third is households. We have seen the government and PSU investment is shaping up pretty well for the last couple of years whereas private investment, which is almost 40 per cent of gross fixed capital formation, has been muted. 

What we are witnessing today is increase in utilisations. There has been a reasonable amount of growth in certain key sectors like cement, steel or you can talk about certain other areas of growth like ferrous, non-ferrous and automobiles and so on and so forth. 

As the RBI has pointed out, the system utilisation levels have also gone to almost 75 per cent, which in our opinion is a threshold capacity utilisation level. We are witnessing early signs of private capex recovery and this is sort of supported by all the companies that we meet. 

If that has to turn around, I would assume that there are a lot of opportunities in the investment recovery theme place. Corporate bank becomes a big large play within that space. We like capital goods and infrastructure stocks also within that category. These two areas along with select cement companies becomes quite interesting space to look at. 


Within cement, would you stick to sector leaders or would it be a more regional bet you are taking?

Cement has little confusing state of affairs in the sense that the overall environment remains quite conducive from the demand point of view. We have seen almost a double digit growth for the past few quarters and demand will continue to be strong because of the base effect. It can go to 7-8 per cent. 

Having said that, this has also attracted a lot of capacity expansion which in our opinion is likely to keep prices in check. In cement, it's very important to see the valuation comfort. We would pretty much go with the top company, which is UltraTech, and also look at some of the companies cheaper in valuations like ACC and Ambuja Cement. 



I was also just scanning some of your other bets and I see that there is a lot of focus on financing companies especially gold businesses. Muthoot Finance is part of your list. Are you going in for bargain hunting within financials outside the very obvious high quality names like Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv in some of the beaten down names over the the last three months?

NBFC remains a concern area. The only area which has done pretty well both in terms of earnings and stock performance has been gold financing companies. That has been one of our preferred bets for quite some time. 

Muthoot Finance is one. It has been a big outperformer. We continue to have faith in that. As for rest of the non-banking finance companies, we think there may be opportunities in CV financing companies. That also remains an interesting bet. A few companies exposed to CV financing are the ones which we should look at. For the rest of it, we will have to wait for a while before we start looking at valuations and where the opportunity lies. 



Apart from the names and sectors you have talked about, have there been any large additions to your model portfolio or any changes thereof?

If you go to our previous reports and strategy, we had very significant overweight on consumer sectors, which are basically staples and automobiles. W have cut down meaningfully on these two. Consumer is now a market performer or you can say market weight and auto are slightly negative. These are key changes. 

The change has been on the positive side on industrials and infrastructure and also consumer discretionary. These are three areas where there has been an upward change. In the financial space, we continue to have a positive bias on private sector banks essentially.



What would be a big avoid for you from a valuation standpoint?

From the valuation point of view, there are two which have been the outperformers last year -- consumer and IT. If you look at all leading stocks in the consumer space whether it is Lever or Nestle or Britannia or the like, they are all trading at meaningfully higher valuation than their historical averages. That is point number one.

Second, the growth has been quite robust in the last 4-5 quarters. There can be some moderation in growth, going forward. Valuations are capturing the sustained growth that we have seen, which are largely driven by not only volume growth but also cost side benefits. If there is a moderation in growth even by 2-3 per cent, there will be some challenge to high valuations these companies are trading at. 

It is very risky to say a complete sell on this sector because this is an election year and therefore investors would like to remain protected within consumer names to some extent. To make money from these levels is quite challenging and therefore we recommend no fresh additions, hold on to these stocks. 

In the automobile space, there are weaknesses emerging on the volume and cost front. That is again an area where we think one should look cautious starting from the leader in the category."
2,2019-01-08,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj and Ashok Leyland are two important auto players one can pick up in this decline, Deven Choksey, MD, KR 
   
   
   Choksey Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


What does the Gruh-Bandhan deal mean for HDFC Ltd?
The cash generated by selling of this particular stake in Gruh Finance will leave HDFC with a higher amount of money for creating the loan book size on housing finance activity in their own books. That explains the reason for which they have generated cash. At the same time, they are complying with the RBI guideline. 

More importantly, as they are monetising this particular investment at a significantly high premium, probably at 16 times price to book value, it is giving them the advantage of building the business on their own at a relatively cheaper cost.

From all perspectives, the liquidity so generated should result in giving HDFC an edge in building their housing finance book at a faster pace This basically should be the conclusion one should arrive at. It is a good deal, probably monetised at the right time and made the best out of the investment that they made in Gruh Finance. 


Which is the one auto stock to buy in this decline?
Most of the companies have started becoming very attractive on the valuations. I am not buying these particular companies when I am putting the names across for one quarter or so. The valuations of both Ashok Leyland and Bajaj Auto are compelling along with the growth stories that they are sitting on. 

The quarterly numbers would have affected Ashok Leyland and Bajaj Auto, particularly for December. But on the whole, this is a good opportunity, given the kind of valuations at which both these companies are quoting. The underlying stories for both these companies remain very strong. 

For Bajaj, the export market is basically balancing the situation for them. At the same time, renewed focus on the entry level segment is giving them market share.

Their continued dominance on the sports segment means they are basically very strong in getting the higher margin and market share. So from all perspectives, Bajaj remains relatively more stronger. With Rs 15,000-crore plus cash in the balance sheet, it is all the more important that this company is basically remaining into the investment books. 

In case of Ashok Leyland, on the other hand, there are the electric vehicles, particularly the buses, which they are continuously executing. On top of it, commercial vehicles segment, somewhere in this particular quarter before end of March, could see a pickup in demand. From that point of view, Ashok Leyland would be an equally interesting choice. Bajaj and Ashok Leyland are two important players in respective segments.


Realty stocks have been abuzz of late. Reports are indicating that one of the proposals at the Jan 10th GST Council meeting is to lower rates to about 5% for builders who purchase 80% of inputs from registered dealers. Would this be a significant move if passed and materially change things for the real estate segment?
Yes, from a structural point of view, this is a welcome move which is coming up from the GST side. Majority of the developers would like to bring the business into the books which up till now, they have been keeping outside the books. From that perspective, this is going to be playing a major role in bringing revenue back into the companies. 

However, if asked whether it will universally apply to all the companies, my answer would be no. The pure play developers in Godrej, Oberoi Realty kind of companies probably would be relatively better off because they concentrate on project-to-project basis on a year to three-year programme. From that perspective, these companies could remain relatively more confident about taking the advantage of the GST move that is coming along. 

I am a little bit more concerned about the unorganised players particularly into the real estate space who are likely to create the undue pains in the market by way of holding the inventory.

Knocking out the inventory at a lower price would affect even the stronger companies at some point of time in fetching a better realisation. We have started seeing in the urban areas a relatively better pickup for commercial real estate and particularly on the lease basis. 

That is where you are seeing slightly better prospects going forward for the proven companies. But I would be selective. I would be selective and put my money in respective companies vis-à-vis across the sector in the real estate. 


You have a few high conviction ideas. Essentially, they are from the Bajaj Group. There is Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finserve and Bajaj Finance. None of these stocks are coming cheap and the whole theory with Bajaj Auto is the export potential but the stock has had its run?
Bajaj Auto is a strong company because they have got a different strategy as far as the entire two-wheeler space is concerned. On one side, they have entry level 100cc motorcycles which go up to as high as 700 cc motorcycles with Husqvarna and eventually Triumph also coming into the portfolio. 

All this put together, Bajaj’s own motorcycles -- KTM, Husqvarna and the Triumph -- the entire chain is giving me confidence. At the same time, they have got export base in about 70 countries. The three-wheeler, four wheeler space in which I think they are operating in the commercial vehicles are basically giving them a relative edge compared to other peers in the market place. 

At the same time, they have cash, which gives me confidence that in a rough weather they would protect themselves relatively better. Fortunately, Bajaj Auto has not had a major runup after the upside of Rs 3200. It came back again to Rs 2,600-2,700 levels. It is giving an opportunity to add into the portfolio. 

For Bajaj Finserv, which is the holding company for Bajaj Finance, they have the insurance business which is more exciting to me. In insurance business, the private sector insurance companies, particularly in the life insurance business, continue to clock somewhere around 20% plus new business premium which is similar to the growth rate which the private sector banks achieved in the period of 90s as far as the insurance business goes. 

We see this kind of a clarity for next 10 years and so we certainly buy insurance business. We believe that companies which have already matured themselves in the insurance business would probably have relatively better numbers to talk about going forward. That is why we prefer Bajaj Finance, Finserv and Bajaj Auto."

8,2019-01-21,Bajaj Finserv,"The Davos Summit is happening at a time when a lot of people believe that global growth has peaked and the figures could be revised downwards as far as global growth is concerned. It is happening at a time when there are global uncertainties in terms of trade tension. Sanjiv Bajaj, MD - Bajaj Finserv & Bajaj Holdings & Investment, Chairman, Bajaj Allianz and , VC - Bajaj Finance, talks to Supriya Shrinate of ET Now at Davos.

Edited excerpts:

Supriya Shrinate: How do you think the global economy is placed and where is India in the midst of it all?
Sanjiv Bajaj: This year the focus is again on what is called the fourth industrial revolution. The digital world is interconnected but it is increasingly polarised today and there is a greater need for a dialogue to iron out differences and find a common path. Nothing is more important than to get people to come together and discuss and that is what Davos is about.


Supriya Shrinate: Globalisation in the era of industrial revolution 4.0 is all about digitisation. How different will this wave of globalisation be than the last wave when there was a lot of trade going on?
Sanjiv Bajaj: I believe that is a developing story. Nobody clearly has the answer to that. On one hand, we have all grown up in a market economy and in a globalised economy especially after the Second World War. So, nearly 70 years of that and overall the world has gained. Unfortunately, it has not gained equally and that is what you are seeing right now. You are seeing the people who have grown significantly less than others to say that you need to carry us with you as well. 

This is a very important point. What the digital economy does is it allows for very low-cost delivery of all kinds of products and services to the last customer, which you could not do earlier. It was far too expensive and the digital economy makes the whole process far more inclusive and that is the opportunity there. That is why I am very positive of how this whole story is going to uncover but we have to wait and watch.


Supriya Shrinate: All eyes are on the big election in India this year. What has been your assessment of the government in last five years? What were the big achievements and what were the laggards?
Sanjiv Bajaj: What is important for a country like ours is to have a decisive government and one that is inclusive as well and one that can get things done. To that extent, this government has got a number of things done. On the other hand, there is still rhetoric and issues which should have not happened. We need to be inclusive. We live in a country where whether you want to be or not, it has to be an inclusive way for moving ahead. The world is telling us that in different ways, it could be economically inclusive, it could be socially inclusive, it could be religiously I am not getting into those levels of detail. I think that is very important.

The second is that because we work in a federal structure, we have to have a way for the centre and the states to work together. I am not here to take names or blame one side or the other, but the question is if all of it does not work together, the country does not progress. 

Despite all this, what we have seen with the Insolvency Code, the bankruptcy resolution, the way Aadhaar has grown, there has been tremendous progress as well over the last four or five years. I just think that we want more, we want to go from seven to nine to 10% -- double digit growth and that is possible.


Supriya Shrinate: Are agriculture and jobs the two fields where Indian industry would have wanted a lot more to happen and would these be the two big issues in this election as well?
Sanjiv Bajaj: They could be but let us also not forget that there is a very large urban young educated middle class which is also driving elections. Their aspirations need to be met as well. It is as much about rural as it is about urban now. Going forward, you need to take a look at both these issues.


Supriya Shrinate: There is a lot of chatter about how India’s fisc could expand. The government so far has been remarkably restrained about going populist. Are they going to give into that temptation finaly? There is some buzz about an agri relief package. Do you believe the markets will understand like the finance minister says that it is a rational and not a populist move?
Sanjiv Bajaj: It is always tempting to do right and expanding budgetary deficits is something that is happening the world over. So, we are just in that phase. Election time clearly ends up being a tempting time and we have always seen in the past elections also, some amount of expansion and some populist moves taking place.

But beyond that, one has to get to some fiscal discipline and that is a balance. I am not an economist and nobody can tell you what that balance is. It is something that we have to leave to the finance ministry and RBI. 

But going ahead, if India has to come close to double digit growth, we need a lot of reforms in the financial sector. Today there is only one type of bank license -- whether you call it SFB or otherwise -- they are all universal bank licenses and 95% of things are common. Now if somebody says I want to set up a digital bank just for 100,000 customers, but at a very low cost and only for those who are digitally enabled but I do not want a PSL responsibility, we should be willing to do that. 

Somebody else says that I am going to set up something just in the neighbourhood. Cooperative banks and others were something but they failed, I am talking now about private sector involvement. At the same time, I can understand that RBI is worried on fit and proper, making it public, having the right set of guidelines and if somebody does not meet that, they do not meet that but do not stop everybody else.


Supriya Shrinate: You have been largely unscathed by the NBFC crisis. There is a lot of debate on liquidity and things like that. What are the key lessons that you believe you want to share?
Sanjiv Bajaj: There are two different issues; one, there were a bunch of HFCs that were mismatched on funds and they got caught at the wrong end. They had short- term liabilities but did not have the assets. Clearly, if you have to grow. you have to match your assets to your liabilities. That is one of the first things you learn whether you are an NBFC or a bank. This is something that requires correction and RBI has taken some steps towards that. 

The second is the larger issue, why did all NBFCs, HFCs fall in value by between 20 and 40% in a matter of a few days? This is systemic risk. Today. the top 10 NBFCs in the country each have AUMs of over Rs 10,000 crore and they are responsible for 30% of incremental credit going into the system. Consumer and SME growth in this economy has been helped by NBFCs. We u need to find a way to ring-fence them. It does not mean that you are going to create the wrong incentives but why did not banks fall because everybody knows that a bank license is a secure license under RBI. RBI will open up a window for liquidity. Why don’t you do that for big NBFCs?


Supriya Shrinate: What would your prescription be for big NBFCs -- , tighter ALM?
Sanjiv Bajaj: I would say tighter ALMs but at the same time RBI opens up a liquidity window. It will probably never get used but it prevents these kind of shocks in the economy. Most of the NBFC stocks have recovered. So, somebody lost a lot of money for no reason at all in the middle.


Supriya Shrinate: On the liquidity front, there was so much of clamour for liquidity. Do you believe RBI needs to look at a special window or do you believe the worst is behind us and we do not need to do that?
Sanjiv Bajaj: No, no. That situation has passed. They need to think of this more structurally because what is an NBFC? It is a license to lend with some limitations. A bank is the same but there are some differences. Why should NBFCs be associated with shadow banking? It is real banking. This is where some fundamental thinking and rethinking is required.


Supriya Shrinate: It is said the Indian economy is a one-engine economy that grows only on consumption. What are the trends you are seeing?
Sanjiv Bajaj: Clearly, we see a pick-up. You should catch Rajiv Jain who is the MD of Bajaj Finance. He can tell you a lot more. But we are seeing that improving.


Supriya Shrinate: There is some amount of debate on high growth in retail lending and unsecured lending. Could that be leading to another asset bubble?
Sanjiv Bajaj: When you look at it from a larger perspective, the opportunity is huge and on average, the consumer is significantly at a low leverage. But there could always be pockets or particular NBFCs which are taking on higher risk. But are they pricing higher risk? Is that getting priced in the money that is being lent to them? When you go down to a macro level, this needs to be dealt at the macro issue but there is a larger opportunity. 

As you said with Bajaj Finance, over the last 10 years, we are doing this because we are focussed on the long term. We are focussed on building the right risk metrics before we lend and we keep reviewing that on a continuous basis.


Supriya Shrinate: One risk metric is that you have slowed on the loan against the property book. Is that a segment that you are wary of, a segment that you believe poses threat and risk?
Sanjiv Bajaj: Two years ago, we slowed it down for two years. Between FY 2016 and 2018, the book did not grow. We have just started growing it last year or this year. This financial year, the book has started growing. The LAP book, the incremental book, sits in our new home finance company called Bajaj Housing Finance and we are growing. We are lending month on month. 

We are being a little cautious just to see the external environment on liquidity as I said the worst is behind us. Does it pick up? We want to be careful over there not because we are seeing higher risk on the ground but we just want to make sure the last liquidity event just settles down and passes by.


Supriya Shrinate: A word on life insurance. How is that business doing? April to December outlook was good. Is that a segment here to stay in terms of robustness?
Sanjiv Bajaj: Life insurance clearly has evolved into pure protection of life but fare more importantly into both an investment product and a protection product. That is because outside of the big cities, mutual funds are still low on penetration. ULIP is a fairly simple product which gives you a little bit of both but of course, it goes without saying that you have to explain it correctly to the customer. 

We are very bullish. We have transformed our business about three years ago and from there, we are showing steady growth in the overall top line, in the product mix as well as in the productivity across the different channels. That is growing well. 


Supriya Shrinate: Any plans to list one of the two JVs?
Sanjiv Bajaj: No, because we do not need to, at this stage. As for whether we will ever list -- it is never say never but there has to be a trigger for it. Both Allianz and Bajaj businesses are profitable and very well capitalised. So there is no need to do that in the short term. Let us see thereafter.


Supriya Shrinate: There is this sense of fear among a lot of investors and Indian industry about a fractured mandate. What if it is a strong decisive government? Does one necessarily need to fear coalitions because coalitions in the past have not been bad for the reform trajectory so to say?
Sanjiv Bajaj: A decisive government clearly is a more stable government than a coalition but as you have said, we have coalitions in the past also which have done reasonably well. So let us put it this way. Decisive clearly ahead of a coalition, but whether one or the other we want one that will stay five years and that will keep focussing on what is right moving forward.


Supriya Shrinate: Whether this government gets voted back or a coalition government is formed, the reform trajectory is perhaps going to move in one direction. Are you confident about that?
Sanjiv Bajaj: I very much hope so because I see the benefits of that and I think a large number of Indians have seen the benefit of that in the last four years.


Supriya Shrinate: Do you have a digital detox day in a week or a month?
Sanjiv Bajaj: In my case I am hardly ever speaking on my phone. I drive it the way I am comfortable. I am on message, I am on email but I have not felt the need to detox.


Supriya Shrinate: Do you still put your phone next to your bed when you sleep or is in the other room?
Sanjiv Bajaj: No, it is next to my bed but it is off."

9,2019-01-22,Bajaj Finserv,"Betting on financialisation via banking and insurance companies and commercial vehicle space in auto, Deven
   
   
   Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Sun Pharma has clarified that their domestic formulations operations will be transferred from Aditya Medisales to their arm by Q1 of FY20. They have named a new auditor for subsidiary companies and they are talking about the capping on loans extended to Atlas Global as well. The company is saying they had the transfer rights to Rs 2,200-crore loans extended to Atlas Global and that no loans and guarantees were given to Suraksha Realty. Have they done enough clarification?
It was definitely expected that Sun Pharma would take corrective actions against the reservations or the observations of the whistleblower on the corporate governance side. They have taken that corrective actions and we must congratulate the company for acting fast on the subject. 

In my view, the contentious issues about keeping the arm’s length distance is now satisfied with the entire operation coming into the fold of the company itself. From that perspective, the shareholders and investors have a lot of clarity and confidence going forward as far as the operations are concerned.


Apart from Sun Pharma what are you telling your clients to buy?
The banking and insurance companies remain favourites as far as our list of buying is concerned. The life insurance business particularly has been recording good new business premium growth and valuation wise also, they are available at corrected valuations. 

SBI Life has come with higher amount of new business premium that they have collected. Similar expectations are there from HDFC Life and Bajaj Finserv’s life insurance business. All in all, we like life insurance business and we have been saying that if life insurance business shows the promise of registering a 25% CAGR growth going forward, then this is one business where you would probably see larger amount of appreciation coming in the portfolio.

What we saw in private sector banks in the ‘90s is likely to be repeated in the ‘20s as far as the life insurance business is concerned. We remain optimistic about this particular segment of the business. 

Individual banks have also been showing greater performance, Kotak has given a good performance. In spite of one vertical not doing as well in this last quarter, they still have been able to come out with better performance. Similarly, we have seen good performance from IndusInd Bank. Some of the large corporate sector banks are definitely heading for a good time. At the same time, they are likely to monetise some of their verticals which they have built over a period of time. So, we like this financialization of the banking space where they would monetise their verticals. These are some of the areas where we find ourselves comfortable. 

In auto, we like the commercial vehicle space particularly because we believe that the demand for commercial vehicles before BS-VI getting implemented would probably increase and that is where the likes of Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors the case should be, Tata Motors of course, JLR related issues troubling otherwise Tata Motors looks really convincing from the domestic market portfolio. Selectively, we are looking at individual companies, where we find the growth momentum continuing in this year as well as the year after. 


You are an evergreen bull in Reliance but if your favourite stock goes up by Rs 100 in a matter of two days despite an absence of near term triggers, is it time to book some profits?
This particular company has come up with a completely changed business proposition. In this particular quarter, the EBIT of the refining business which is their core business is in kissing distance of the other two new business consumer facing businesses; retail as well as Jio which have recorded EBIT of around Rs 3,800 plus. 

Obviously, what one is expecting is that going forward the retail and the Jio platform business could possibly surpass even the core business of refining and that is where I see a larger amount of optimism, because on a relatively smaller turnover, you are producing higher amount of profits and going forward these numbers could increase as they start implementing Jio-2 in a full fledged manner. 

Going forward one year down the line, you would see the Jio-3 version getting implemented. All this put together, suggests that Reliance’s consumer facing businesses are likely to produce higher profits. Jio-2 and Jio-3 versions in my definition is where you are having consolidation of all networks into one which is going to be Jio-2 where the ISP network, the cable TV network, the leased line or landline network and the mobile telephony network will all converge into one.

That would be the first rollout game that we will be seeing through Jio-2 and thereafter plugging the content into Jio-3,could possibly drive the data volume for the company. We feel that this is the beginning of this particular trend and that is where better times are likely to come up ahead. One could possibly trade because in the short term, the stock price has gone up but for the long- term investor, it makes sense to stay invested into the company."
11,2019-01-23,Bajaj Finserv,"DAVOS: Financial services major Bajaj Finserv's chief Sanjiv Bajaj on Wednesday said NBFCs must be subjected to the right regulations as that would give consumers greater confidence about the companies working under an effective regulatory watch.

Dismissing concerns about the financial services sector being worried over recent attempts to tighten regulations, Bajaj said the digital world is anyway changing the way business is done and a lot of businesses and innovations do not require any government or regulatory intervention anymore.

""As long as we are within regulations, for example of insurance regulator IRDAI, there is no restrictions from the government side on innovating in the way business can be done,"" he said.

He said non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have always seen lighter regulations though they have been doing 70 per cent of the work done by a bank.

""Therefore, some kind of tightening of regulations for them is not bad at all, as it also send the right message to consumers and other stakeholders about these entities are working under the right regulatory framework,"" said Bajaj, who heads one of biggest NBFCs in the country.

He said there are thousands of NBFCs in India as against just about a hundred banks and they have been working with a lighter set of regulations for a long time.

At the same time, he said, the days of 'License Raj' are completely gone as that mostly pertained to traditional businesses and anyway not many business activities require a difficult-to-get licence any more.

The country's NBFC sector has been facing a crisis of confidence following IL&FS defaulting on debt repayments late last year."
10,2019-01-23,Bajaj Finserv,"Hailing technology as a great enabler for providing the right products and services, Bajaj Finserv chief Sanjiv Bajaj on Wednesday said his company is following a 'consumer first' approach towards innovation. 

At a session on 'India 4.0: Making technology work for all' at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Bajaj said his company now provides consumer loans on the spot and that has been made possible through the right use of technology and a right approach to business. 

 ""Technology has become a big enabler for companies like ours in terms of providing right products and services to customers. 

""A typical consumer loan used to take three to four days earlier, but my company went down to the root level and found that consumers wanted to buy that plasma TV immediately to watch a cricket match or something, rather than waiting for three or four days,"" Bajaj said. 

 He said a lot of innovation comes from thinking about the consumers first and that is happening a lot in India. 

At the same session, Andhra Pradesh IT Minister Lokesh Nara said his is a new state and his aim is to make it number one in terms of per capita income and happiness. 

 He said data is being used in a big way for achieving these targets and the state is using technology as an enabler as well as a tool that can make the government accountable.

14,2019-01-27,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: December quarter earnings of heavyweights, including Kotak Mahindra Bank, ITC, YES Bank and Maruti Suzuki India, remained most dominant themes for the domestic stock mark et during the week gone by.

Global cues and crude oil’s volatility also influenced mood, but not as much as the third-quarter numbers that swung the market.

Last week, Sensex slipped 361 points or 1 per cent, while Nifty suffered a loss of 126 points or 1.16 per cent.

Volatile is likely to remain high next week, as market will try to take the Vote on Account and the expiry of January series of futures and options contracts in its stride.


Let's take a look at the key factors that will influence market mood this week:

Budget 2019: The government will present Vote on Account on February 1, which will be only for three months before the new government presents a full-fledged budget in July. Experts are expecting some populist moves by the government, especially for rural and agri-based sectors, in the run-up to Lok Sabha elections.

While this may be the last opportunity for the NDA government to woo a bigger section of society facing agri challenges, it will have to show prudence to stick to fiscal consolidation target. What may bother the market is slippage in fiscal targets.

In a report, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that the government is set to breach the fiscal deficit target yet again by 40 bps for 2018-19, and raise the target to 3.5 per cent for next fiscal.


F&O expiry: The domestic stock market may have to endure bouts of volatility as January series futures & options contracts expire on Thursday, and investors roll over positions to the February series.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,788 with a 0.74 per cent loss on Friday. On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at strike price 10,800 followed by 10,700 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900 levels.

Meaningful Call writing was seen at 10,800 followed by 10,900 levels, while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices.

The option band signified a lower trading range between 10,700 and 10,900 levels. 


Q3 earnings: Third-quarter numbers of major firms, including Escorts, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC, HCL Technologies, Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India, are expected this week. Their numbers can boost or dent market mood.


US Fed meet: The US Federal Reserve will hold its first monetary policy meet of 2019 on January 29-30. Markets across the world will closely follow whether the Fed walks the talk and an era of milder Fed rate regime begins. While the central bank forecast two more hikes for 2019, the darkening global economic outlook, convulsing stock markets and a record-long government shutdown are clouding the policy picture, Reuters reported.


The macro meter: Important domestic as well global macro prints are slated to be released this week. India's fiscal deficit numbers and infrastructure output numbers for the month of December will be out on Thursday, while January Nikkei Markit Manufacturing PMI will be released on Friday. 

Among the global economies, China's Caixin Manufacturing PMI data for January, US Nonfarm Payrolls data and US ISM Manufacturing PMI data for January are the important ones, markets will take note.


US-China trade talks: The next round of trade talks between the US and China are scheduled to take place on Wednesday and Thursday. Markets have not given up hopes of an amicable deal between the two largest economies of the world. The hope became stronger after the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there was a fair chance of a deal despite great differences between the two parties.


Brexit vote: Britain's exit from the European Union (EU) is turning chaotic day by day. The British lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal just a week ago, and now they will debate her proposed next Brexit moves on January 29. The British Parliament will also discuss alternative plans put forward by lawmakers, including some that seek to delay Britain’s March 29 exit from the EU. Greater focus will be on averting a no-deal Brexit - a scenario in which the UK crashes out of the EU with no trade agreement, Reuters reported.


Global sentiment: Tech giants Apple and Microsoft will release their earnings this week. In the wake of uninspiring numbers from tech majors across the globe, the numbers of these two company's will either darken the gloom or scatter the ray of hope in markets. 


Crude oil: Oil prices rose on Friday on concerns that the political turmoil in Venezuela may tighten the supply in the market. The opposition leader of Venezuela Juan Guaido has declared himself interim head of state and has got backing from many countries, including the United States, Canada and Brazil. The political impasse in the Latin American country may disturb the oil supply, pushing the crude prices higher. 


Technical outlook: Nifty's Friday session signalled that the bears have tightened their grip and some more weakness is in the offing as the index formed a large bearish candle on the daily chart. Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities believes the key resistance level of 10,850 is proving too big a hurdle for Nifty50 to take out. The near-term trend looks weak and the 10,700-680 range will be the next downside support to watch out for, he said."
16,2019-01-28,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Index heavyweights played spoilsport on Dalal Street on Monday, dragging the benchmarks lower by over a per cent lower. This was the second day of fall for the key indices.

Markets shrugged off favourable macro cues in the form of plunging crude oil prices and a strengthening rupee. Other Asian and European peers too slipped ahead of the crucial US-China trade talks and Federal Reserve's policy meeting.

The BSE Sensex shut shop with a loss of 369 points, 1.02 per cent, at 35,657 while the NSE Nifty came off 119 points to settle at 10,661.

Market at a glance:


Who moved the Sensex?
Among Sensex stocks, only seven advanced while 23 slipped. TCS was the top gainer, rising 2 per cent. Coal India, L&T, Power Grid and Asian Paints followed. YES Bank was the top index drag, falling 5.46 per cent. Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Hero MotoCorp and Sun Pharma slipped up to 5.40 per cent.


IL&FS fears still persist
Most of the financial stocks bled on fears of continuing exposure to IL&FS. Even housing finance companies witnessed a similar fate, with Deewan Housing Finance slipping 11.64 per cent. 


Canara profit soared, but stock fell
Canara Bank posted a 152 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 318 crore for the December quarter as against Rs 126 crore reported in the corresponding quarter year ago. However, the stock slipped 5.23 per cent in today's session.


ZEE Entertainment rebounds
The shares of ZEE Entertainment rebounded today after the company said it has reached a deal with lenders on pledged shares. The company said 96-97 per cent of the lenders have agreed not to invoke shares if the shares fall further. After the agreement, the company has not pledged further shares as collateral after Friday’s sharp fall, said CEO Punit Goenka said in an investor call. The stock closed the session 16.64 per cent higher.


Mid, smallcaps have a sob story
Midcaps and smallcaps shed nearly 2 per cent in today's session and underperformed the benchmark Sensex. Midcap index closed 1.84 per cent lower while smallcap index was down 1.99 per cent.


Sectoral view
Basic materials, healthcare and finance each shed over 2 per cent. Only IT and teck managed to close in the green today. 


Factors behind the fall


Weak global markets
Major European bourses fell, mirroring a retreat for Asian stocks as concerns over Chinese growth outweighed any boost from the tentative end to the US government shutdown late last week. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul all losing ground, according to Reuters. 


Crucial US-China trade talk
The crucial US-China trade talks are scheduled to take place later in the week and the investors have assumed cautious positions until any further announcement. 


Financial stocks bleed
Financials and bank stocks plunged the most today as fears of IL&FS default continue to plague market. IB Ventures was the worst drag in the NSE Financials index while all stocks ended in the red in the Nifty private bank index. 


Poor Q3 show
The December quarter earnings failed to impress investors and this acted as one of the major forces behind a dent in investor sentiment. Among key results, HDFC, Axis Bank, HCL Tech, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv are among top companies expected to report quarterly numbers.


Expert-take:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 
""Market slid below 10,700 mark as uncertainty over global trade negotiation and US Fed policy later this week added volatility. Any progress in US-China trade deal and a dovish view from FOMC meet amid global growth concern may provide respite to the investor’s dilemma. Additionally, weak set of earnings from auto major and selling in banks marked the tone of domestic indices.""

Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking
""Domestic benchmarks opened on a negative note with the market breadth in favour of the sellers. A majority of the sector indices were trading in the red while mid-cap and small-cap shares underperformed its larger peer. Market breadth was in the ratio of 1:4 in favor of the sellers and the market ended 1% lower. The rupee appreciated against the dollar as crude prices declined by 1.8 per cent to trade at $60.5 per barrel. The upcoming week will be crucial because of the Budget presentation, US Fed policy meet and the resumption in the US-China trade talks.""

Viral Berawala, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund
""Global markets sold post comments by the US president that another shutdown is an option if agreement with Democrats is not reached. Indian markets also reacted to this negative cues with all sectoral indices in the red with Nifty Pharma being the biggest loser followed by Bank Nifty. Markets are also worried about the government straying from its fiscal consolidation path in the interim Budget."""
15,2019-01-28,Bajaj Finserv,"Monday blues came back to haunt benchmark stock indices as the Sensex and the Nifty tanked 369 points and 119 points, respectively. 

As many as 36 stocks of the Nifty turned red. Adani Ports plunged over 12.53 per cent, followed by Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 6.51 per cent), Bajaj Finance (down 5.45 per cent), YES Bank (down 5.28 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (down 4.30 per cent).

On the other hand, some buying in Zee Entertainment, Bharti Infratel, Larsen & Toubro, TCS and Coal India capped the downside.

Here are key reasons that put pressure on domestic equities on Monday. 


Weak Q3 numbers: Subdued quarterly numbers by select heavyweights dampened sentiment on Monday. Maruti Suzuki on Friday posted its second successive decline in quarterly net profit with a 17.21 per cent fall for the third quarter ended December, also the steepest fall in nearly five years. 

India's largest carmaker said its net profit for Q3 came in at Rs 1,489.3 crore as against Rs 1,799 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.


Financial stocks bleed: ICICI Bank alone shaved off more than 100 points from the Sensex during the late afternoon trade. The scrip was down 4.84 per cent at Rs 339.80 at around 11.45 am. 

India's biggest mortgage lender HDFC, IT major Infosys and largest lender by assets State Bank of India together dragged the Sensex down by more than 100 points. HDFC and Infosys were down 1.50 per cent and 1.34 per cent, respectively, at around the same time. SBI was trading 2.37 per cent down at Rs 278.50. 

The CBI has transferred the investigating officer in the ICICI Bank case as its “discreet inquiry” suggested his role in leaking information related to searches, according to a report by PTI.


FII selling continues: Foreign investors offloaded nearly Rs 5,000 crore so far from the domestic equity markets in January and experts believe this trend will continue in the coming months as well. Prior to that, they had sold shares worth Rs 28,900 crore in October. Their net inflows stood at Rs 5,980.89 crore and Rs 3,143.22 crore in November and December, respectively.


Populist measures: Traders were also concerned with Bloomberg report stating that Indian bonds are pitted against a familiar foe: likely record debt sales by the government to finance populist measures before national elections due by May.


US-China trade talks: Uncertainties over the high-level trade talks between the US and China were another major overhang."

More to come..."
21,2019-01-29,Bajaj Finserv,"Both Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance look interesting from an investment point of view, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


What played out is that some of the quality names came off as well. While Bajaj Finance does have its earnings today, there are expectations that it is going to be a steady quarter. Should declines such as these be used by medium and long-term investors to buy into the stock? Or would you say wait it out because one does not know where this NBFC bubble may be headed?
Yesterday’s market turned bearish largely because of this particular announcement of the Cobrapost press conference coming up today in the afternoon. That is why the market got nervous and the stocks fell yesterday. In the larger sense, it is a sentiment which drove the fall into the market. 

There is nothing wrong fundamentally with Bajaj Finance or Bajaj Finserv per se. The insurance business in Bajaj Finserv continues to grow with a robust speed. Today when the result comes out, it should get validated. 

The results which have been announced by HDFC Life and SBI Life are all suggesting that the insurance business has been on a very good track as far as the outlook on this side is concerned. From that point of view, Bajaj Finserv looks really interesting from an investment point of view. 

Bajaj Finance is a slightly pricey stock but it is always valued high and any correction in the market would definitely demand a look at this particular company. In my viewpoint, the continued growth of Bajaj Finance and the thrust on recovering their money faster from the borrowers makes them a unique company which gives them good margin as well. 

If their premium value is a little bit justified, any fall in the price definitely demands some interest though they have not become very attractive yet. If for some reason, the market gives in and the stock is available at attractive valuation, one should add it into the portfolio."
20,2019-01-29,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are likely to report double-digit growth in key financial numbers for the quarter ended December 2018. Both the Bajaj Group companies are slated to announce Q3 results on Tuesday. 

Shares of Bajaj Finance rose 2.79 per cent to hit a high of Rs 2524.95 on BSE in morning trade on Tuesday. Meanwhile, shares of Bajaj Finserv nearly 1 per cent to Rs 5956.65.


Expectations from Bajaj FinanceBrokerage firm Sharekhan sees a 24.90 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit for Bajaj Finance with 13.60 per cent YoY and 29 per cent YoY increase in net interest income and pre-provisioning profit (PPP), respectively.

Emkay Global Financial Services, on the other hand, projected 34 per cent and 32 per cent YoY rise in EBITDA and net profit, respectively, for Bajaj Finance. A strong AUM growth is expected on the back of healthy demand in the consumer segment and mortgage business. Net interest margins (NIM) are expected to decline marginally on a YoY basis primarily on account of higher cost of funds. Asset quality is likely to remain stable.

Deutsche Bank looks confident on the AUM growth of the NBFC player. “Bajaj Finance should continue to post steady AUM growth 35 per cent YoY,” the global financial services firm said.

Antique Stock Broking sees 23.10 per cent, 31.50 per cent and 28 per cent YoY rise in net interest income, PPP and net income, respectively, for Bajaj Finance for the quarter ended December 2018.

The brokerage house expects steady performance from Bajaj Finance with over 30 per cent growth in loan book. Margins would be impacted slightly but don’t see any meaningful impact on its profitability. 


Projections for Bajaj FinservBrokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services sees 30.30 per cent, 37.80 per cent and 42.30 per cent year-on-year rise in net interest income, operating profit and net profit, respectively, for Bajaj Finserv in Q3FY19.

Edelweiss Securities believes that strong growth momentum in the financing business would continue. Margin may come under pressure, a function of change in the business mix. Life insurance profitability, though improving, will continue to be under pressure. General insurance would clock better-than-industry growth rate."

FIIs buy Rs 223 crore worth of equities
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 223 crore worth of domestic stocks on Monday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 92 crore, data suggested."
26,2019-01-30,Bajaj Finserv,"As many as five Nifty companies including HCL Technologies, Axis Bank, HDFC, Bajaj Finance, and Bajaj Finserv announced their financial results on Tuesday for the quarter ended December 2018. 

While private sector lender Axis Bank reported over two-fold rise in net profit to Rs 1,680.85 crore, NBFC Bajaj Finance Ltd reported 54 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,060 crore -- the highest ever quarterly profit -- for the third quarter ended December, 2018. 

CLSA maintained ‘buy’ on Axis Bank with a revised target price of Rs 840 from Rs 800 earlier. It said that strong topline supported operating profit of Axis Bank. Slippage stood a tad higher but recoveries remained stronger. Improvement in return on equity and a stable earnings rise will be key to a further re-rating.

Macquarie also hiked target price for Axis Bank to Rs 620 from Rs 540 earlier.

Axis Bank shares hit a new all-time high of Rs 703 in the morning trade, while Bajaj Finance was 2.41 per cent up at Rs 2572.35 at around 9.50 am (IST).

Software services major HCL Technologies posted a 19 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 2,611 crore during the December 2018 quarter. The scrip was trading 2.51 per cent higher at Rs 1012.95 in the morning trade.

Credit Suisse has ‘outperform’ rating on HCL Technologies with a target price of Rs 1,350 (Rs 1,275 earlier). Domestic brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher maintained ‘accumulate’ rating on HCL Tech with a revised target price of Rs 1,170 from Rs 1,100 earlier. 

Prabhudas Lilladher added that dollar revenue growth guidance was downgraded to 7.9-9.9 per cent owing to cross currency headwinds. However, valuations remained cheap for HCL Technologies.

Bajaj Finserv posted 16 per cent increase in its consolidated net profit to Rs 851 crore. The share was trading 1.50 per cent up at Rs 6,323 in the morning.

According to ICICIdirect, Bajaj Finance shows continued growth momentum and earnings growth. However, asset quality witnessed slight pressure with slippages coming in higher. Overall headline NPA numbers are still under control. Bajaj Finserv delivered healthy performance in terms of topline. However, lower profitability in insurance business (both life and general insurance) kept overall earnings flat YoY and lower compared to the brokerage estimate.

Housing finance company HDFC registered a profit of Rs 2,113.80 crore on a standalone basis in Q3FY19. It had posted a net profit of Rs 5,300 crore in the October-December quarter of last financial year. 

The profit numbers for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 are not comparable with that of the quarter ended December 31, 2017, HDFC Ltd said in a statement. 

Global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘buy’ on HDFC with a price target of Rs 2,360. On the other hand, Macquarie retained ‘outperform’ call and revised price target upward to Rs 2,400 from Rs 2,050.

Loan growth slowed down from 17 per cent to 15 per cent due to corporate book. The minor blip in asset quality was driven by non-individual loan book. There was not much impact of the liquidity crisis in the NBFC sector, Macquarie said.

Shares of HDFC closed 1.74 per cent down at Rs 1,885.50. On the other hand, the benchmark BSE Sensex closed down 1.25 points at Rs 35,591.25."

Board meetings"
24,2019-01-30,Bajaj Finserv,"Mumbai: The Bajaj ‘twins’, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, reported robust profit growths in the December quarter despite their exposure to IL&FS, demonstrating that quality para-banks could raise funds competitively and deploy them even through a period of protracted liquidity squeeze brought about by defaults at the infrastructure financier.

Bajaj Finance reported a 54 per cent increase in consolidated profit at Rs 1,060 crore, compared with Rs 690 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a consolidated basis, Bajaj Finserv’s profit for the quarter rose 16 per cent to Rs 850 crore against Rs 730 crore.

“For good credit, money was available,” said Rajeev Jain, CEO, Bajaj Finance. “We raised Rs 6,500 crore from banks and another Rs 19,000 crore from the money market. We have seen good growth from small and medium enterprises during the quarter.”

Bajaj Finance borrowed around Rs 25,600 crore from market. It saw 71 per cent increase in deposit growth, which formed 12 per cent of the borrowing profile. Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew 46 per cent to Rs 3,209 crore.

Exposure to IL&FS resulted in a spike in loan losses and provisions increased to Rs 454 crore from Rs 278 crore a year ago. The company said it has Rs 275 crore of exposure to IL&FS, of which 20 per cent is provided for.

Gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPA for the quarter stood at 1.55 per cent and 0.62 per cent, respectively. The provisioning coverage ratio stood at 60 per cent. Standard assets provisioning was 88 basis points as per ECL (stage 1& 2) provisioning under lnd-AS versus 40 bps as per RBI prudential norms.

At Bajaj Finserv, profits fell at the insurers, although the company posted growth at the consolidated level. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit to Rs 223 crore. Gross written premium rose 35 per cent. Underwriting profit halved to Rs 48 crore due to losses from group health business and investment in bancassurance. The life insurance arm reported a 31 per cent decline in profit to Rs 122 crore."
27,2019-01-30,Bajaj Finserv,"Our strategy of diversifying our product mix seems to have worked quite well. On the non-life side, growth has 
  
  
  been very strong. We have grown 34.7% in this quarter, S Sreenivasan, CFO, Bajaj Finserv, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


It has been a strong quarter for Bajaj Finance but we are seeing muted performance in insurance business. Please explain.
On the life insurance side, we have actually done quite well. Our growth rate on individual rated premium has been better than both the private sector as well as overall market. We are seeing a slightly subdued performance by policy holders in terms of unit-linked business. 

Last year, we changed our product mix and for this quarter we have ended up at 60% ULIP as against 72%. In hindsight, our strategy of diversifying our product mix seems to have worked quite well. On the non-life side, growth has been very strong. We have grown 34.7% in this quarter. There is an element of new business trend in both life and non-life businesses. As you do new business, the entire expenses have to be written off upfront while the premium gets earned over time in the general insurance business.

Therefore, as you grow, there will be some strain on profits. However, we are not concerned about it at this stage. There are some segments of general insurance business we will be tweaking -- a bit on group health, some parts of commercial vehicles but otherwise the business is on a sound footing. 

Bajaj Finance has had another very good quarter. The momentum continues to be strong and we hope to continue that momentum going into the next quarter.


Is Bajaj Finserv committed to keep their holding percentage intact in Bajaj Finance or as is it that as Bajaj Finance grows, your holding will come down?
Last year, we raised capital for Bajaj Finance. Our holding did come down from about 58% to 55%. As we go forward, we will be evaluating that. In the immediate future. we do not require capital in Bajaj Finance. When the time comes, if we need capital, then we will review all options including maintaining our stake. If we have to reduce our stake, we will look at it. As of now, we are committed to keeping at least 51% in Bajaj Finance.


There could be an early trend of a massive slowdown in the ULIP business. It is not your mainstay, but you do have a presence there. Given market volatility, could the ULIP business slowdown have an impact on your life insurance business, especially the non general insurance business?
For the next two quarters, we expect the ULIP business to be somewhat subdued because people are holding on. There are uncertainties, they are waiting for election results. They will hold on a little bit there. However, we have a more diversified product mix and we feel that our guaranteed product business which is the traditional business, is doing quite well -- both our risk business as well as the guaranteed business. 

We are cautiously optimistic about our performance. The fourth-quarter is very important because that is the tax season and a lot of the life insurance business gets done in this quarter. We will have to see how it pans out but our product mix is poised for sustainability.


Let us talk about Bajaj Finance. What led to the strong growth in business despite a tough liquidity environment? There was over 40% AUM growth, is this a large part of market share migration in the wake of some of the players finding it hard to sustain?
Post IL&FS events unfolding, the crisis that developed it was largely affecting companies which have a long-tail liability book, particularly housing finance and infrastructure companies. In our book, housing finance is only about 30%, 70% is consumer business, rural business, SME and commercial business. There has been segregation between the stronger and the weaker players in the market or people who have more difficulty in accessing the funds. 

But in Bajaj Finance, we are well capitalised. We have a very strong ALM position; a lot of inflows are short term; we do a lot of consumer business which is less than one year. To that extent, we are less affected by this crisis. We also keep an internal liquidity book which varies from 4-7%. 

Depending on the market, we keep adjusting the amount. This is a voluntary thing we do, not required by regulation. We have diversified our liability book by taking deposits which today stand at 14% of our liability book. So we are looking at all options to diversify liability book. We have been looking at it for the last few years and we think that will help us ride over liquidity squeezes. 

Typically, they have happened in 2013, and by now, one could say it is a five-year event. The momentum continues to be strong on growth. We do not think it is because of market share migration but it is more because of the value of the products. We have products for almost every segment of customers that we want to attract, backed by strong service and ease of buying. That is providing momentum to Bajaj Finance.


It is very encouraging to see what Bajaj Finance has done. Your team has done a great job but at what point in time would the base effect start hitting you? We have built Bajaj Finance as a diversified NBFC. This is probably the most diversified NBFC available in India today and our target segment is clearly the mass affluent and above customer. We are still a very small proportion of the lending system overall. We are probably less than 1-1.5%. There is a significant opportunity for growth. It is only because of our differentiated product offering, our strong customer connect and the ease of buying that we continuously invest, supported by deep investments in technology and analytics.

We think there is enough market available and as long as we can hold the risk, we should be able to grow all our segments.


A large part of corporate India is grappling with demand slowdown, especially in the auto segment.Two-wheeler, three-wheeler numbers show a demand slowdown and perhaps a multiyear low in terms of volume growth. What do you foresee as the demand scenario for two-wheelers, three wheelers or even your LAP book, one year hence?
It is very difficult to predict what will happen one year from now but my feeling is there is a lot of uncertainty externally, primarily because of elections. We had the state elections and now we will have the national elections. Till such time this uncertainty may continue, there will be a little bit of volatility and months when you will see growth and de-growth. 

But by the second half of next year, we should see growth coming back. As far as Bajaj Finance is concerned, we are into white goods, digital, lifestyle, home improvements and even into life care which is support for medical expenses through 0% finance. All these segments are not affected as of now. We do not expect those to be affected by any slowdown in the auto segment. 

There could be some effect on our general insurance business and to that extent, there will be some amount of slowdown but again we have growing portfolios in health insurance and our property portfolio is doing well. 

Overall, there is enough diversification for us to grow even if one or two segments are not growing well.


Can I safely say your Allianz partnership is a happy one?
Yes, the partnership is very happy. We are in very close touch with Allianz. As of now, Allianz has not decided to allocate capital to India. They do have a right to go up to 49% but they have not exercised that option. The ball is in their court. They have had reviews globally. They have a life business which has been affected by solvency to guaranteed products. Globally, they are getting affected because of lower interest rates. 

It is clearly Allianz’s call and they are probably biding their time. The partnership continues to be very strong, very happy and companies are doing very well.


They can induce capital whenever they want even at this level because your stock is not at Rs 2,000, it is at Rs 6m000 plus. So, obviously the capital requirement will come at a cost at expanded price to book. If you need capital will they come in and induce?
I cannot comment on that because Allianz would be able to comment on that.


They are partners?
They are partners, yes. Globally, Allianz’s view is that markets are hot. That is what we have read and we have heard from them as well."

2,2019-02-05,Bajaj Finserv,"Sticking to a focused equity portfolio, which picks profitable ideas across market capitalisation with strong conviction, serves as a good investment option for investors in present market conditions. One such fund that is a good bet for mutual fund investors is SBI Focused Equity, which is managed by R Srinivasan.

This is one of the few early focused-equity schemes in the markets. The portfolio has 25 stocks of which top 10 form 48.6% of the total portfolio. This shows the level of conviction of the scheme’s fund manager. It is a well-diversified portfolio covering sectors such as financials, consumer durables, automobiles, technology and engineering. Close to 57% of the scheme’s portfolio is invested in large-sized companies while remaining is spread across mid-and small-sized companies.

Such conviction bets show desired results especially in the long term. This is reflected in the performance of the scheme in the long duration. In the past seven- and 10-year periods, the scheme has given 16.8% and 24.7%, while other schemes in this category have given 14% and 17.6%, respectively, during the same period, while its benchmark index, Nifty 500 TRI, has given 13.2% and 16.4% returns. This scheme would work for investors who believe in the power of benefiting from patient investing which pays off when bets are based on high conviction.

KAUSTUBH BELAPURKAR,Director (fund research), Morningstar India
The fund is a concentrated high conviction strategy investing across the capitalisation curve. R Srinivasan is an excellent stock-picker and runs a benchmark-agnostic strategy both at stock and sector levels. He focuses on investing in high growth stock and doesn’t mind paying a premium for growth. He also invests a portion of his portfolio in value plays which he believes are trading at a significant discount to their intrinsic value."

5,2019-02-08,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: This bit will make it easy for you to forget the shock from Tata Motors.

At least 12 Nifty companies reported their highest quarterly profits this earnings season. They included Reliance Industries, TCS, Asian Paints, Titan, HDFC Bank and Bajaj twins Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv.

Most of them also reported highest-ever sales for a quarter. While not all of these companies are a outright ‘buy’ calls, analysts do fancy most of these counters, earnings reviews by analysts showed. 

This season Reliance Industries became the first private sector firm to report Rs 10,000 crore quarterly profit. The number of analysts recommending a ‘buy’ rating on the stock has jumped to 12 from nine a month ago, Reuters data showed. Analysts recommending a ‘sell’ rating on the scrip fell to two from four. The scrip has topped Nifty50 performance chart, rising 17 per cent in last one month.

RIL’s consolidated profit for the quarter stood at Rs 10,251 crore, beating Street estimate by 7.7 per cent. Sales were highest ever at Rs 1.71 lakh crore.

At FY20 PE multiple of 13.6 times, the scrip looks attractive, says YES Securities.

“RIL is our top pick in the oil & gas space, as we see benefits from refinery-petchem integration playing out in a tough macro environment and RJio and retail scaling up operations,” IIFL Institutional Equities said in a note.

Analysts are painting a rosy picture for Asian Paints too.

The number of brokerages recommending ‘outperform’ rating on the stock has jumped to 15 from 12 a month ago. The company’s record profits and sales were fuelled by nearly 20 per cent volume growth, which was the highest the company has witnessed since FY11.

“Though near-term headwind in the form of general elections could pose a challenge, Asian Paints’ long-term theme of market shift from unorganised to organised hands and premiumisation remain intact,” Reliance Securities said.

Bajaj Finance managed to impress Street with a 54 per cent jump in quarterly profit. JM Financial said the NBFC is well-positioned to deliver sustainable profit growth driven by strong customer acquisition, increasing rural footprint with diversified product offering, rising contribution of fee income, superior asset quality and a well-capitalised CAR of 21 per cent. 

Analysts have showed faith in ITC, as the scrip has slipped 2 per cent in last one month. Citi says Dalal Street may be missing the point that the margin lever for a business is price, and not volumes. Cigarette volume recovery builds the base for price hikes, they said, adding that the company’s diversification drive will pay off soon.

“High cash generation has enabled ITC to invest aggressively in other fast-growing businesses, enabling it to diversify into other, non-stringent segments. We expect revenues and earnings to grow at a CAGR of 10.2 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, in FY18-21E,” said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock. 


Others
Tata Group firm Titan is another stock analysts are positive on. This jewellery maker has given guidance for 22 per cent growth in jewellery business in FY19. The number of brokerages recommending an outperform rating on the stock has increased to 17 from 14 a month ago. Calls recommending a hold rating on the stock have fallen to 3 from 5.

Brokerages are not that bullish on another Tata Group firm, TCS.

December quarter sales and profit of India’s most-valued listed firm came in at Rs 37,338 crore and Rs 8,121 crore, respectively. The target price for the stock has been cut by up to 16 per cent, as the software major’s margins failed to cheer investors despite record sales and profit.

Another IT firm Wipro has seen brokerages raise price targets on higher-than-expected margin growth in December quarter. But increased price targets are not enough to trigger ‘buy’ calls. Most brokerages have either retained ‘sell’ or ‘neutral’ rating on the stock due to muted guidance for fourth quarter, as growth continues to lag peers.

The numbers of analysts giving buy ratings on the stock has fallen to one from two a month ago, while analysts with ‘hold’ ratings has jumped to 17 from 15 and those with ‘underperform’ rating have risen to 10 from 9.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid and HDFC Bank are a few other companies which have reported record profits.

7,2019-02-13,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Ignoring decent gains in its Asian peers, Indian equity benchmark Sensex suffered losses on Wednesday, extending losing streak to a fifth successive session, on selling in bank, energy, auto and metal stocks.

Stocks opened in the positive territory as macroeconomic numbers in terms of retail inflation and industrial production boosted market mood. 

However, a fresh spell of selling emerged in the latter half of the session, which caused the market to end the day in the red.

Experts say other than the uninspiring December quarter earnings and anxiety around general elections, the pressure in NBFC and banking spaces were still making investors jittery.

13,2019-02-22,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Following the crowd usually takes you nowhere in the stock market. True!

But what do you make of the stocks that figure in portfolios of one after another mutual fund scheme? At the end of January, there were 78 stocks that were part of the portfolios of at least 100 mutual fund schemes, including ETFs, data from Ace Mutual Fund showed.

Don’t forget domestic institutional investors have become one of the key market drivers in recent years, having managed to cushion severe corrections every time there has been a big selloff by the overseas portfolio investors. 

Foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in Indian market, having offloaded shares worth over Rs 34,000 crore since January 2018. DIIs poured in some Rs 1,15,000 crore in the same period.

Not surprisingly, the list of 78 stocks includes the usual suspects. HDFC Bank is part of at least 535 mutual fund schemes; ICICI Bank 528 schemes, State Bank of India 465 schemes and Axis Bank 450 schemes.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

14,2019-02-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Benchmark equity indices soared nearly 1 per cent on Monday following firm global as well as domestic cues. 

BSE Sensex advanced 342 points for the day to close at 36,213 while NSE’s Nifty50 gained 88 points to 10,880.

As many as 36 stocks in the Nifty pack closed in the green, with TCS gaining 3.19 per cent, followed by Bajaj Finserv (up 2.77 per cent), Infosys (up 2.73 per cent) and Grasim (up 2.68 per cent). Adani Ports, Bharti Infratel and BPCL slipped 2-8 per cent. 

Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here are the key factors that fuelled the rally in domestic stocks.


Trade war worries ease

Most Asian markets rallied after US President Donald Trump said he would postpone a March 1 deadline for a US tariff hike on Chinese imports following weekend talks on Beijing’s technology ambitions. Shanghai Composite index closed 5.60 per cent higher at 2,961. Hang Seng and Nikkei settled in green. Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities said, “Trump on Sunday postponed sanctions on $200 billion worth of goods from China which caused the dollar to weaken and rupee to gain strength. On the line of Asian markets, Indian indices opened in the green rose through the day.” 


Rupee gains strength

Rupee extended its rally. The domestic currency was trading over 13 paise higher at 71 against the dollar in afternoon trade after the greenback came under pressure against indexed currencies amid foreign fund flows and a higher opening for domestic equity market. On Friday, the rupee settled 10 paise higher at 71.14 against the US dollar. 


Robust FII inflows

Foreign investors on Friday pumped in a net of Rs 6,311 crore into domestic equities, the highest inflow in a day this month so far, exchange data showed. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said: “The market rally was fuelled by signs of progress in US-China trade talks and a gradual turnaround in FIIs liquidity. Market has factored the negatives cues from quarter earnings while a strengthening rupee is boosting investor’s sentiment.”


GST push & other factors 

Dalal Street also cheered the GST tax cut on under-construction flats to 5 per cent and affordable homes to 1 per cent effective April 1. Robust buying in banking and IT counters further lifted the benchmark indices. YES Bank closed 3.24 per cent higher at Rs 229, while TCS and Infosys gained 3 per cent and 2.94 per cent, respectively. “Nifty traded buoyant and ended around the day's high, taking cues from firm global markets and upbeat local cues. The GST tax cut on real estate added to the positivity. IT, banking and auto stocks were the top contributors from the sectoral front while the broader indices managed to end marginally higher,” said Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking.



PM Kisan Samman Nidhi launched

Market participants also got some booster after the government launched the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) to provide an assured income support to small and marginal farmers. This programme is expected to boost rural consumption and give stimulate demand for FMCG goods."
15,2019-02-26,Bajaj Finserv,"Mumbai: Homegrown private equity fund True North Capital is set to purchase a 51% stake owned by Max Group in Max Bupa Health Insurance Co for ₹1,100 crore, said two persons with knowledge of the plan.

The deal is in the final stages and may be discussed by the Max Bupa board, which is scheduled to meet soon.

“The board is likely to approve the transaction later this week,” said one of the two persons. “Max India will exit the venture.” Max India declined to comment on the development. True North did not respond to queries.

“We don’t comment on market speculation,” said a Bupa spokesperson. “We are committed to the Indian health insurance market and see opportunities for growth over the coming years.”

The deal will see the exit of Indian billionaire Analjit Singh-owned Max India, while the British partner will keep its 49% stake. KPMG Corporate Finance is the exclusive adviser on the deal.

The market is attracting private equity funds because the health insurance coverage of Indians is poor but it needs fresh strategies in both products and policies, experts said.

“Promise of massive under-penetrated market in health is attracting private equity firms,” said Joydeep Roy, partner, PwC. “However, any company that brings private equity funds will need fresh strategy to enter under-served market or product categories like OPD (outpatient department), low ticket size and mass insurance policies.’’ Max Bupa has been growing at a faster pace than the industry as it focuses on the corporate segment. Total premium income rose 24% to 404 crore in the first half of the fiscal against ₹327 crore a year ago.

Last year, the company grew 27%, faster than the market growth of 23%. It has a market share of 0.5%.

Its products are sold through Bank of Baroda, Standard Chartered Bank, Federal Bank, RBL Bank, Deutsche Bank, Sarv UP Gramin Bank and nonbanking finance companies Bajaj Finserv and Muthoot Finance, Private equity investors have been buying stakes in both life and health insurance businesses, seeking to take advantage of market that is potentially massive in the world’s second-most populous country. Apart from that, the Indian government wants to ensure health cover for economically weaker sections, which find it difficult to pay for the treatment they need.

Safecrop Holdings--a consortium of WestBridge AIF, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Madison Capital—has acquired Star Health & Allied Insurance Co. Similarly, Warburg Pincus purchased a stake in IndiaFirst Life Insurance and ICICI Lombard General Insurance. True North had earlier tried to purchase Religare Health Insurance.

The health insurance market has been expanding 25-30% annually for the past five years and needs fresh capital to write new business. There are six standalone companies with less than 6% share in the overall health insurance business. The latest to enter the sector is Reliance Health Insurance.

“The consolidation of health insurance space does not mean that the market has expanded,” said a partner with a consultancy firm. “Complementary distribution and product focus will work better than takeover or merger.”"

18,2019-02-27,Bajaj Finserv,"About seven decades ago, as British India grappled with challenges brought about by the Second World War, a handful of entrepreneurs in the southern peninsula began the business of financing the unorganised sector, or those that lacked access to the venerable banking system. In three decades, those early-stage ‘startups’ would become sufficiently important to grab the central bank’s mind space, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) accepting in the 1970s crucial gearing ratio proposals of a special purpose study group established for these ‘financial’ companies.

About 30 years since India began integrating its economy with the global order, these financiers – non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) – have become even more systematically significant and numerically important, accounting for a third of the loans advanced in the world’s second-most populous nation. That has prompted Mint Road to introduce additional norms to harmonise the sector with high-street banks and bring in greater oversight on their operations.

To be sure, from NPA recognition at the NBFCs to capital requirements, the norms have been tightened for the para banks that are considered essential to help organised financing reach the consumer’s doorstep in the hinterland. Some large NBFCs, important for their geographic reach and market share, are also allowed to raise public deposits.

At this juncture, the question is whether systematically important NBFCs be mandatorily directed to convert into banks. NBFCs up-down cycle is anywhere between 3 and 5 years. The recent liquidity crisis is not the first of the challenges faced by the NBFC sector. Banks became cautious and mutual funds wary after the IL&FS default. Banks refused to release the sanctioned limits, starving the para banks of much needed liquidity flows.

“The reason for converting into bank should not be liquidity alone,” said Dinanath Dubhashi, MD and CEO, L&T Finance. “It should be left for NBFCs to decide whether they want to convert into a bank. Large NBFCs anyway have to go through regular RBI inspections and those accepting deposits have to maintain statutory liquidity ratios.”

Some entrepreneurs in the financing business have always favoured such a transition.


Auto conversion into banks
“We have been proposing this to the regulator that systematically important NBFCs should have an option of automatic conversion into banks,” said Hemant Kanoria, chairman, Srei Infrastructure.

“They should be allowed to convert into banks and be allowed to raise public deposits.

Large NBFCs have to depend on banks so that they can on-lend. Stronger ones have corporate governance and been in existence for long time. Many are larger than many small banks. The main raw material… is funds by way of retail deposit.”

Innovators in the financing business also want the ‘systematically large’ NBFCs treated differently than the 10,000 others that make up the sector.

“The regulator and government should support these entities while monitoring them in a reasonably stringent manner rather than clubbing them with over 11,000 NBFCs in the country,” Sanjiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Finserv, had said in an interview in November. “There can be an individual supervision criterion for very large NBFCs.

Banks are lending to these NBFCs because NBFCs can gather consumer assets in a profitable manner, which banks are either not interested in or cannot. One must understand that these large NBFCs are helping the economy.”


Banking license on tap
RBI did try to allow NBFCs to convert into banks when they opened small banking and universal banking licenses.

While the banking license is available on tap basis, only one entity has filed for it. In the last round, RBI had given two universal bank licenses to Bandhan Bank and IDFC Bank. Bandhan Bank has successfully raised public deposits with 40% CASA, IDFC Bank got merged with an NBFC Capital First to form IDFC First Bank.

Eight micro finance institutions were given small finance bank licenses.


Agencies

L&T Finance and Bajaj Finance lost out last time because they are backed by corporate houses, which the regulator is averse to. “Converting to a bank will be a logical step, but NBFCs would want some exemptions in terms of maintaining CRR and SLR when they convert into banks,” said Prakash Agarwal, director & head, financial institution, India Ratings. “Given a choice, NBFCs would like to convert into banks. The funding cost can drop drastically as market confidence goes up. RBI would want NBFCs to gain confidence. They would want NBFCs to convert into small finance banks and gradually convert into universal bank as they gain experience.”


Costs out of WACC
The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for NBFCs is high, especially for financiers seeking long-term funding, but rated below A. The size of the capital market is rather small. Besides, asset and liability profiles for most NBFCs don’t match.

“The current crisis is because some of asset-liability mismatch,” said V P Nandakumar, MD and CEO, Manappuram Finance. “With more regulations around ALM, the issue can be addressed… During the last two decades, there have not been many issues. Today, the issue is not because of credit quality. It is because of irregularity in payments.”

Of the NBFCs that recently converted into banks, very few could mobilise reasonable amount of CASA, a source of lowcost money.

Ujjivan and Equitas have been loss-making after converting into small banks.

Operating expense for the NBFCs goes up because as banks, they must maintain cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio. They have to bring the entire operations under the core banking system and branches must face RBI’s inspection.

Banks will have to raise CASA to lower their funding costs. Bulk deposit is easy to get, but retail deposit is difficult.

“Operating expenses are higher for banks since they have to meet prudential norms,” said Digant Haria, an analyst with Antique Broking. “Recovery methods are different for banks and NBFCs.

One reason why banks do not get into usedvehicle segment is because banks cannot recover money the way NBFCs can.”

Deterrents and challenges NBFCs will have to transfer all leading activities into a bank and those that cannot be part of the bank will have to be divested.

AU Small Finance Bank sold three of its subsidiaries, including AU Home Finance and insurance broking business to be able to convert into a bank.

Similarly, Shriram Group, Aditya Birla Capital and Bajaj Finance have step-down subsidiaries among NBFCs which need to be merged for a banking license.

For companies such as Edelweiss and India Infoline, the rules of having 10% income from broking or real estate activities may come in the way of conversion.

“The key question that the RBI should address is whether we should have the same set of regulations for all NBFCs even as they vary widely in their business focus and sources of funding,” said Nandakumar.

Whether the regulator likes it or not, big industrial houses like L&Ts, Tatas, Birlas and Bajajs have lending firms and mutual funds which are all inter-connected in the financial system.

These firms need to convert for the safety of the financial system in general. While the regulator should retain all its prudent norms, it should avoid the blanket ban on conglomerates and ring fence finance business from the rest with toughest possible penalties for any violation."

1,2019-03-05,Bajaj Finserv,"I am extremely bullish on the midcaps space and I think you cannot get a better time to stock midcaps, said N 
   
   
   Jayakumar, MD, Prime Securities, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Donald Trump has threatened to slap a mirror tax in India and he has criticised India for high tariffs. Could this situation escalate or are these just tweets coming in?
Sometimes, he gets up on the right side of the bed from our perspective and sometimes he does not. But I think these are passing days. My own assessment is the comment may mean something over a period of time. May be, there is some negotiating somewhere. Frankly, the sectors are too small. The total quantum as estimated is at about $5-odd billion of exports and that too on some tinkering on taxes which have been principally agreed upon, is not there at least from the listed space perspective. Perhaps steel in some sense could be impacted. But right now, I do not think that is the case even from a steel sector perspective. We have got much bigger things to worry than Trump’s tweets.


And those bigger things are elections or is there anything bigger than that?
Well I think elections were something to worry at least till about 8-10 days ago. My own feeling is that the way things have moved, public reactions to whatever has happened notwithstanding whatever has happened, is in terms of how many died etc. The reality is that you had a case of somebody who has landed on enemy camp and comeback. If that is not a victory for diplomacy, what is? We can keep arguing whichever way, but summing substance is we have a very weak neighbour, which of course is a matter of worry. Economically, they have become extremely weak. I am not a political commentator at all and I do not think we are anywhere close to war.

But the way it has been heightened, I think there is a clarity that will come through in elections front as a result of public reactions being so positive. My own assessment is that the markets in some sense already suss out these things a little earlier. A week-10 days ago, when we made a pretty strong bottom for midcaps. Every dip in the market index optically will probably keep testing 10500-10600, but you will have a bounce off that. 

I am not a great index believer because the index composition keeps changing and the broad market is much much lower than these levels. I am extremely bullish on the midcaps space and I think you cannot get a better time to stock midcaps. After four, five years of this government, we are back in an broad market index level of 8000-8500. That is where you are getting a chance to pick up a lot of stocks. 

The market as a whole is very bullish. All the classic signs were there. Flows into mutual funds had tapered off, you had problems in terms of capitulation across the board, leverage in terms of midcap promoters, a lot of big groups in trouble when the stocks were getting busted. These were the classic signs of a capitulation in the midcap space. 

On the frontline space, for almost six months, we were in this 10400 to 11200 range and we pretty much stayed the course. For once, I believe now we are going to get pass the 11200 range. We will make new highs even before the elections on the index front. We will have a huge value pickup on the broad market front.


You are talking about a lot of opportunity. You are very bullish and you have always maintained a stock specific stance. Where can one find value in midcaps?
I do not talk stocks specifically, but if you look sectorally, there are multiple sectors, where some of the frontliners have dropped 70-80% for reasons which have been other than just the fact that business has suffered. 

Pharma offers a greatest opportunity in terms of a big sector play where there are two or three largecap stocks in the generic space. The generic space in the US has made at least a quarter or two quarter go in terms of price and in terms of the business potential, it has made a fantastic bottom. So, there is pricing power, which can only go up. 

Two, business prospects are on the ascendant. Pharma as a largecap space offers great opportunities. From a smallcap perspective, there is a plethora of them. Look at industry leaders in home building, home financing and even in the NBFC space where the stocks have got pummelled 70-80%, Those are well capitalised and they have come off from being 4.5-5 times book premium to 2-2.5 times. There is consolidation across-the-board. There is a great opportunity in the space where NBFCs have merged with banks. 

Recently, there were two or three transactions, Some steel companies, even in this gloom, offers some opportunities and the big ones are down 35%-40% from peak levels. So I think there are opportunities across the board and I for one believe that this is a great time to go back to the drawing board, pick up the balance sheets and pick stocks. Karl Marx said, you have nothing to lose except your chains. I think you have nothing to lose except a fixed deposit rate of interest, if that. This is a time to put on risk and hunt for midcaps.


You believe that there is valuation comfort in the larger pool. I am not talking about the benchmark Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finances of the world but within the NBFC pool, where is it that you find that comfort?
HFCs is the category where people find most comfort. The NBFCs that have been in the loan against shares space or otherwise, have been actually a little more hit because of markets. 

Also, this entire business about leverage which promoters have enjoyed, NCDs that they have issued to borrow against. Those have all come under bit of cloud. But sectors that are growing the MSME space still offer a well diversified risk portfolio. There are companies that are in niche spaces like education finance which is actually growing. There are companies in spaces like consumer durables. While the big ones are far too expensive, have still not really corrected. Housing finance has been a congested space but there has been a lot of fallout. A number of names have dropped out and the others are actually picking up the slack. 

But linked to this space is a lot of PSU banks that have been picking up portfolios and therefore the retailisation of the PSU bank portfolios is happening amongst at least the top two-three PSU banks. They will represent portfolio qualities very differently from what they did a year, year and a half ago. 

In the past, we used to accuse them of being corporate focussed, high on NPAs with paralysed balance sheet and not able to move. The same balance sheets now got recapitalised. They have recognised losses. 

The NPA recognition has come off and you got now retail portfolios that they are acquiring. This is a perfect storm and we are still trading at 0.6-0.7 times book. The only question mark on PSU banks is whether there is a reasonable window of a period where they do not need to dilute continuously. They are still capital short and to that extent, there could be dilution. But if you really look at it from an opportunity perspective, the top two-three PSU banks could give you 50% returns from here over the next two years.


Are you comfortable with the way they are stretching SBI buying into Jet, etc?
I do not think SBI has bought into Jet. All that they have done is in the interim, they have taken a position where lenders have exercised their free will to take control and there will be presumably further dilution has happens. When it does, their stake comes off and they will sell and move on in life. 

It is a great proactive step in preventing the collapse like Kingfisher that we had five-six years ago. Now a similar step may have prevented that from happening. You learn from the past but look ahead. From that perspective, Jet has been a great story of how PSU banks have moved in and pretty proactively at that. Hats off to that.


While you have maintained that economic growth is perceptibly slowing, you seem to have a tilt towards the engineering space that is intrinsically linked with the macros. What is really driving the conviction?
Over the last two-three decades, engineering spaces have been ignored in some sense. Capacities have remained broadly the same. People have been operating at 60-70% capacities. So the real economies of scale have not kicked in. A lot of small companies, typically Japanese multinationals operating in India, Swiss multinationals operating in India have very low floats. Therefore they have been off the radar in some senses. 

While the Rupee has weakened now, capacities have not increased in engineering space. The available capacities are now are operating at peak capacities. They are debottlenecking to increase capacities. This is the classic case where EBITDA margins actually will explode, PE margins will go up as their top line moves and I think you could have very good four-five engineering names.

I cannot name stocks, but if you were to hunt deep enough, there are lots of opportunities in multinationals operating in India. We have not been adding capacities and now for the first time we are operating at full capacities in addition to exports coming through, in addition to captive business being there, etc. These are all perfect storms for value creation.


You have said you continue to like chemicals. This is the most misunderstood space because each chemical company is different from the other. What within chemicals interests you? This is a continuing theme. We had the first phase runup where simply people said China is preventing polluting industries to operate and therefore everybody moved. As we have seen, many of these companies have corrected quite dramatically -- whether it is in terms of the industries which are steel-related or chemical industries to be used as an intermediate for pharma. 

Chemical is a loose term, essentially it means polluting industries where the first phase cut down happened. Many of these companies went up and with the market had come off. It is time to relook at those because the absence of polluting industries in China is not a transient theme, it is here to stay. They are going to cut back even more severely and the next wave may well be in terms of a lot of polluting steel-related spaces. 

There could be companies in the solar industry which could be benefitted. So I think chemicals is loose, I agree that that has been a sort of a liberal use of that terminology but the idea here is that the polluting theme has not gone away and I think as you look at greater call on China-US negotiations, one of the big themes that is going to be here to stay is the polluting aspect, their own contribution to the climate change and stuff like that. This is one theme we should pursue.

I also think that in power companies, the resolutions are leading to very interesting acquisitions that people are making. Those who have been in the power and in the infra space and acquiring some of these assets, may actually end up with a very interesting portfolio. A lot of issues facing power companies will get resolved as we go along in the next few months. Linked to that, the typical pre-election and post election themes traversing that area could be the infra and road, where a lot of orders get issued at this point in time. A couple of days ago, there was relaxation in terms of the REIT and InvIT issuances where 49% becomes 70% in terms of portfolio coverage. That would benefit road companies immensely. So, there are a few listed spaces which you could look at.


What about the good old private sector banks and especially now the corporate banks which just about everyone seems to be recommending and autos? Do you think there will be a big sectoral churn?
When I said fresh highs, what I meant was that I think this 11200 that has not been crossed will be taken out. Whether we will cross 11600 I am not sure but I would not be surprised if we saw a new high before the elections itself.

 So the point here about this is that what will make these new highs happen. PSU banks, pharma will be at the forefront. I am sure Reliance will play its role there, no question. In terms of the good old spaces that people have been invested in, ultimately you need mutual funds and large FIIs to hold these and they continue to hold these. 

I do not think they offer great excitement especially if multiples are recommending those. These are best avoided because it is not often that multiple recommends make money. It is going to be a normal sort of thing. The real alpha is going to be generated elsewhere and we have dwelt on multiple spaces."
2,2019-03-06,Bajaj Finserv,"Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President & CEO, YES Securities, believes that there will be a derating of most of NBFCs by rating agencies and analysts. He laid bare the preference for corporate finance banks such as ICICI and Axis. He spoke to ETNow. 


Edited excerpts:


Within large caps, would you say it is going to be more a broad based move or again the move is going to be narrow, the six-seven stocks are performing?

So, we have chosen sectors. Let me not say sectors, it is stocks that we like in this space. We continue to like the corporate finance ones, which are your ICICI and Axis, and the preference is given to Axis because of the focus towards growth rather than sustenance that ICICI is trying. they are basically trying to maintain and not falter too much whereas Axis has decided to put growth path on their radar. 

Then you have L&T as a pick in the same space, thanks to also the infra spending that has happened and the fact that their businesses are more broad based and their credit cycles have become shorter. It is a more lucrative business. They have cut margins, but they have made sure the cycles are shorter which is core of the business that they have functioned with. Lastly, in the space that is there, it is a momentum move that has continued in the steel sector and so we are bullish on JSW Steel in that space. 

We have stuck to the largecaps, but specific ones. I do not think it is sector wise that we have gone ahead with. There is only one midcap that we have in our pick at this point of time and that is Birla Corp and that too because of the fact that they are central India focussed and they have a lot of infra projects that have come in out there. That is more or less the basket we have gone ahead with.



Let us take a look also in terms of what we are seeing in the IT pack and a lot of strength that seems to be building out there. What is your take on that in terms of the potential going forward, whether or not it is a defensive play or there is genuinely scope here to see more room for growth as well?

In the IT sector, you have two picks that we have when we continue to have over the last quarter or so, which has given results for most of our clients. It remains TCS in the large cap space that we have taken and Persistent in the midcap space, both because of the futuristic move they have made towards products. Because that is where the margins are going to lie, that is where demand lies, that is where you are going to make sure the differentiation between you and the next player. 

You stick to these sectors because of the simple fact that it is not a three-month or a six-month view. This is a good two-year view. They have managed to transform themselves at TCS. They had hardly around 4-5 per cent of their top line coming in from their businesses which were apart from services. 

Around 23-25% of their top line now comes in from their product businesses and allied businesses, the digital business that they have talked about. So interesting stories to play out and it will continue to hold good for some more time.


I understand you are suggesting to buy corporate banks and the mess through which NBFCs have gone. The one beneficiary pocket of this mess has been corporate banks because that is where more lending would start because NBFCs are dealing through their problems. Going through your note, you are saying liquidity issues in NBFCs will get better now. I understand you have hands-on experience of functioning of NBFCs. Just for our viewers, please explain what is happening in the NBFC space at this point when it comes to liquidity and also if you feel that liquidity pressure is going to ease. Which are those NBFCs and let us not get into consumer NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv of the world? Which are the NBFCs which would capitalise on this liquidity enhancement which would happen in the near future?


What clients need to understand is that the last two quarters have gone by post around September when the crisis actually started off. Most of the NBFCs were lending for a long term, but they had been borrowing for short term because they get cheaper rates to borrow either from a bank or a mutual fund or by CPs that they had issued or by way of NCDs. 

So you have a six-year book, 10-year book based on whether it is a housing loan that you have given or whether it is a car loan or some other short term loan. 

So how do you start lending again, how do you build a book, how do you comeback into growth, those are the concerns that NBFCs have which will continue over the next one odd quarter. By the time the situation will ease off, there is no default and there will be confidence which will come back into the money markets and there will be lending which will start again to this sector. 

It is a crucial segment, it is practically around 30-35 per cent of the retail lending space which is catered to by these players. So it is a crucial area, it needs to be watched. 

Actually one of the NBFCs we have is CanFin Homes. It is a pure retail lending play in the NBFC space. It is among the very few that we have chosen apart from obviously the large ones like HDFC Ltd. because of the pedigree and the way they have been able to manage raising funds and deploying it also.

Does the move so far and especially the kind of broader market recovery that we have seen of late, does it look deceiving and do you think it is going to falter soon or is it looking a little bit more convincing this time?

So the good portion is that it has given a lot of relief to a lot of HNIs which have been beaten black and blue as far as midcaps and smallcaps are concerned. There is a lot of relief on that side. But it is a little too premature. 

There are still events that are supposed to flow out in the next quarter or so, which includes the elections, liquidity push and as far as NBFC is concerned, they have still not seen an end to it and lastly the pickup of economy which is the last portion of it. In this, elections seems to be moving towards a consensus and that will firm up the moment your election season is over. 

As far as liquidity is concerned, the NBFCs that we have spoken to have managed to tide over the short-term crisis. Now the growth will happen, but there will be a derating of most of NBFCs by the rating agencies and analysts. So you will have some pain there. My belief is that you are in the top end of the spectrum as far as valuations are concerned. 

You will again see a range between 10,400 and 11,100-11,200. In that range, your markets will ease off and it will start picking up from the bottom post the Q1 getting over anywhere. It is around that period that we will expect the markets to start taking off and you should build up a portfolio for the long term in the midcap space. The next quarter is a largecap space that I will stick to because midcaps have run up way ahead of their fundamentals at this point."
3,2019-03-11,Bajaj Finserv,"The market tends to downsize the valuations of large conglomerates, as it is difficult to analyse them. Parent companies, therefore, often quote at a discount to their intrinsic values. “It is easy to analyse standalone companies. A number of businesses makes analysis quite difficult. Since the risk is higher, the market gives only lower valuation,” says Shailendra Kumar, CIO, Narnolia Financial Advisors.

Also, with holding companies, investors are forced to buy several businesses, all of which may not be their favourite, and this also leads to lower valuations. Another reason is that most Indian holding companies are investment companies of their promoters, and their actions may often be in the interest of the promoters and not of the minority shareholders. Finally, the valuation differentials across countries also contribute to the parent company discount. For instance, Maruti Suzuki is now quoting at a premium to its Japanese parent, Suzuki Motor Corp.


Sound investment bets
As discounts of some holding companies have recently increased, they have become quite promising. “About 30%-40% holding company discounts are common in India and, therefore, go with companies with larger discounts,” says Daljeet S. Kohli, Fund Manager, Valentis Advisors.

But you need to be careful of intergroup transfers that may favour promoters and not the retail investors. For instance, the recent decision of Cairn India Holding—a subsidiary of Vedanta—to pay Rs 1,430 crore to Volcan Investments—the parent company of Vedanta—to invest in Anglo American, held by Volcan, has raised concerns. You should also avoid parent companies that are quoting at a discount because of poor corporate governance. Also, you need to stay invested for the long term, as it can take time before a parent company decides to unlock the value in the subsidiary companies.

After taking all of the above into consideration, the following holding companies seem ripe for investment*.


1. Bajaj Holdings: Robust growth of subsidiaries
Total value of holdings: Rs 68,215 crore
Market-cap of Bajaj Holdings: Rs 35,270 crore
Discount: 48% 

 Bajaj Holdings has several fast growing companies under its umbrella. It has direct investment in Bajaj Auto, and holdings in Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance through Bajaj Finserv. “Consumer durables finance penetration is only around 20% and Bajaj Finance has around 70% market share. Despite strong growth in past five years, Bajaj Finance’s loan book should grow at 32% CAGR over 2018-19 to 2020-21,” says a recent Jefferies India report. It’s unlisted subsidiaries, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, are also doing well. Given the performance of all its subsidiaries, the 48% discount to net asset value (NAV) is not justified.


2. Godrej Industries: Holds promising unlisted firms
Total value of holdings: Rs 30,644 crore
Market-cap of Godrej Inds: Rs 16,868 crore
Discount: 45% 

 After the listing of Godrej Agrovet, Godrej Industries has almost became a holding company because it generates major value from its listed subsidiaries and associate companies. However, the business of the parent company, which mostly deals in chemicals now, is not negligible—it generated revenue and net profit of Rs 573 crore and Rs 50 crore, respectively, during the third quarter of 2018-19. As it has several unlisted subsidiaries with 100% holdings, the actual discount is much more than the 45% computed on the basis of its listed subsidiaries.


3. Grasim Holdings: Parent sees sharp growth
Total value of holdings: Rs 84,823 crore
Market-cap of Godrej Inds: Rs 53,131 crore
Discount: 37% 

 Since the domestic demand for VSF—a biodegradable fibre— continues to be robust, the standalone business of Grasim is also doing well. While its revenue for the third quarter of 2018-19 grew 21% year-on-year (y-o-y), to Rs 5,293 crore, its net profit grew 28%, y-o-y, to Rs 608 crore. The outlook for its standalone business remains robust. While its discount based on listed subsidiaries is placed only at 37%, this does not consider its booming standalone business. Even at a PE of eight, based on its last year’s standalone net profit, this division should be valued at Rs 14,000 crore, which will take the discount to 46%. While most of its subsidiaries are also doing well, there is concern about its loss-making telecom subsidiary—Idea. However, Grasim’s Idea holding came down to 11.55%, after the telco’s recent merger with Vodafone.

• Ambit Capital has initiated coverage on Page Industries with a sell rating and target price of Rs 20,000. Recent growth slowdown is caused by disruption (GST-related), discontent in wholesale channel, rising competition from Van Heusen and Jockey’s weakness in female innerwear, said Ambit.

The Nifty50 hit a new lifetime high of 11,761 on Wednesday, but failed to hold its gains ahead of RBI’s money policy and witnessed sharp decline towards 11,630 level amid profit booking. The index formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern followed by two Doji candles on the daily scale and also negated the formation of higher lows of last six sessions by slipping below the previous day’s low of 11,655.

Overall, the medium-term trend of the market is positive, but a pause in the positive momentum with negative divergence in the RSI indicators suggests some consolidation is required for a decisive move beyond its lifetime high of 11,761. It has immediate support near the 11,550 mark while hurdles are placed at 11,760 level. A decisive range breakout is required for the next leg of rally.

India VIX moved up 3.89 per cent to 18.78. VIX started to hold at higher levels. It needs to cool off to shift its base to higher levels, else volatile swing could start in the market.

On the Options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800. There was Call writing at 11,900 followed by 12,000 levels while Put writing was seen at 11,500 followed by 11,700. The option band signified a broader trading range between 11,500 and 11,800 levels.

Bank Nifty got stuck in a range since last five sessions and failed to hold above the 30,500-30,650 zone. It witnessed a decline towards 30,000 level amid profit booking and formed a bearish candle on the daily scale, which suggests the immediate support zone is being tested. Now Bank Nifty has to respect the immediate support at 29,888 to again attract buying interest towards 30,250 and then 30,500 levels while next major support is seen at 29,750 level.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,724 level with a loss of 0.47 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Marico, Bajaj Finserv, OFSS and Pidilite Industries while shorts were seen in Amara Raja Batteries, BPCL, Dish TV and HPCL.

9,2019-04-09,Bajaj Finserv,"India needs stronger NBFCs to take financial inclusion forward, says Sanjiv Bajaj, MD and CEO, Bajaj Finserv. In an interview with ETNow, he said his company is in a superior position because of the value proposition it brings to the table. Edited excerpts:


What are your readings of the financial landscape in India?

There are multiple issues over here and that is why this is not an easy answer. I think as far as Indiabulls is concerned, they are in a peculiar situation and maybe this is a solution for them if they get RBI approval. I do not know too much detail other than what one reads in the papers. 

There is an equally strong opportunity in this country whether you are a bank or you are an NBFC, and that is something we as Bajaj Finance have demonstrated over the last 10-11 years that you do not need a bank licence to do 70 per cent of what a bank does and yes, you cannot do 30 per cent. 

This country is so large, it is so deeply unpenetrated if that is the right English as far as financial services concerned. So, we have a lot to do and we have been able to show that. I believe that there are too many limitations around the banking licence which will interest good long-term promoters to apply. 

For example, it is silly to have a rule to say you have to come down to 15 per cent ownership. Why? If we are building something of high quality, if I can today manage Rs 70,000 crore of insurance policy holders money for the long term, what is difference if that customer is a banking customer? 

Insurance industry has shown since 2001 that it can be trusted and we have to get away from the old ways of thinking that no businessman can be trusted to trusting the ones who have proven themselves and allowing them to build within a certain set of regulatory limitations businesses. 

Are you therefore saying you may not be interested in applying for a banking licence or going down the M&A route for a bank unless you see the rules of the game change, unless for example the Reserve Bank relooks at promoter ownership issue?

All I can say at this point is we are not looking at it.


But do you think this is a healthy sign...?

It's difficult to answer that without understanding the details of the situation. As I said, this a particular situation and if that is the right answer for them as long as it meets RBI’s requirements and shareholder approval, that is their call to make. But clearly, this country needs many more banks and many stronger NBFCs if we have to really take financial penetration to the masses.


When the government changed rules for FDI, there was all this talk of how the gates were going to open the floodgates. We did not really see that happen. And there was a lot of talk whether your joint venture would stand or whether we would see the put-call option. It did not happen. Is anything on the cards?

Nothing is on the cards. When the government was opening this, we told them as well that do not expect that because a lot of the large insurance companies were already adequately capitalised and they were making a reasonable amount of money. So, they did not need the additional capital. 

The additional capital was only if the foreign promoter wanted to take their stake up and we have seen that in a few companies. You had to also keep in mind that the last 4-5 years when this happened has been a very volatile period globally and it depends on the priorities of the foreign promoter. India fits into most of their long-term priorities.

It very much does so for Allianz from what I know, but they are very comfortable with the way the businesses are being run right now. The businesses are profitable. They do not need to put in more capital into the company. Neither of us has done that for almost 10 years now and they are happy to use that capital elsewhere where they need to grow further.


They are going to stay where they are, is this what you are basically saying?

At this point, yes till they come back to us with some...


You have a sense of the consumption story and how the economy is performing. Is it really as good as the incumbent government tells us or is it as bad as the Opposition tells us?

We see some trends on the consumer side that does not necessarily mean it is the only proxy for how the economy is doing. But for us, the closest big day was Gudi Padwa which just got over, especially in Maharashtra, which is the new year there. 

And we saw different growth curbs. Urban India did grow for us, but growth was slower. 

Tier II to tier IV towns were growing at twice the rate and I think this is something that we are seeing consistently over the last year or two. Just with greater wealth creation and availability of financial services, aspirations are growing, whether you are in tier IV or tier I. 

Maybe, your pocket is a little smaller. We are seeing these aspirations driving consumption and we are seeing it very strong in outside say the top 70-80 cities.


How do I juxtapose that with other indicators that are coming in, for example auto sales? The auto companies cannot understand why sales are not taking off at all that will have a domino impact on a company like yours. 

It should have. It should have a domino impact on the industry. As a company, we are slightly in a superior position because of the value proposition we are able to do with our instant loans, with our small ticket insurance which gives us the additional volume. 

But yes to the larger industry, it should be. The larger industry has not shown very strong credit growth if you look at the banking industry. If you look at general insurance on the other hand, the industry has grown at about 13-14 per cent, but we have grown almost at twice that rate. So, it varies. We are not necessarily the right proxy for the industry, at least these recent years because we have been able to outperform.


If I just look at housing, that has not taken off. Since politics is the flavour of the season, allow me to say this, housing in the last five years of the Modi government has not taken off the way it was supposed to. They have tried a lot of sops, it has not taken off. That also has an impact on a company like yours and the economy.
Housing to me is a very large opportunity for a very long period, at least from a housing finance point of view. This is even for those that are actually building houses across all price points from affordable to at least four bedrooms which would be for the upper middle class and even the rich. 

The really high end one is limited by definition. If you see what has happened in the last 4-5 years, we have not seen rates go down dramatically. But what we have seen is a whole bunch of enactments come in on housing, especially RERA. 

RERA has been very welcome. States that have fully enacted -- and I believe Maharashtra is one of the leading states -- are already seeing benefit of that. But these things take time to play out. Housing is a long-term game. 


But there are a lot of issues in housing too. The RBI governor is also hoping to address them. He has talked about a committee at the last press conference. As an important industry stakeholder, how do you react to that and what is the kind of clean-up that is needed?

The simple thing is that if I am going to give a loan for 10-15 years for housing, I need to borrow for 10-15 years to prevent asset-liability mismatch. Today, there are not too many people who can lend 10-15-year money. One of the very few industries that have long-term money is insurance and pension. 

As an insurance manufacturer, 50 per cent of my investments have to be in government securities. Here, I am giving money to the government in a non-competitive manner. How do I build the sector? A lot of these broader rules have to be corrected which will automatically improve I would say the foundation for housing finance companies. 

Most housing finance companies do not want a high mismatch between the asset and liabilities but they have no choice and you cannot do a 3-year housing loan."

13,2019-04-13,Bajaj Finserv,"It's a question of three Es -- economy, earnings and elections, not necessarily in the same order.

The heat is showing on Indian stocks as the market posted first weekly fall in eight. This followed the IMF lowering India’s growth estimate for 2018-19 and the next two years as well. 

Though corporate earnings for the March quarter kicked off on a strong note on Friday, thanks to TCS and Infosys, investors are wondering what lies ahead.

General elections, which got under way on Thursday and run till May 19, is adding to this level of uncertainties though a win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi is largely being priced in.

Despite all these unknowns, some buying over the last two days of the week kept the downside in the market to a minimum. 

The BSE Sensex slipped 95 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 38,767 on April 12, from 38,862 on April 5. Likewise, the NSE Nifty came off 23 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 11,643 during the same period.

The next week will be a truncated one as the market is shut on Wednesday and Friday for Mahavir Jayanti and Good Friday, respectively. 

Among key data points, WPI inflation for March is slated for Monday. On the global front, Chinese GDP and industrial production data due on Wednesday, along with Opec Meeting, will inject a sense of caution.

Below is a list of top stocks and sectors that made news through the whole week.


Stocks that rallied up to 30%
As many as nine stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Rain Industries (up 30.85 per cent), PC Jeweller (28.68 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (22.92 per cent), Shankara Building Products (16.66 per cent) and Jai Corp (15.20 per cent). 


Pain for 3 scrips Just three stocks such as Century Plyboards (down 11.53 per cent), PNB Housing Finance (down 11.86 per cent) and Reliance Communications (down 22 per cent) on the BSE500 plunged in double digits. 


IPO update
The initial public offering (IPO) of wires and cables manufacturer Polycab India, which was open for subscription from April 5-9, got subscribed over 51.96 times during the week. The Rs 1,345-crore IPO received bids for over 91 crore shares against the total issue size of more than 1.76 crore. 


Lacklustre debut
Shares of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited made a flat market debut on Thursday, listing at its issue price of Rs 19 on BSE and NSE both. The scrip settled 3.94 per cent up at Rs 19.80 on the NSE.


Q4 off to good start
IT majors TCS and Infosys beat Street expectations on Friday with some solid March quarterly numbers. The results came in after market closing. 

While TCS earnings grew 17.7 per cent in January-March from a year earlier, Infosys posted a 10.5 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,078 crore. TCS stock settled 0.26 per cent down at Rs 2,013.75 ahead of earnings whereas Infosys gained 0.63 per cent to Rs 747.85. 

“With robust TCV (total contract value) signings and improving business visibility, we believe that Infosys would gradually catch up in revenue growth with TCS in FY2020E and in turn would narrow the valuation gap with TCS, going forward. Thus, we maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs 840,” said brokerage firm Sharekhan.


Stocks @fresh all-time high
As many as 13 stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs. The list includes stocks such as ICICI Lombard Life Insurance, Gillette India, Bajaj Finserv, PVR, SKF India, Pidilite, Honeywell Automation, Info Edge (India) and Infosys.


Sectoral scene
Sector-wise, BSE Auto as well as FMCG, Healthcare and Power indices rallied more than 1 per cent. However, BSE Telecom, Metal, Teck, IT and Consumer Durables weakened up to 2.84 per cent. 


Top Nifty gainers/losers
Wipro: With a rally of 8.13 per cent during the week, Wipro was the top gainer in the Nifty pack. Tata Motors (up 5.26 per cent), Bajaj Auto (up 5.12 per cent), Cipla (up 4.28 per cent) and ITC (up 3.80 per cent) brought up the rest of the list. 

Wipro is scheduled to announce its results on April 16. It's set to announce its largest buyback of Rs 12,000 crore ($1.7 billion) on the same day following Sebi's nod to the proposal. 

On the other hand, Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 8 per cent), Asian Paints (down 5.01 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 4.12 per cent) lost the game in the 50-share Nifty pack.

Asian Paints scrip fell after a fire at its paint manufacturing facility in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The manufacturing operations have been affected since. 


DHFL skids
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) came down by over 3 per cent to Rs 167.10 on Friday after rating agency Brickwork Ratings India downgraded its secured NCDs and subordinated debt instruments. An ETNow report suggested that US-based large private equity (PE) player Lone Star Funds is eyeing a stake in the company. 


But SpicJet takes off
Shares of SpiceJet rallied over 10 per cent after the airline announced induction of new aircraft into its fleet. According to a BSE filing, the company will induct 16 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft on dry lease in the next 10 days after regulatory approvals. 


Takeover buzz lifts Ruchi Soya
Shares of Ruchi Soya Industries climbed over 12 per cent to Rs 7.30 on April 12, from Rs 6.50 on April 5. An ET report suggested that Patanjali Ayurved’s proposed acquisition of Ruchi Soya has reached the final stages with the committee of creditors (CoC) scheduled to meet next Tuesday to clear the deal."
14,2019-04-15,Bajaj Finserv,"JM Financial has a buy call on Cholamandalam Financial Holdings (CFH) with a target price of Rs 620.

The current market price of Cholamandalam Financial Holdings is Rs 490.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Cholamandalam Financial Holdings price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage-

Provides a broader exposure to financials, similar to Bajaj Finserv: CFH is not just a pure lender. It has a more diversified play in the financial space as it offers exposure to both a consumer NBFC and general insurance. We believe CFH is a wealth creation candidate (similar to Bajaj Finserv) as both its businesses have attained a good scale (CIFC is the third largest asset finance company (AFC) in India and Chola MS is the seventh largest private general insurer) in underpenetrated and fast-growing verticals, both have championed their respective retail-oriented businesses, and there is tremendous scope to further increase scale and better the operations of these businesses.


Cholamandalam MS General Insurance - Efficient player in a highly lucrative general insurance industry: Indian general insurance has posted an 18 per cent CAGR in premiums during FY14-18, and outlook remains better as the industry is still significantly under-penetrated, urbanisation is rising and significant increase in asset ownership is expected. Moreover, given the low solvency and high underwriting losses of state-owned insurers who collectively have over a 50 per cent market share, we expect a structural shift towards stronger private players. Cholamandalam MS GIC with a strong JV partner, credible management, and controlled combined ratio will be a prime beneficiary. After a subdued FY19E due to investment losses (IL&FS Bonds) and higher claims in crop insurance, we build in GWDP / PAT CAGR of 15 per cent / 35 per cent during FY19E-21E, driven by growth recovery due to rationalisation of commission expense, shift in business mix away from Motor TPs, better claims ratio and normalisation in investment return. Capital infusion by both the partners is a possibility given that the solvency ratio is just above the minimum mandatory requirement.


Growth in value of investments + reduction in Holdco discount = market Cap expansion: CFH at the current price, quotes at a 41 per cent discount to the fair valuation of its investment companies, which is almost double the discount of Bajaj Finserv (quotes at 21 per cent discount at CMP). Unlike just an investment holding company, CFH has a majority holding and management control in both its businesses which should lead to a lower holding company discount. Given the 20 per cent PAT CAGR forecast during FY19E-21E and FY21E ROE of 19 per cent, we value CFH at Rs 620/Share on a SOTP basis giving it a 25 per cent holding company discount. KEY RISKS- Material slow down in commercial vehicle sales, abrupt rise in credit spreads, regulatory change in motor TP insurance segment, higher losses in crop / motor Insurance portfolio, catastrophe risk."
17,2019-04-16,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: The Nifty Financial Services index was up with its components trading higher in Tuesday's afternoon session.

Shares of ICICI Bank (up 3.58 per cent), Axis Bank (up 1.23 per cent), ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company (up 1.15 per cent) and Edelweiss Financial Services (up 1.14 per cent) were the top gainers in the index.

16,2019-04-16,Bajaj Finserv,"Whenever you see new kid on the IPO block, there will be positive excitement around it because merchant 
  
  
  bankers would also have their bit to do in terms of pushing it, said Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 

History is telling us not to worry about elections and move on, but street beleieves we will take a view only post the election verdict. Why is that?
What is playing in the minds of investors is the fact that for almost about 15 months or so, there has not been any meaningful appreciation in the portfolios, if you leave aside the top four to five index heavyweights. The performance of the broader market has not been that great. When for an extended period of 12 to 15 months, the portfolio gains are mediocre, that definitely weighs on decision making. 

Given the fact that even the earnings growth has not been that great and you have a major event coming up, that probably would put people into some kind of a tight spot. But if you look at the overall retail activity, particularly in March, mutual fund inflows have definitely improved. So, I agree that the participation has not been that great but given the fact that March has been a much better month and you have an event like election which would bring in a lot of volatility, retail participation from here on can increase. 


There are no signs of a breakthrough when it comes to the saga at Jet Airways. Now it seems like the talks have really drawn a blank. There is going to be another crucial board meeting that will extend today. What is the worst case scenario you can think for Jet Airways in light of this?
It is a sad episode for the Indian airline industry that one of the best performing airlines is going through this kind of a period. The fact that it is taking more time to get the funds and to bring in a new investor, is not boding well for the company because international operations have been halted and if they are not able to get the intervening relief, then there will be question marks on domestic operations also.

It is not a great news for the sector per se and let us hope that over the next few days they are able to at least get some fund infusion. If a very strong investor comes in, then the stock can start stabilising from here on.


The entire Nestle India royalty is not as bizarre a case like Jubilant Foodworks and a royalty here is only justifiable, but would it go down well with minority shareholders if the quantum is a little too high?
This royalty issue has always been there for many of the MNC companies and whenever there is some increase or a new proposal, there is going to be a lot of media hype around it and there can be a bit of a negative knee-jerk reaction. But the companies are very strong and they enjoy a brand and product franchise. I do not think the market is going to be too much worried about it and in case of Nestle, last year has been good. They have been able to win the market share. The entire controversy around Maggi has died down. and the company has started really doing pretty well on the volumes front. I do not think we should read too much negatively into this royalty issue at this point of time.


Suddenly there is a lot of interest in the insurance space. Is this a pure rotation, a migration of flows not by choice but by compulsion?
It is possible that some part of the money which is meant for investments in the financial services space could move into the insurance space. For the last couple of months, we have seen major deals happening over there. In ICICI Pru, we could see a big investor coming in and from there the stock has recovered. 

The larger issue for the insurance company has been that a company like Prudential ICICI which has a larger dependence on the ULIP related products. There is a sense that dependence will go down and overall in the pure term plan segment per se, the companies are delivering a very healthy growth. A combination of this new money coming in and the fact that with the ULIP related issues have actually played out, people are becoming a little more positive and partly also because some of the companies could be included in some of the indices where the rebalancing is happening will also bring in an element of new flows. 

A combination of these factors are playing out and we continue to be positive on that sector. Our preferred stock is definitely Bajaj Finserv which has general insurance as well as life insurance and is quoting at a discount of about 12% to 15% to HDFC Life and ICICI Pru.


It is good to see that the IPO market is thriving again. The subscription numbers were absolutely amazing. What is so unique about Polycab India? Why is there was so much interest in a business which is more a B2B and less a B2C business?
The product range and the business model of Polycab is pretty similar to some of the names like Havells or V-Guard or KI Industries, Crompton etc. with consumer products a decent amount of volume growth of about 12 to 15%. 

Polycab could be one of the companies that will fit into that particular segment. They have a very decent market share and they are also moving into those newer categories where growth could be in excess of about 12-15%. The market at this point of time likes to move into these kind of niche companies with a decent amount of brand volume growth in excess of 10%. We have not had any major IPO pipeline because of the weak sentiment in the broader market. Whenever you see new kid on the block, there will be positive excitement around it because merchant bankers would also have their bit to do in terms of pushing it. It could be a decent company from investor perspective.


Who is buying Tata Motors?
If you look at the last monthly numbers particularly from the markets like US, UK and some of the other markets, the data has shown a marked improvement. Also, after the S&P downgrades, the management came out and gave a positive guidance in terms of their overall growth and the sense one is getting is that after such a huge underperformance, finally the stock has started catching up on the domestic market because of the product rollouts that they have had, met with some amount of success. 

I think some people might be taking a call that the worst is over in terms of operational performance and price performance and risk rewards looks better but it has been the most difficult stock to track in terms of what is really happening. We have always had a neutral stance on the stock for quite some time and we continue to remain that way.


What is your view on Dr Reddy’s? Their Bachupally unit, which accounts for 45% of the US revenues, has got an EIR by the USFDA. Would you be willing to buy DRL just yet?
Yes, this development is quite positive because the lifting of the warning letter or this EIR that they have got for Bachupally is definitely important. What is more important is that within a very short timeframe, they could actually bring in this particular EIR and overall, most of the pharma companies the US business is stabilising and on a quarter-on-quarter basis, there has been a decent amount of growth with margin and outlook continuing to be good. 

Some of these stocks present a good investment opportunity and we expect even DRL to do well from a 12-month perspective at current price point."
15,2019-04-16,Bajaj Finserv,"Want to beat the Nifty 50’s returns over the next 12 months? Go contrarian. That’s what the one-year forward Bloomberg consensus target prices of Nifty 50 companies suggest.

According to the consensus, the Nifty will gain 7.2 per cent in a year — is one of the highest anticipated return among major global markets. The quirky part, however, is the stocks that are expected to gain more than 10 per cent have been underperformers over the past six months. These include ONGC, Hindalco, Mahindra & Mahindra, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Zee Entertainment. In addition, the stocks including Reliance Industries, UltraTech, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Bajaj Finserv, which have largely driven the current rally, seem to have reached full potential.




Barring L&T, the other four stocks, which are likely to offer the highest upsides, failed to generate returns in the past six months while the Nifty rose 11.2 per cent during the same period. ONGC has the highest likely upside of 28 per cent in the next 12 months.

Among the index heavyweights, HDFC Bank, ITC, Hindustan Unilever and ICICI, which together have 24 per cent weight in the Nifty, offer an upside of 10.4-12.6 per cent over the next one year.

The top 10 stocks, which have 20 per cent weight in the Nifty, earned 19.7 per cent return in the past six months pushing the index to record levels. Among them, eight stocks now trade above their consensus target prices. Wipro has the maximum downside of 10 per cent followed by Bajaj Auto (8.6 per cent downside) and Bajaj Finserv (10.1 per cent downside) over the next 12 months."

19,2019-04-19,Bajaj Finserv,"Mumbai: RBL Bank posted a 39 per cent profit growth in the March quarter on the back of robust credit growth and other income, and also laid out plans to raise Rs 3,500 crore in capital as it looks to accelerate corporate lending.

The private sector lender’s earnings grew to Rs 247 crore from Rs 178 crore, a year ago, while their consolidated loan book grew 35 per cent to Rs 54,000 crore in this period.

Net Interest Income (NII), the difference between what it earned and what it paid for funds, increased 44 per cent to Rs 2,540 crore. RBL’s shares fell 0.5 per cent to Rs 677.



“Our retail lending portfolio is growing faster, but our corporate portfolio has also seen a healthy growth,’’ said Vishwavir Ahuja, MD and CEO, RBL. “In our experience, large corporate loans have seen lesser stress than medium and small corporates. “We would be looking to grow our wholesale book by 20 per cent over the next year by targeting a 25 per cent growth in advances to large corporates.”

Partnership with technology players such as CreditVidya for loan underwriting and fintech-NBFC Bajaj Finserv helped the lender register healthy growth in its micro finance and credit card businesses with 41 per cent and 135 per cent yearly growth respectively.

“We have now 17 lakh credit card holders of which 10 lakh have been through our partnership with Bajaj Finserv,” Ahuja said.

Stress in its agri-related assets due to farm loan waivers and tractor sale slowdown grew. Gross NPA rate remained stable at 1.38 per cent down from 1.40 per cent in March quarter last year. Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) in correspondence also rose to 65 per cent from 57.6 per cent in this period.

“There has been some uptick in standard provisioning as we took additional provisions due to some stress in the agri portfolio. The last leg of demonetisation related provisioning which was spread over last year has also now been completed,” said Ahuja.

Though the bank’s capital adequacy ratio remained above regulatory needs at 13.4 per cent, it would raise around Rs 3,500 crore through share sales in the next 18 months.

""Investors resorted to profit booking as weak results from banks and auto hit investor sentiment. However, a late recovery in IT and metal stocks helped minimise losses,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

0,2019-05-01,Bajaj Finserv,"MUMBAI: The prevailing stress in debt mutual funds is prompting investors to put incremental money into fixed deposits and non-convertible debentures (NCDs). Investment advisors say fixed deposits and NCDs of top-rated NBFCs are seeing higher inflows these days than last year with returns from various debt mutual funds taking a knock due to ratings downgrades of securities and defaults.

Fixed deposits with AAA rating such as HDFC Ltd, LIC Housing Finance, Bajaj Finserv and Mahindra Finance, which fetch returns between 8% and 9%, are among the top picks. Senior citizens can earn anywhere around 10-50 basis points extra. Investors have also put some money in recent NCDs issues of L&T Finance, Shriram City Union.

Over the last one year, debt mutual fund schemes have written off their investments in IL&FS, resulting in NAVs or net asset values of these schemes eroding. While a delay in repayment by Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group has sparked concerns among investors, the credit rating downgrades of ADAG group companies last week, which has led to losses in some debt mutual fund schemes, has exacerbated the worries. “While investors continue to use mutual funds to allocate towards equity, in debt they have started increasingly moving to fixed return instruments like AAA- rated fixed deposits and secured NCDs,” said Anup Bhaiya, MD, Money Honey Financial Services, a Mumbai- based distributor of financial products in Mumbai.

Bhaiya said debt portfolio of investors is far bigger than equity and this trend could change as investors are increasingly preferring safety of capital.

“Investors worried about news flows in mutual funds and looking for absolute safety are opting for a combination of company deposits and high-rated NCDs,” says Rupesh Bhansali, head (distribution), GEPL Capital.

In the last one year, returns from debt mutual funds have been volatile. Many schemes which held bonds of IL&FS have eroded investor returns for an entire year. As per Value Research, the liquid category has returned 6.92%, Ultra short term category 6.2%, credit risk category 5.08% and dynamic bond category 7.02%. These returns have been lower when compared to AAA rated company FDs and secured NCDs."

9,2019-05-08,Bajaj Finserv,"There is no point hiding in high priced consumer staples stocks. Go for companies with earnings visibility, said Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

On private banks & erosion in gains 
The FII, FPI flows tell you part of the story. Now we are beginning to see outflows, whereas in the last couple of months, there were inflows. FII outflows at this point are largely concentrated in the frontline names. There has been a fair amount of concentrated selling within the oil pack, HP, BP and Reliance over the last few days. 

But that actually should come to an end given that at some points valuations will matter and so from that perspective, select pockets like oil is looking good; ICICI, Axis is beginning to look okay. So I think that is where you will see but I think you will see some continued FPI outflows in the coming few days. 


On Reliance Industries & Brookfield deal

Irrespective of whether there is stake sale to Brookfield or someone else, Reliance Industries is still an extremely solid company with an extremely good balance sheet. The amount of debt might look high, but in terms of debt equity ratios and various coverage ratios, it remains a very strong company. Now the recent InvIT that Reliance has done with both the fibre and the towers will see some kind of enhanced value, as more tenants come into both the towers business. 

It has optically reduced debt for Reliance Industries. All these steps will contribute and I do not think debt is really an issue in terms of coverage ratio. But clearly, they have plans and very good ones for deleveraging some of their balance sheet. 


On the financial pack & TCG strategy
If you look at the earnings so far, retail banks still continue to be fairly strong but have started weakening. On the other hand, corporate banks have not really picked up. Provisioning has increased across board which means that there is still some more pain left in the system. But if you look at the management commentary, we seem to be closer to the end of the NPA cycle. Against this backdrop, the private banks, ICICI and Axis Bank are trading at very reasonable valuations. Therefore, the amount of downside from current levels is not much. On the other hand, SBI is still a very inexpensive stock and better placed. 

The NBFCs’ loan growth is going to slow down quite significantly from last year. Their valuations have also corrected. But you see pain where they have some exposures to specific groups or companies. You will continue to see some pain but otherwise there is not much downside for banking from current levels.

On Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance.

The valuations are on the high side. These stocks have done well and I think their earnings also are likely to continue to be good. But given the environment, where corporate is slowing down or has not picked up, consumer is slowing down, it would be advisable to continue to be on the sidelines vis-a-vis the Bajaj Finance types.


On media space. Any top calls?
Within the media space, Zee is one story. There will be a stake sale or it will get sold at some point. But what is holding it back is if a promoter, or a founder wants to sell it at a higher price and a buyer wants it at a lower price. It is a very classical Indian story where the founders always hold out and meanwhile the balance sheet strain increases. That is exactly what is happening with Zee and I think sooner rather than later, somebody would have to bite the bullet rather than holding out for a much bigger number. 

As for the rest of the media, TRAI in its zeal to expand viewership amongst the common man, is doing a regulatory overkill. India has one of the lowest cable ubscription rates but in spite of that and a huge population, it is not doing any cable company or distribution company any favours. 


On high-debt companies
The high-debt companies are clearly not the place to be in simply because liquidity still continues to be tight, the cost of funding has gone up and for companies which are in financial problems, cost of funding has really gotten tighter. 

Recovery is still some time away. There is no point hiding in the high priced consumer staples stocks either. Wherever you see earnings visibility, like IT or even the HP, BPCLs which are actually quite inexpensive stocks, are the safer places to be."

12,2019-05-09,Bajaj Finserv,"If somebody has Reliance share in the portfolio, it is a hold. But it is a difficult call to take whether it is a buy at this point of time, said Devang Mehta, Head-Equity Advisory, Centrum India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 


The largecaps have taken quite a beating and Reliance Industries definitely merits a mention given the selling pressure. Now, Morgan Stanley is also rather circumspect and have downgraded the stock saying that the upside is going to be limited. What are you advising on RIL?
The markets have been extremely polarised in the last few months and the rally has been led by five or six businesses including Reliance, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and TCS. Unless the broader market starts participating in the rally, a crack in stocks which were doing extremely well, would cap the rally. 

The correction that we are seeing is more FII driven and that is clearly notable. They have overweight positions in the stocks which I have mentioned earlier. Reliance also is getting a bit of its correction because it has been a dream rally for the stock. I do not see a big challenge in the business as such people knew the earnings of petchem as well as the core business of oil and gas has been slowing down in the last two-three quarters.




But still, the stock was making new highs and this can be a natural correction -- probably 5% more from here as the market ,corrects led by heavyweights. I do not see a big problem emerging. If somebody has it in the portfolio, it is a hold. Whether it is a buy, it is a difficult call to take at this point but it is a good hold in the portfolio.


 The world is migrating towards corporate banks but looking at Yes Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank numbers, would you say the long crowded trade in corporate banks is getting challenged?
There were different set of numbers from different banks. Yes Bank faces a typically different type of problem. There was a kitchen-sinking done after the stock performed very well in the earlier couple of quarter. One quarter is mirroring what Axis Bank or a Yes Bank, ICICI Bank did two-three four quarters back, but there are not many compelling trades in the market in the banking sector. Of course, HDFC Bank commands a premium as a retail bank but clearly if somebody still needs to buy on dips, a better candidate where ROE expansion is going to happen is Axis Bank. The management is talking about 8% ROE getting into an 18% league in another three years.

After the clean-up, there is a lot of scope for these banks to give if not 25-30%, at least 15, 18, 20% type of return CAGR for the next two-three years, particularly for Axis Bank. 

So, yes the cream is out of the rally. The 40-50% return has already been made but it is back to 15-18% boring returns that can be made out of Axis or ICICI.


What is going on with some of these pledged share scenarios like the Essel Group? The fact that Reliance Mutual Fund sold it had created a lot of nervousness in the markets. What is your take?
It is better to avoid the space, where there is a lot of pledged share issue. In last two-three months, there has been bouts of volatility. A lot of these companies have good businesses and good pipeline as well. The numbers also are good for a lot of these companies, but the overhang on these type of stocks have always been the promoter pledge or the debt on the books which is very difficult to manage, during these types of market where on one side, there is polarisation and on the other, market breadth has been very weak. 

So, fundamental has taken a back stage for this type of businesses. It is better to stay away from these types of businesses. If you have to buy at all, go for a screaming buy or place your bet on the valuation side. That way, you do not suffer in the shorter term but over a longer period, you make good returns but yes, refrain from buying into companies where there are pledged shares.


We are gathering that there is going to be a steep hike in cement prices, the second one in the last two months. Your view?
In the last couple of quarters, we have started hunting for such businesses. Generally we refrain from buying more cyclical businesses as we are more into high market share or market leading businesses where there is pricing power. But cement in the last couple of quarters, have been showing a bit of traction. The last quarterly numbers of a lot of companies like UltraTech also see that the demand scenario coming back plus a bit of pricing power with price hikes. 

After a long time, probably the demand for cement is coming back and may be monsoon would be subdued. But for somebody with a one-one-and-a-half-year type of a view, cement presents a good opportunity. Cyclicals is one space where with select capital goods or cement, you can start constructing a portfolio and post election results, if a stable government is in place, the construction demand, infra demand and a bit of housing demand could come back. Cement can act as a proxy play for this type of construction activity.


Do you think one should just get more realistic rather than following a predefined template of buying good companies and great businesses? One should acknowledge that these companies are nowhere available at levels at which they warrant a buy?
There is a clear distinction between a great business, a good business and also a third category which IS classified by Warren Buffett as gruesome business. You do not want to buy any gruesome business in the portfolio at any type of valuation. May be it is a value or a value trap. We do not know any business so gruesome you have to stay away. A good business is probably about some cyclicals you have to time as and when you feel that this is the right price or the cycle is changing. Of course it is very difficult to say but cement and capital goods probably qualify as some of these companies have good business. 

Great businesses are some of the businesses like a Britannia or may be Dabur or HUL. These are types of businesses you do not want to sell or either you want to buy in distress. These are distressed times and probably after a 5% or 10% correction, the price may be right. But Page Industries from Rs 35,000 to Rs 32,000 or Rs 28,000 was probably overvalued. A couple of bad numbers brought it to Rs 22,000 right. Probably you need to time your bets -- that this is a time when you buy some consumption businesses like Page Industries or take a contra call like Eicher Motors which people will not find favour with right now at Rs 20,000. But at Rs 18,000 it would a screaming buy.

So, rather than adventuring into companies which you do not know, get into plain vanilla businesses where you know that the high market share and market leadership would come and help you in good times and which would not shatter you in bad times. So keep your bets ready, keep your list ready and these are the businesses in India which you need to buy. There are 100-150 good businesses where you can make money in a simpler way rather than adventuring out of the 500 stocks that present itself."
13,2019-05-12,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities have been in a free fall since the last eight sessions on worries over US-China trade war, uncertainty over election outcome and uninspiring March quarter earnings.

During this period benchmarks Sensex and Nifty have plunged 4 per cent each. Moreover, investors have lost over Rs 6.42 lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed stocks dropped to Rs 1,46,66,587.70 crore last Friday from Rs 1,53,08,828.49 crore on April 26.

The coming week is expected to see the continuity of the bearish trend, as election developments may keep market jittery, while macro data and global sentiment, too, will have a significant impact.


Here’s take a look at factors that will steer market movement in the coming week:


Election politics: Market is getting more and more nervous as we approaches the end to the 7-stage general elections on May 19. The results will be out on May 23 and analysts say Dalal Street will keep experiencing bouts of volatility till then. 


Trade war saga: After the US raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the world is holding its breath in anticipation of Chinese retaliation.

The two-day US-China trade talks concluded without bearing any fruit. However, hopes have not died completely as both parties agreed to talk about it in the future as well. Reuters, quoting Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, reported that China and the United States have agreed to hold more trade talks in Beijing. Each step in the positive direction will be a tonic for markets across the world.


Inflation prints: India's April retail inflation prints will be out on Monday while the wholesale inflation numbers will be released on Tuesday. In March, the annual retail inflation rate rose to 2.86 per cent. On the other hand, wholesale price-based inflation rose for the second consecutive month to 3.18 per cent in March on costlier food and fuel. While there is the anticipation for a slight uptick in inflation prints for April, the market is hoping that it may still remain under the RBI's target, boosting the chance for another 25 basis point trim in key rates by the country's central bank in June. 


March quarter earnings: HDFC, Vodafone Idea, ITC, Lupin, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, UPL and Bajaj Auto are among the companies that will release their March quarter results next week. The earnings numbers have been mixed and they have failed to lift market mood. Positive signals from the above-mentioned companies may give some food to the low spirited bulls.


Crude's course: As per Reuters, Brent crude futures are holding above $70 a barrel, up 30 per cent this year. On Friday, Brent crude oil settled 0.4 per cent higher at $70.62, but posted a weekly loss of 0.3 per cent. Elevated oil prices will add to the miseries of the Indian equity market as the commodity price has a direct impact on the country's fiscal maths and currency. 


Foreign money: Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 1,245.14 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday, data available with the NSE suggested.

Trade war worries and political uncertainty have triggered an outflow in the foreign fund this month- a sharp contrast to the trend of the last three months. In February, March and April, FIIs pumped in Rs 12,053 crore, Rs 48,751 crore and Rs 16,728 crore, respectively. However in May, as of Friday's close, they have pulled out Rs 3,217 crore, data available with NSDL showed.

If the outflow of foreign money continues, the market may see more downside in the coming days.


Technical indicators: Nifty formed a bearish candle on the weekly chart in the week gone by. Besides, the index has been forming lower highs and lows since the last five sessions and traded below its 50-day EMA, which indicates weakness, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said in the near term, Nifty sustaining above 11,250 level would be crucial for the bulls to prevent further damage."

Board meetings (FULL LIST)
 

Analyst calls
 • Jefferies has maintained buy rating on Nestle India with a target price of ₹12000. Jefferies continues to like Nestle's focus on volume led growth and diversification of the portfolio. Launch of 40 new products in the last 2-3 years and entry into new categories such as dips, breakfast cereals (scalable), premium chocolates, RTD formats, coffee machine etc. will help sustain growth momentum, it said. 

 • HSBC has maintained buy rating on Equitas Holdings and revised target price to ₹158 from ₹160. The brokerage believes that Equitas’ offerings, on the assets side as well as its branch positioning and pricing on the deposits side, position it well to grow loans at about 33% CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) through FY21. Slightly higher credit costs and lower NIMs drive marginal earnings cut, it said. RoEs should cross 10% in FY20 and 13% by FY21, driven by improving leverage, said HSBC. 

• Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on Just Dial and revised target price to ₹680 from ₹605. Over the last few quarters, Just Dial has shown good recovery in revenue growth, led by volume growth, said Morgan Stanley. The firm expects current momentum to continue, based on operating metrics such as addition to ""feet on street"" headcount, sustained traffic growth, and healthy increase in deferred revenues. 

• Credit Suisse has initiated coverage on PI Industries with an outperform rating and target price of ₹1,300. PI can deliver a 20% plus EPS CAGR over the next few years, said Credit Suisse. Given its unique business model, high probability of non-linear growth in coming years and option value from acquisition or branching out into other chemical segments like pharma, this premium multiple will sustain, it said. 

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Union Bank of India and cut target price to ₹96 from ₹105. Union Bank may see earnings normalize from FY21 onwards, said CLSA. With the recent capital infusion, CET I is now 8% and Tier I CAR is 9.5%, but this has diluted BVPS, it added. The brokerage has cut its target price because of this but retained buy rating given reasonable valuation and better CASA franchise.

18,2019-05-16,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a positive start on Thursday amid firm global cues. Market breadth was in favour of buyers. However, steadily rising crude oil prices and selling by foreign institutional investors capped gains.

Asian shares steadied in early trade on news that the US was planning to delay tariffs on auto imports, providing much-needed relief to markets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Australian and South Korean indices were little changed.

Oil prices rose for the third straight day, as the risk of conflict in West Asia stoked fears of supply disruptions, negating an unexpected rise in US inventories. Amid all this, Brent crude futures touched the $72 mark.

India’s trade deficit widened to a five-month high in April as rising crude prices raised import costs and gold imports swelled. 

FIIs have suddenly turned sellers in equities in seven out of last 10 sessions. They offloaded shares worth Rs 1,142.44 crore on Wednesday, NSE data showed. 



At 9:30 am, Sensex traded 24 points, or 0.06 per cent, higher at 37,139 while NSE’s Nifty was up 6 points, or 0.05 per cent, at 11,163. In the 50-pack, 30 stocks advanced, while 20 declined.

Among Sensex stocks, Tata Motors was the biggest gainer, up around 1.07 per cent. Other gainers were Vedanta, Infosys, Bajaj Finance, Powergrid and Tata Steel.

Kotak Bank was the biggest loser, falling over 1 per cent. L&T, Coal India, M&M, HDFC and ITC joined Kotak on the list of losers.


Off the main board, IndiGo shares kept buzzing after reports of serious differences between the two founder-promoters, threatening to affect the airline’s functioning. Clauses in the shareholders’ agreement and differences between the two founders over strategies and ambitions are said to be the bone of contention. IndiGo shares slipped nearly 3 per cent.

The market would watch Hindalco Industries, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Blue Dart, Chambal Fertilisers, DB Corp, JSW Energy, JK Tyre and Shree Renuka Sugars, companies that are scheduled to release quarterly earnings during the day.

The broader market moved in step with the benchmark. BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices traded in line with the overall market mood, gaining 0.16 per cent and 0.13 per cent respectively.

On the sectoral map, barring Capital Goods, Oil & Gas and Realty, other indices gained. BSE Auto was the biggest gainer, up 0.55 per cent."

26,2019-05-17,Bajaj Finserv,"In pharma, Biocon is one of the company’s which has strong revenues and in the coming quarters also, the revenues will be coming up more consistently, said Siddharth Sedani, Head - Vice President - Equity & Portfolio Advisory, Anand Rathi, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Bajaj Finserv seemed to be leading the way today. What is your take on the kind of momentum we are seeing currently?
Talking about Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, the results were quite good and we were very positive on the stock since Rs 2,800 levels. We believe the stock has a potential and it is a consistent performer. 

After a nine-day decline, the market has been rising since Thursday but I would still persist that volatility will be there in the market. Not only until the election results, but post that also. We believe one has to be very picky. This earning season we have been seeing there are mostly misses than hits, so from an overall perspective, earnings are a little tepid.

Added to that, from an overall perspective, the macros are not that exciting. On the global front we know the concerns which are coming. Eventually one has to pick and choose in terms of the market. You cannot go sector specific, you have to pick and choose the particular stock and go about it. This should continue till the election results are out.


There has been constant news flows in many of the pharma names that prove to be disruptive. Also, what kind of price action is there?
That is the case with Sun Pharma and other pharma companies. The pharma space is really vulnerable in the current situation. I still believe that the biosimilar side of the business looks very interesting to me. Biocon is one of the company’s which has strong revenues and in fact in the coming quarters also, the revenues will be coming up more consistently for Biocon. 

Biocon could be the one stock with a target of Rs 823 where we like the story. Although a correction despite quite strong results. There was growth expectation in biosimilar drugs. I still believe that Biocon looks the most interesting in the pharma space.


How do you think Tata Consumer Product, the new entity formed by the merger of the consumer division of Tata Chemicals with Tata Global, is going to function? They are focussing on their core competency, in tandem with the plans that they had laid out earlier. Is it a positive move?
Yes, of course it is, and that has been reflected in the price also since yesterday. However, most of the things are priced in. Consolidation will definitely reap fruits for the company but with a long-term perspective. 

One good thing which happened after consolidation is that a right valuation parameter can be given to a particular set of business, which is a strong moot point for Tata Global now. 

Overall, Tata Global had been an underperformer in last two years. We do not have a recommendation on the stock but I think this move will definitely attract valuation for the stock from the analyst community.


Do you see demand growth returning soon or is it a longer term horizon you have in mind? What is the strategy?
Of course, it has a long-term horizon and the kind of numbers that have been posted both on the volume front for cigarettes as well as FMCG are as per our expectations. Going forward, we may see volume growth coming up. Once we look factor in monsoon in the next three months, FMCG play will be definitely coming up well in terms of volumes and that will be the case with other FMCG plays also. 

Having said that, ITC looks very interesting and compared with its peers in valuation term, it is well priced. This is a good time to buy ITC with a target of Rs 352.


It is going to be a fairly interesting week next week. On Monday, we will see a lot of outcome based on the election exit polls. What are the top midcap picks? Is there any particular sector that you would be pinning your hopes on?

Yes, of course. In the midcap arena, we have been surrounded by companies which have been putting vulnerable numbers. One of the quality plays which we have picked up from the speciality chemical is the Deepak Nitrite. The numbers were quite good. Profits were also up by around 178%. EBITDA margins jumped by 10% to 23-24%. 

On the back of phenol and acetone chemical a new plant which was commissioned in Dahej and we believe the kind of commentary which the management is posting, it seems a strong jump in revenues is expected in the quarters to come. 

We believe this stock can deliver strong returns, strong numbers in terms of performance is concerned. We like this story in the speciality chemical play with a target of Rs 346."

Board meetings (Full list) 



Analyst calls
 • Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Endurance Technologies with a target price of ₹1,350. The brokerage has maintained FY20/ FY21 EPS, as increase in EBITDA margins by 70 bps/50bps was off-set by cut in revenue estimates due to weaker two-wheeler industry outlook. Endurance is the best proxy play on India’s twowheeler industry growth, as it should continue to outperform through sustained increase in content and crossselling, said Motilal Oswal. 

• Reliance Securities has maintained hold rating on Mangalam Cement with a revised target price of ₹255. Continued cost pressure and soft volume dragged Mangalam Cement’s quarterly performance, it said. While commissioning of 11MW WHRS and sustainability of realisation recovery is likely to aid the company to witness a remarkable improvement in its unitary EBITDA in subsequent quarters but considering its below par operating performance even after realisation recovery, stock is unlikely to be re-rated, it added. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has retained reduce rating on IIFL Holdings with a fair value of ₹410. IIFL Holdings reported strong earnings growth even as most operating trends were muted, said Kotak Institutional. Realisations in the wealth business remained weak while capital market-related income declined, it said. Post demerger IIFL Wealth will remain the most preferred franchise even as NBFC’s business models will gradually take shape, the brokerage said. 

• IIFL has a buy rating on Amara Raja Batteries with target price of ₹627. The brokerage has cut EPS estimates by 8-10% on lower revenue growth assumptions. Exide and Amara Raja saw negligible EPS growth over FY17-19, as the strong revenue growth was offset by margin contraction, said IIFL. With margins seeming to have bottomed out, EPS growth may return as soon as demand revives, it added. 

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Jubilant FoodWorks and revised target price to ₹1,500 from ₹1,600. Jubilant Food’s fourth quarter same store sales growth of 6% was much lower than forecasts, said CLSA. The mid-single digit SSG also raises concern of a slowdown due to heightened competition from food aggregators, said CLSA. The brokerage has cut EPS estimates for FY20-FY21 by 7-11% on slowing SSG.

Analyst calls• Reliance Securities has maintained buy rating on JK Tyre and Industries and revised target price to ₹115 from Rs 135. The brokerage said that the company may face challenging environment in the near-term, while its performance is expected to improve from second half of FY20 owing to sustained growth in sales volume, reduction in manpower cost and better cost control. 

• Edelweiss has downgraded Bajaj Finserv to reduce from hold and revised target price to ₹6,481 from ₹5,948 after rolling over valuation to September 2020. Bajaj Finserv reported a mixed performance in the fourth quarter with strong momentum in the financing business and lower profitability in general insurance as well as life insurance, said Edelweiss. 

 • Kotak Securities has a buy rating on Phoenix Mills with a target price of ₹754. Rental renegotiations, new project launches, and completion of under-construction assets are likely to maintain healthy performance for the company going forward, said Kotak Securities. Residential revenues are likely to witness contraction going forward due to revenue recognition largely done during FY19, it said. 

 • Nomura has maintained buy rating on Minda Industries and reduced target price to ₹454 from ₹490. Minda Industries' fourth quarter revenue growth of 8% year-on-year and EBITDA margins at 12.5% were largely in line with our forecast and the consensus estimate, said Nomura. Minda remains a key beneficiary of rising content in vehicles and regulatory push driving adoption of safety and BS-VI, said Nomura.

 • CLSA has maintained buy rating on Jammu & Kashmir Bank and rolled forward target price to ₹68 from ₹50. For the fourth quarter, the bank’s profit was ahead of estimates aided by a better top-line and treasury gains, said CLSA. The bank’s CASA franchise is strong, at 51% of deposits and its focus on home state retail loans will help improve profitability,it added.

36,2019-05-27,Bajaj Finserv,"Narendra Modi’s resounding victory in the general elections has given hope to bargain hunters on Dalal Street. With political jitters easing and a rejuvenated market willing to bet that the government’s focus is on resuscitating the economy, the so-called value stock picks, which have been ignored for a while, seem ready to make a comeback.

Value investors look for stocks that have been beaten down compared to their earnings prospects, turnaround stories or those that have been ignored for a long time. Such stocks tend to go out of favour when risk appetite among investors is low or when stronger companies are valued relatively cheap. Many stocks in infrastructure, telecom, energy, capital goods and the public sector have been ignored for a long time. Similarly, various small-caps were battered in the sell-off in the broader market that started in January 2018, resulting in their Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio — a widely-watched valuations measure — shrinking to single-digits. In these periods, investors mostly focused on quality and growth stocks — the opposite of value. In growth style of investing, the focus is to buy stocks of quality companies that are growing at a steady pace. Private sector banks and consumer companies fall into this category. In the last year or so, the rally in the Sensex and Nifty was led by a clutch of stocks like Reliance, TCS, HUL, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Bajaj Finserv. NSE’s Growth index advanced 12 per cent in the last one year, while the Value index declined 10.5 per cent in the period, showing investor preference for growing companies. Although investors were growing uneasy about valuations of growth and quality companies, the upward momentum continued in the run-up to elections because of uncertainty.

BJP’s election win seems to be changing that. The risk-on sentiment is showing signs of a rebound. The rally on Friday that lifted the Sensex and Nifty to record closing levels was driven by stocks such as ICICI Bank, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Bharti Aitel and L&T — many of which have been laggards for a long time. If investor interest in these stocks is long-lasting, it’s good news for the die-hard optimists because now the market would have fresh sets of legs to carry on its record breaking rally. Clearly, the likes of Reliance, TCS, HUL, Infosys, HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance were out of breath after shouldering the burden of holding up the market.

A more enduring shift in focus from growth and quality to value would be encouraging for the numerous investors in mutual funds and Portfolio Management Services (PMS), whose equity products have been underperforming the benchmark indices since the crash in mid- and small-cap stocks in most of 2018. The narrow rally in a few sets of quality stocks resulted in various equity schemes lagging behind their benchmarks as fund managers have investment restrictions on exposure to each stock. If a new set of stocks lead the rally, it would provide a fillip to equity portfolios. For equity PMS — a product for the rich — a sharp rebound in small-cap stocks would be critical. Shares of some small companies, which are bargains or turnaround candidates, showed some promise last week.

Optimists are pinning hopes on the government and foreign portfolio flows to strengthen the fresh investment thesis. With consumption weakening, investors are hoping the government would boost capital spending to cushion the economic slowdown. Whether foreign investors buy this narrative and the government meets market’s expectations in its Union Budget likely in July will be crucial. Foreign investors have brought in Rs 2,400 crore in the last two days since the election results. Now, it is up to the government to oblige."
37,2019-05-27,Bajaj Finserv,"There is a good chance of a broad-based participation which probably will come and to that extent, increasingly in banks like RBL Bank or City Union Bank, said Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Zee Entertainment is slated to come out with its earnings later today and the expectations are that it could be a fairly tempered quarter. We will be closely watching out for any information on strategic stake sale and then you have the TRAI tariff order as well which could be a little bit of a roadblock. What is your expectation?What we have seen in Zee Entertainment in the last couple of months or in fact a couple of quarters is more or less driven by news flow and management stake sale, how it happens and what happens to the SITI’s stake over there. The numbers can be sort of muted in the current environment but the sense here is that probably somebody who wants to get into the entertainment space (we have fairly been bullish on companies like PVR and Inox), something in the multiplex space where the movie content right now is superb and regional movies plus Hollywood movies as well as all your commercial and offbeat movies have their respective audiences. Plus the F&B revenues do very well. 

If somebody wants to get into the entertainment space right now, PVR or Inox though at an expensive valuation, presents a better opportunity than anything like Zee Entertainment where there are a lot of questions which has to be answered by the management and investors would be keen to know about that type of issues rather than seeing the result and getting into the stock. 


Everybody likes ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. Give me something where there is scope for compounding and yet it is not a very popular or a consensus trade.Probably, we were also more into the consensus trade in the last 6-12 months seeing the polarisation of the markets. But after seeing this type of a mandate, there is a good chance of a broad-based participation which probably will come and to that extent, increasingly in banks like RBL Bank or City Union Bank. Of course, this does not trade very cheap. Among PSU banks, SBI remains the classic favourite but that has also run up. 

A RBL Bank probably seems to grow at around 38-40%. Even in a difficult scenario, it probably would grow at say 28-30%. 

Yes Bank does not sound good right now but seven-eight years back, all the right things were probably done. I sense that financials still has a lot of upside. Consensus trades like Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv probably also on a correction would be still growing at say 30-35% if not more.


What is the view on Divi’s Laboratories after the disastrous earnings?Pharma is still one sector we need to look at in a different way. Most of the pharma companies have disappointed or at least just come out of the loop of that bad earnings which it had overall for the last two to three years. We probably like companies like Abbot Laboratories or Sanofi or Pfizer which are into niche segments into India.

In all these MNC companies, the R&D burden is borne by the parent and they have a lot of US pieces regarding their individualities in terms of the market share on the drugs which they sell. We are more comfortable in this niche space rather than getting into the companies which are more or less related to USFDA, not Divi’s Laboratories but a lot of such companies."

3,2019-06-05,Bajaj Finserv,"It is nine months since Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) imploded. RBI has pumped in nearly Rs 3.6 lakh crore in liquidity since April 2018. Conversion of loans into tradeable securities or securitisation is at record highs. Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have sold assets worth at least Rs 1.3 lakh crore. Defaults by big borrowers are few and far between.

Not just that. Some shadow banking lenders such as Mahindra Financial and Shriram Transport have raised more than a billion dollars in overseas debt. Some others have recovered from a slump and are posting record profits. Still, Anil Ambani, the chairman of a financial conglomerate, declares that the non-banking finance industry is in urgent need of a bailout package for survival.

“The sector has gone into ICCU over the past eight months,” Ambani said in a recent interview with ET. “The contagion and its cascading effect on the economy are clearly visible. In ICCU, if you want to save the patient, what is needed is not paracetamol but full life support.”

Nirmala Sitharaman, the 59-year-old economist from Jawaharlal Nehru University who has just taken charge of the finance ministry, has her job cut out. That is to pull up the economic growth rate, which has slumped to a five-year low. But she is starting her innings with a key player severely injured. It’s like Liverpool Football Club’s Jurgen Klopp going into a Champions League knock-out match without Mohammed Salah.

“The new FM can incentivise banks to lend to private NBFCs,” said Raman Agarwal, chairman, Finance Industry Development Council, a representative body of NBFCs. “The issue of bank’s hesitation and increasing costs needs to be addressed. The situation is critical for small and medium-sized NBFCs, where banks play a big role in providing growth funds.”

Ever since IL&FS defaulted, the entire industry is on the ropes. Mutual funds, a key lender to the segment but without reliably long-term funds, have frozen because of redemption pressures. So NBFCs, a key intermediary that lent to millions of small firms and individuals to buy cars and motorcycles, are unable to meet the demand. SMEs account for 8% of India’s GDP.

That’s partly blamed for the collapse in sale of automobiles and cut in discretionary spending. Automobile sales fell 17% in April, the sharpest decline in almost 8 years, data from Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers shows. Maruti Suzuki, the auto bellwether reported a 19.6% decline in sales; tractor sales by Mahindra & Mahindra, a key indicator to farm economy, were 14.7% less in the fourth quarter than a year ago.

“Basic thing that the government can do is to ensure that growth capital is available to all deserving NBFCs,” said KV Srinivasan, founder of Profectus Capital, backed by private equity firm Actis. “This will create a positive ripple in the financial services sector. Auto sales, two-wheeler and SME have taken a hit because of liquidity squeeze in the past six-eight months.”


LIQUIDITY WINDOWA key demand of the industry has been that the RBI lend funds to NBFCs under an exclusive window by keeping their assets as collateral. This, the industry argues, would help them overcome the resistance of traditional lenders such as banks and mutual funds in lending to them.

“Special window is like giving medicine to a sick patient,” said Piran Engineer, an analyst with Motilal Oswal. “Next time you would not want to fall sick. Prudent players will take a step back and look at their business model.”

NBFCs are preserving liquidity and in the process are shrinking their balance sheets.

“Investors and lenders are showing discomfort for NBFCs that have holes particularly due to related party transactions,” said Abizer Diwanji, national head, EY. “NBFCs, which have excess of 8 times leverage, haven’t been able to manage liquidity well.”

Normal disbursement for Indiabulls Housing was Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 13,000 crore in a quarter. After the IL&FS crisis, Indiabulls reduced disbursements to Rs 3,000 crore in the December quarter and to Rs 7,000 crore in March.

Margins are squeezed due to higher cost of funds and CP primary issuances going down. For instance, the share of CP percentage for Gruh Finance was 20-22%. It has fallen to 15%.

Liquidity balance for NBFCs has gone up to 8-10% from 3-4% before the crisis. Long-term money is even more difficult.

But is it liquidity that’s at the root of the inability of NBFCs to lend?

The net banking system liquidity moved to a surplus in the week ended May 31 to more than Rs 2,000 crore, that is for the first time in more than three months. The average liquidity deficit in May was Rs 38,736 crore, down from Rs 72,014 crore a month before, data from CARE Ratings show. The average call rate at 5.89% in the week was lower than the repo rate of 6%.

If the data is any indication, it is not the liquidity but something else which is holding back NBFCs.

“The control and the regulations for NBFCs are made by the RBI, so probably the new finance minister may have to direct the regulator to lend a helping hand,” says Kuntal Sur, head of financial services at PwC. “It’s not as if they are facing any fiscal or tax hurdle the new FM can help with.’’




STRUGGLING VS THRIVINGSome 200 km away from where Ambani is finalising his asset sales to remain relevant, a competitor is smiling his way to the bank in Pune, the home of the Bajajs.

Sanjiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Finserv, is sitting on the biggest wealth of his life time at ?450 crore as his stock price reaches the sky while Ambani firm’s wealth turned into dust. While Bajaj Finance trades at 10.3 times its book value, Reliance Capital is at 0.2 times, data from Bloomberg shows.

“Investors will trust NBFCs which managed the crisis well without RBI’s assistance, had strong internal norms and diversified into less riskier segments,” said Digant Haria, analyst, Antique Broking. “Those NBFCs to whom banks are willing to buy portfolio but averse to lending will gain confidence gradually as they realign the business practices related to ALM, concentration of sectors, ticket size of loans.”

Painting the entire industry with the same brush would be doing injustice to those who have managed the risk well, while others compromised on it for higher market valuations. Many of the NBFCs, using cheaper funds from mutual funds, borrowed for short term to lend for long term to boost their profitability.

“The NBFC sector on a broad base does not have a problem,” says Gautam Chhugani, director, India financials at Bernstein, a research house. “The problem is concentrated with the real estate-focused NBFCs. The Bajajs, Shrirams, Mahindras are not affected. They are able to raise money and drive disbursements.”

While the chorus was that the entire industry was affected when the credit markets froze last year, there is a realisation that it was only in pockets such as mortgages where there was trouble. There too, it is mostly concentrated in builder loans where inventory has piled up.

“There will be fear when there are sporadic events,” says Rashesh Shah, chairman, Edelweiss Financial. “There was fear when certain corporate groups defaulted. Octoberto-December was very challenging where even I didn’t know who is in what shape even within the industry. After March, I feel confident that all these are all manageable accounts. This is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem as there is value in the asset.”


WHAT’S THE LEGACY?Every top administrator would like to leave behind a legacy that future generations would talk about. In a society where development stands ahead of politics, achievements of economic administrators are keenly watched.

In terms of economics, Manmohan Singh’s legacy as a finance minister is far outshined by his achievements as Prime Minister. Pranab Mukherjee’s is marked by “tax terrorism” and broken banks. P Chidambaram was the darling of markets.

Would Sitharaman choose from the above, or from her recent predecessor and party colleague Arun Jaitley? Jaitley, who is being blamed for presiding over sliding economic growth rate, has left behind a banking system that is a lot clean and reliable.

The asset quality review (AQR) of the RBI that he approved opened a can of worms, but ended the political legacy of kicking the can down the road. Although the ugliness of the banking system is in full glare, it ended the practice of banks and businesses sugar-coating bad practices as social necessity.

“AQR will be a short-term surgical strike,” said Engineer of Motilal Oswal. “In the long term, it will definitely benefit the industry.”

Former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian suggested that the central bank go for an AQR to restore confidence in the industry. Without a stamp of approval from the regulator, it would be difficult for investors to separate the good from the bad.

“AQR is an absolute requirement and that will differentiate good ones from bad ones,” says Diwanji. “When they introduce AQR for NBFCs, RBI should introduce a comprehensive turnaround action plan.”

There’s little doubt that the NBFC problems need to be addressed, but a thorough study of it is essential so that the good ones get the benefits while the bad ones meet their fate.

“The new finance minister should make some positive statements to cheer up the NBFC sector and assure them that the finance ministry and the RBI will always stay vigilant if any need arises,” says Sur of PwC. “That is a better idea than forcing her to bring about some regulation to help them.”"
4,2019-06-08,Bajaj Finserv,"Domestic equity investors took money off the table for the week ended June 7, sending benchmark equity indices down for the first time in four weeks. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty kicked off the truncated week on a positive note after Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched Rs 1 lakh crore in May 2019 as compared to Rs 94,016 crore in the year-ago period.

Markets participants ignored CSO data which showed that economic growth slowed to a 5-year low of 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, pushing India behind China, due to a poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

However, sentiments got dampened after a private weather forecaster Skymet Weather said the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. Also, lack of a comment from RBI on the on-going NBFC crisis overshadowed the 25 bps rate cut and change in stance.

However, some buying on Friday capped the downside.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Markets started the holiday trimmed week on a positive note. The momentum was triggered by weakness in crude oil prices and hopes of RBI cutting rates in the bi-monthly policy. But the momentum was short-lived and markets traded lower after RBI cut repo rates by 25 bps and changed stance to accommodative from neutral that came mostly in expected lines. No further comments by RBI regarding the on-going NBFC funding crisis was taken as a surprise by the market that added to the negativity.”

As a result, the BSE Sensex closed 98.30 points, or 0.25 per cent down at 39,615.90 on June 7 against 39714.20 on May 31. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index closed 52.15 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 11,870.65.

10,2019-06-18,Bajaj Finserv,"Ajay Piramal enjoys the reputation of being one of the most astute investors in recent years, but his bet on Shriram Transport Finance (STFC), the NBFC arm of Chennai-based Shriram Group, has been a dampener.

The Rs 1,652-crore investment in Shriram generated a compounded return of just 6.5 per cent in six years for Piramal Enterprises compared to 12 per cent by Sensex or Nifty in the same period. On an absolute basis, the company made 40 per cent returns.

Pirmal Enterprises on Monday sold its entire 9.96 per cent in STFC for around Rs 1,015 a share.

The company had bought the shares at Rs 790 a piece.

Rival non-banking players such as Bajaj Finance, Manappuram Finance, Can Fin Homes, Bajaj Finserv, and Bharat Financial have given far better returns, ranging between 700 per cent and 2,300 per cent since May 2013.



The stock prices of some of the smaller players like IIFL, Motilal Oswal, Edelweiss, JM Financial have rallied between 200 per cent and 700 per cent over the same period despite the recent losses.

Weak operating performance over the last few quarters and several negative news flows in the last five years dented the investors’ confidence in the company despite it belonging to a strong promoter group.

The growth in assets under management (AUM) growth in the recent quarter was impacted due to lacklustre real estate activity and slowdown in demand of commercial vehicles.

Net interest margin also declined due to pressure on yields as well as increase in cost of funds.

In July last year, the stock fell nearly 20 per cent on the back of concerns of a possible default in payment of interest on non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of an unlisted Shriram group company, SVL Ltd, for whom Shriram Transport Finance had extended guarantees.

In 2015, brokerages cut their earnings estimates for the Shriram group company by 9 per cent to 25 per cent after the quarterly numbers showed that the construction equipment finance business had made an annual loss."

“The stock changed life for many investors and liberated them early. I was fortunate to be one of them,” says Soumya Malani, a young Kolkata-based investor, who made 71 times return on the stock. 

Last year, the company faced double whammy of a spike in input cost and softening output prices, which squeezed margins.

“Things seem to have stabilised now and better numbers are expected from here on. It is a phenomenal company with one of the best pedigrees in place,” Malani said.

There are many stocks like Avanti Feeds that have delivered multibagger returns to investors even when the market navigated many headwinds amid intermittent bull runs.

NBFC major Bajaj Finance is another such stock. Had you invested Rs 1,00,000 on this counter in June 12, 2009, it would have become Rs 2.33 crore today, growing at a CAGR of 72 per cent annually. A similar investment in cooler maker Symphony would have become Rs 2.11 crore. 

While past performance does not guarantee future returns on Dalal Street, brokerages say there is more steam left in these stocks. 

Edelweiss Professional Investor Research is bullish on Avanti Feeds with a price target of Rs 480. The scrip traded at Rs 335 on Tuesday. The company saw substantial improvement in bottomline during FY2009-2018 and posted Rs 465.40 crore profit for FY2018 against a net loss of Rs 7 crore in FY2009. In FY19, the profit figure swelled to Rs 306 crore, but it was down 34 per cent YoY.

“Avanti reported weak numbers for FY19 mainly because of a crash in global shrimp prices and farm gate prices, as farmers moved away from aquaculture, impacting demand for feed. However, the processing business is doing well and seeing healthy growth,” Edelweiss said in a report.

Bajaj Finance is among the alpha pick of Indiabulls Ventures with a price target of Rs 4,000. A subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance has transformed itself from a captive auto loan provider for Bajaj Auto to one of the most successful and diversified NBFCs.

It had leadership position in the consumer durables segment with a large customer franchise of 34.48 million and loan cross-sell franchise of 20.67 million as on FY19.

“Bajaj Finance has constantly grown its market share even in challenging times. It has a track record of maintaining healthy financials and sound returns ratio. We believe the company will be able to grow at a CAGR of 40 per cent on the bottom-line over next two years,” Indiabulls Ventures said in a report.

Symphony is one of the largest players in the air cooler market with an organised market share of around 48 per cent. In order to explore new opportunities in the industrial and residential cooling segment, the company has made acquisitions in different geographies including Mexico, China and Australia.

At present, India business contributes around 57 per cent to the topline while the rest of the world brings in 43 per cent. ICICIdirect.com is bullish on Symphony with a price target of Rs 1,530. “With rising temperature in a major parts of the country coupled with low dealer-level inventory, Symphony is likely to record robust performance in the FY20E. With a lower base and revival in air cooler demand, we model standalone volume CAGR of around 18 per cent in FY19-21E and topline growth of 20 per cent during this period,” the brokerage said.

Two other companies that turned investors millionaires are Relaxo Footwear and plastic products maker Astral Poly Technik. Both stocks rallied over 1,000 per cent in last 10 years. 

Relaxo Footwears surged to Rs 825.80 as of June 14, 2019 from Rs 5.10 on June 12, 2009. Astral Poly Technik has risen to Rs 1,350 from Rs 11.40.

Brokerage Anand Rathi Financial Services likes Astral for its consistent focus on growth and profitability, supported by innovative product launches, vigorous brand-building and successful product diversification.

With over 50 times rally, La Opala RG, Ajanta Pharma, Vinati Organics, Atul Ltd, Eicher Motors, TTK Prestige and Cera Sanitaryware have been some of the other top wealth creators from the BSE500 index in last 10 years.

Domestic equity benchmark Sensex has rallied over 150 per cent since June 2009.

The pecking order will surely change for next 10 years and Dalal Street will throw up a new set of wealth creators.

Malani says what can possibly help spot potential wealth creators early are a combination of visionary management and a business with scalability, pricing power, tailwinds, high growth, higher incremental ROCE, low equity, under ownership and leadership in a niche areas.

On its 10th birthday this Monday, business news channel ETNOW invited 10 renowned stock pickers from Dalal Street – including Basant Maheshwari, Porinju Veliyath, Vijay Kedia, Sandip Sabharwal and Manish Sonthalia – to build a Power Portfolio of 10 stocks for next 10 years. They picked Titan, Britannia, Tata Global Beverages, Repro India, Britannia and DCB Bank, Edelweiss Financial Services, HDFC Life and Syngene, among others."

16,2019-06-21,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Thursday's buoyancy in domestic equities, owing to short-covering in recently oversold stocks, fizzled out on Friday, as a fresh spell of across-the-board selling left the benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty, deep in red.

Analysts said it is a sell-on-rise market, as lingering domestic as well as global concerns over liquidity crisis, trade tensions persist and geopolitical tension in West Asia have turned investors risk averse.

""Cautious global sentiment amid trade war and geopolitical tensions is weighing on investor sentiment. At home, concerns over the health of NBFCs and slow progress of monsoon kept risk appetite in check,"" said Siddharth Sedani, Head VP- Equity & Portfolio Advisory at Anand Rathi Financial Services.

The market is volatile and slightly nervous ahead of the Budget, but will stabilise after this major event, he added. 

Sensex ended the day 407 points, or 1.03 per cent, lower at 39,194, while NSE’s Nifty settled 108 points, or 0.91 per cent, down at 11,724. For the week, Nifty slipped 0.84 per cent while Sensex retreated 0.65 per cent. It was the third straight weekly fall for Sensex while Nifty slipped for the fourth consecutive week.

The brokerage said it was surprised by the sharp 20 per cent drop in volumes during April and May. 


TaMo rebounds to settle flat
After falling nearly 3 per cent in morning trade, shares of Tata Motors rebounded smartly to close almost flat at Rs 159. Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday downgraded Tata Motors’ corporate family rating (CFR) and senior unsecured instruments rating, citing sustained deterioration in the company's credit profile mainly on account of its British arm Jaguar Land Rover's weak performances.

17,2019-06-22,Bajaj Finserv,"The benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty declined over half a per cent during the week gone by amid fears over India’s retaliatory tariffs on US goods, ongoing NBFC crisis, soaring crude oil prices and concerns over poor progress in monsoon. 

The Sensex slipped 0.65 per cent to 39,194 for the week ended June 21. The index was at 39,452 on June 14. Similarly, the NSE Nifty dipped 0.84 per cent to 11,724 from 11,823 during the same period. 

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week:


Top Nifty gainers


ICICI Bank: Shares of ICICI Bank rallied 3.12 per cent to Rs 430.80 on June 21 from Rs 417.75 on June 14. During the week, ICICI Bank and IndoStar Capital Finance entered into sourcing and servicing arrangement to partner in extending credit to small and medium fleet owners to purchase used and new commercial vehicles. Under this partnership, IndoStar Capital Finance will originate and service the customers through the entire loan life-cycle including sourcing, documentation, collection and loan servicing and in turn, ICICI Bank will provide funding to these customers.


Power Grid: Shares of the company advanced 2.72 per cent to Rs 199.90 for the week ended June 21. Power regulator CERC has allowed state-owned transmission utility PowerGrid to offer towers to telecom companies for BTS (base trans-receiver station) installation to improve mobile connectivity, especially in remote rural areas. The move will not only address the issue of deficiency of telecom coverage in the country, particularly remote areas, but this segment could also be a money spinner for Power Grid. Besides, the power distribution utilities will get a share of income, which would eventually reduce the tariff burden on consumers. 


Top Nifty losers

UPL: Shares of agrochemicals maker UPL dropped over 11 per cent to Rs 890.10 during the week. According to HSBC Global Research, UPL appears at risk due to its global diversified exposure, but the near-term impact should be non-material.


Yes Bank: The private sector lender remained under pressure after Moody’s Investors placed the bank's ratings under review for a possible downgrade citing it high exposure to the struggling NBFC and realty sectors. The agency said the ongoing liquidity pressures on finance companies will negatively impact the credit profile of Yes Bank, given its sizeable exposure to weaker companies in the sector. The scrip declined 4.74 per cent to Rs 109.60 on June 21 from Rs 115.05 on June 14.


Stocks that rallied up to 21%
As many as 12 stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 5 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Hexaware Technologies (up 21 per cent), Suzlon Energy (10.17 per cent), Oberoi Realty (7.86 per cent), Syndicate Bank (7.56 per cent) and Dr Lal Pathlabs (7.21 per cent).


23 scrips that cracked
More than 20 stocks on the BSE500 plunged in double digits during the past five trading sessions. Jain Irrigation (down 33 per cent), Eveready Industries (down 21 per cent), Graphite India (down 19 per cent), SREI Infra (down 15.86 per cent) and Manpasand Beverages (down 14.42 per cent) stood among companies that went down over 10 per cent during the week. 


IPO update
IndiaMart InterMesh, an online marketplace for business products and services, on Friday said it has raised more than Rs 213 crore from 15 anchor investors by allotting 21,95,038 equity shares at a price of Rs 973, the upper band of its IPO which will open on June 24. ICICI Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, Birla Mutual Fund, Hornbill Capital Advisers LLP are among the 15 anchor investors.


Stocks @fresh all-time high
As many as nine stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs during the week. The list included some of the blue-chip stocks such as Titan Company, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance and Tata Consultancy Services. SRF, Godrej Properties, PI Industries, City Union Bank and Maharashtra Scooters also scaled new life peaks.


Scrips at fresh life lows
On the BSE500 index, The New India Assurance, General Insurance Corporation of India, Manpasand Beverages, Laurus Labs, Central Bank of India, Reliance Communications, Jet Airways, SH Kelkar, Reliance Power, Vodafone Idea, Eris Life and Reliance Infrastructure reeled and touched new all-time lows.


Sectoral update
Sector-wise, the BSE Consumer Durable, Realty and Power rallied more than 1 per cent during the week. However, the BSE Telecom, Auto, FMCG, Healthcare and Oil & Gas indices weakened between 1 per cent and 2.20 per cent.


Jet Airways
Shares of beleaguered aviation firm Jet Airways remained highly volatile during the week. On the NSE, the scrip jumped over 100 per cent in a day on Thursday. Still, it settled the week 11.70 per cent lower at Rs 72.50. Jimeet Modi, CEO, Samco Securities & StockNote said, “This week gone by saw the biggest speculative displacement in stocks like Jet Airways, which were fundamentally weak but witnessed spine-chilling movements on both directions. The reasons? Demand-supply mismatch, greed and fear, hopes and expectations – a clear reflection of emotional responses from investors all at once.”"

18,2019-06-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Unless more money comes in, we do not see any big uptick in the market in the next couple of weeks at least, says Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL. Excerpts form his interview with ETNOW.

What is your view on Bitcoin, gold and 10-year papers?The yield curve has been steepening in the Indian market also and the interest rates are coming down - which is a kind of conundrum. There is clearly some doubt in terms of the relationship between the asset classes. We try to correlate the GDP numbers with tax numbers which are coming. Right now, the problem in case of India is that we have gone through a large cycle every year but growth never seems to come about. The situation especially in the last couple of weeks seems to reflect the mindset that the government may not be aggressively looking at relieving the short-term pain, not only in the NBFC sector but even on the manufacturing and other sectors.

On the mining side, we have been importing a lot of natural resources which typically have one of the largest reserves. So a lot of systematic challenges are there. It is not that these have come just over last two-three weeks and were never there earlier, but there was a hope that the government will move fast starting with the NBFC crisis on the liquidity side. Since that is not happening, lot of deleverages are happening on the client side in terms of their overall exposure in the market. As a result, we are seeing a carnage in the smallcap and midcap space. Until and unless you have more money coming in, say from the Bimal Jalan Committee recommendations, which again has got postponed by a month, we do not see any big uptick in the market in next couple of weeks at least. 


As you said, we have seen some of those midcaps take a real beating and even some on the back of news flow. What would you do in the meantime, particularly when it comes to the broader markets?From the flows perspective, those 10-12 stocks now account for around 60% of the overall investment happening -- be it via mutual funds which is close to 58% or 60% in case of FIIs. Those 10 top stocks are where everyone is looking to park their money before they venture out and look at bottom fishing.

It is clearly the institutional view which is right now prevalent in the market and from that perspective, the consensus trades -- HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank -- will continue to do well. Maybe the IT sector, where the valuations are quite reasonable could be another area where people will be more sanguine relative to the pharmaceutical sector. 

A lot of things have happened over the last couple of years in the pharma sector. It is not only that the FDA has been improving compliance level for the Indian companies, but there has also been fall in pricing on the generic side. 

So the IT sector as well as corporate banks are the spaces where one should be parking their money and look at specific opportunities. On the NBFC side, one can look at a stock like LIC Housing Finance because most of the other players are going through bad times in terms of getting money and you are also likely to see a significant reduction in growth for the affordable housing sector. Companies that have the ability to raise capital will continue to do well like Bajaj Finance, Cholamandalam, Sundaram Finance etc.


You were talking about stocks and companies that you are betting on to stay put for the long haul and Bajaj Finance is clearly amongst the chosen ones. What are the other names that you have picked out?One sector which can be considered from a multi-year angle would be the insurance sector. Right now, it is difficult to say that one will be the one which will do better because clearly from a valuation perspective, HDFC is slightly more expensive than others. 

Something like SBI Life should do pretty well going forward, in addition to HDFC Standard. These are the companies from the life insurance space that we like and if you want to play the Bajaj Finance story, buy Bajaj Finserv. At these levels, Bajaj Finserv also looks quite decent because of the growth trajectory which is likely to happen on the insurance side, will be complementary to Bajaj Finance where we expect the growth to be at least 35% CAGR going forward.


Where does an investor really look at this point of time?Within the IT space, we prefer companies like HCL Tech and Mphasis because multiples for most of these companies, for example, HCL Tech would be around 12.5 times and with lot of opportunity coming for HCL Tech after buying some of the products from IBM, going forward there is a margin of safety along with a lot of other companies.

There is always a risk that there could be a significant fall in terms of earnings. In this kind of market environment, what investors are looking for is consistency in earnings and for the IT sector, that is likely to be better relative to other sectors. Investors should look at having stocks like HCL Tech or Mphasis in their portfolio in this kind of a volatile environment.


HCL Tech margins are the lowest ever despite IBM.The reason for that is they have been investing a lot and obviously in between, they were not doing that well and for that reason only, they are available at these multiples. The call that we have is that there will be improvement in terms of how the company has been managing and the margins would improve. If you look at the overall multiple of the market, you have to look at whether you will lose money from the current level or not. From that perspective, HCL could do well going forward. 


Are there opportunities within pharmaceuticals where one can start nibbling in right now because both news flow as well as prices seem to be at rock bottom?One of the stocks that we really like in terms of doing pretty well over the next two-three years would be Torrent Pharma. Last quarter, numbers were not good and for that reason we saw that the stock had come down. However, we believe that with the Unichem acquisition, they have been able to really scale up the revenue per MR from Rs 3 lakh to around Rs 5.5 lakh. This clearly suggests that there is significant excellence in terms of execution from the company and from that perspective, Torrent is one stock from the pharmaceutical side that one should look at. 

We believe that the typical US generic focus players will continue to face challenging times going forward and that is why like yesterday we had downgraded Dr Reddy’s because clearly on the market share side, we saw that Suboxone already has four generic players and one innovator in the market and Dr Reddy’s market share had come down.

26,2019-06-28,Bajaj Finserv,"Once the government’s strategic road map for certain sectors is in place, one can scan for stocks with earnings visibility over the next two to three years, provided all other parameters are maintained, says Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.

Would the markets continue to be lacklustre till the budget is presented?Yes, that seems to be the most probable case for the markets because on the one hand, a lot is expected from the Budget and on the other hand, one has to see how the government is going to stay on the glided fiscal path. Those are the two essential things. It is a classic standoff between growth and the fisc that the exchequer has to manage. This is a big overhang for the markets. 

There are a lot of moving parts in terms of the slowness and the slowdown that the broader economy is facing; what happens to the larger global markets; statements from the Fed, the ECB, are all pointing towards some amount of imbalances at play when demand is coming through on the global scale as well. 

The markets will be range-bound in my opinion and very volatile. As the budget draws nearer and as the event probably gets over, we will focus back to the two key issues -- how corporate earnings are expected to grow and when private capex will revive. But that will be known only in the second half. 

In my opinion, markets are fairly valued at this point of time and remain range-bound over the next few weeks or months. Those stocks and sectors will be in focus where the earnings visibility and earnings recovery can be very clear over the next few quarters.


Which are the stocks that you would want to buy? Are they related to budget or not? It is a mix of both because I think the budget will give the strategic direction in terms of how the economy will look over the next one year. It is basically a statement of accounts and a factual representation. The strategic representation is a very key facet that the markets will probably gauge in terms of where the government spending will come from. 

Taking this into cognisance, what the manifesto has promised in terms of infrastructure spending are a whole host of facets attached to this and if you widen the gamut, you probably will have a lot of road companies at play. A lot of infrastructure spending will be done on road infrastructure, ports and probably cold storages.

For example, there is water scarcity in Chennai. Bengaluru has just declared some norms on water preservation that could probably get introduced. Any stocks that are related to waste and water management, desalination projects will get positively impacted. 

For infrastructure as a whole, cement probably comes into play. So, it is going to be a dual objective. 

Once the strategic road map that the government gives for certain sectors is in place, one can scan for stocks which have an earnings visibility over the next two to three years provided all the other parameters were at play like no leverage on their balance sheet, well managed working capital, no corporate governance issues etc. These companies along with the markets might struggle for a short period of time but over a longer period, I think that earning story will rerate these stocks.


Every day we hear about corporates getting downgraded or defaulting. Do you think these developments will keep the markets very volatile, especially the financial sector which has the maximum weightage?Oh, it will. The froth is probably getting cleansed up from the market and that is better for the markets from a medium to long-term perspective. It also allows far more clarity because the largecaps, the well-managed companies have done exceptionally well. We did witness liquidity issues for the financial system as a whole. RBI obviously has done a lot of work in terms of OMOs and the liquidity again is back to normal.

It is the well managed corporates which will probably rule the roost. You cannot paint the entire NBFC universe with the same brush because the better rated NBFCs have withstood the test of time. Stocks like Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC -- despite some blips in terms of their borrowing mix, NIMs and contracting spreads contracted a tad bit but it hardly mattered in terms of their overall business dynamics. 

The asset quality pressures slipped a tad bit but it is not something which was making the street awry. These stocks are something that can outgrow the industry over a longer period of time but the better-managed midcaps should also do relatively better. 

The performance in some stocks like Chola Finance has been exemplary compared to the others. It might struggle a little bit along with the whole universe but when the earnings recovery comes through, it will be in a far better position compared to the others. 

Within the housing finance space for example, we continue holding on to stocks like an LIC or a CanFin Homes because of the retail spread, asset quality issues on their books and the capital adequacy that they possess. All that will hold their earnings trajectory in a strong fashion. There are a few key overhangs as well.

Identifying a few stocks within these sectors is going to be very critical.


What is the outlook within the metal space? Does one need to be very selective due to the cyclical nature?From a structural perspective, the US-China trade war is going to create an overhang for the sector as a whole and this probably gets reflected in terms of how the LME pricing moves. What you have probably seen is in terms of how the Chinese output has been over the past few quarters and the expectations of the output still being a little bit subdued over the next few quarters.

It is the realisation growth which creates leverage on ferrous as well as non-ferrous balance sheets. The companies within the commodity space itself are classical companies which are exposed to these cyclical fluctuations and it is very difficult to say when the cycle will turn. You need to wait it out to assume that the cycle might turn in the next quarter. It might be a little bit pre-emptive but how the entire input cost scenario is going to pan out is extremely critical as well. There were some shutdowns because of which, iron ore prices had shot through the roof. Coal prices again had inched higher. EBITDA per ton, which is a very important parameter for all these companies probably remaining subdued even at this point of time. 

Companies are classically trying to increase volumes to offset the effect that you are seeing but then comes the structural demand nature of the market. So, demand has to outpace supply which probably does not seem to be the case at the global scale at this point of time. 

Domestically, for ferrous companies in particular, when the infrastructure spending starts coming from the capital account on the government side and as the monsoon season gets over, a lot of activity is expected to pick up.

We would wait it out and not rush into buying anything at this point of time. We will wait out at least for a quarter before looking into the sector. 


In H1, the midcap index is down 4%, the smallcap index is down about 3-4%, Russell 3000, which is the US markets smallcap index has been up 15%. Do you think our valuations versus US smallcaps would be decent? Can one start to invest into small cap, midcap names?
Selectively yes and if you look at the historical precedence, after the markets have gone through such a huge grind and when the expectations largely rely on earnings improving, selective midcaps, the better rated ones, over the next 15 to 18 months should do very well in my opinion. One really needs to cherry pick within the midcap universe but these midcaps will probably outperform over the next four to six quarters."

22,2019-06-28,Bajaj Finserv,"Shares of HDB Financial, the NBFC arm of HDFC Bank, are being valued at over Rs 80,000 crore in the grey market, making it the country’s fourth most valuable non-bank lender at the existing prices.

Brokers and market experts say HDB Financial Services is being traded heavily in the grey market at Rs 1,000-1,050 per share on hopes of an early initial public offering. The top-end of the price values the firm at around Rs 82,000 crore below Bajaj Finance’s Rs 2.11 lakh crore and Bajaj Finserv’s Rs 1.34 lakh crore. HDB’s parent and the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC is the most valuable non-bank lender at Rs 3.78 lakh crore.

HDB’s price also values it just below that of leading private sector lender IndusInd Bank and higher than Bandhan Bank, Yes Bank and IDFC Bank. HDB is currently a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, the country’s most valuable bank.

“Activity in the HDB Financial counter suddenly increased in the last few days ahead of its AGM on June 21,” said Narottam Dharawat, a Mumbai-based broker who deals in unlisted companies. “The company is currently trading at a huge premium because of the HDFC brand and the last trade was at Rs 1,050 per share.”

HDB’s price gives it a price to book value of 11.5 times compared with Bajaj Finance’s 10.92 x and Bajaj Finserv’s 5.93 x.

HDB, which gives personal and car loans, is likely to be listed in the current financial year. HDFC Bank which holds 95.53 per cent stake in the company is planning to sell part of its stake through an initial public offer (IPO) to raise around Rs 10,000 crore, according to Bloomberg.

HDB Employees Welfare Trust and HDBFS Employees Welfare Trust hold 26.19 lakh shares and 19.22 lakh shares, respectively, as on March 31, 2019. Debenture trustee company Vistra ITCL owns nearly 15 lakh shares in HDB Financials. “Several HNIs are buying the HDB Financial stock on expectation that HDFC Bank will price the IPO in the range Rs 1,100-1,200,” said Anil Goel, a Delhi-based broker dealing with the unlisted shares. “Good demand for HDB shares is due to solid return investors got in companies like HDFC AMC and HDFC Life Insurance from the HDFC brand in the last few years.”

HDB’s profit more than tripled in the last four years from Rs 350 crore in FY15 to Rs 1,153 crore in FY19. Revenue grew 245 per cent to Rs 8,725 crore. HDB’s AUM growth moderated in FY19 to Rs 54,700 crore due to challenges in the NBFC sector.

Return on assets (RoA) has been around 2.3 per cent in FY19, aided by the healthy net interest margin (NIM) and low credit cost while return on equity was at 17.2 per cent"

Where are We? The market witnessed a muted start to the July series as the Nifty struggled to hold above 11,800 levels. The index closed at 11,789, down 0.45 per cent for the day and up 0.55 per cent on weekly basis. Broader market indices, BSE Midcap and Smallcap were up 1.26 per cent and 1.10 per cent, respectively, for the week.


What is in Store? The Nifty has been largely range bound in 300 points for last couple of weeks. The index attempted to break out from the consolidation on June series expiry day, but it failed to do so and retraced back into the range. Thus, on the upside, the index needs to cross 11,911 levels on sustainable basis for trend to continue towards its all-time high of 12,103 levels. Above this, the next level is seen at 12,300. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 11,590 level where rising gap of 20th May is seen. Breaking below 11,590, the index is likely to fill the gap down to 11,425. Overall, the market is likely to remain in this broader range of 11,900 and 11,600 till Budget.


What could Investors Do? In Nifty weekly options maximum open interest for put is seen at a strike price 11,700 followed by 11,800; while for call maximum open interest is seen at 12,000 followed by 11,900. Significant amount of call writing was seen at 11,900 followed by 12,000 and 11,800; while put writing was seen at 11,700. Thus, suggesting immediate overhead resistance at 11,900-12,000 levels. Stock specific, HDFC Life Insurance, State Bank of India, Bajaj Finserv, Info Edge can be looked on long side, while on the short side Escorts and Glenmark are showing fresh breakdowns."

NEW DELHI: There could be some consolidation going ahead, but the trend is likely to remain strong till the time 11,600 is not breached by the Nifty, according to technical analysts. Stocks like Tata Motors, Majesco, Canara Bank, HDFC Life, SBI, Bajaj Finserv and Info Edge are likely to move up as per the charts.


Where are We? The expiry week remained marginally in favour of bulls since the benchmark indices ended the week with marginal gains. The Nifty spot recovered from the support of 11,600 to close near the 11,800 mark with a weekly gain of (+0.55 per cent). On the other hand, the Bank Nifty surged more than 1.5 per cent during the process.


What is in Store? At this juncture, the Nifty has formed an intermediate swing high of 11,911. Also, the daily chart of Bank Nifty depicts a ‘Shooting Star’ candlestick pattern which is a reversal one and that too exactly at 78.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous move. Thus, there could be some consolidation or profit booking going ahead. But the trend is likely to remain strong till the time 11,600 is not breached by the Nifty. On the downside, the index has a support at 11,700-11,600; while the upside hurdle is at 11,920. A move above 11,920 might pull the index towards its life high.


What could Investors Do? On the stock front, we are bullish on Tata Motors for the coming weeks. After a relentless correction from Rs 239; the stock found support near the 150 mark which is the 78.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement levels of the previous rise. The stock has formed a bullish ‘Hammer’ formation at the retracement support. The weekly rising RSI indicates fresh upside going ahead. Thus, traders can accumulate the stock between Rs 162 and Rs 158 with a stop below Rs 150 for the upside target of Rs 170-180. With regards to trend line breakout, stocks like Majesco, Canara Bank and Voltas should be kept on the radar for buy on dips."

8,2019-07-05,Bajaj Finserv,"There are lots and lots of ideas and it is great to see that the start of a new five-year term, says Sanjiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Finserv on Budget 2019. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.

What is the good news, what is the bad news and where do you think the Budget has disappointed?The good news is that this budget is big on ideas, a 360 degree view of what the government is focussing on and whether it is on infrastructure spends or building a connectivity network with big focus on electric vehicles. If you look at what they want to do with education, skill development, recognising the need to put in more liquidity into the system for NBFCs, a significant focus on MSMEs, on start-ups, the digital economy, on women entrepreneurs. So, there are lots and lots of ideas and it is great to see that the start of a new five-year term.

But God is in the details and really a lot of this is going to be about execution. But these are the big positives. On the negative side, I would say that given the economy is in a period of a slowdown, I would have liked to see an additional focus on a few key areas, namely how do we create more jobs, how do we stimulate the existing economy, existing businesses because doing start ups is great as a long-term investor with view for three, five, 10 years down the line. 

What do you do for today, what do you do immediately for labour reforms? We are hearing about the four labour codes. Is this something that is more urgent, that can be done on this? Also, how do we go ahead and ensure quick whims on the infrastructure side pan out in coming years? But the immediate focus is we have to get this economy on the 8% growth CAGR which is required to get to $5 trillion.


Would you say that in the near term, all the concerns with regards to liquidity in the system and the state of NBFCs have been addressed by the budget duly?Let us divide the problems between liquidity problems and solvency problems. Those that have solvency problems need to bring in capital and resolve the solvency issues. Where it is a liquidity issue, in most cases, there was an issue of confidence in giving money to the NBFC sector. Yes, their short term measures will last for up to six months or so. The government will back public sector banks for their first loss of up to 10% and a few other initiatives. 

I would hope that in the short term, it does take care of the problem but we need a far more robust mechanism. For large NBFCs, we need the same kind of liquidity backstops that the RBI provide banks and not to bail out any NBFC. That is not what we are asking. We are the private sector and we can take care of ourselves but the large NBFCs are playing a very significant role in this economy, particularly towards consumer growth and MSME growth. That is why structurally we need that support. I hope we hear this from RBI in the coming months.


One of the challenges is slowdown; the second is global tariff war which is real and third is India is not competitive in terms of labour laws, land reforms and interest rates. Some would argue that this is a good budget. You have set up a target of $5 trillion economy towards which India should move in terms of the right size and the demographic advantage. But how do you fix productivity and how do you make yourself competitive? You are absolutely right. The three key factors -- land, labour and interest rates we need to see and that is why as we need to have a quick and clear focus on this. If India is to really maximise on what is happening globally and use the opportunity, then India has to really create a Made in India option to Made in China for the world. That can only happen if these areas are immediately looked at and a clear roadmap set out. Some of the things the government has to do, some RBI and other regulators have to do but this concerted effort towards this is very important."
9,2019-07-05,Bajaj Finserv,"MUMBAI: The crisis-ridden non-banking finance companies have welcomed the liquidity- boosting measures announced in the budget, saying the steps will help getting growth funds for the sector.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said NBFCs which are fundamentally sound should continue to get funding from banks and mutual funds without being unduly risk averse and offered some liquidity enhancing measures under which the government will purchase high-rated pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs worth Rs 1 trillion and also provide a one-time six months' partial credit guarantee to public sector banks for first loss of up to 10 percent.

""The budget has taken several measures to reduce risk aversion and increase lending to NBFCs. Measures like the one-time partial six-month credit guarantee to state-run banks to buy sound NBFCs' loans and higher recapitalisation of state-run banks require a special mention,"" L&T Finance Holdings managing director Dinanath Dubhashi said.

The minster also said the government will infuse Rs 70,000 crore capital into state-run banks to boost credit to oil the economy which has been facing some headwinds of late.

""The bank capitalisation, credit guarantee for high rated asset pools and easing of the reserve requirements in public issue of debentures will further enable flow of liquidity to well-performing NBFCs with strong balance sheets,"" Tata Capital managing director Rajiv Sabharwal said.

Bajaj Finserv's Sanjiv Bajaj said there is support on the liquidity side on temporarily basis to NBFCs. ""I hope this becomes a more long-term support like the banks are given by the RBI, because NBFCs play a very key role given the consumer and MSME demand,"" he said.

Muthoot Finance managing director George Alexander Muthoot said the credit guarantee scheme will further open up the liquidity line for sound NBFCs."
10,2019-07-06,Bajaj Finserv,"Domestic equity markets ended first week of July in the green after the Economic Survey projected India’s economic growth rebounding from a five-year low to 7 per cent this fiscal. Softening crude oil prices and the US-China trade war truce also calmed investor nerves globally. 

As a result, the benchmark BSE Sensex added 118.75 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 39,513 for the week ended July 5. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index inched higher by 22.30 points, or 0.19 per cent to 11,811 during the same period.

Overall, the market kicked off the week on a positive note after RBI relaxed the leverage ratio for banks to help them boost their lending activities. Market participants remained optimistic despite domestic manufacturing sector losing growth momentum in the month of June. The Economic Survey painted a rosy picture for D-Street which further fuelled the sentiments till Thursday. 

However, Sensex and Nifty pared most of their gains on Friday as Budget proposals failed to enthuse investor sentiment. What further dented the confidence was -- rating agency Moody’s comments which said there are risks of India missing 3.3 per cent fiscal deficit target for the current financial year if tax revenue falls short of the projection.

Nifty opened in negative on Tuesday and drifted towards the 11,460 mark in the first half of the session as it partially filled the bullish gap that had occurred on May 20. The index later recovered from lower levels to close on a flat note near the 11,550 mark. It formed a Hammer candle on the daily scale as some buying interest emerged in the 11,480- 11,500 zone while supply pressure remained intact at 11,600.

As long as it holds below 11,650, Nifty’s immediate structure could remain under pressure to retest the next major support at 11,420, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 11,720 and then 11,777 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,300 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,900 levels. There was Put writing at 11,200 and then 11,300 levels, while Call writing was seen at 11,600 followed by 11,900 levels. Options data suggested a lower trading range between 11,400 and 11,800 levels.

India VIX fell 1.17 per cent to 13.68 level.

Bank Nifty opened negative but traded in a range of 300 points for the entire session. It formed a Doji candle after a sharp decline of past three sessions, which indicated some pause in selling pressure but the index needs to surpass the immediate hurdle to get short-term stability. As long as it remains below 31,000, the index could continue its weakness towards the next major support at 30,250 while on the upside hurdle is seen at 30,850 and then 31,000 levels.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,550 with a loss of 0.14 per cent. Long buildup was seen in JustDial, BEL, Bank Of India, Bajaj Finserv and IOC while shorts were seen in GAIL, REC, Titan, Concor and PFC.

This is not about rescuing NBFCs. It’s also not about the government bailing out a few private sector companies which are currently in trouble; that’s the responsibility of company management and its shareholders. This is about recognising the importance of a handful of large NBFCs in building the Indian economy and the need to regulate these folks differently from the remaining 10,000 NBFCs in our country.

First, let’s understand the role of NBFCs in our economy. The top 10 NBFCs have assets in excess of Rs 50,000 crore each with the largest ones exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore. They are responsible for over 25 per cent of the incremental credit that is driving our economy over the last five years. The boom in consumer and SME lending and commensurate economic development has mainly been financed by these large NBFCs. That’s why they are critical for the continued growth of our economy and to deliver the aspirations of our rising middle and lower middle classes.

And this is also what makes them different from the other 10,000 NBFCs. These large NBFCs have raced past RBI’s classification of systemically important NBFCs which have assets over Rs 500 crore and need a separate classification. Indeed, they are bigger, better and more profitable than most banks. Yet, since many of them have been set up by business groups, RBI in the past has refused — rather unfairly, I daresay — to give them bank licenses. Undeterred, however, these institutions have used the more easily available NBFC licence to build high quality businesses.

Hence, there is a clear rationale for the RBI to recognise these large NBFCs through a separate classification — regulate them tighter than the other 10,000 but also provide them with some of the liquidity backstops that banks get. This will give them the strong framework required to continue their good work.

Now to understand the current NBFC crisis.

IL&FS’s case appears to be one of clear mismanagement if not more; let the law decide and take its course. If there are other badly managed NBFCs that have a solvency problem, then their shareholders need to act. Two, housing finance companies (HFCs) are facing liquidity problems currently, but that is the risk of their business model — they lend long term but can only borrow short.

Interestingly, though banks also hold assets with longer maturities than their liabilities, they do not face such liquidity mismatches.

It is because the RBI provides liquidity security to banks — ability to take deposits, access liquidity from inter-bank deposits or through a RBI window. While most banks don’t use these facilities (other than customer deposits) because they are expensive, the fact that they are available creates confidence in the market and hence there is no run on banks.

NBFCs (excluding HFCs), on the other hand, both borrow and lend short- to medium term and hence inherently should not have a liquidity mismatch. Then why the current ‘crisis’? Well, liquidity for NBFCs is like air that we need to breathe; it is the raw material that keeps the business moving. So, when that air or liquidity is cut-off for a few minutes or months, even an Olympian athlete or a well-run lending institution could die.

With good financial practices and prudent asset-liability management, these large systemically important NBFCs are not only different from HFCs but also different from smaller NBFCS.

The current liquidity crisis of NBFCs has no one to blame. It is the result of the evolution of a few capable lending institutions with NBFC classification, which have grown over the years providing the tailwinds for our economic growth and now need a stronger foundation to continue the good work. Think of them as a youngster who has outgrown his learner’s licence and is ready for a permanent one. And hence, you need different strokes for different folks.

Nifty futures for July contract on Friday closed at a discount of 2.65 compared with the spot. The index in the cash segment closed 0.31 per cent higher at 11,588.40 following firm global cues as all the US indices hit all-time highs. In the derivatives segment, maximum Put open interest (OI) was at 11,500 followed by 11,550 strike while maximum Call Open Interest (OI) was at 11,600 followed by 11,700 strike.

Meaningful Put writing was seen at 11,500 followed by 11,600 strike while Call writing was seen at 11,600 followed by 11,700 strike. Fresh put writing with shift in call OI forming base at lower strikes of 11,500 and 11,600 suggests a short-term hurdle at 11,700 and expected to trade in range of 11,500 to 11,700 levels.


1) Fresh long positions: Rise in price & rise in OIA long position is like buying a stock or any other asset with the expectation that it will rise in the near future. Such a position suggests a bullish view on a security or index. Open interest shows the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, be it options or futures, that have not been settled. Total open interest count is the total of every buy and sell contract. Thus, the higher the open interest, the higher the level of investor interest in a position. In long positions, the larger the volume of open interest, the higher the level of bullishness.


Agencies

2) Short covering: Rise in price with fall in OIShort covering refers to buying of shares in order to close an existing short position, or a position that has been sold. Typically, short covering is done to avoid loss on a short position when prices start moving upward. Thus, short covering signals a shift in view on a security from extreme bearishness to bullishness.


Agencies

3) Fresh shorts: Fall in price with rise in OIFresh shorts are built when a trader sells options contracts speculating that there will be a fall in the value of the securities. By definition, a short position is a bearish view on a security or the index. This technique is used when an investor anticipates that the value of a stock will drop in the short term. Here too, the bigger the open interest position, the higher is the level of bearishness on that security or index.


Agencies

4) Long unwinding: Fall in price with fall in OIUnwind means offloading or selling a position. In trading parlance, long unwinding refers to selling of positions or stocks owned for a longer period either to book profit or to exit it in anticipation of impending bearishness. Long unwinding usually happens when traders feel the price of a stock or security is nearing its point of resistance, or the bullish view on it has reached a certain saturation point.


Agencies

Option chainAn option chain is a listing of all the Put option and Call option strike prices along with their premiums for a given maturity period. The options chain charts give valuable information about a security or index for that particular day and where it might be heading in the near future. The volume column shows how many options got traded today, while the open Interest column shows how many options are outstanding. The level of open interest at any strike prices show the level of investor interest on that contract, and based on the spot price, Call and Put open interest levels at different strike prices can give a perspective as to how and where do investors see the market in the foreseeable future.

39,2019-07-23,Bajaj Finserv,"HNI investors are looking to buy into some of the broader names but the overall incremental money which is moving into the market is extremely slow, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President & Head Equity Sales & Advisory, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Should one be wary of FII dominated stocks like HDFC, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance? What we are seeing is that the bunch of 10-12 stocks which was holding up the index and where a large amount of money was moving in, are seeing a bit of a correction and that might unnerve a lot of investors. We had a big divergence in the market in the last one year wherein these stocks were actually going up and people were comfortable holding on to them, whereas in the broader market -- the midcap and the smallcap space -- we had seen a massive correction. 

Typically when you have some kind of a selling or the expectations in terms of growth that the market was working for these large names, whenever you see a bit of a concern, these kind of corrections do happen. But our sense is that we are going to have a slowdown for at least the next couple of quarters. It makes more sense to stick to the quality names rather than trying to buy something which has corrected because you do not know how long this phase will last and how the market is going to deal with volatility, particularly for the broader market. 

A normal correction in let us say HDFC Ltd, about 5% cut from the top, should not unnerve you. Same is the case with many other names. A small correction of let us say 5, 10, 15% is quite normal and it should not make us uncomfortable.


What is it that you are hoping to hear from Unilever on the kind of consumption slowdown that one is seeing? In terms of earnings, it seems that price hikes may actually add to Unilever’s top line growth but from a demand scenario, what would you be looking out for from the management commentary today?In the recent conference call, they had clearly indicated that there might be a bit of a slowdown in volume growth, given the stress that was there in the rural markets and we believe overall earlier people were hoping for a 7-8% kind of a volume growth, that had tapered down to about 4-5%.

I do not think there should be too much an issue in terms of achieving a 3-4% kind of a volume growth at this point of time which the market will be very comfortable with because they have taken a price hike and also GST has been a big beneficiary for a company like HUL. Therefore, a 3-4% kind of a volume growth is what we are working with and in the current environment, it should be taken very positively by the market.

More importantly, given the incremental slowdown that we are witnessing in the last three to four weeks, what kind of guidance the management is able to give is something that the market would be watching out for. 


What about L&T? What is your perspective on that heavyweight. Also, what are you watching out for earnings there today?L&T should report a decent set of numbers. We are looking at a 10% revenue growth and operating profit margin somewhere in the range of about 10-10.5% and despite the slowdown in the broader economy and capex cycle not being there, the order inflow continues to be good for L&T because a large part of their revenue comes from the export market. 

I think these numbers should look good, the order inflow is something that we will be watching out for. If there is any major negative commentary or surprise, then that is something the market may not like but in the current environment it makes sense to stick to such large cap names at this point of time. 


What do you make of the current selling which is only coming to two names HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank? Is it time to derate them or is this pure FII selling adjustment and eventually the decline in HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be a buying opportunity?In terms of performance, in case of both HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank, there is no reason to be uncomfortable or if there was any major disappointment. Yes the loan growth was a bit lower but in the current environment, it looks pretty okay. 

The way I read the situation is that there was a good amount of money moving into these names because of the comfort and at some stage, that incremental buying has stopped and that is why we are seeing a bit of a correction. I do not think we should worry too much about that if you look at HDFC Bank. In almost 30 quarters, the stock has not corrected more than 11%-12% which is quite an achievement. I do not think we should worry about small corrections in these names as long as the performances are coming through.


What do you make of yesterday’s price action in Yes Bank? We learnt that Dewan Housing is in its final lap to reach a debt resolution with their lenders. If that is the case and if debt holders do not take a large haircut, Yes Bank could benefit disproportionately because 1.5% of the total book currently is exposed to DHFL. Would you buy Yes Bank with the assumption that the rate of change could be constructive for Yes Bank?It is hard to gauge that way. We have to see to what extent, DHFL and its resolution is favourable to the lenders. The larger concern in Yes Bank is that since they have started providing for the bad quality assets, how long that process will continue and given the size of the book that they have and exposure to real estate and some of the SME sector companies, it is hard to figure out how long that will go on. More importantly, what kind of capital raising they are able to do and the dilution etc. 

Because some of these stocks have corrected quite sharply over the last few months, you might see a bit of a pullback and this news flow about Dewan Housing, for almost six months, we have been talking about resolution in Zee, Dewan Housing and many other companies. which is taking its own time. I would not really react to such news flow and buy into some of the stocks which have corrected so badly. I would definitely wait for a larger stability in the business before I really buy into these names.


What has been the activity at your firm? What are HNI investors doing?The HNI investors were actually looking to buy into some of the broader names but the overall incremental money which is moving into the market is extremely slow. What people are focussing more on is in terms of rebalancing of the portfolio and trying to buy some kind of a protection because it looks like there might be an extended period of volatility in the market as we have seen in the last two weeks. At the same time, the retail investors’ participation through mutual funds and particularly SIP, not the lump sum that continues to have a good traction. Overall activity is extremely slow but on the F&O side, there are people who are more active in terms of doing various strategies and the overall volume continues to remain good but the direct pure equity delivery based business the traction is much lower."
40,2019-07-23,Bajaj Finserv,"Many midcaps funds own which companies are not necessarily tiny companies. They are not unproven companies. Finding an opportunity there, spotting a company and backing their own conviction could prove to be more rewarding, says Dhirendra Kumar, CEO, Value Research. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

If you look at the past three months, one month or for that matter even a one year performance of any small and midcap fund, you start wondering whether you should be investing at all in any of these schemes or not. But do you think right now is the time to buy this fear? When everything is at rock bottom, in the next five years, you are sure to make better returns, maybe even bigger than largecaps?Oh! You have been too kind. In fact, all the investors who got excited about investing in mutual funds or initiate their SIPs when the whole Mutual Fund Sahi Hai Campaign took off, through 2017, are all very disappointed. The number of mails that we get at Value Research online tells how apprehensive the new investors are. It has been very disappointing. But at the same time, it is not something which is unusual. Equity turns out to be disappointing many a time and for a prolonged period of time and if you are investing, if you are in your accumulation phase, if you have chosen the right vehicle, if you are in the right kind of fund, do carry on. You do not have a choice. 

The only problem is investors came with a short-term expectation and so they are disappointed. They will remain disappointed. They will not be able to meet their goal. But if you are investing for three years, five years, ten years, I do not think you have anything to worry about. 

For two years, every fund manager we have spoken to said that the market is not cheap and looks like we are getting to a phase where market if not cheap, will be reasonably valued. Stopping your investment and getting out of the market at the worst time is one of the biggest mistake a investor can make and should not do that.




Is this the right time to get into midcap SIP, given the fact that two years ago we saw a very different scenario and midcaps trading at a premium are actually trading at a 30% discount? While there is a sense of nervousness around that basket of the market, it could also be an opportunity. What is your view, is this the right time to get into that pocket of the market?Whenever we think of the tough times, the big guys actually rule the market but the way the midcap universe is getting defined and in fact got articulated by the regulator that companies which are not among the top 100 companies are midcap and the next 100 (101 to 200) on the market cap in the descending order are midcaps. 

There could be a large number of companies which will be market leaders in their small sub segment or sub sectors. Many midcaps funds own which companies are not necessarily tiny companies. They are not unproven companies. Finding an opportunity there, spotting a company and backing their own conviction could prove to be more rewarding.

It also does not come with risk, given that we have seen those corrections. The kind of corrections in some of those midcaps can actually turn out to be very robust businesses and potentially become largecaps. There are five-six companies which comes to my mind which are great examples of that. One can take lesson from Bajaj Finserv in 10-years time frame, Aurobindo Pharma or five-seven other examples which have actually turned from smallcap to midcap and for the midcap funds which own a few of them, 90% of their blockbuster returns were derived from that. It is going to be the story even from here on. 

The investors investing in midcap funds today are unlikely to be wrong as much as they were likely to be wrong in 2017 when it seemed all stocks have PEs of 70, 80, and everybody thought magic is about to happen.


At a time when we have at least five to six dozen funds which promise you a take on the Indian midcap economy, how does one filter the names to two-three and maximum five?You have reasonable choice here but if you filter the funds on the basis of the fact that they should have been through two market cycles that is at least a eight-nine years. Somebody who has a well articulated principle which looks convincing and third, you know they have done well not by taking an extreme step. There are funds which look very impressive simply because they were in cash at an opportune time or they raised the money at a point which is favourable. Based on this, if you apply in some of these filters and a fund manager who have been around who have the person who is managing the fund have been around for that long, if I have to you know apply these filters I will be left with no more than four or five."
42,2019-07-24,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty ended with losses on Wednesday as selloff continued on D-Street for the fifth session making it the longest losing streak in over two months. The markets were dragged by auto, metal, energy, banking and pharma stocks as IMF's cut of India's growth outlook dampened sentiments.

The IMF on Tuesday projected a slower growth rate for India with a downward revision of 0.3 per cent for both 2019 and 2020 saying its GDP will now grow respectively at the rate of 7 and 7.2 per cent, reflecting a weaker than expected outlook for domestic demand.

Analysts said that concerns over an economic slowdown, weak corporate earnings and IMF's downward revision of India's economic outlook weighed on the domestic market. 

Heavy foreign fund outflow and weak monsoon were also hurting investor sentiment, analysts added. IMD had recently said that deficient rainfall was expected over half of India this season.

Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak Securities said, ""Nifty broke its recent bottom of 11460 and has been under pressure since then. On the downside trend support is seen at 11000-11100 levels; unless a strong reversal is seen there remains a chance of the same being tested. We expect volatility to remain high in the near term and the index to stage a strong recovery with support of 11000 levels. Midcap indices have been under pressure and currently trade near critical support levels; any upside momentum would indicate possibility of a strong reversal in the space.""

Asian Paints was among the top gainers in the Sensex pack gaining 3.42 per cent on BSE after the company said its consolidated net profit after minority interest jumped 17.7 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 655 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 compared with Rs 556.85 crore in the same quarter last year. The number beat ET Now's poll estimate of Rs 547 crore profit. 

Investors are now keeping a close watch on Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, who are scheduled to announce their June quarter results tomorrow, for further cues. Analysts expect volatility to persist in the coming sessions, as the markets are expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings season.

On the global front, Asian shares closed higher on prospects of fresh Sino-US trade talks. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.1 per cent and Chinese blue chips climbed 0.8 per cent. 

BSE Sensex closed 135.09 points or 0.36 per cent lower at 37,847.65 while NSE Nifty ended at 11,271.30, down 59.75 points or 0.53 per cent.

Consolidated total income increased 39.92 per cent to Rs 12,272.26 crore during the quarter under review against Rs 8,771.06 crore in the same period last year. 

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for the various financial services businesses under the Bajaj group.

While commenting on the quarterly results, the company said, “During this quarter, the tight liquidity conditions witnessed in the aftermath of a default by IL&FS did not show signs of abatement and companies with strong balance sheets were favoured by lending banks and investors. This quarter also witnessed default by Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL), a housing finance company, on the part of its commercial paper dues.”

In this difficult environment, it is heartening to see Bajaj Finance continue to deliver excellent results. While both BAGIC and BALIC recorded strong growth in premiums, their profits were adversely impacted by provision for impairment on their holdings of DHFL’s fixed income securities. BAGIC's underwriting result was also negatively impacted by losses from cyclone Fani which hit India's east coast in the quarter, the company said."

NSE Nifty managed to hold the 11,200 level and attracted buying interest towards 11,300 on Friday. The index formed a small bodied candle on the daily scale and bearish candle on the weekly chart, which indicates that selling was seen at higher levels.

The immediate structure of Nifty is under pressure and it has to surpass and hold above 11,320 to witness short term bounce towards 11,365 and then 11,420 while a hold below the same could drag it towards 11,200.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,200 strike while maximum Call open interest was at 12,000 followed by 11,500 strike. We have seen Put writing at 11,300 followed by 11,000 strike while Call writing was seen at 11,300 followed by 11,800 strike.

53,2019-07-26,Bajaj Finserv,"We are a very small part of the whole lending system and therefore the size of the opportunity is very large, says S Sreenivasan, Chief Financial Officer, Bajaj Finserv. Excerpts from an interview with ET NOW.


Let us first talk about the consolidated profits seeing a marginal growth. While Bajaj Finance has reported strong profits, what led to the degrowth on the general insurance side?
General insurance growth has been fairly strong. We have grown 17% on the gross return premium. However, on the profitability side, we have two-three one-off events that affected profits. Last year we had return crop insurance in the rabi season. This year, we had extra underwriting losses of Rs 98 crore because of crop insurances. You do get large losses because of weather. The losses are determined a couple of months after the end of the year, so we lost about Rs 98 crore extra there. We had another Rs 30 crore of losses from the cyclone Fani which hit the east coast of India early in the quarter. These are the two major reasons.

There is also a slight uptick in our motor own-damage claims, but as we go along, we hope to correct that. If you exclude these one-off events, the underlying results has been quite strong. Obviously, on the investment side, we have taken a call to provide for 60% of our exposure to DHFL, which affected BAGIC profits by about 76 crore in this quarter.


What is your total exposure to DHFL now? How much more provision is needed and are there any other stressed accounts you could mention?Last year, we had provided 100% exposure to IL&FS, DHFL in Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company (BAGIC). We had provided Rs 76 crore which is 60% of the total exposure of Rs 123 crore -- all in non-convertible debentures. In the life company, we have provided Rs 126 crore in this quarter which is 60% of the total exposure on the shareholders account of around Rs 210 crore. Out of this, Rs 50 crore is in CPs which they defaulted at the end of June and otherwise the rest is in NCDs which will fall due over the next two to three years. Other than that, we actually publish stressed accounts every quarter. Every quarter in the insurance companies we make them public in a list of downgraded securities. As some of them are not stressed today, we have a watch list which we observe very closely and are deeply engaged with companies to understand moves there.


If possible, could you highlight what is on that watch list or at least give us a flavour of what sectors you may have there?It depends as some of them are based on market rumours. Insurance companies are required by regulation to invest in certain sectors which are socially desirable, including housing and infrastructure which are two sectors that have undergone severe stress. That is where we have some of our investments. But some of these stressed names are market rumours. We do not see that either in the credit ratings or in their financial performance, so it will be too premature to comment on those. But to the extent that they have been downgraded, even from AAA to AA, we have to disclose that.


Could you give us a ballpark figure of the exposure you would have to housing and the real estate segment?In housing and real estate it is only the DHFL bonds. We do not consider the lot of public sector companies as stressed at all, it is only DHFL for which I have already given the numbers out. In infrastructure we had IL&FS for which we are fully provided.


 Let us talk about your deposit growth that has improved on a sequential basis. What will be the share of deposits over FY20 on the consolidated book and how do you see your margins shaping up as well?Around 14-15% of our book is now deposits. This is one area which we have been growing over the last four-five years and will continue to stress on. We have increased the number of locations where we offer fixed deposits to our customers. After this liquidity squeeze of the last one year, we have seen that there is a demand for high quality papers like ours and therefore we expect a lot of demand for fixed deposits going forward. Over the next two-three years, we want to increase the share of deposits in our overall book to diversify our liability base. I cannot give you an exact number, but we would want it to be significantly higher than today.


Coming back to the insurance side, motor insurance currently accounts for 42% and we have seen a slowdown. How do you see that impacting premium, profit growth for FY20? Give us a sense of how things stand.Motor has multiple segments. We have passenger cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles. In terms of new vehicle sales, as you have correctly mentioned, there has been a slowdown in growth over the last several months. However, the insured pool includes a lot of vehicles which are already on the road, including ones that are already insured with other companies. Last year, after the Supreme Court mandated that new cars should have three years of third-party insurance and two wheelers have five years, a lot of the uninsured vehicles, especially in the two-wheeler segment, are now automatically insured. That led to some growth. As far as the pricing in motor is concerned, yes, there is pressure. 

It is not new for the market. For the last several years we are seeing significant competition on the own-damage front. For the third party, the price is controlled by the regulator. They have given a modest increase from 1st July. We will have to see how it pans out. But our third-party portfolio related to markets is significantly better. Our loss ratios are lower. On a consolidated basis, we are quite optimistic about the profitability of the portfolio. In terms of growth, yes, it is a business of selection. We will continue to monitor wherever there are pockets of upward moving loss ratios and we are correcting them. That is what we have been doing for years and our general insurance company will continue to do that over the next three quarters.


 Shift to life insurance now because while premium growth has been strong for you, how has the new business premium margin shaped up? What would you say has been the growth in embedded value?We published that only once a year because the first quarter for life insurance is very low. But last year FY19 we reported new business margins of about 15.6% and after a few years where we had large over runs, we were able to report a positive net margin of about 6.5%. The new business value had grown by almost 54% last year before the overruns. As of now in the first quarter, we seem to be on the same trajectory. Unfortunately, the profit and loss account of a life insurance company is affected by two factors. 

As you grow, you will have a new business and your profits will actually come out of the renewable book. But I am happy to say that our renewable book has recorded 29% growth in this quarter. Our overall new business premium has grown 41%. And most importantly, we had diversified our product mix away from ULIP a couple of years ago. Now we stand at 61% ULIP and 39% traditional business. That is helping us quite a lot in giving balance and sustainability to the portfolio. So the life business on all parameters of quality, growth, margins and product mix has done very well. On the profit and loss account, because of the provision for DHFL, unfortunately we have had a de-growth in profit. If you exclude that provision, we would have recorded an increase in profit after tax for the quarter after several years. 


What impacted profits in the life insurance business?Our new business has grown by more than 40%. Clearly In new business, the first year is a loss and it will be to the extent of the growth. Secondly, we have a provision of Rs 126 crore pre-tax for DHFL, which I mentioned already. But for these, the underlying business is very strong. New business value is the correct measure and we are on track to record reasonable growth in that segmwnt.


What is the update on the Allianz JV? The management so far has maintained that Allianz continues to be a partner. Is there a case for the JV being pulled off or looking at any other partners in the insurance business?No way. I think there is nothing on the cards along those lines. Allianz continues to be a strong partner and we are deeply engaged with them on a regular basis. They have reiterated their commitment to India and to the joint ventures.


While management has clarified to the media that Bajaj Finance will be raising a capital of $1-1.25 billion in the second half, what really is the rationale of this capital raising when you just raised capital about a year and a half back?You see, capital is required to support growth. On a normal basis if we are growing at 20-25% given the profit margins that BFL delivers and capital would not be required. However, they have been growing significantly higher than that. We look at several things when we want to decide capital. One of them is our leverage ratio compared to the average of the NBFC sector. We normally tend to be a little bit more conservative on leverage, so we never allow it to go beyond seven. And the moment it crosses six, we start looking at the alternate means of funding. Although every time we raise capital we think it will last us for three-four years, the company’s performance on the growth side has been so strong that sometimes we may have to do it a bit earlier. We are looking at that option maybe later in this year if we continue to grow at this rate.


 In the investor presentation yesterday, the management talked about tighter underwriting standards. Will that also mean slower AUM growth going forward?Not necessarily. We are not slowing growth, that is not the objective of the management. If you look the last 10 years of BFL, it has been good at being able to find warning signs early as the underwriting standards keep changing depending on the market conditions. This is not a high-level change. These are small, micro changes you make on each portfolio to ensure that credit quality is where you want. The external environment today has a lot of uncertainties. As you have seen, there has been muted growth on automobiles and some parts of consumer discretionary spending. In such a situation it is natural that cash flows in the economy will get tighter and we are preparing ourselves by tweaking some of our underwriting standards to ensure that the business quality remains the same. Having said that, the management has also confirmed yesterday that 65% of the business is for existing customers, which means that we already know the credit quality of those customers. This is a very intense micro-level exercise which the management does in a very precise fashion to ensure that we maintain the balance between growth and profitability. But managing risk is the underlying essence of management of an NBFC, and BFL has shown that year after year.


 What is your view on the housing finance subsidiary? Can you tell us what is the state of asset quality here?Practically, I have no NPAs in the housing finance subsidiary as of now. We are a very small player in housing finance. Our AUM is just 21,000 crore there, but it is something we want to develop into a low cost, profitable housing-finance entity. The risk philosophy of the group will continue in the HFC. It is too early to talk about the profits given that they have been in business only for about 18 months, but we are very satisfied with the the profit they have generated and with the performance of the HFC. It is the largest pool of lending assets in the country, probably with the lowest risk in terms of the salaried finance and individual retail finance. That is the area where we would predominantly be focussing. I think it will take another two-three years for that company to really come up because it is a start-up entity. Let us see how it goes.


With both real estate and consumption demand slowing down and real estate languishing for a while now, do you sense that your AUM growth could be slower than 40% going forward?See, I do not have a crystal ball. All I can say is that when times are tough, demand for money actually increases. And where lenders have to be cautious is on the lending side -- who you want to give to. Therefore, there are many borderline cases that during good times when the cash flows in the economy are very strong, they will do very well. There you will prune a little bit however. We are a very small part of the whole lending system and therefore the size of the opportunity is very large. We have a very large customer base and cross-sell base. Therefore, we are very confident that we will be able to beat the market going forward.


Can you maintain the AUM growth in the rage of 35-40%?No, we actually always give a guidance that our target is to grow AUM at about 25-27%, 3-3.5% return on assets and an 18-20% ROE. However, depending on the economy, you could have volatility and beta factors playing which means that sometimes you deliver significantly higher than that. It so happened for several quarters. Quarter after quarter we have been delivering higher than that, but as management, we would not like to give that kind of prognosis."

56,2019-07-29,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: June quarter turned out to be a period of painful wealth destruction for investors on Dalal Street, but promoters of 43 BSE500 companies –barring PSU banks – took advantage of the price correction to increase their holdings.

 Analysts say promoter raising stake in a company provides a certain degree of comfort to market participants. However, that is just one tick on the boxes while selecting a stock, they caution.

 Data from Ace Equity showed shares of over 70 per cent companies, where promoters increased their holdings during the quarter, saw a correction during the quarter.

 Among the companies in which promoter holding went up during the quarter, eClerx Services, Escorts, Glenmark Pharma, Vodafone Idea, GMR Infrastructure, Eris Lifesciences and Sterlite Technologies saw their shares slip 20-34 per cent while Sequent Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Zensar Technologies, Rajesh Exports, Shoppers Stop, NTPC, Meghmani Organics, APL Apollo Tubes and Can Fin Home registered gains of 3-23 per cent.

 “Investors should not follow anyone blindly, even if they are promoters or large institutional investors. The promoters’ objective could be very different from that of an ordinary retail investor. Promoters increasing stake should only act as a catalyst in one’s investment decision,” said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst.

 Companies like NIIT Technologies, Bajaj Finance, DLF, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finserv, Jindal Steel and Power and Persistent Systems witnessed a substantial rise in promoters’ holding during the quarter.

 Likewise, promoters raised their stake from 49.03 per cent to 49.56 per cent in Bajaj Holdings, from 57.96 per cent to 57.52 per cent in TV Today Network and from 63.54 per cent to 63.22 per cent in GMR Infrastructure.

 “It is not sufficient to simply rely on promoter buying to own a stock. Yes, it could give some comfort to investors. But it should be supplemented by other factors like valuations, size of leveraging, outlook for the business, and one also needs to check whether the management is a time-tested one,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.

 Buying in a handful of largecap stocks took BSE benchmark Sensex 2.20 per cent higher to 39,395 on June 28, 2019 from 38,546 on March 28. However, the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices dipped 3.40 per cent and 4.55 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

 “If you are planning to chase promoters in this market, we should remember that promoters too are a smart lot. There is a need to check whether they are trying to beat investors at their own game. In a market like this, one should look for positive cash flow of the business before even looking at any other parameter,” said Baliga.

 In the BSE500 index, Natco Pharma, Trident, Gateway Distriparks, Cyient, Indostar Capital Finance, Thyrocare Technologies, Infosys, Nava Bharat Ventures and Maharasthra Seamless were among the stocks that saw promoter stake go up during the quarter."

0,2019-08-02,Bajaj Finserv,"There is a lot of money to be made in auto in three, four years, though not in three- four months, says Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Some of the auto names including Maruti closed yesterday with mild gain despite the weak data, production cuts and so on. Would you be getting into any of these names -- be it four-wheelers or two-wheelers -- on the basis of valuation currently?Some of the market leaders frankly are still not undervalued. Make no mistake and some of them are still trading at expensive valuations despite almost 50% correction from their peaks. That is the current day challenge. 

From September, the base effect will start kicking in. If you remember, IL&FS had defaulted exactly a year back in the last week of August. The slowdown in the auto numbers had started showing up from September 2018. 

Starting September 2019, the base effect will start kicking in and at least optically there is a chance that at least the sales figure may appear like say plus 2%, plus 3%, though nowhere back to its previous highs. But at least optically it may look like positive demand scenario. Also there is pre Diwali demand. Diwali is on October 27th and in the first half of October, it is Dussehra. So, the festive demand is expected to start kicking in from the second half of September. 

Even though it will be difficult to guess if this time there will be any festive cheer, but if there is even a small momentum, there is a good chance that auto numbers may start appearing as a growing phenomenon, not close to its previous peaks but at least the current gloom may go out of the window. 

But as the prices are still expensive, I feel downsides may still open up. More opportunities will come for the investors but if you are looking for three to four years, I am sure the cycle will turn at some point maybe in three or six months. But there is a lot of money to be made in three, four years, though not in three-four months. 


With the sort of slowdown news that you are getting, is the downside move justified?Absolutely. Actually it is a good in a sense for the market because in last 12 months, market was trading at five-star rating when the economy was at three-star level. Now finally that alignment process has started commencing where market is giving away and finally the alignment is happening. Right now, the economy is at three-star level and the market is at four-star. If that alignment happens, it is extremely good for new money to come in, especially from the ultra HNIs or the family offices or the global long only funds. This money could come in and create a perfect base for the market. In that sense it is extremely good. 

And if you look at the overall Nifty earnings, an extremely disturbing trend that is developing is that 29 out of 50 Nifty stocks have posted results and as of now, there is a 7% degrowth in the EPS. I do not remember when was the last time Nifty 50 companies posted a degrowth on earnings! We may end up the result season on a degrowth note. 

Already there is no earnings comfort. Generally, earnings have to weigh about 60% importance in the overall market movement and pattern. So the backbone of the market is being challenged. Keeping all those things in account, if more corrections were to come, I am sure the real smart money and the family offices and high quality money will be eagerly getting into market. What is happening is extremely good for the long-term health of the market.


As you pointed out earlier, this is a good time to buy stocks, a good time to go ahead and invest for the long term. Which are the stocks and sectors that you would look to buy at a decline?A small clarification I said that the misalignment that happened between the capital markets and the economy is getting corrected. That will give eventual extra comfort to HNIs and family offices to come in. What was happening is that because market was elevated and economy was bad, new money was not coming in and the only to that extent, I was saying that eventually when this fall gets arrested, the valuations should have reached a level which will be aligning with the current economic reality which may excite some of the investors to take a contrarian bet on the market. 

In terms of the stock ideas we like life insurance space. We believe it is a huge long term 5-10 years kind of story which has already created a lot of wealth over the last six months to one year and shown an extremely good rally despite the market conditions. 

Globally, insurance companies tend to have higher market cap than the banking companies whereas in India, the largest life insurance company in terms of market capitalisation -- HDFC Life -- is at about 1 lakh crore market cap. The largest bank is about Rs 5 lakh crore market cap. I feel this alignment is bound to get corrected and life insurance companies can be a very major opportunity.

So is the case with city gas distribution companies because the government is very clear that they want to reduce the dependence on oil. They have to create an alternate mechanism and city gas distribution is a good opportunity for them to set the tone right for the next five years. 

I feel life insurance and city gas distribution are two sectors one can look at long term instead of focussing on very short term per se.


What has been your takeaway from the banking earnings so far? Which are the names that you are focussing on currently within the financials?If you look at the overall earning season, the non-BFSI space has been a clear laggard and within Nifty stocks also, non-BFSI companies have posted minus 16% earnings dip. That is unbelievable by any standards. While the banking BFSI space has posted 38% growth, that is understandable because in the previous two years, almost all the banks have cleaned up their books and have provided extra provisions which has created extremely low base. So the current performance in terms of the low base effect, is clearly appearing as a higher growth scenario plus 38% in the earnings growth. 

If there is a dip, Axis Bank can still give opportunity even though commentary has been bad and the company was talking about new fundraising. Whenever that were to happen, I am sure it will happen at a discount and that may give opportunity for long term investors who have missed out previous six to nine months of rally to get in.

Also, ICICI Bank can be bought on dips because the performance has been good and whoever has missed out earlier, can keep these two stocks in radar. I am not saying that the bottoms have been created because markets were all over the place but a deep correction will give a very good opportunity to get in. 

Also if the overall market gets into the capitulation mode, there is a very good chance that the H2B2 (the HDFC, HDFC Bank and Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finserv) can get deep corrections and that may give a very good opportunity to get in. 

So stick to frontline stocks, because many largecaps are slowly becoming midcaps. If you are bullish on midcaps, you can focus on some of those large caps which got corrected."

4,2019-08-10,Bajaj Finserv,"In a grim job market the surprise bit of good news is that temporary staffing may shoot up in the coming festive season. And the reason is counterintuitive.

Precisely because consumer demand is stagnant companies are looking to push sales aggressively and therefore hire more staff. Staffing firms like Quess, TeamLease Services, Manpower, Kelly Services and CIEL HR Services expect a 10%-15% jump in temp hiring. .

“Companies will try harder to promote sales during the season,” said BN Thammaiah, managing director, Kelly Services India. “Overall temp staff hiring may be upwards of 15%”, he said. Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO of CIEL HR Services, said he anticipates a 10% growth in demand for temp staff.

There is higher demand for people in customer services, logistics and sales, said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder, TeamLease Services. “Undergraduates/graduates with good communication skills are very employable in sales jobs, delivery and food tech,” she said.

Temp staffing firms said ecommerce firms led by Flipkart and Amazon will be frontrunners in hiring. Swiggy and Urban Clap are others with hiring plans.



Consumer durables and retail sectors, too, have upped hiring. Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) is also expected to join the hiring bandwagon, with HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Bajaj Finserv planning to push products at points of sale. Laggards are automotive and manufacturing sectors.

""For us, BFSI has emerged in pole position, followed closely by retail,” said Lohit Bhatia, president, workforce management at Quess Corp.

A majority of millennials are looking for EMI options, bundled offers and special schemes while purchasing products, which banks, non-banking finance companies and consumer loan providers will hard-sell during the festive season, Bhatia said.
Alok Kumar, senior director (sales, account management and global accounts) at Manpower India, said the company expects a 25-30% increase in demand for temp workers compared to last year.

“Consumer companies – durables, mobile devices, lifestyle products — are looking positive as they will focus on this period to revive sales. Finance companies dealing with consumer loans are also coming up with large demands. With quick loans available for end-customers, consumer companies are piggy-backing their fortunes on these,” Kumar said.

The demand for temp staffers typically begins from the Onam festival in Kerala and lasts up to New Year’s Eve. For most companies, particularly those in the retail and fast moving consumer goods space, about 60% of annual sales happen during these months. This year, with Eid and Independence Day running into weekends, the action is poised to kick off earlier.

Flipkart and Samsung did not respond to email queries. An Amazon spokesperson told ET it was too early to share projected numbers (on hiring temp staff) for this year. Panasonic India is looking to increase temp hiring by 25% compared to the previous year, said Adarsh Mishra, its chief human resources officer."

19,2019-08-27,Bajaj Finserv,"ET Intelligence Group: The stock of Nestle India hit a record high on the speculation of being included in the Nifty 50 index in its next reshuffle. However, short-term investors may well book profit in the stock if such an inclusion stands confirmed.

This is because two out of every three companies that have made it to the Nifty in the past five years have posted negative returns in the year after inclusion. As many as 19 out of the 21 stocks underperformed after a year of inclusion against their performance a year before, indicating that the Nifty inclusion comes at the time of peak performance. It is also indicative that much of the positive sentiment surrounding the inclusion gets factored in well before the actual inclusion.

For instance, the Britannia stock was included in the Nifty in March this year. The stock is down 18 per cent since, whereas it had gained 20 per cent in the year before the inclusion. Similarly, JSW Steel, which got added in October 2018, is down 44 per cent till now. It had posted 52 per cent gains in the year preceding its inclusion.

Only two – Eicher Motors and Bajaj Finserv – of the 21 stocks that got included in the Nifty in the past five years performed better a year after their inclusion in the benchmark index. Trading at very high valuation of 71 times of its trailing four quarter earnings, the Nestle stock will be the most expensive FMCG stock in the index, if included.

Nestle India reported an exceptional performance in the latest quarter to June, posting 10.5 per cent growth in volume amid overall slowdown in demand.

While acknowledging the slowdown, the management has hinted of single-digit growth this year. The company posted a smart recovery since FY16 when its flagship noodle brand Maggi got embroiled in controversy concerning its quality. The company has institutional holding of 20 per cent. Its return on net worth stands at 45 per cent and return on capital employed at 43 per cent. The company is relaunching its global malt-based drink Milo in India."

0,2019-09-02,Bajaj Finserv,"Indian stocks have struggled to stay afloat in the past few months but there are some that have managed to buck the declining trend – over the medium term. Only 26 of the BSE500 stocks have outperformed the benchmark in each of the past three years.

Stocks such as P&G, Future Lifestyle, Vinati Organics, NIIT Technologies, Bata India, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, and Honeywell Automation have given more returns than the Sensex in each of the past two calendar years — 2017 and 2018 — and so far in 2019.

Shares of Vinati Organics surged 34 per cent so far this year after rallying 66 per cent in each of 2017 and 2018. Vinati, the world’s largest manufacturer of Isobutylbenzene (IBB) and manufacturer of 2–Acrylamido 2–Methylpropane Sulfonic Acid (ATBS), should continue to outperform on the back of strong traction in ATBS owing to robust demand and shortage of global capacity. Similarly, Bata India has given returns of 34 per cent, 50 per cent and 68 per cent in the past three years, respectively, as the premiumisation drive boosted margins for the 13th successive quarter. Hence, investors seeking growth stocks to beat the current bear market can look into these counters for decent returns over the medium term."

9,2019-09-13,Bajaj Finserv,"Nobody, trust us, nobody has ever got it right while trying to tell a market bottom. The textbook trick is: start buying when the last bull has turned a bear!

Dalal Street’s biggest bull, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has already turned bullish. “Indicators are suggesting that stocks have bottomed out, particularly midcaps, and this is a good time to invest,” he told a TV channel on Thursday.

Meanwhile, adverse macro-economic factors that were causing all the trouble in the market have started improving: the US and China are making goodwill gestures, no-deal Brexit is off the table, ECB going in for fresh bond buying, and back home the government is getting serious about hand-holding the distressed sectors of the economy. IIP print for July did show a turnaround, though economists were cautious with that number.

Domestic stock investors surely have a huge opportunity here; the challenge is in one’s ability to spot the right stock. Stocks have been beaten down across sectors and many of them today trade really cheap by any valuation matrix.

Investors are already busy mining value bets and BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have started showing early signs of brisk buying, having managed to outpace the benchmark Sensex in four out of past five sessions (till September 12).

“It is difficult to call the market bottom,” says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. “But it is looking like a good time to go bargain hunting, even though there is some degree of risk out there. One should always realise that bargains are only available when there is a degree of risk. It does feel a little difficult from an economic perspective, but you should go bargain hunting when you still feel a little risk in the air,” he said.

At ETMarkets, when we applied some filters, we found around 350 stocks that have fallen 10-97 per cent from their respective all-time highs scaled in last three years.

This list includes only liquid companies that reported profits in last five financial years.

And then, we applied a few more filters on them. Check out what we found:-


1) Stocks that have slipped 10-20%The list threw up 48 stocks that are down up to 20 per cent from their all-time highs. The list even included some of the largecaps such as HDFC Bank, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra and Bajaj Finserv.






2) Stocks down 20-40%Most stocks on this list are midcaps or smallcaps and several auto majors that have taken a big knock after the severe slowdown. So the list included Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, The Federal Bank, Tata Chemicals, Chambal Fertilisers and Cholamandalam Finance.








3) Stocks down 40-60%This list, too, includes select auto and auto ancillaries, besides media and NBFC companies. Among them are M&M, Balmer Lawrie, TV Today, LIC Housing Finance and TVS Motor, which have eroded nearly 50 per cent of investor wealth from their all-time high levels.










4) Stocks down 60-80%Avanti Feeds, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Phillips Carbon Black, Indiabulls Housing Finance, NBCC and JBM Auto are some of the names on this list








5) Stock down more than 80%The list topper here is, of course, YES Bank, which faces corporate governance issues. Others included Geojit Financial Services, PC Jeweller, Vakrangee, Kushal and Excel Realty, which have wiped out up to 97 per cent of investor wealth.




6) Stocks below industry PE averagesWe further shortened the list to look for stocks trading a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios that are below their respective industry averages. It threw up nearly 230 names, which included Apollo Tyres, Bajaj Consumer, Deepak Fertilisers, Eveready Industries, M&M and YES Bank, among others.






7) Stocks trading below book valueThis screener threw up some 60 names. The list included YES Bank, Indian Bank, GSCL, Gujarat State Fertilisers, Arvind, Welspun Enterprises and JK Tyre, among others.




8) Stocks with YoY profit & sales growthWhen the list was further filtered for companies that reported a rise in profit and sales on a year-on-year basis for last four quarters, it yielded just seven stocks: Welspun Enterprises, Goodluck India, REC, GHCL, Globus Spirits, Himatsingka Seida and Sukhjit Starch & Chemicals."

Where are We? Nifty has formed a bullish long body candle and weekly candle with long lower shadow indicating sustained throughout the day from lower levels. Though the index closed off its high of 11382, it has cleared its resistance of 11150-11230 where a cluster of resistances were seen. The Nifty has given a breakout after consolidating between 10637 and 11150 levels. Thus, any decline in the market towards 11150-11100 zone will be an opportunity to go long in the market for higher levels. Above 11380, the next levels are seen at 11542 and 11650. Below 11100, next supports is seen at 11000-10950.


What is in Store? In Nifty September monthly expiry options, maximum open interest for puts is seen at strike of 11000 followed by 10800; while for calls, maximum open interest is seen at 11200 followed by 11300 and 11500. Significant amount of put writing was seen in 11000 to 11200 indicating that the base has shifted higher. Nifty Put-Call option distribution data is suggesting support at 11000 levels and resistance at 11500. India VIX was up 9.07 per cent to close at 15.40 levels after a volatile week. Decline in the VIX from current levels will be supportive for the market in sustaining the up-move.


What could Investors Do? On the stocks front, Avenue Supermarts, Hindustan Unilever, Voltas, HDFC AMC are showing fresh breakout at all-time high levels; while Bajaj Finserv, Larsen & Toubro have seen consolidation at lower levels and started fresh up-trend."
18,2019-09-23,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: The government’s move to lower corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent is likely to ensure Rs 72,000 crore savings for about 300-odd companies in the BSE500 basket. This would improve cash flows and earnings, and may help a few companies boost demand by passing on the tax benefits to end users.

In value terms, banks and financials, oil & gas, metals and mining, consumption and capital goods companies would gain the most, analysts said. Sectors such as IT, pharmaceuticals and electric utilities may see only limited gains, they said.

Stocks such as HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finserv and State Bank of India, among others, may lead the BFSI space with Rs 27,994 crore in savings in FY21, suggests a study by KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Stocks like ONGC, IOC and Reliance Industries could add Rs 12,459 crore to profits. Metals and mining firms such as Vedanta, Coal India and Tata Steel may add Rs 8,820 crore to aggregate bottom line. Consumption stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints and Nestle India, among others, and capital goods companies L&T, Siemens and others may together see over Rs 11,000 crore addition to their profits.



Having said that, the stocks may not go on a relentless rally. Edelweiss Securities said after Friday’s big rally, upsides may be more modest from here on.

The brokerage projects Nifty at 11,600 by September, 2020. That said, the brokerage sees more opportunities to take on risk at stock as well as portfolio levels.

Goldman Sachs on Friday reasserted its positive view on India, and raised its 12-month Nifty target to 13,200 from 12,500 earlier, saying recent pro-growth measures, a boost to already the highest earnings growth in the region and a likely revival in sentiment further strengthen the positive investment case for India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said companies currently availing exemptions can opt for paying the new tax rates, only once the exemption periods get over. On the other hand, companies which will avail the lower tax rate will not be able to avail any of the exemptions.

Domestic equity indices saw their second-biggest intraday rally of the year on Friday, as the Rs 1.45 lakh crore tax relief brought down effective tax rate for domestic companies to 25.6 per cent from 34.9 per cent. Sensex galloped 1,921 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 38,014, while Nifty zoomed 569 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 11,274.

Meanwhile, MAT or minimum alternate 
tax which applies to ‘zero 
tax companies’ has been reduced to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent earlier.

“Looking at the PAT boost due to lower taxes and keeping the current Street expectations and valuations in mind, we could see a 23 per cent upside in the overall market in next 2- 3 years,” KR Choksey said in a note.


Guest contributor and other agenciesSource: KR Choksey Investment Managers
For benchmark Nifty, analysts now expect a profit growth of 24-26 per cent compared with 13-15 per cent earlier.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded its estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25 per cent for FY20 from 13 per cent earlier. Kotak Securities expects net profits of Nifty firms to grow at 25 per cent for FY2020 against 15 per cent projected earlier.

This assumes that companies will retain bulk of the tax cuts. In reality, some of them will pass on some of the benefits to consumers. If this happens, it would be the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006.

Among Nifty stocks, 20 companies with tax rates higher than 25 per cent have a cumulative weightage of 39 per cent in the index.

Prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut would include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30 per cent in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty50 soon, will be another big beneficiary, considering it had a tax rate of 34 per cent in FY19.

Meanwhile, apart from recurring earnings benefit, there will also be one-time gains on deferred tax liabilities for companies such as RIL, Ultratech, among others, and one-time loss on deferred tax assets for corporate banks, Edelweiss Securities said."

Where are we?
 A roller coaster ride continues on D-Street, as the index reversed its losses and staged a one-of-the sharpest intra-day rallies. This intraday upswing negates the underperformance of the last couple of weeks and indicates that a durable bottom is in place. Among all the sectoral indices, Nifty Auto, Nifty Bank, MNC and Financials stand apart, with gains in the range of 7-10 per cent. The broader market too remained buoyant for the day.


What is in store? Bargain hunting prevailed post the key announcements by the FM; the Nifty staged a close above the short to long term averages of 50 & 200 DMA which are placed at 11115 & 11230, respectively. The index has rallied more than 5 per cent in a day. A rally of such a magnitude certainly warrants a consolidation before staging a follow up buying. We may witness minor profit booking; however, any dip till the level of 11000 (which is a psychological support pivot and 50 per cent Fibonacci Ratio of the reference range i.e. 10637-11382) would attract buying interest from market participants. Key resistance/target remains at the level of 11470 for the short term.

What could investors do? The consensus bearish view of the market participants before the key announcements followed by an unanticipated sharp move up will continue to act as a trigger for index outperformance in the near term. On stock-specific front, we recommend going long on HDFC, Bajaj Finserv and M&M and we expect outperformance in the short/ medium term."

32,2019-09-27,Bajaj Finserv,"Equities never give guaranteed returns. But seven stocks on the bourses are doing their job smartly, delivering double-digit returns year after year since 2015 despite talks of slowdown, geopolitical tensions and demonetisation amid sustained selling in midcaps and smallcaps.

In alphabetical order, chemical players Aarti Industries and Atul top the list.

 Aarti Industries, a leading manufacturer of chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates with global footprints, saw 107 per cent jump in 2015, 31 per cent in 2016, 66 per cent in 2017, 27 per cent in 2018 and 13 per cent in 2019 (till September 25), respectively. Axis Securities says the company is well positioned in the global market with a marquee customer base, robust margins, strong balance sheet and a diversified product portfolio. With the company expanding product portfolio and existing capacities and a shift in demand from China, the company is likely to see steady earnings growth for a long term. Shares of the company turned ex-bonus in the 1:1 ratio on September 27.

Atul gave between 15 per cent and 35 per cent returns year after year during this period. It manufactures value-added chemicals by blending basic chemicals and natural resources for diverse industries – from agriculture, construction, textiles, pharmaceuticals to automobiles – from its plants in Valsad, Bharuch (Gujarat) and Thane (Maharashtra). Brokerage CD Equisearch recently revised the target price for Atul to Rs 4,663 from Rs 4,169 earlier.

“Though it has no small base, earnings growth would barely show signs of waning, boosted largely by the recent corporate tax cut. With an improved outlook, we revise post-tax earnings target upwards for this financial year by 26 per cent,” CD Equisearch said in a report.

In the financial space, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and HDFC Bank managed to get their places on the list. Bajaj Finance rallied 73 per cent in 2015, 40 per cent in 2016, 109 per cent in 2017, 50 per cent in 2018 and 49 per cent in 2019. Bajaj Finance rallied 554 per cent in these five years, while Bajaj Finserv and HDFC Bank gained 315 per cent and 129 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Bajaj Finance with a 12-month price target of Rs 4,550. With the forthcoming festive season and several planned online and offline mega sales events lined up, the brokerage reiterates that Bajaj Finance remains the best bet to play the India consumption story.

Goldman Sachs has maintained ‘buy’ rating on HDFC Bank with a 12-month price target of Rs 1,389. The stock jumped 14 per cent in 2015, 11 per cent in 2016, 56 per cent in 2017, 13 per cent in 2018 and 17 per cent in 2019.

“We remain confident that HDFC Bank will deliver above-consensus earnings growth at CAGR of 22 per cent over FY19-24E and RoA of 2 per cent by FY24E (notwithstanding the recent tax cuts), helping the market-cap to double to $200 billion from $100 billion at present,” it said.

Shares of auto ancillary player Maharashtra Scooters and entertainment major PVR have delivered over 10 per cent returns to investors every year since 2015.

Prabhudas Lilladher recently initiated coverage of PVR with an ‘accumulate’ rating and set the price target at Rs 2,099. It is the largest player in the multiplex industry with a screen market share of around 28 per cent.

“Except for east, PVR is the market leader in three out of four regions. PVR’s market leadership would remain intact. We value the multiplex player at an EV/Ebitda of multiple of 10 times. This is broadly in line with the past one year’s forward multiple of 11.6 times since FY10 and is justified given PVR’s market leadership, preferred brand positioning, strong organic screen pipeline and industry-leading metrics,” Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report.

28,2019-09-27,Bajaj Finserv,"Mumbai: Masayoshi Son’s Soft-Bank may call off talks aimed at backing the Piramal Group’s financial services arm, Piramal Capital and Housing Finance, due to irreconcilable differences, four people close to the situation said.

The Mumbai-based conglomerate was negotiating a deal that would have spun off the group’s housing finance division into a separate company with SoftBank investing around $1 billion for a significant stake, they added. In its July 15 edition, ET had reported that the deal would likely happen only if Piramal Group moves away from wholesale loans to consumer lending.

This was one of the biggest points of friction, forcing the SoftBank Vision Fund’s investment committee to decide against the deal, two people privy to the talks said.

“The Piramal Group has traditionally been focused on wholesale or corporate loans,” one of the persons added.




“Shifting almost completely to consumer was not something the leadership was comfortable with,” the person said. They tried to negotiate exposure splits between the two types of debt but couldn’t get past it. The group was also planning to buy some portions of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation debt but the talks haven't progressed, two people said.

Spokespersons of the Piramal Group and SoftBank declined to comment on emailed queries sent by ET.

The Piramal Group’s wholesale real estate exposure is just over 60%. Housing finance forms 9% of its overall book. The group has a total book size of Rs 56,000 crore, in which real estate loans account for Rs 40,160 crore. There have been indications that the Piramals are looking to expand into consumer lending.

According to multiple sources, the Piramal Group was never SoftBank’s first option. “It was Bajaj Finserv.

But it is a listed company and Soft-Bank did not want to get into the public market,” said one of the persons mentioned above. One of the reasons Bajaj Finserv was the first choice was its retail exposure through Bajaj Finance, the consumer lending arm.

Another bone of contention was SoftBank’s insistence that technology be the core platform in this new entity.

“SoftBank wanted this new entity to resemble Rocket Mortgage in the US,” the person said. Rocket Mortgage is among the biggest debt providers in the US and specialises in home loans.

The selling point for the company is that a loan can be applied for almost completely on the web without any human interface. “This was a good aim to have but not possible in India because of the amount of red tape and regulations,” the person added.

The two parties also differed on the timeline of the exit. SoftBank had come with a sharp sixeight year timeline in which this new entity would list on the BSE.

This timeline was not deemed acceptable by the Indian group.

“The problem was that there are very few others who could write a cheque that large or give Soft-Bank an exit even at face value if the exit timeline lapsed,” the person added.

The executives at Piramal Group have already started talking to Chinese and American private equity companies as an alternative to Soft-Bank. “This is probably an indicator that both parties have moved on,” said one of the people mentioned above.

“But the leadership team keeps meeting the Vision Fund representatives in London. A deal like this is never off, it is just on pause.”"

35,2019-09-30,Bajaj Finserv,"The first order of business as the nine-member jury for The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2019 met went through without any debate. Infosys non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani was unanimously selected jury chairman. Then, the debate started.

The 2019 jury, as with every ET Awards jury, was a group of big achievers — put a group like this together and you’re guaranteed crackling conversation.

Ask them to pick the best and brightest of India Inc, and you’re guaranteed fascinating and insightful debate.

Ethics were top priority. It’s not just that Bhavish Aggarwal left the jury room when members were deliberating on the Business Leader of the Year award — he was a contender. Some jury members volunteered to recuse themselves because they were acquainted with nominees in various categories. Chairman Nilekani was firm, though, saying he had full faith in the integrity of the jury, and unless a jury member was directly related or was a nominee her/himself, he didn’t see any reason for a recusal. He was firmly supported by Mittal.

Vigorous debates started right from the first award, Business Leader. Who’s more of a leader — a professional CEO or an entrepreneur?

Nilekani, who has been both, presided over a debate that saw Sadhguru, Mittal, Morparia, Munjal and Shroff make strong cases, often disagreeing with each other.

Every award was a two-step decision. The first round of voting pared the nominee list down to two, the second round chose the winner. All voting was by secret ballot and all results were announced by the chairman. For every category, jury members used their own wisdom, listened to each other, looked at detailed company numbers provided to them by the ET Intelligence Group and asked dozens of sharp questions.



Deciding the winner for some categories took longer than others.

When picking the Business Reformer, the jury had a long and fascinating debate on how to assess a public administrator’s contribution to easing conditions of entrepreneurship. Discussion went beyond choosing the winner, to fundamental aspects of the relationship between the state and business.

Entrepreneur and Global Indian of the Year were two more categories that saw particularly high-spirited debates. Is entrepreneurship getting equated with a cash burn, valuation-chasing game, asked more than a few jury members. But what’s entrepreneurship without risk-taking, asked others. Are we biased in favour of B2C companies, was another sharp question.

Deliberations on the Global Indian category showed the close understanding many jurists had of global business across sectors.

How ‘Indian’ are global Indians, was another fascinating subplot.

The issue here was to fairly assess whether success in the West can coexist happily with joyful expressions of Indian identity.

And when the jury was choosing Businesswoman of the Year, the debate looked too close to call till the last minute. ET reinstated this category in 2019, and the high quality jury debate that preceded the vote on the winner showed why it is so necessary to champion India Inc’s smartest women.

When Nilekani announced the winner of the last category and thanked the jury for a spirited and thoroughly fair debate, more than two hours had passed since they assembled. Two hours during which some of the best in business picked the best in business this year – and the bonus was a thoroughly interesting discussion.



Friend, philosopher, FM: A special award for Arun Jaitley




A skilful parliamentarian who was respected on both sides of the aisle, former finance minister, past winner of the ET Awards, and a towering presence at the award ceremonies, Arun Jaitley, the jury all agreed, will be missed by all. The jury for The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2019 unanimously voted to institute a Special Award in order to recognise Arun Jaitley’s enormous contribution to public service, especially his role in championing economic reforms. Not only was Jaitley a central figure in building consensus over the goods and services tax, but even the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code came into being under his watch.


Business Leader: Charting a different path to the top spot




Nearly six years ago, Sanjiv Mehta became the first Indian chief executive at Hindustan Unilever who had never worked at the country’s biggest consumer goods company earlier. That was not the only departure from the tried-and-tested CEO template of HUL, the gold standard in consumer marketing in India. Unlike his recent predecessors who had cut their teeth and built their reputation in the rough-and-tough of marketing, 58-year old Mehta is a chartered accountant who transited to a broader profile.

The unprecedented move didn’t fail HUL. Its market capitalisation nearly trebled to Rs 4.35 lakh crore since Mehta joined the firm in September 2013 as it added about Rs 3 lakh crore in value — more than the combined market cap of rivals Colgate, Dabur, Marico and Godrej Consumer Products. Mehta also oversaw the Indian business outpace Brazil to become the second largest market behind the US in terms of sales for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever.

Mehta credits various initiatives for HUL’s impressive growth in a tough and highly competitive market. “We have been creating a future-fit portfolio through extensive market development and strategic acquisitions; rebalancing scale and driving focus through initiatives like ‘Winning in many Indias’ (WIMI); making our organisation nimble by setting up country-category business teams to empower people to experiment; and leading digital transformation across our value chain to build new capabilities that will fundamentally reshape the way we do business,” he said.

Under WIMI strategy, the maker of Rin and Dove reorganised its go-to-market operations from the traditional four sales branches to 14 consumer clusters. HUL also added a fifth branch in central India to accelerate sales in a relatively underpenetrated but high-growth market. This, in turn, helped counter regional competition and improved market share.

Born to SP Mehta, an RBI employee, Mehta has been with Unilever for 26 years.

He worked in about 20 countries in three different regions — South Asia, South East Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa — before his India stint.

But when Mehta took over HUL — which is among the most important units for Unilever, accounting for nearly 9% of its overall sales — in 2013, the situation wasn’t normal. The overall fast-moving consumer market had gone into what can be described as a lull period, after recording 17-18% growth in the preceding years. The growth rate more than halved to 6-7% between 2013 and 2016. India’s consumer goods sector saw a series of disruptions, from two consecutive bad monsoons to demonetisation woes and short-term trade issues after the introduction of GST.

But, in his six years at the helm, Mehta helped increase HUL’s sales from Rs 25,810 crore in 2013 to Rs 38,224 crore now. That’s over Rs 12,000 crore in incremental sales, or more than the size of Nestlé or P&G’s overall business in India. Last fiscal, HUL posted Rs 8,500 crore of Ebitda, with margins at its highest ever at 22.9%. Mehta was appointed president of South Asia and a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) in March this year.


Lifetime Achievement: DMRC’s hero is a Metro Man to the core




He’s the most “revolutionary disruptor in urban transport,” said a member of the jury at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence, which conferred the Lifetime Achievement award on E Sreedharan, popularly known as Metro Man. He is “one of the most amazing builders of modern India” in terms of values as well as infrastructure, said another member of the jury.

“I am very happy and elated for this recognition,” Sreedharan told ET.

Government departments are known for missing project completion deadlines. No major infrastructure project has been completed in India without delays and cost overruns.

But under Sreedharan, the Delhi Metro — independent India’s most ambitious transportation project — became operational before its completion deadline.

Maverick civil engineer Sreedharan went on to repeat the feat, delivering project after project months before official deadlines, saving the exchequer thousands of crores in cost overruns.

Armed with a free hand from the government, Sreedharan ensured that the Delhi Metro progressed at great speed along with transparency in awarding contracts. In just two years and nine months, the first phase of the Delhi Metro was completed, three months earlier than originally scheduled.

The project’s 124 km second phase, estimated to cost Rs 24,000 crore, took only four-and-ahalf years to be commissioned.

The 85-year-old veteran, who is from the Indian Railways Engineering Service, has spent almost 60 years building railway lines, bridges and metro networks, and has delivered some of country’s most critical infrastructure projects such as the Konkan Rail, Kolkata Metro and Delhi Metro.

In the 1970s, Sreedharan was entrusted with designing India’s first metro network in Kolkata. Then came the Konkan Rail project, an engineer’s nightmare in terms of construction. The project ran between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats from Mangalore to Roha in Maharashtra.

He had joined the railways as an assistant engineer in 1954 and retired from it after 36 years of service in 1990.

After spending seven years at Konkan Rail Corp, he became managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corp in 1997. Sreedharan retired from Delhi Metro in December 2011 at the age of 79 and moved back to Kerala. He was then approached by many state governments to help implement metro projects.

Sreedharan helped deliver projects with a total investment of about Rs 10 lakh crore, according to ‘Karmayogi: A biography of E Sreedharan’. From the Pamban Bridge to the Kochi Metro, none of the projects executed by him were touched by even a hint of corruption.

Indeed, this was something the jury recognised. Sreedharan is currently heading a central government committee to fix technical standards for all upcoming metro networks.






Businesswoman: A beautiful business model
 

Nykaa has emerged as one of the most recognisable consumer brands in the fast-growing online beauty category without raising billions of dollars in investor capital. This has been one of the standout differentiators for Nykaa’s founder Falguni Nayar.

Credited with building an ecommerce platform very differently from the rest the industry, Nayar has won the coveted Business Woman of the Year Award. Nayar’s ability to steer clear of heavy discounting and massive funding to spur growth in a typically cash guzzling industry has helped her uniquely position Nykaa amid competitors.

“I have always believed this (ET Awards for Corporate Excellence) is one of the most coveted awards since the time I started working in Mumbai. I have always looked up to the people who have won this award previously. You have to pinch yourself to believe you are in the same room as some of the previous winners,” Nayar told ET after winning.

A former investment banker at Kotak Mahindra Capital where she was the managing director, Nayar founded Nykaa in 2012. “I am so glad that I jumped into entrepreneurship. I believed in technology and I believed in the Indian consumer.




The way it is panning out, the sky’s the limit,” said Nayar.

Nayar’s 180-degree shift from being a career banking professional to striking out on her own with a consumer-focused startup was one of the key reasons the jury picked her.

In the past seven years, the online retailer has expanded into offline stores, launched new categories like fashion and continued to grow amid competition from bigger ecommerce players like Amazon and Flipkart’s Myntra. Nykaa doubled net revenue to Rs 1,230 crore in the previous fiscal, pushing aggressively into newly-launched categories such as apparel and fashion. Its valuation, too, has kept pace with growth.

Apart from Nykaa Fashion, it has also set up Nykaa Man to build its men’s grooming business, and introduced Nykaa Pro, a portal for professional beauty consumers, with an aim to diversify its business. The company will focus on building heft in its fashion and apparel categories, and grow offline stores to 70 by March next year, from 35 currently, Nayar told ET in an interview earlier this year.

Nykaa began by curating beauty products and embellishing it with edgy content, including reviews and expert recommendations customers could use to make informed decisions about beauty needs. Since then, however, Nykaa has done what none of the big ecommerce companies have been able to do in the beauty space. Its inhouse eponymous brand, which contributes 10% to overall sales, has been an important lever of growth.

Nykaa will start distributing products more aggressively and widely across third-party offline stores to scale up this year, Nayar told ET in April. Nayar will have to position her fashion and apparel offering in such a way that it is not only focused on selection and price, but also build stickiness and engagement like it did in the core beauty category.


Global Indian: A ten-fold growth in market cap: Priceless
 

When Ajay Banga took over as the president and chief executive at Mastercard in July 2010, he followed a list of illustrious Indians who have made it to the top of multinational companies after the 2008 economic crisis, such as Vikram Pandit of Citibank, Deven Sharma at Standard & Poor’s and Piyush Gupta of Singapore-based DBS Group.

Banga’s stint as CEO has resulted in a profitable decade for the shareholders of the payment company. Since Banga took over in July 2010, Mastercard’s net income has increased four times to $2 billion for the quarter through June 2019 from $458 million in 2010. The rise in income has also resulted in better returns for shareholders as shares have risen 10-fold in that period, to $269 at close in New York last week. Its market capitalisation is $270 billion.

Under Banga, Mastercard has diversified revenue away from consumer credit cards towards the more predictable commercial payments and debit and prepaid cards, and added new streams of services such as data analytics, consulting and loyalty platforms. Data on the company’s website shows that of the $5.9 trillion gross dollar volumes reported in 2018, 11% came from commercial businesses — up from 9% in 2012 — and 46% from debit and prepaid cards which contributed 41% in 2012.

Banga has spoken out against cryptocurrencies, calling them junk. “The idea of an anonymised currency produced by people who have to mine it, the value of which can fluctuate wildly — that to me is not the way that any medium of exchange deserves to be considered as a medium of exchange,” Banga said last year.

An economics graduate from Delhi University, Banga’s entire career has been at multinational companies. He began with Nestlé in India after doing his management from IIM Ahmedabad.

At Nestlé, Banga spent 13 years across sales, marketing and management.

He also worked at PepsiCo at a time when the Indian economy was just starting to enjoy the fruits of liberalisation.

Banga’s first job in the financial sector was with Citibank, which he joined in 1996 and rose to head the US-based lender’s unit in Asia Pacific.

He joined Mastercard in 2009 as president and chief operating officer, before being named the CEO of the payments giant.

Banga, who got the Padma Shri in 2016, was earlier this year awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Now, as The Economic Times Global Indian of the Year, the 59-year old joins an elite company comprising global business leaders like Adobe Systems chief executive Shantanu Narayen (2018) and Fairfax chief executive Prem Watsa (2017).

Banga was modesty personified when he spoke to ET, giving credit to his colleagues and partners for the success he has enjoyed throughout his career. “It’s an incredible honour to receive this recognition. It is a testament to what we can accomplish when we combine a culture of decency with a solid business strategy that includes actions to solve societal issues. But you know, they say it takes a village; in my case I am very fortunate to have terrific employees and partners who inspire, cajole, guide and assist me every day,” Banga said.

As one of the captains of American industry, Banga has called for a ‘mahagatbandhan’ between the two largest democracies of the world, India and the US.

“What I want to really see is a time in the world when the two greatest democracies are engaging at every level — socially, culturally, politically and economically,” Banga said at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum earlier this year.


Company: An NBFC with a difference


 BAJAJ FINANCE
You don’t need to be a bank to build a financial services supermarket, as visualised by Sandy Weill of Citigroup and by KV Kamath in India. You can do it by being a non-banking finance company (NBFC) as well.

Bajaj Finance, started as a result of the demerger of Bajaj Auto over a decade ago, has become the largest technology-driven retail franchise in the NBFC space, with a market capitalisation of Rs 2.35 lakh crore. Defying market challenges, Bajaj Finance has continued to showcase strong sequential growth over the past year, while several others floundered. Growth has come on the back of use of analytics, cross-selling and a large retail ecosystem.

What started as a captive two-wheeler financier of Bajaj Auto has grown into a diversified retail lending business by expanding to consumer electronics, white goods and digital goods. While financing for consumer durables, two-wheelers and personal loans are helping maximise profit, entry into mortgage, small business loans and commercial lending is aiding in building scale.




“On behalf of Bajaj Finance, we are thrilled to receive this award,” Sanjiv Bajaj, managing director of holding company Bajaj Finserv, said about being adjudged the Company of the Year. “Our 12-year journey at Bajaj Finance has been to create an entrepreneurial-driven, innovative and high-quality lending business. Our focus is to build this into India’s first industrial-scale fintech lender.” Bajaj is vicechairman of Bajaj Finance.

The company has grown assets under management by 41% and profit by 43%, even as margins and asset quality remained stable at end of June, despite the liquidity situation since the IL&FS crisis broke out in September 2018. The NBFC sector has seen disbursements shrink 30% in the period. In retail, Bajaj Finance has 37 million customers, 97,000 points of sale and a balance sheet of Rs 1.25 lakh crore.

Key drivers at the company are Nanoo Pamnani, Bajaj and Rajeev Jain.

Amid tight liquidity, Bajaj Finance maintained a Rs 6,400-crore liquidity buffer, with diversified liability mix bank borrowings at 35%, deposits at 16% and market borrowing at 39%. It is in the middle of raising funds to maintain leverage at about 6x.

What came as a natural hedge for Bajaj Finance is a diversified product portfolio across tenors. After early warning signals in digital product and twowheeler financing, it slowed lending and brought in higher diligence.

Gross non-performing loans remained at less than 2% backed by cautious lending. It cut down exposure to loans against property, infrastructure and construction, before stress seeped in. Investment in digital paid off. Zero-cost EMIs aided consumer durables lending. Bajaj Finance has been adding 1 million customers every quarter with initiatives such as cobranding wallet business, partnering with Mobikwik and co-branding credit card with RBL Bank.


Methodology
The categories of Company and Emerging Company of the year 2019 recognise only listed companies, and consider performance for the financial year 2018-19. The shortlists are prepared after extensive number crunching by ET’s research arm, ETIG.

For the Company of the Year, profitable companies which were listed before April 1, 2018 with an average market cap for the month of March 2019 of over Rs 30,000 crore were considered. For the Emerging Company of the Year, profitable companies listed between April 2013 and March 2018 and incorporated after 2000 were considered.

In both categories, ETIG used a set of financial data points to generate a composite score for each company, and ranked the companies on this score. The top five were shortlisted for discussion by the ET Awards jury.

The data points used to generate the composite score are net sales (FY19), operating profit (FY19), net profit (FY19), market capitalisation (March 2019), return on equity (March 31, 2019), share price appreciation for the year March 31, 2018-March 31, 2019, growth in revenue over a three-year period (CAGR), growth in operating profit over a three-year period (CAGR) and growth in net profit over a three-year period (CAGR).


Emerging company: Growing from the grassroots to the clouds




Bandhan’s transition into a bank from a microfinance company has been the Reserve Bank of India’s first such experiment turning into a resounding success.

The microlender, which begun the journey in 2001 with practices to meet rural needs, had to shift its focus beyond villages and create a new ecosystem as it got off the block as a bank on August 23, 2015. In the next four years, it garnered Rs 43,700 crore of public deposits, a hallmark of trust and recognition across the spectrum. On the asset side, Bandhan’s outstanding loans crossed Rs 45,400 crore at end of June with growth as high as 39% year-on-year, amid chaos in the financial system which saw government banks reeling under asset quality stress and non-bank lenders facing heat with cash flow mismanagement.

“The ET Award is a huge recognition to Bandhan’s business model which touches lives at the grassroots, and will be an inspiration to our entire workforce who helped create the Bandhan Bank brand in just about four years,” founder and managing director Chandra Shekhar Ghosh said.




“The award is a responsibility bestowed upon the Bandhan family.” Supported by marquee global investors such as GIC and International Finance Corporation, Bandhan has added 7.25 lakh new bank accounts in the June quarter alone to create a massive customer pool of 1.73 crore. It has 1,000 bank branches, along with more than 3,000 doorstep service centres catering to its 1.36 crore micro credit customers, much to the envy of its rivals. About 75% of its offices are in the unbanked districts, which makes Bandhan an important player for the government’s financial inclusion drive.

The lender, with 85% exposure to economically weak borrowers, is in the final stages of acquiring housing finance company Gruh Finance with Rs 17,700 crore, which will not only help diversify its loan portfolio but also provide geographical balance.

“We still have an unexplored market in microfinance, in MSMEs, in housing loan segment. Till these markets exhaust, there is no point in experimenting with the big-ticket loan market,” Ghosh had said in an interview to ET in July.

Bandhan’s June quarter profit grew 45.4% to Rs 701 crore. On the same yardstick, IDFC First Bank, the other one to get a universal banking licence along with Bandhan, posted a loss of Rs 617 crore. A net interest margin as high as 10.45% (for the first quarter) keeps Bandhan Bank’s profitability high.






Business Reformer: A CM who never sleeps
 
In a few weeks from now, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will face probably the most consequential elections so far in his political career.

In 2014, Fadnavis was just one among the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in the state who lived and worked in the shadow of seniors such as Nitin Gadkari. A Nagpur boy, few expected him to scale and occupy the highest political position in the state. One of the questions to be answered in the upcoming state elections is whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s gamble in overlooking other party leaders with prominent caste support and selecting Fadnavis as the chief minister in the winter of 2014 has paid off or not.

The Maharashtra chief minister has earned many admirers, especially for the manner in which he has pushed for a massive infrastructure upgrade in Mumbai as well as the rest of the state, something that the ET Awards jury cited when making its decision.




“Maharashtra has always been at the forefront in attracting industries,” Fadnavis told ET. “It however had been lagging behind other states in the last few years,which is why when we came to power we initiated various ease of doing business measures to attract more investment and ensure that companies don’t face hurdles. And the results are in front of us. We have received Rs 3.75 lakh crore FDI (foreign direct investment) in five years compared to Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the previous five years. This award is a recognition that we are on the right path and that also pushes us to achieve more.”

One of his first acts after he came to power was to set up a war room in the state administration and get people from the private sector to run it. The war room helped execute projects at a rapid pace. For instance, the 11.40 km Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar metro project took more than 15 years to plan and execute under earlier governments. In contrast, the Fadnavis government is pushing to complete the more challenging 33-km underground Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ line by December 2021. The war room chaired by the chief minister is also working on projects such as the coastal road and the Mumbai-Nagpur expressway.

With many industries complaining about delay in getting clearances, the chief minister, within a year of coming to power, halved the number of permissions needed to set up an industry in the state to 37 from 75. Fadnavis has also been instrumental in cutting time needed for project clearances, though businessmen still complain about harassment by municipal and district-level officials. While the state administration at the top has been receptive to investment and keen on speeding up clearances, local problems still persist in some sectors.

A little-known aspect of his style of governance is the appointment of people with out-of-the-box thinking and integrity to key posts such as that of the Mumbai Police Commissioner or the Maharashtra DGP’s post. The chief minister has not just focused on industries but also on agriculture.

He has pushed for more agro-processing industries and for establishing cold-chain centres in rural regions.


Entrepreneur: He always delivers, and so does his company





Sriharsha MajetyCEO, Swiggy

In just five years of starting up, Swiggy cofounder Sriharsha Majety has built one of the largest online fooddelivery companies that can rival many global counterparts in size. Its rapid scale up and diversification into areas outside of food delivery made Majety the elite jury’s choice for Entrepreneur of the Year this year.

Widely known for his execution skills in the fledgling consumer internet industry, Majety has expanded Swiggy into several new areas, launching grocery delivery, on-demand concierge and a bunch of private label food brands over the past year, as he sets sight beyond food delivery.

“It’s very exciting to get validation for the work we’re doing at Swiggy and thanks to the many people who’ve helped us get this far,” said Majety on winning the award. “I think our focus on customer service has helped us get here and is what will push us in the future as well.”

Swiggy has grown from clocking around 700,000 orders a day till a year ago to doubling that number to 1.4 million daily orders today, becoming among the fastest growing Indian consumer internet startups.

Aside of the genetic growth, Swiggy’s diversification foray has been pushed by Majety’s belief that hyper-local deliveries are at the core of great customer service.




Swiggy’s expansion beyond food started in September last year when it acquired hyper-local delivery startup Supr Daily.

Seen as a bid to utilise its already large fleet, now at 45,000 agents, to deliver for categories beyond food, within six months the company launched Swiggy Stores—a rival to Dunzo and BigBasket—that curates inventory from stores near users’ locations to deliver everything from flowers to health supplements.

Swiggy’s diversification mirrors that of China’s largest food delivery network Meituan-Dianping, which has a small stake in the company. “The capability of having India’s largest delivery fleet will be a key driver towards building many businesses over time,” said Majety. “That’s the one thing that I am very happy about having built and we will continue to invest in it.”

Its expansion is being funded by a $1-billion cheque investors cut for Swiggy in December last year, $650 million of which came from its largest backer, South African internet and media conglomerate Naspers. This also valued the company at $3.3 billion, making it among the most valuable internet firms in the country.

In a recent interview with ET, Bob van Dijk, the group CEO of Prosus and Naspers, while talking about Majety and the competition Swiggy faces against Zomato said, “The reason why we are so comfortable with Swiggy is basically that Harsha and his team have shown their abilities to execute really well. I think we have our bet on the winner, and the potential of the market is huge”.

Losses, however, continue to mount for Swiggy and its monthly cash burn of $40-50 million is being questioned.

In the year ended March 31, 2018, its losses soared 93% to Rs 397 crore on revenue of Rs 422 crore, but its revenue growth zoomed 232%.


Corporate Citizen: For child, community & country




Wipro, India’s fourth largest IT company, involves its employees in giving back to society and the neighbourhoods where it operates, through Wipro Cares. The impact of this is measured. In 2018-19, more than 12,500 employees of Wipro spent around 30,000 hours of volunteering time with partner organisations at 20 locations in India, the US, the UK, Japan, Australia and the Philippines. The company engages employees to imbibe founder Azim Premji’s philosophy of contributing back to society in education, primary health care, community ecology and disaster rehabilitation.

As a business, more than 40% of its electricity consumption is from renewable sources; over 42% of freshwater requirement, or about 1,400 million litres a year, is met through treatment and recycling of water equivalent to one day’s consumption of Bengaluru, a city of more than 12 million people.

“Wipro is an exemplar of a successful, ethical and a socially responsible organisation,” Premji wrote in his letter to employees when he stepped down from his executive role at Wipro in June.




Wipro’s journey towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) began in 2001 with its first intervention in school education. Since then, it has expanded to participate in community care and ecology and environment. It set up the Wipro Foundation, a separate entity created in 2017, to manage its CSR programmes.

The Bengaluru-based company’s business practices and activities in giving back to society have won it the 2019 The Economic Times Corporate Citizen of The Year Award.

“We are deeply honoured by this recognition. It is the dedication and hard work of over 175,000 Wiproites across the globe that has made us what we are,” chairman Rishad Premji said. “This award further strengthens our resolve in contributing to developing a just, equitable, humane and sustainable world”.

Wipro’s strategy has been to develop and strengthen organisations that work in making systemic reforms in school education in India. It has partnered with more than 116 organisations across 22 states in India with an effective reach to 20,000 schools, 40,000 educators and a million children. Through Wipro Cares, the company addresses the needs of more than 40,000 children from underprivileged communities and 2,200 children with disability.

It also has Wipro-earthian, a programme to engage students on sustainability. It has reached over 2,200 schools and 2,600 teachers in 32 states and union territories.

Wipro has not just focused on helping its community within India. Through the Wipro Cares initiative, employees engage with disadvantaged communities which are proximate to its facilities. Wipro Science Education Fellowship, which began in 2012, is a programme designed to develop teachers’ capacities to teach better in their schools and help other teachers teach better.

It has replicated this model in the US and UK.


Policy Change Agent: A unique achievement via hard work




Rarely has a bureaucrat been given charge of so many crucial government positions simultaneously. For softspoken Ajay Bhushan Pandey, juggling key positions comes with ease. As serving chief executive of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the 57-yearold bureaucrat was given additional charge as chairman of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Network in September 2017.

In addition to spearheading these two crucial government projects, Pandey, a 1984 Maharashtra Cadre Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, was appointed revenue secretary in November last year.

Pandey was instrumental in scaling up use of Aadhaar in delivery of government subsidies and benefits, which led to savings of over Rs 90,000 crore by eliminating ‘ghosts’ and duplicates.

“It is under his steering that Aadhaar has earned worldwide acclaim,” the government said when it appointed him revenue secretary last year.




The government called his stint at UIDAI “remarkable” and added that he played a key role in establishing and steering Aadhaar across the country and drafting the historic Aadhaar legislation for providing statutory basis to the unique identity.

“He also successfully explained Aadhaar and its benefits and the underlying technology to the five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court through his two day long power-point presentation in the open court room, which helped the government in successfully defending the Aadhaar case against 37 petitions,” the government had said.

This work won him the ‘Policy Change Agent’ in a near unanimous vote from the high-profile jury for the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2019.

“This award is recognition of Aadhaar which has empowered more than 120 crore Indians with a lifelong digital and secure identity for ease of living,” Pandey told ET. “Aadhaar has helped transform the governance, brought in transparency and ensured that government benefits and subsidies are directly delivered to the deserving and marginalised sections of the society,” he added.

Pandey is a graduate in electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur. He also secured an MS and a PhD in computer science from the University of Minnesota. Prior to joining UIDAI in 2010—in the early days of the project— Pandey handled several key positions in his state cadre of Maharashtra, which included land revenue management, sales tax department, and the information technology ministry, among others.

Known for his frank talk, after taking over as revenue secretary, Pandey said his priorities were to help the government improve tax-GDP ratio, enhance tax compliance through integration of technology, stabilise the implementation of GST, and bring transparency and simplification of laws and procedures for better tax administration, particularly for startups, and ease of doing business.

Pandey was instrumental in ensuring that every communication from the income tax department carries a document identification number or DIN, verifiable on department’s portal, to bring about transparency and accountability in its functioning."
0,2019-10-07,Bajaj Finserv,"Sandip Sabharwal, Investment Adviser and Founder, asksandipsabharwal.com, is bullish on ICICI Bank, HDFC and Bajaj Finance. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Assuming the best case scenario, what will be the top five winners for the next three years?It is very tough to say who will be the top five winners overall, but I expect some consumer names and financials will do well. ICICI is in a transformational phase. For example, when the entire Indiabulls crisis came up, the only large bank which had no exposure to Indiabulls was ICICI. Who would have believed that three-four years ago, they had exposure in every stressed asset? So there a transformation process is on there. Their CASA ratio is very high. They have not been raising capital because their capital adequacy has been very strong. So this bank should do well. 

Among financials, HDFC and Bajaj Finance will gain market share. The NBFC business was always a suspect business because they used to take cheap money from banks and lend and make money out of it. Now when they are stressed, the banks can lend themselves and make money. That is why banks will become more prominent.


Is there no bearishness about financials?There is no slowdown for some of the companies.


Those are large companies with large bases, not the small, low-base HFCs where 5% means uptick of only Rs 5 crore.What we need to understand is that these are the financials which cater to the retail segment. Retail demand will actually pick up much more from October because the festival season has started right at the fag end of September. Go around the marketplace, you will see the kind of penetration that Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance are gaining. Every retailer has a tie up with Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv. They are taking away market share from a lot of other financial companies and my guess is that they will continue to grow at this pace with such a large base even for the subsequent two-three quarters. That is the reason why their valuations defy gravity. I guess they are also looking out to raise some capital. If they raise Rs 4,000 crore, that by itself is additive to the shareholders. 

There are some financials which are in a virtuous cycle, there are some financial which are in a vicious cycle like Yes Bank, which is unable to raise capital. Since they are unable to raise capital, they have to degrow. 


Would you take a relook at Yes Bank now that the uncertainty with regards to Rana Kapoor is over? He has totally exited in terms of pledged shares. Now, TPG, Carlyle etc are looking at a piece of Yes Bank?We have to look at it practically. The data they revealed on the conference call was that their deposits went down this quarter, the advances have also come down. That was the first step. I believe they had to take to compress their balance sheet to revive. 

I hope that they continue this phase so over the next two quarters. If they continue to compress their balance sheet to release some capital for growth in the future, that will be the best strategy. Now at Rs 10,000-crore market cap, it is very tough for them to raise equity. Even if they want to raise Rs 2,000 crore, they have to dilute by 20% and if they dilute by 20%, the EPS comes down and they are trading at 0.4 times reported book. 

If you raise money below book, then it does not add to the existing shareholders. It actually is negative. I would think that on balance, may be fundamentals could start bottoming out now but as the advance book compresses, the profitability will also see pressures. People just look at the price and think it is attractive since the price has fallen so much. We do not know but this might not be the time to take a long- term view. The long-term view has to be taken one or two quarters down the line.


Do you think the pecking order in the next three years would remain the same?It depends on how the economy behaves. If the economy actually bottoms out, which we have been expecting for the last two years, and there is a revival, then a different set of companies will outperform. But if the economy continues to languish and we see recovery now, then obviously these companies will benefit much more. Given the strength of their balance sheet, they do much better in adverse circumstances. When there is lesser strength of balance sheet, you gain better from the macro environment improving. 

It depends purely on that. Ideally macros are such that things should improve but they have not improved till now.


 I will continue to bat on the back foot which is stay with HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance. I may lose 10-15%, but I am not guaranteed to lose a substantial chunk of my capital?Yes, so HDFC, Bajaj Finance, Kotak are one basket, then there is another basket with ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, etc. If you want to take some risk, why do you want to take on Axis Bank? Take it via SBI. Though I don’t own this stock, I would think it is cheap. If someone wants to take risk, take it on those stocks, rather than Yes Bank. 


What do you make of Zee and the commentary coming in from the management. They are not sounding confident on the non-media asset sale. However, that stake reduction is only going to increase supply. Does that help resurrect the stock or save any of the minority shareholders who still have money to put in Zee?That has been an issue because it is a question of what expectations were built up and what was actually delivered. The expectations that the management continuously built was that a stake sale, potentially to a strategic investor, will happen before the earlier deadline. That was in July or something but then they ended up selling to a financial investor and no strategic investor came in and the money flow was lesser than was expected. Right now, it is more a technical thing.

The good part about Zee is that it is a debt-free company. There are no allegations of funds siphoning off or something like that from Zee and it is a very profitable company, even at this stage. It is a very large company, whose valuations have now come down to 10 times earnings. Purely on valuations front, it is extremely cheap but technical factors are dominating right now. So on a particular day, we do not know how much of promoter stake is going to be sold off in the market. If today 5% of that stock gets sold off for whatever reasons, there is no way the stock will not fall 10-15%. That is the uncertainty we have to fight with.



The other panic stock seems to be Piramal Enterprises. Though Mr Piramal himself has time and again reassured investors that they are not in a soup and they will recover money from the beleaguered real estate names, what signal should someone who has invested in Piramal Enterprises be taking and what should they be doing with their positions?Piramal Enterprises is a very tough company to analyse because we do not really know which are the companies they have actually lent to. They do not take in public deposits. To that extent, the disclosure levels also are not as great although even with greater disclosure levels for NBFCs, we have gone nowhere. But at least in this company, we do not know that. 

The only thing is you can possibly trust the management more, in this case. I never bought the stock because I thought that they were always doing slightly higher risk lending to get higher profits. So, it is a very tough to take a call on the stock because given the way the interest rates are moving, what the RBI policy has been and the liquidity in the system,. one would think that all the stressed companies should start stabilising sometime now.


Now with the earnings which will be trickling in, last quarter saw the impact of the wage hikes, the visa cost and the strong currency, all of which impacted the margins. Will we see some reprieve on the margin front in IT? Yes, it could follow through because most of the IT companies have been increasing onshoring and given the employment situation in the US, the wage pressures have been high. So, we could see some impact of that. The rupee has also not been so supportive this quarter. The positive is that the US economy continues to do reasonably well. So, the demand side pressures might not be seen. It is a balanced picture. I do not think there is a case for any big upside in these stocks and they should remain more stable."
1,2019-10-10,Bajaj Finserv,"By Andy Mukherjee

A common refrain you hear in India is, “There’s no credit in the market.” 

The despondence cuts across industries as diverse as real estate, autos and road construction. An 88% slump in the flow of funds to the commercial sector between April and September shows that the producers’ unease is justified. 

However, one credit tap is starting to gurgle, giving some cause for optimism. Pocket-sized loans are feeding online consumption, with demand coming from smaller cities and towns. The amounts are still tiny, but as digital spending grows, financing it has the power to turn the page on Indian lenders’ underwriting of soured corporate loans: the source of a $200 billion sigh of collective agony.


Taps Have Run Dry
Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt claimed record sales during the recently concluded six-day online shopping bonanza that marks the start of the Indian festival season. Although nowhere close to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $31 billion Singles’ Day promotion in China, the Indian version of Black Friday has grown five-fold to $3 billion in four years, according to a review of this year’s sales by RedSeer, a consulting firm. Add the spending between now and Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, and Forrester Research reckons the total for a month of online purchases may fall just shy of $5 billion.


Bloomberg

Although the 30% growth this year was slower than in the previous three, it’s a strong outcome in a weak economy. Both of India’s leading e-commerce marketplaces cited small towns – and credit – for their success. Flipkart says Tier 3 cities ordered 100% more goods this year. The share of transactions using credit options grew by 70%, with a majority of these people living outside of big cities. Amazon revealed that three out of four customers who availed themselves of financing came from Tier 2 and 3 cities; significantly, every second buyer who used credit did so for the first time.


Six Days of Shopping
All this is hardly unique to India. China’s e-commerce boom saw an explosion of microloans, with millennials buying hamburgers on credit and the buy-now-pay-later habit picking up in Indonesia. What makes India interesting is the possibility that soon even physical retail will embrace digital in-store credit – minus plastic.


Bloomberg

A mobile-payment app with pay-later options at physical stores will be an important innovation. For all its expansion, e-commerce will account for only 7% of India’s $1.2 trillion retail sales by 2021, according to Deloitte. Credit cards won’t go beyond big cities and organized retail. It’s not worth any bank’s while to make card acceptance universal because the revenue to a bank from signing up a mom-and-pop shop – the merchant who handles purchases at the bottom of the income pyramid – is a meager $4 a month.


Winning the Neighborhood Store
That’s why Flipkart’s “cardless” credit deserves attention. Customers are validated for a $1,400 limit via a simple video upload; the actual financing comes not from Flipkart but from banks and financiers like Bajaj Finserv Ltd. This is the model that Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, might use to connect India’s 30 million small retailers with consumers. Amazon’s claim that its Great Indian Festival saw orders from 99.4% of the country’s postal codes owes that reach to Ambani’s aggressive entry into telecoms three years ago. The 4G network of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. has caused data prices to crash and usage to explode.

But Ambani won’t let the American duo of Amazon and Walmart be the biggest beneficiaries of his disruption. If Jio succeeds in taking its knowledge of 340 million Indians who use its mobile service to neighborhood stores, where most people still shop, banks and shadow banks will rush in with credit. From Citigroup Inc. to State Bank of India, HDFC Bank Ltd. to Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd., everyone will want this sizable new line of revenue at the intersection of consumer and corporate banking. 


Bloomberg

Writing in the Financial Times, Viral Acharya, a former deputy governor at the Indian central bank, argues that finance in India must learn from shampoo makers such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble Co., who boosted sales by offering families affordable quantities in small sachets rather than in more expensive full-size bottles.

To similarly make bite-sized finance sustainable, account aggregators are coming. They’ll digitally record a consumer’s transactions with various institutions and, with consent, share data with a lender. Given that 52% of Indian workers are self-employed, and only 23% earn a regular wage, to be able to accurately assess a borrower’s irregular cash flows will give lenders confidence to extend credit.

So large is the overhang of bad corporate debt that to suggest a better model of banking will emerge invites skepticism. Yet below the surface of corporate bankruptcies and failing financial institutions, technology is enabling important change. Maybe not tomorrow, but credit will go where it is due."

5,2019-10-15,Bajaj Finserv,"We do not consider all the beaten down stocks. We stay with quality fundamental stocks, maybe in the insurance business. Any corrective downside in the insurance business particularly in life insurance companies, is where our preference lies, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What next for IRCTC? It has been a stellar debut but for those who have missed out and could not really get a piece in the IPO, what next? Do you think that at these elevated levels, one should wait for a dip? Will that dip come at all or is it going to be one of those Avenue Supermart cases where one had to wait for a very long time for the first dip to come in?Arguing from a purely business point of view, the valuation at which the stock has traded after listing is on the premium side. The business is not that great but they enjoy a monopoly in supplying to railways. At the same time, pricing is a question which they would probably have to encounter when they are suppliers to railways. So this is one area which one would like to keep under check as far as the fundamentals are concerned. 

Looking at the stock price, why should the stock price remain high? The demand-supply situation in the market is certainly playing a role here. In my view, if the government ended up attracting so many bids as far as the IPO is concerned on offer of sale basis, I wonder what stops them from parting some more stake from their portfolio at the current price when the demand is so high. 

Again for Rs 650 crore, they ended up acquiring more than Rs 70,000 crore worth of bids. They could have some more shares and cool down the market and the demand. But that did not happen and as a result of which, technically the market price of the stock remains high as the government continues to hold 87% stock even after the OFS. So from that perspective, I would say this is more of a demand-supply situation which is driving the price currently. Fundamentals are what they are and the stock is quoting at a premium at current levels. I guess, investors will have to wait for buying at a lower valuation.


Now that you have come out of your hibernation, can I also assume that bulls will also come out of their hibernation?The market definitely is trying to do its best getting adjusted to the reality. The situation is seemingly improving as I see it. Banks are lending more money to the people. At the same time, for a few days, the vehicle registration numbers have improved and that suggests that at retail level, all is not that bad and probably once the inventory level gets cleared out, at factory level, the situation might slightly improve as far as auto is concerned. 

The early signals suggest that the economy is trying to show some amount of corrective upside now and maybe with monsoon being over and purchasing power returning, going forward the next few months would be interesting to watch out for. Maybe with a reduced rate of interest, maybe with the policy pertaining to the incentives to the taxation, I would think the economy would start experiencing at least select amount of investments and maybe a good amount of consumption coming up hereafter. So hope for the best. The worst in my viewpoint is behind us.


Are you saying that if you buy stocks now, you will not lose money?Across-the-board, that statement will not hold true because the stronger companies would definitely remain strong and even they probably would have a relatively better performance to talk about. But the weaker companies lacking bandwidth would have real challenges. If you ask me, whether we are seeing the rally across the board, my answer would be no. If we are going to see the rally in select good quality stocks where the fundamentals are supportive, where the management bandwidth is adequate and the financials are disciplined, then those companies would have a relatively better chance to grow themselves faster. 

Compared to last year, the market capitalisation of NBFC companies have not changed but the fact remains that some of the stronger NBFC companies have emerged stronger and their market caps have improved. As a sector, if the wealth has not changed, probably respective stocks performed and that is holding true for many companies even in the FMCG basket and select capital goods segment. In such a situation, I would like to believe that individual stocks should be given preference over the general market and that is where quality will get the premium and I think that we will probably pay premium for buying quality. 


Yes Bank has exited their ownership in Fortis. Is there scope for the stock to go higher?Corrective actions of any degree is certainly a help as far as balance sheet restructuring is concerned. Getting the cash back into the balance sheet -- either by recovering money from the non-performing assets or by way of selling investments -- is the name of the game. In any case, they required to capitalise themselves further given the kind of provisioning that they are required to do. Uncertainties are many. I really hope that not many nasty surprises are coming out of Yes Bank in some of the other failing institutions where Yes Bank had lent.

If those kinds of situations do not happen hereafter, in my view point, the stock should stabilise at current level. One would like to argue that with new investors coming into the company and strategically allowing the business to grow, in six to eight quarters, the company should come back on track. Maybe in anticipation, one could buy if a new investor comes into the company and the company starts stabilising. But we will have to wait and see. As of now, I would like to wait and consider adding the stock into the portfolio once clarity emerges. 


Is there anything from the broader market on your list? Are there any real estate names where you are looking for an opportunity to buy?I am not too sure about real estate. Yes, there would be offtake in properties which they have constructed given the kind of new money which we are attracting into the segment. Certainly, the investors coming into real estate space, would absorb the unsold inventory and that would be a good sign for some of the companies, at least the larger ones who have got quality inventory to offer -- be it in commercial space or residential space. However, I am unsure about the kind of margin that they would probably make.

I would rather wait in real estate till the situation gives that kind of clarity because today in a beaten down market, you are getting some of the quality fundamental stocks at significantly lower valuations, where you have reasonably good visibility of growth, reasonable good visibility of the companies performing and stock pricing giving return in two-three years’ time. Certainly one would like to stay with quality and even if it is at a premium, one would like to stay with quality in the name of margin of safety in the current market situation. 

We are not immediately looking at all the beaten down stocks. We stay with the quality fundamental stocks, maybe in the insurance business. We continue to like them, any corrective downside in the insurance business particularly life insurance companies, is where our preference lies. 


Give me the last acquisition you have done in your client’s portfolio or in your personal portfolio, a stock which you bought aggressively in last one monthWe continue to accumulate companies like Reliance, HDFC Life in dips. I have accumulated part of it when the market corrected in between. In case of the Bajaj twins, particularly Bajaj Finserv, it is more of an accumulation and balancing the portfolio, no fresh additions have been made into the portfolio.


How much more of value do you see within OMCs’?When I look at public sector oil marketing companies, I find their retail model more interesting and the refining model remains at the standard core industry level. That means, at the refinery level, unless you have the shore- based refinery where your raw material to finished product exchange takes place on the port itself which is the case with Reliance. In that case, you enjoy the distinct advantage of throughput processing as well as enjoying higher refining margins because of the strategic position on the port. 

Anything other than this in the refining business would mean that you are running the business with inefficiency. It is a given kind of situation because inbound refineries would have logistics issues to take care of. In my viewpoint, if the government is divesting and privatising some of these OMCs, I would think that they should be separating out the retailing business vis-à-vis the refining business. Gas stations etc could possibly fetch them relatively better valuation.

One could argue that BPCL shareholders could be in for a future of wealth creation or value creation, But I am not too sure at this point of time, how far wealth can be created."

14,2019-10-21,Bajaj Finserv,"Dalal Street veteran Bharat Shah, Executive Director, ASK Group believes value buying is an exercise a stock investor needs to do all the time. He said wealth creation through multibaggers is not only about spotting the right stock, but also about having the wisdom and patience to hold on to it for a long period of time. Quality of management is the first principle of investing, and one should never lose sight of it, he told Ami Shah of ETMarkets.com in an interview. Edited excerpts:


How do you view the current situation in the market? Is it a good time to go value buying? How does one navigate this market?

Value buying is a perennial, forever exercise. No matter what the state of the market, you want to buy quality businesses at prices that are presenting value; in other words, at a discount to its intrinsic worth. That is what value buying is. Therefore, there is nothing specific about this time or that time. In the current market, there has been a dramatic restructuring and dramatic reforms have been unleashed. Just to name a few, GST has been cleansing the behaviour of businesses, demonetisaiton has been an effort to clean up behavior of individuals. RERA is aiming to clean up the biggest and probably one of the murkiest sectors of the country, which is real estate. It has been painful, but very necessary, exercise of cleaning up of the rubbish on bank balance sheets, which is altering both the lending and borrowing culture. For the first time, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act has put the fear of God into the minds of big industrialists and the promoters, who otherwise would not have surrendered the assets that they have clutched on to irrespective of whatever was the record in terms of doing what they had done with those assets.

These are very powerful structural changes. They have all combined together right now to change the character of the businesses. These changes are permanent in nature. To that extent, it is interesting to see the process of creative destruction, which is at work. Bad businesses and bad managements are being damaged. On the other hand, quality businesses and quality managements are flowering like never before. Bad capital and bad growth are getting retarded, and good quality growth, good capital and good businesses are thriving. This change is materially important, here to stay. To that extent, all investing has to reflect that reality.


Apart from the measures announced by the government, what else would you like the government to come out with to ensure that the economy gets back on track quickly?

As far as businesses are concerned and as far as economic activity is concerned, it is really the private side which has the responsibility. The role of the government is to provide necessary enabling laws, which in my opinion the government has been doing very effectively. Of course, there are some areas where reforms are still pending, such as land acquisition and labour reforms – there has to be some flexibility in terms of the ease with which one can hire and relieve labour. An important thing is to achieve parity in taxation on the agriculture side, which has been exempt. Agricultural income above a certain level, I think, must be taxed judiciously. Beyond that, I do not think there are too many things the government really needs to do. There have been clamours from certain sectors. For example – auto and some other sectors will demand this concession of GST or that concession, and I think the government has rightly not done any of those. The deep tax cut that has happened on the corporate side is a very powerful change. It is a permanent import, and not a one-timer. This is a more durable and it is a far more fundamental and fair change, because it can help everybody judiciously the same manner. These kinds of reforms are important. On the personal income-tax front, I would hope at some stage there will be some matching deduction. And yes, I would say a significant part of the public sector really needs to be privatised.

So, privatisation, reform on the personal income-tax, agriculture tax, labour and land reforms – these to my mind are among the significant remaining blocks. The government has done most of the other things, I would say.


You have seen many market cycles over the decades. Which sector have been the best value creators for you?

Identifying a performing sector is a very temporary activity. Investing is not about finding a sector. It is not about finding a fashion or a trend or a theme. It is not about judging an index or making some index predictions. Investing is a bottom-up art. It is about picking and choosing quality businesses run by quality and dependable managements. You can look for businesses that are sitting atop a large chunk of opportunity where the fundamental capability to grow is visible. Growth is vital, because without growth, equity becomes like a bank fixed deposit and after a while a negative bond. The task is to buy into that superior value-creating machine with some margin of safety, so that the underlying growth becomes annuity returns and the margin of safety is a one-time extra icing on the cake. That bottom-up stock selection and discipline is the approach. In addition, it requires wisdom to sit on a few good things that you have found, and not part with them in a whimsical or temperamental way for the temporary change or oddities in market behaviour. Not surrendering is vital.


Can you name some of the multibagger stocks that have delivered for you over the past decades – stocks where you really had the conviction?

Well, multibaggers happen. Many times, we think we are approaching a stock with a multibagger mindset in advance. I would say that is arrogance. You probably may figure out that a business represents enough virtues for it to be bought. Most importantly in a multibagger, it really happens when you buy a virtuous bundle of attributes or a package and you have the sagacity and wisdom to sit on it for a long period. It is the ability to sit on it for long enough duration, which actually has the greatest contribution to make it multibagger.

Whether it is Bajaj Finance or Bajaj Finserv or an Asian Paints or a Berger or a Pidilite or HDFC Bank or a Gruh Finance or a PI Industries, multibaggers happen when you identify the attributes. You can see that they are reasonably attractive as a combo and then you have the patience and wisdom to sit on them longer. Trying to predict multibaggers and buying them with that mindset is most likely to disappoint you and deliver inferior results. When Infosys was floated in 1990s and I had a good sense to buy it. It went up by a three-digit number, but did I really judge and did I know when I bought it that it is going to be some 150-times from the price that I bought? No. That will be utter arrogance to say, or it will be self-praise to say that one could judge everything in advance. All that one could judge was that here is a good management, people whom you can depend upon, right kind of professional behaviour and governance, that the business is a large-size opportunity, global in character and there were great attributes to the business which are amenable to value creation . On a conventional measurement also, the business was available at a reasonable price. Thereafter, it is just the patience of sitting on it in the market process, which made it multibagger. Think of something like Asian Paints. See if you had put Re 1 in Asian Paints 30 years ago, it is worth about Rs 850 today. In these 30 years, Asian Paints has not asked for a single rupee from you, no rights, no placement, no QIP, nothing. That is the beauty in a great high-quality business and the management that has sat on it for long period of time.


Over the past couple of years, we have seen a lot of first-time investors coming into the market. But these young investors are in hurry to make money? What do these young investors tell you?

I have not found anything of this kind. In fact, I have seen a growing maturity among our clients over time. The kind of questions they ask, the kind of periods for which they want to remain committed, their ability to ward off difficult phases in the market without losing patience is something which I growingly observe and appreciate. In my 31 years of investing career, if I think about the kind of questions and the kind of behavioural pattern of investors 20 years back, 25 years back or even 15 years back and today, there is a world of difference and there is far greater maturity, sensible behaviour and commitment to longer term and ability to discriminate that investing is not a ‘get rich quickly’ scheme. It is a journey over a period of time and that journey has to be done with patience and wisdom.


What is one lesson in value investing that you would like to pass on to the budding investors, particularly the millennials?

I think quality of management is the first principle of investing. One should never lose sight of it. A bad management can end up damaging even a good business in so many ways that you cannot imagine. Even if they do not end up damaging the business, they can certainly end up damaging an investment in a very bad way. Equally, bad businesses fundamentally just cannot create value. Finally, I would say errors of omission do not hurt you really, but it is errors of commission which can seriously set you back. When you miss something worthwhile and valuable, sure you lose an opportunity to make return from that good and healthy thing, but even if you have missed out something terrific you probably will get something else if you are on the right process and mindset, maybe less rewarding, but that is alright. 

But errors of commission can really set you back. Errors of commission occur when you make those fundamental transgressions or errors either in judging the quality of a business or in judging the quality of management or you try to profit out of rubbish, hoping that somehow either you are too smart to get affected by it or you are too lucky that you will get away with it, Neither of this is a sustainable one."

24,2019-10-24,Bajaj Finserv,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 26.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Citi has maintained sell rating on 
GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and revised target price to Rs 1330 from Rs 1240. GSK’s efforts to rationalise its portfolio by divesting multiple, tail-end brands and focusing on its priority brands portfolio have begun paying off – as reflected in low double digit topline growth and 20 per cent plus EBITDA margin, said Citi. The brokerage expects this trend to continue going forward but does not see a return to historical 30 per cent plus margin levels. Shares of GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals ended up 0.5 per cent at Rs 1490.60 on Wednesday.

• UBS has maintained buy rating on 
Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 2120. In the September quarter, Asian Paints grew decorative paint volumes by 15-16 per cent much ahead of expectations, said UBS. Given strong volume growth visibility for paints in the medium term and the competitive advantages, the stock will continue to trade at its premium valuation, said UBS. Shares of Asian Paints ended down 0.75 per cent at Rs 1766.40 on Wednesday.


• Jefferies has maintained buy rating on 
Newgen Software Technologies and revised target price to Rs 290 from Rs 372. The brokerage has cut EPS estimates for Newgen over FY20-FY22 to reflect weaker growth as well as resulting lower margins. Jefferies has retained buy as it expects growth to recover in FY21 which should also lead to sharp margin expansion. The brokerage is hopeful of traction in sales in the US market in particular which is a large opportunity for Newgen; India business should also grow better next year helped by a more favorable base. Shares of Newgen Software ended down 19.4 per cent at Rs 200.70 on Wednesday.

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on 
ICICI Securities and rolled forward target price to Rs 340 from Rs 320. The brokerage has raised earnings estimates to factor-in a better top-line and see a 15 per cent CAGR over FY19-22. Its valuation is reasonable and an improvement in its growth outlook could drive a rerating, said CLSA. Shares of ICICI Securities ended up 8.5 per cent at Rs 308.85 on Wednesday.

• Nomura has upgraded
 Bajaj Finserv to buy from neutral and retained target price of Rs 9500. The brokerage has upgraded the stock as lending business continues to deliver well on growth and asset quality and part of the disappointment in earnings for general insurance business is in the price. In the life insurance business, a tie-up with Axis Bank could lead to improvement in future business value, as the tie-up ramps up, said Nomura. Shares of Bajaj Finserv ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 8066.15 on Wednesday."

The 30-share Sensex climbed 216 points to 39,277. Its counterpart Nifty edged 60 points higher to 11,663.

Larsen & Toubro climbed nearly 2 per cent to Rs 1,455 in the early trade as it reported a 6.83 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 2,770.43 crore for the quarter ended September 2019.

Asian shares pulled ahead as corporate earnings and a ceasefire in northern Syria helped prop up sentiment, though the backdrop of trade and brexit uncertainties was enough to prevent a decisive shift towards riskier assets.

Chief Analyst -- Technical derivativesm Angel Broking

Where are We?
Market participants had to undergo a lot of stress as we didn’t see any respite in the market, if we keep aside last one month. The pain is still not out of the system as we can see some indecisive swings thereafter. In the midst of it all, the market is at a very interesting juncture.


What is in Store? This week, the benchmark index did nothing as we witnessed the Nifty moving in a 150–180 points range to conclude the week with marginal cuts. As per our recent ‘Time Retracement’ analysis, the Nifty has reversed exactly in September and is now well above the recent lows. But the question remains: Are we going to see sustained rally from here or not? This would probably be the toughest question to answer. But, we are still hopeful as we can see the bulls trying to flex their muscles a bit and hence expect some good days to come. On the daily chart, we can see a breakout happening during last week from an ‘Inverse Head and Shoulders’ pattern.


What Should Investors Do?
Although the follow-up move is lacking, one should remain upbeat as long as the recent swing low of 11090 is intact. Meanwhile, 11450–11350 can be seen as immediate support. On the higher side, we could see the rally extending towards 11850–11900 first, or may be beyond 12000 once the Nifty manages to sustain above 11700. The banking index has been a laggard of late, which needs to step up and we expect it to happen soon. From the automobile sector, we continue to like Maruti, Bajaj Auto and Bharat Forge. Banking giant SBI posted stellar numbers on Friday which has lit up the entire PSU banking basket. In the F&O mid-cap space, we have been persistently advising Sun TV, MGL and Tata Elxsi, they are likely to extend their bull run. In the paint space, Kansai Nerolac is poised for some catch-up rally to its larger peers.

ANDEEP PORWAL

Technical analyst, Ashika Stock Broking

Where are We? The festive mood and state election verdicts failed to cheer up the market. The index traded on a subdued note since the beginning of the week gone by. Quarterly earnings acted as a trigger for stock-specific volatility. On the sectoral front, the IT index remains a major underperformer with a drop of 3% while bargain hunting trades were being observed in PSU banks in the week gone by.


What is in Store? Trend exhaustion is being observed in the benchmark index as price remains below the overhead resistance post the reversal from the key Fibonacci ratio of 61.80% (reference range of 10670-11695).The formation of indecisive and reversal candlesticks near the trendline of a downward sloping channel on the daily chart confirms that price remains near the point of exhaustion. We are likely to see selling pressure mounting till the time the index trades below the intermediate high of 11715. The bearish view negates in the event of a breakout above the overhead resistance. In the short-term, key support remains at the level of 11300.


What Should Investors Do? Traders and investors should remain on the edge given the swift turn of the tide because of a lack of follow-up in both the scenarios of long and short. However, swing trading certainly is a good strategy/approach to make most out of the prevailing phase. Stock specific, we recommend longs in Mindtree, TCS and SBI and expect a short-term rally; while Bajaj Finserv and CESC are likely to trade with a negative bias.

 BHAVIN MEHTA
VP-Derivatives Strategist, Dolat Capital

Where are We? The recent recovery in the Nifty was seen post FM’s bigbang corporate tax cut announcement, that saw the index moving from levels of ~10700 to 11700 in just two trading sessions, after which we have seen about 21 sessions of consolidation. In this period, we saw the Nifty unable to manage to close above 11600 despite multiple attempts. The ongoing earnings season seems to be decent so far with very few misses for Nifty50.


What is in Store?
Two sectors where we believe institutional investors are most focussed are private sector banks (financials continue to hold high weights) as well as FMCG companies. Both these sectors continue to witness good amount of accumulation as well as long build-up.


What Should Investors Do? 
For the Nifty, we will advise to go long in case of mean reversion to short-term averages that lie in the range of 11300-11400 or in case of sustainable close above 11650 (at least two trading sessions). A breakout on the upside will lead to the Nifty moving towards 11950-12000. We remain positive on private banks (Axis, ICICI & HDFC Bank); FMCG (HUL and Dabur) auto (Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto and Eicher). Contra traders can look at an opportunity to buy into select stocks from metals (Tata Steel), PSUs (SBI, GAIL, SAIL and PFC). On other hand, we are concerned with IT (Infy and Mindtree) and NBFCs. Participants may also look at shorting strangles for the next month specifically in names where earnings have been out and momentum seems to have subsided: TCS, Hero MotoCorp, L&T, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Bank and ACC."

31,2019-10-30,Bajaj Finserv,"If stock prices are doing well, an economic recovery is perhaps a few months down the line. When markets are turning, if you feel the next 12 months’ trajectory for the Nifty, Sensex is great, then it is the tier II, tier III which will outperform the tier I stocks, says Dipan Mehta, Founder & Director, Elixir Equities.

Is it true that Nifty is 500 points away from an all-time high, the market breadth has stabilised, FIIs have stopped selling and finally HNIs have also started buying?What can I say, 
acche din aa gaye (good days are here).


But are good days really here or is this momentary rise, not a rally?Stock markets are lead indicators and if stock prices are doing well, an economic recovery is perhaps a few months down the line. By and large, there are cycles and this particular base cycle seems to be over and going forward, if there is no incremental bad news and in the financial front, there are no blow outs as far as fresh slippages are concerned, gradually the economy will start improving and that will get reflected in stock prices as well. 

The corporate tax cut has been a game changer and it is now pretty evident in the earnings which are coming through. You may keep on arguing that PBT profits are same but at the PAT levels, the earnings per share which is the most important data point for analysts for valuation those are improving significantly even where companies have been reporting flat to negative growth rates. 


Yes, margins have gone higher, cash flows have improved and corporate can now start spending.Absolutely yes. All these factors put together give a lot of confidence and in any case, there was always money waiting on the sidelines globally as well as in India. It just needed the right tipping point and that came with the September 20th announcements. The markets have clearly turned.


The challenge is Nifty has been fooling us. We may be up 10-11% over last one year, but it has all been about the 5-6-7 stocks. If you bought those stocks, it is great. But crowded trades are seldom over-owned trades. Should we stop looking at the Nifty for now?You can do that at your own pedal. Fact is that we all benchmark ourselves to the Nifty. Mutual funds, fund managers look at the Nifty. It is a major global index and if it is going up and those five stocks are taking it up, then so be it, you cannot argue against that. But I do feel that we are getting into a more broad-based rally. Across-the-board sectors are starting to do better, take cement for example. Now auto, auto ancillary has also turned around. So by and large we are getting the rhythm back in the market. Of course, there is still a concentration of trade in the good quality 10-15 stocks, but it is percolating to the rest of the market and this trend will only gather more. 

Everybody knows that those 15 stocks are expensive but nobody wants to touch the tier II, tier III stocks because of various uncertainties -- earnings balance sheet, corporate governance, whatever. But incremental flows will find their way into the tier II, tier III stocks and the gap which has been widening, has started narrowing already and this trend will gather momentum.


Looking at BPCL, you want to do a bit of a double take. The government’s divestment drive has taken off. Do you think a lot more strategic stake sale is required or the fact that they are even have got this on their priority list is a major positive?It is a reform process and the market thinks that it is the beginning of a major reform process as far as PSUs are concerned. The problem with the PSUs is that there is excessive control by the government over the PSUs and these are in businesses where they should not be. Because of whatever reasons, they are not as efficient as the private sector and if a disinvestment like BPCL goes through successfully and the political fallout is manageable, then it will embolden the government to do more such disinvestments. In order to do that, they will have to first clean up the PSUs as far as control, corporate governance, efficiency, all these factors are concerned, make them attractive for the foreign or local investors who want to look into it.

 The whole process is a very powerful investment theme and many investors will like to ride on it. Also what favours PSU is low valuation, businesses are great businesses in terms of monopolies. Balance sheet wise, they are all excellent, at least the listed ones and they have very high return ratio. They are great businesses in the wrong hands and if those hands are changing, or if there is a subtle change in the way as those PSUs are being managed, then there is a great scope for PSUs to rally even further from this side. 

The classic, the best stocks to buy are the ones where we see earnings increasing and the PE is expanding and that is possible in the PSUs where the earnings also move up and the PE multiples kind of shoot up.


While Air India, BPCL are very large disinvestments and some of them are of strategic importance, do you think government will be easily able to slip a Concor or BHEL out?It should be, let us see how this plays out. Right now, it is all up in the air. Let one disinvestment get done in the right spirit because in the past government has tended to sell its own stake from one PSU to another.


 … ONGC, HPCL or PFC and REC…It is an evolving situation and if it happens in true earnest, we have to see what is the political fallout. But just to start buying stocks based on the idea that they will eventually get disinvested, is like taking a punt. It may work out, you may take a small exposure to it but the likes of BHEL or even BPCL for that matter can never be part of the absolute core holding.

The top five holdings cannot be these companies because we have seen in the past that the government goes back on its entire plan of disinvestment and then these stocks end up going nowhere like a BHEL. I do not know what is the scope in terms of earnings growth and other factors we value it on, but if you disinvest it, then the new player who comes in will sell the land, will reorganise the business, focus on the right products and turn around the company and extract its full value which the government cannot do. 

Also keep in mind that the PSUs have got very strong labour unions as well. How that plays out also is extremely important. It is early days as far as India’s strategic disinvestment programme is concerned. Let us see how it plays out that is what I should say.


What do you make of the move in auto names post the festive season? Double digit sales growth that has come in, strong commentary from the likes of Anand Mahindra. Can we say that they are safely out of danger zone or would you attribute this purely to festive demand?The turnaround in auto was long overdue and it is great that we are seeing these kind of pickup, especially in the festive season. Most analysts and industry observers say let us see what happens in November, December or so. 

The advantage in auto is that we get quality data month after month and we are getting even registration data these days, although that is not as accurate. As an investor in auto industry, I would like to see a few more months of double digit growth rates, see how that is playing out before deciding on the increasing exposure to auto. 

But I tell you one thing I am not happy with is the long-term trajectory of the auto industry. It is not a sector which is going to be a market favourite over three-four years or so. The reasons are partly structural, partly comparative intensity, partly disruption which is taking place within the sector. 

I would be very careful to play the auto shares going forward. They are great trading bets because they had been oversold, under owned and now you have some positive news flow, so you will quickly have that upswing. But can they scale to their previous highs and give returns from that on a consistent secular basis? I am not so sure.


Lot of funds have bought into NTPC of late. It is one of the top holdings of Prashant Jain and one of the top holdings of S Naren. Their logic is utilities do well when interest rates are declining and frankly except for NTPC and the Adanis a little bit, no large corporate group has added a lot of power capacity. Is there money to be made in a stock like NTPC which frankly for the last couple of years has been a dog of a stock?Not the last couple of years. Since listing, it has been a huge underperformer and when the markets are down, you want to go for value plays. Price to book is great, dividend yield is fantastic, you get steady cash flows all that is fine but what makes money in the stock market is growth and that is missing as far as utilities companies are concerned. 

By and large, there is a fine balance between installed capacity and demand at least at the price point at which we are just now. The monthly figures for electricity generation and consumption are not showing double digit growth and if you want to make money in the market, you have to find businesses which grow at least 15-16% at a reasonable valuation. That particular assumption has not changed. 

You could have trading rallies in the likes of NTPC or some of the other slow growth PSU companies and that is what it is. In one year, it may give you 15-20%, even 30% return, but then for the next five years, it may remain at the same level, whereas other growth stocks may become multibaggers.


What is your view on Yes Bank?We had fantastic results from Axis Bank and ICICI Bank. If you go back two-three years ago, Axis and ICICI had corrected 45% from their peak. They are in a similar situation where IndusInd and RBL are just now. Yes Bank is in slightly deeper mess than these two banks but if Axis and Yes Bank can come around from the problem they were in, providing for all the NPAs, cleaning up the balance sheet, raising capital and are now on a solid growth path, then the same can get repeated in IndusInd Bank or an RBL and maybe even YES Bank as well. 

In investment, we do not want to buy the best bank but best investment opportunities are where there is stress just now, valuations are cheap, there is uncertainty as far as their slippages are concerned.


Survival?Survival also but if they live through these tough times, then these stocks can give you 35-40% compounded return over the next two-three years or so. Banking is a great business to be in in India.


Demand will never be a problem. It is a credit-starved country.Exactly. When you have a situation like this, I would like to put the stressed-out banks on my radar and look for opportunities over there. I would watch them closely, see how they are turning around, see how they are playing out and maybe get higher returns in the likes of Axis, ICICI, HDFC or Kotak. When markets are turning, if you feel the next 12 months’ trajectory for the Nifty, Sensex is great, then it is the tier II, tier III which will outperform the tier I stocks.


Given that we are talking about some of the PSU names now, would you look at specific names like SBI that has also delivered?SBI came up with a great set of numbers and ironically these days the PSU banks have better provision coverage ratio than the private sector banks and it does seem that now maybe the likes of SBI and some of the larger banks can provide some amount of consistent growth going forward. Again there is scope over here for the valuation ratios to improve the price to earnings or price to book or so. 

I would say that one should not be negative on likes of SBI or some of the larger stronger PSU banks as they have scope to deliver good returns. They will have some amount of volatility in the earnings, but the overall move maybe quite positive going forward.


Last time we spoke you said you were preparing a portfolio for the bull market, stocks where you can get 40-50% return in the next two years and so that when the bear market comes, my 50 becomes 25 and yet I get a CAGR of 25%. What are you trying to buy in that?As I said that the focus is more on the second level players over there. In banking, we are looking at IndusInd Bank, RBL. In NBFC space, something like an L&T Finance is looking quite interesting, being available at reasonable valuations. That is another sector we are looking at. 

And then across the board, within the consumption space -- appliances, FMCG to an extent. Within FMCG, I am looking at the likes of Jyothy Laboratories or Godrej Consumer which have underperformed HUL or Nestle. That is the theme that we are trying to follow through and depending on how the results are and how this particular rally shapes up, you will get better returns in the second level stocks than the stocks which have been outperforming so far. So you could see a turnaround over there.


Would you trade out of a Nestle if you own it or a D-Mart or Bajaj Finance purely because they are expensive or would you like to keep it simple. You may not make money in six months but you will also not lose a lot of money?It is a difficult one to answer and the way are going to approach it is incremental flows. The incremental flows come from households, it comes investors cash flows. Incremental flows are not in the Nestles and the Bajaj Finances and HDFC Bank. Incremental flows are in riskier bets and gradually if you have 70-80% in the safer stocks and if you move that ratio lower through incremental flows to 40-50% or so, over the next two years, you would have a nice outperforming portfolio with certain amount of stability. Whenever downturns come, the top holdings will remain quite solid over there.


Insurance has been a sector that has been growing very steadily, More opportunities here?We like the insurance sector. And I will give you a stock with usual disclosure that we and our clients are invested in. We like ICICI Lombard in the general insurance space. It is India’s largest private sector insurer and if you want to buy a private insurance company, this is the only standalone listed company, the rest are all part of holding companies like a Kotak or a Bajaj Finserv or so. 

So we are very positive over there and this is a great secular growth story. It will gain market share at the expense of PSU banks and what we like best is that this company focuses on profitable business. In crop insurance, it does not get the right yields. It exited out of it completely at the expense of losing out on large revenue. But it is very focussed, well managed and it is a great business.


If you are not bullish on autos, why are you bullish on ICICI Lombard because a large of their insurance is actually autos?That is a bit of misconception over there. Not only do they insure new vehicles but the older vehicles also need to be insured and there are changes in the Motor Vehicle Act which benefits insurance companies. And now they are moving more into even mediclaim and general insurance, fire insurance. So, it is a completely diversified company and it can have a solid growth going forward, at least maintain its 15-20% type of top line, bottom line growth. It is an expensive stock, around 50 times or so, trailing 12 months. But it is a steady one and we do feel that it can give good returns going forward."

33,2019-10-31,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: As benchmark equity indices hit fresh all-time highs, stocks of Bajaj group have emerged top wealth creators, with a 33.4 per cent jump in the combined market value so far this year. They beat Ambani, Adani and Tata groups to claim the crown.

Investors made money with both hands in five Bajaj group stocks that rose 17-53 per cent in the first 10 months of 2019. However, six other group stocks fell up to 14-52 per cent in the same period. 

Six Adani group stocks saw a 19.27 per cent rise in the combined market value. All of them have gained so far this year.

In value terms, two of Mukesh Ambani group stocks – Reliance Industries and RIIL – added Rs 2.19 lakh crore to increase combine market-cap to Rs 9.30 lakh crore, up 30 per cent from Rs 7.11 lakh crore at the end of 2018. On Wednesday, RIL became the sixth largest energy firm globally by market cap.

Bajaj Auto, in fact, is among a handful of auto stocks that has yielded positive returns globally this year. Both Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have been reporting strong numbers for past few quarters. Bajaj Finance’s Q2 profit grew 63 per cent while that of Finserv 71 per cent.

“Bajaj Finance can definitely give a 10 per cent return, if you are not expecting it to double in four-five years,” said Siddhartha Khemka of MOSL. In the case of Bajaj Finserv, Hemang Jani of Sharekhan said: ""Within insurance, we like Bajaj Finserv because it has both life and general insurance businesses. Besides, compared with some of the other listed entities, it is quoting at a discount of about 16-30 per cent.""

Mukund Engineers, Mukand, Bajaj Consumer Care, Bajaj Hindustan Sugar, Bajaj Electricals and Hercules Hoists are the other of group stocks that are down 14-52 per cent year to date.

Aditya Birla, ADAG stocks drop
Out of the nine listed Aditya Birla group stocks, six eroded Rs 33,000 crore worth of investor wealth this year. Vodafone Idea alone has lost Rs 21,870 crore in value. Hindalco, Grasim Industries and Aditya Birla Money have erased another Rs 20,000 crore. UltraTech Cement added Rs 9,050 crore to the group’s value.

Six ADAG stocks saw 40 per cent erosion in market value. Their combined market value now stands at Rs 22,400 crore compared with Rs 37,880 crore at the end of December 2018.

Nippon Life Insurance acquired 75 per cent stake in RNAM from Reliance Capital for around Rs 6,000 crore.

Reliance Capital, RCom, Reliance Home, Reliance Infra and Reliance Power lost 88-95 per cent of their value in 2019 so far.


Adani stocks deliver 19% return
In case of Gautam Adani stocks, except for Adani Ports, all other stocks have performed pretty well. Adani Green surged 113 per cent, followed by Adani Gas (47 per cent), Adani Transmission (32.65 per cent) and Adani Power (30 per cent). Adani Ports rose just 1 per cent for the year.

TCS, Titan, Trent, Voltas and TGBL contributed the bulk of increase in Tata group market-cap, as 17 of the 27 group stocks are down this year. TCS alone added Rs 1.13 lakh crore to the group’s market-cap. Titan added Rs 35,773 crore to its market value. Rest three added a combined Rs 16,720 crore.


RIL a $200 billion company in making

5,2019-11-03,Bajaj Finserv,"By Mythili Bhusnurmath

Last month, a business daily declared Bajaj Finserv MD-CEO Sanjiv Bajaj ‘Banker of the Year’. Few will dispute the Bajaj scion’s Midas touch, or contest his selection. Except that Bajaj is not a banker. And his company, Bajaj Finserv, the holding company of Bajaj Finance, is not a bank, but a non-banking finance company (NBFC).

But if no heads seemed to turn at the announcement, the reason is simple. The line between banks & NBFCs, always a fine one, has blurred to a point where few see a contradiction in a ‘non-banker’ being declared ‘Banker of the Year’.


A Bank by Any Other NameThe confusion is understandable. Newspaper editorials often equate deposits in banks and NBFCs. A recent piece in ET (
The Unsafe Vaults: With the Financial System Hit by Defaults, Is It Time to Resurrect an Old Law?) says, “At the peak of the global financial crisis, Ireland had to publicly declare its promise to repay every single bank depositor to prevent arun on the banking industry that would have shattered its economy.” It then goes on to describe how depositors have not been repaid by NBFCs like Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), Altico Capital and Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, overlooking the subtle, but key, difference between banks and non-banks. And between deposits of banks and NBFCs.

This distinction is not a matter of semantics, but a key pillar on which the entire edifice of modern banking and the capitalist economy rests. At a time when government is reportedly toying with reviving the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill (it was shelved last year following fears among bank depositors that the bail-in clause in the Bill would put their deposits at risk), it is important to understand the difference.

What makes banks special? Why would a bail-in clause be suicidal in the case of banks, even if it is not without merit in the context of NBFCs?

Let’s start at the very beginning. Unlike NBFCs, banks are licensed by RBI to engage in the business of banking, that is, to take deposits from the public for the purpose of lending, with the caveat that these deposits are repayable on demand. NBFCs, too, might take public deposits. But these are not repayable on demand; they are repaid only after a specified period.

Since banks are licensed repositories of public savings, trust is paramount if the system is not to break down. Note, banking is a licensed activity not only in India where RBI is the licensing authority, but globally as well. Further, in keeping with global best practice, all applicants for a bank licence are required to meet the ‘fit and proper’ test, in addition to satisfying strict financial criteria.

Banks are unique in another respect. Unlike NBFCs, they issue cheques. These are considered as good as cash since they are backed by money in the bank. Banks, therefore, are part of the ‘payments system’ that underpins modern commerce.

At the same time, the fractional reserve system that underpins modern banking means they need keep only a fraction of their deposits and can lend out the rest. Yes, there is an inherent mismatch, since deposits are repayable on demand, and loans, understandably, cannot be repayable on demand. But provided banks manage the mismatch between their liabilities (deposits) and assets (loans) wisely and deploy deposits in sound assets, they will be able to pay their deposits as and when demanded, even if not immediately.


Sibling, But Less PrivilegedTo ensure banks live up to the trust reposed in them, they are subject to tough regulations like cash reserve ratio (CRR), statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), capital adequacy norms and a host of other regulations, including inspection — to ensure they are always able to pay their depositors and in full. In return for submitting themselves to tough regulation, RBI acts as ‘lender of last resort’, in case of sudden liquidity problems or inability to meet withdrawals.

This is a crutch extended only to banks, not to NBFCs, to ensure trust in the banking system is not shaken. For the same reason, barring exceptional circumstances, banks are not allowed to fail, especially once they become large, as the collapse of a single large bank could have a domino effect and lead to the collapse of many others. Hence the phrase, ‘too big to fail’.

NBFCs, in contrast, are not licensed by RBI. Large NBFCs are registered, especially if they are going to access public deposits. But RBI does not apply the globally sanctified ‘fit and proper’ yardstick, a highly selective, admittedly subjective, yardstick, to NBFCs. Unlike with banks, RBI is not a lender of last resort to NBFCs, even though it is their regulator and supervisory authority.

So, while it might be good to have a resolution mechanism for financial firms, especially deposit-taking NBFCs, it would be fatal to equate bank deposits with NBFC deposits. For the same reason, deposit insurance must remain a privilege extended only to bank deposits, given their unique position in the financial system and regulatory strictures to which they are subject. For non-bank depositors, it must be caveat emptor, backed by a functioning legal system, where the remedy for non-payment rests with courts.

A bail-in clause, appropriate for nonbanks, would be disastrous if extended to banks. Not unless we are willing to shake public faith in bank deposits and deprive banks of much-needed resources to finance economic activity."

6,2019-11-04,Bajaj Finserv,"The portfolios for 2014 and 2015 have delivered stellar performance on an aggregate level. These have comfortably outperformed both indices and the average diversified equity fund. Vinati Organics and Atul from the 2014 list and Bajaj Finserv and Coromandel International from the 2015 basket have been standout performers. 

Gateway Distriparks and McLeod Russel have been a drag on the 2014 portfolio while Yes Bank has taken the sheen off the 2015 portfolio after a sharp correction in its stock price following deterioration in its asset quality. Apollo Tyres and Redington have also disappointed.

Despite Voltas, PI Industries and Finolex Industries powering the 2016 portfolio, it has offered tepid return on an aggregate basis. CARE Ratings and Cholamandalam Finance have dragged the entire basket down. While CARE Ratings has fallen off the cliff in recent months, the latter has actually seen a rebound in stock price. After rising smartly for a few years, shares of Exide Industries and Schaeffler have given up most of the gains since last year.


2014: Outperforming the indices comfortably


KPIT Tech share price inclusive of Birlasoft post demerger.


2015: Surged ahead of markets by a wide margin



2016: Two scrips pull down overall portfolio return



2017: NBFC stocks weigh heavy on entire basket



2018: Two scrips take sheen off entire portfolio



The 2017 portfolio has been completely overwhelmed by the sharp value erosion in DHFL and Repco Home Finance. DHFL shares particularly have taken a sound beating after allegations of financial irregularities at the lender plagued by severe solvency issues. Repco Home Finance has not escaped the beat-down received by housing finance companies amid the liquidity squeeze and concerns over loans to stressed developers. City Union Bank remains the only standout performer from the 2017 basket.

Most of the stocks from last year’s basket have fared well, but the portfolio has been hurt by steep cut in Sterlite Technologies and Motherson Sumi. Broadband infrastructure provider Sterlite has lost nearly two-third of its value despite recording a 60% top line growth and 68% jump in profits in the fiscal year 2019. Auto components supplier Motherson has seen its value erode amid a spillover effect from a sharp consumption slowdown in both domestic and global automobile industry.


How mutual funds treated stocks
Previous year picks have their share of multibaggers and lemons, but funds increased their stake in the outperformers and threw out the losers.



Mutual funds held 8.29 lakh shares of Vinati Organics in September 2014. This has shot up over 200% to 28.59 lakh now. The stock has given a CAGR of 37.09% in the past five years.
MF holding in Bajaj Finserv increased from 83 lakh shares in September 2015 to 4.12 crore shares now. The stocks has registered a CAGR of 42.77% in the past four years.
Curiously, fund holding in Mcleod Russell has not come down even though the stock has declined 97% since September 2014. From 84.7 lakh shares in September 2014, mutual funds now hold 1.39 crore shares.
Similarly, fund holding in Gateway Distriparks has increased even though the stock has not done well in the past five years. From 1.65 crore shares held in September 2014, mutual funds now hold 1.94 crore shares.
However, mutual funds have not been so merciful in case of other underperforming stocks. They have ruthlessly exited stocks such as DHFL, Yes Bank and even Aurobindo Pharma following corporate governance issues.

14,2019-11-04,Bajaj Finserv,"Better September quarter earnings helped HDFC and Varun Beverages register solid gains on the bourses on Monday. IT bellwether Infosys emerged biggest Sensex gainer, after it said prima facie there was no truth in the whistleblower allegations.

Metal stocks jumped for the second consecutive session led by JSPL, which gained after successfully bidding for a coal mine. Its peer JSW Steel and SAIL also rose.

BSE benchmark Sensex added 137 points, taking the winning streak into a seventh session. It ended at 40,301, making it the highest closing ever. Its NSE counterpart Nifty also inched closer to its lifetime high, ending 54 points higher at 11,945.

""Nifty opened with marginal gains and closed a volatile session at 11,945. In the process, it formed a Doji candle on the daily chart, hinting at indecision among investors. Now good support for the index exists in the 11,900-11,850 zone and a strong hurdle stands near the 12,000 mark. Any decisive break above this level can help it make a strong move,"" said Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.

Here is a lowdown of the movers and shakers of Monday’s session on Dalal Street:


HDFC gains on good Q2 show
HDFC shares gained 2.3 per cent to Rs 2,178 after the company posted a net profit at Rs 3,962 crore, up 61 per cent. The bottomline beat consensus estimate of analysts, who in an ETNOW Poll had projected a net of Rs 3,470 crore.


JSPL gets coal impetus
Shares of Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) rose 11 per cent to Rs 137.25 on BSE after the media reports said it emerged highest bidder for Gare Palma IV/1 Coal mines at Rs 230 per tonne.


Infosys shares jump
Shares of Infosys advanced over 3 per cent after the IT major informed the bourses that it has not received any evidence to corroborate allegations by whistleblower. The stock ended at Rs 709 on BSE.

Varun Beverages gains
Pepsi bottler Varun Beverages gained 1.5 per cent to Rs 629.75 on BSE after it reported a 83 per cent jump in September quarter profit at Rs 81.1 crore.


Vodafone jumps despite downgrade
Shares of Vodafone Idea jumped nearly 5 per cent to Rs 4.51 on BSE even though CRISIL downgraded its rating on non-convertible debentures of Rs 3,500 crore of Vodafone. The action has been taken on the apex court’s AGR ruling and delay in asset monetization viz. stake sale in Indus Towers.


Metal pack shines
Metals shone led by Jindal twins. Jindal Steel and Power surged 8 per cent to Rs 133 and JSW Steel ended up 5 per cent at Rs 249.50 on NSE. Other major contributors in the space were Coal India, up 3.8 per cent and SAIL, up 3.21 per cent. Nifty Metal ended with gains of 2.84 per cent to Rs 72.85.

Where we are: Last week market started on a positive note and then tapered towards the end of the week. The Nifty closed higher by 2.27 per cent at 11,891 levels on weekly basis. Broader market also chipped in with gains as BSE MidCap Index outperformed the benchmark with a rise of 3.11 per cent while BSE SmallCap ended higher by 2.18 per cent for the week.


What is in store: On daily chart Nifty has formed back to back small body doji (opening and closing are around the same levels) candle, indicating indecisiveness in the market. But on the higher time frame i.e. weekly chart, index has formed a long-body bullish candle indicating broad trend remains up after the decisive breakout above 11700. Thus, some profit booking can be seen if Nifty is unable move past 11945 levels.

Crossing above 11945 expect rally to continue towards all-time high of 12103 and then 12280 levels. However if it touches below 11820 levels, expect the market to correct towards 11650-11700 levels which was the earlier resistance zone and it will now act as support. Recent swing low of 11490 will the key pivotal level for the market.


What you could do: In Nifty November monthly expiry options, maximum open interest for Put is seen at strike price 11600 followed by 11500; while for Call maximum open interest is seen at 12000 followed by 11800. Nifty Put-Call option distribution data is suggesting a range between 11600 and 12100 levels. India VIX closed higher by 0.98 per cent at 15.73 levels for the week. VIX is facing resistance at 17 and seeing reversal; further decline will be supportive for the market. However, crossing above 17 may cap the gains for the market. On the stocks front Bajaj Finserv, SRF, Muthoot Finance, Axis Bank, Inox Leisure look poised for further upside from current levels."

19,2019-11-05,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices have now advanced for seven straight sessions. Technical indicators are largely positive, even as oscillators are nearing the overbought zone.

Back-to-back positive closings for the indices are having a rub-off on the broader market, where at least 42 such stocks now look stronger on technical charts.

These stocks might be heading higher in the coming days, suggests technical indicator moving average convergence divergence or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled a bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. Strong trading volumes on many of these counters are lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Infosys, Tata Power, Max Financial, Karur Vysya Bank, Torrent Power, Varun Beverages and Shalimar Paints.

Bajaj Finserv, Rallis India, Cholamandalam Finance, Century Plyboards and Music Broadcast are among other stocks showing bullish crossovers on the MACD indicator.







The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed 33 stocks are signalling bearish trends. They included M&M, Hindustan Zinc, Berger Paints, Ashoka Buildcon, Amara Raja, Divi’s Labs, HDFC AMC and Kansai Nerolac Paints.





Analysts say the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

As for Nifty50, Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking sees no signs of any trend reversal yet. He expects to see the index taking out the 12,000 level soon.

“Traders are advised to avoid taking any contrarian bets and use intraday dips as buying opportunities. The immediate supports for Nifty are placed at 11,843 and 11,776 levels,” he said.

Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said a High Wave pattern at the key overhead resistance indicates confusion. “The possibility of a downward correction can't be ruled out from the highs. A sustainable move below the 11,850 level may confirm a negative reversal pattern at the highs,” he said.

Moraiya is one of the important plants for the company and currently contributes more than 45 per cent to its US revenues. Palviya of Axis Securities said a break below the crucial level of Rs 230 can lead to a further fall of Rs 10 in the stock.

BAJAJ FINSERV

Bajaj Finserv has also seen build-up of bullish positions. The stock ended up for the third straight day on Monday. The company had reported a 71 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the September quarter to Rs 1204 crore. SBICAP Securities said the strong show in the second quarter was driven by robust underlying performance across businesses supported by lower taxes and realised investment gains."
21,2019-11-06,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Bajaj group holding company Bajaj Finserv and its subsidiary Bajaj Finance scaled fresh all-time intraday highs on Wednesday, for the second session after a similar show on Tuesday.

Bajaj Finance touched an intraday high of Rs 4,277.50 after the company on Monday launched its Rs 8,500 crore qualified institutional placement (QIP). BlackRock, Nomura, GIC of Singapore and others lapped up the shares in the Rs 8,500 crore private placement to qualified institutional investors.

However, the scrip pared gains to close 1.04 per cent or Rs 43.90 lower at Rs 4,185.90, while the benchmark BSE Sensex settled 221.55 points or 0.55 per cent higher at 40,469.78. Shares of Bajaj Finance have more than doubled investors’ wealth in the past 22 months. The scrip was trading around Rs 1,756 in December 2017.

Bajaj Finance in October said that its consolidated profit after tax jumped 63 per cent to Rs 1,506 crore during the July to September quarter from Rs 923 crore in the same period of the previous year.

Net interest income of the country’s largest consumer durable lender was up by 48 per cent to Rs 3,999 crore from Rs 2,708 crore in Q2FY19.

JM Financial in its report on October 31 maintained a ‘buy’ rating on Bajaj Finance with an immediate target price of Rs 4,251 and thereafter Rs 4,316.

“Bajaj Finance has a strong risk management framework with a large client base and best practices in terms of measures in keeping strong asset quality confidence. In a declining interest-rate regime, BAF has strong pricing power and is better placed to tap growth,” JM Financial said in a report.

Meanwhile, shares of Bajaj Finserv hit an intraday high of Rs 8,874.95 on Wednesday on BSE. The stock, however, ended lower after paring gains in afternoon trade. Net profit of Bajaj Finserv advanced 71 per cent YoY to Rs 1,204 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal.

It had posted a profit of Rs 704 crore in the corresponding July-September quarter of the previous fiscal ended on March 2019.

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for the various financial services businesses under the Bajaj group. Edelweiss Securities on October 23 gave ‘Reduce’ call to Bajaj Finserv with a target price of Rs 6,938. “While we like the sustained momentum in operating variables, risk aversion in the current environment and uncertainty surrounding moderation in customer demand warrants ‘valuation rationalisation’. Despite the decent operating performance, the run-up in stock renders risk-reward unfavourable,” it said."
20,2019-11-06,Bajaj Finserv,"Individual investors, including high networth ones, are seeking comfort in blue chips as the broader market has turned volatile.

The total number of individual shareholders in Nifty50 constituent companies increased to 2.33 crore as of September end, 2019 from 2.23 crore on June 30 and 2.16 crore as of March 31,.

As options dried up elsewhere in the market, these investors went for heavy buying in select Nifty stocks, trying to make the most of a market rebound. That, even when valuations of many of these stocks hit sky-high levels.

For instance, Bajaj Finance hovered at a price-to-earnings multiple of 51 times and a price-to-book value of 3.10 times on November 1 after the scrip jumped 130 per cent since December end, 2017.

Nestle India traded at a P/E of 85.40 against the industry average of 49.20. Its price-to-book value stood at 15 times on November 1. The stock has rallied 93 per cent in 22 months to trade around Rs 7,700. Nestle became a part of Nifty on September 27, 2019.

Are these valuations justifiable?

Sunil Singhania-led Abakkus Asset Management in a recent report, titled ‘The Big Call-Bubble in Quality?’ said some of the quality stocks have now reached the bubble zone and could give zero or negative returns over the next few years.

With over 22 lakh small shareholders, 10 per cent of Nifty’s individual investors were holding Reliance Industries, the country’s biggest firm by market value. The stock jumped nearly 60 per cent to Rs 1,457 on November 1 from Rs 921.10 on December 29, 2017. The domestic equity market has remained highly volatile during this period following Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps for mutual funds, credit crisis in the NBFC sector, general elections, unfavourable announcements in the Union Budget 2019, bleak macroeconomic data and adverse global cues.

More than 10 lakh retail investors held SBI, Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares each as of September 30. Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares have cracked more than 50 per cent since December 2017, while country’s biggest lender by assets SBI has largely been flat.

ITC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, TCS, HDFC Bank and Coal India were among other players in which more than 6 lakh individuals held a stake at the end of September quarter, 2019.

IDBI Capital Markets in October maintained a ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490. Among other largecap players, Emkay Global Financial Services is ‘overweight’ on Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Grasim, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, RIL and United Breweries.


Tables: Number of individual shareholders in Nifty companies
 
 
Among other ‘expensive’ Nifty stocks, industry heavyweights TCS, HUL, RIL, Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Titan Company, ICICI Bank, Britannia, Axis Bank and UPL are among other stocks whose P/Es hovered above their respective industry average as of November 1, 2019.

The P/E ratio measures the relationship of a stock price with its earnings per share.

Analysts say stock investing is never only about financials and there are always some qualitative and future growth aspects to it. “Every valuation methodology has one underlying principle: the value paid today should be justifying future earnings potential,” Abakkus said in a report.

The domestic money manager listed HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Titan, Siemens, Berger Paints and ABB among 27 perceived high-quality expensive stocks, where profit after tax and revenue growth stood at a CAGR of 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, in past nine years (See Table).

“We don’t think anywhere in the world at any point of time, companies have traded at P/Es of 50-100 for 10-15 years stretch,” Abakkus said in the report.



It said penetration levels of most of the products these companies produce are much higher today than what they were 9-10 years back, and hence, the growth over the next few years should be lower than what it was over the past few years.

On the other hand, the number of investors in the BSE Smallcap index stocks remained almost stagnant in last three quarters at 4.23 crore.

The number of individual shareholders in BSE Midcap index companies increased marginally to 1.37 crore at the end of September quarter from 1.36 crore at the end of the preceding quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed on November 1. The figure stood at 1.34 crore on March 31, 2019.

Analysts see more comfort in the second-rung stocks, which have been beaten down badly over the past 22 months. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have cracked 17 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC, says midcap and smallcap stocks are clearly giving more relative valuation comfort and that is where you will end up making more money than the largecaps over the medium to long term.

“We have been suggesting that investors should increase a little bit of allocation towards midcap and smallcap stocks. Even in our portfolios, wherever the investment mandate allows, we have been buying midcaps and smallcaps from across sectors,” he told ETNOW during an interaction."

“Domestic news flow is turning negative and that would not allow the market to sustain at higher levels. Global cues are also mixed and not supportive in the short term. During the day, we saw deep cut in fundamentally weak companies, which suggests the risk appetite is getting over. Technically, we are anticipating further weakness for equity markets.

25,2019-11-18,Bajaj Finserv,"‘Unstoppable’ is the term that can be used for non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, whose shares have rallied 1,318 per cent, the most in the largecap space, in last five years.

This break-neck rally shrugged off everything, from a painful downturn in domestic equities since February 2018 to a major demand slowdown in the economy that pulled down India’s GDP growth.

With more than 20 per cent holdings by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and over 7 per cent holding of domestic mutual funds, the scrip turned out to be the apple of the eye for big investors.

There were many factors at play throughout.

Net profit of the company grew over 40 per cent annually (CAGR) during these five years, while return on equity jumped to 22.60 per cent in FY19 from 19.60 per cent in FY14.

The company’s bottom line expanded to Rs 3,995 crore for the financial year ended March 2019 from Rs 719 crore in 2013-14. JM Financial projects 54.80 per cent profit growth for Bajaj Finance in FY20 and 30.10 per cent in FY21.

Despite a challenging business environment in FY2019, Bajaj Finance signed off the year with 41 per cent growth in consolidated assets under management (AUM) and a 60 per cent expansion in consolidated profits. The company’s cost of fund increased by about 5 bps in FY2019 over FY2018.

“Bajaj Finance (BAF) has a strong risk management framework with a large client base and best practices in terms of measures in keeping strong asset quality confidence. In a declining interest rate regime, BAF has strong pricing power and is better placed to tap growth,” JM Financial said.

Of late, a couple of developments drove the share price to its all-time high of Rs 4,277 on November 6 despite a slump in India’s economic growth rate due to consumption slowdown, which has dampened demand for consumer durables also.

On October 22, Bajaj Finance posted a 63 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,506 crore for the quarter ended September 30. The figure stood at Rs 923 crore in the same period of the previous year.

Net interest income of the country’s largest consumer durables lender grew 48 per cent to Rs 3,999 crore from Rs 2,708 crore in Q2 FY19.

Meanwhile, the company raised Rs 8,500 crore by issuing over 2.17 crore equity shares at an issue price of Rs 3,900 to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Going by reports, BlackRock, Nomura, GIC of Singapore and others lapped up these shares.

Majority of analysts are still bullish on Bajaj Finance. The stock had six ‘buy’, five ‘outperform’, seven ‘Hold’, one ‘Underperform’ and one ‘sell’ ratings as of November 15, data available with Reuters showed.

Brokerage Antique Stock Broking on October 23 gave a ‘hold’ recommendation on Bajaj Finance with a price target of Rs 3,960.

“Bajaj Finance has created one-of-its-kind customer franchise and the journey keeps on getting better with newer products, newer geographies and newer delivery mechanisms. Using its size to its advantage, both on borrowing cost and cross-sell front, operating leverage benefits can continue for longer than we expect.” It said, adding that the current slowdown in the economy could have a rub-off effect on the NBFC and any major price corrections should be looked as opportunity to build long term positions.

With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 55 times, shares of the company are looking dearer against their five-year average of 38.60 times. P/E is a valuation ratio that measures the company’s current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS).

Yes Securities on October 22 gave ‘reduce’ rating to Bajaj Finance.

“In the medium-to-longer term, we expect Bajaj Finance’s AUM growth to gravitate towards 30 per cent YoY considering a large asset base and sustained deceleration in few products. The flexibility in cost structure and rising digitisation in loan origination and collection will help the company in delivering a tight cost/income ratio. Despite assuming an elevated credit cost in FY20 and FY21, we estimate Bajaj Finance to report 45 per cent earnings CAGR over the next two years and an average RoA and RoE of 4.5 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. Valuation is lofty at 6x FY21 P/ABV,” the brokerage said.

Following in the footsteps of subsidiary Bajaj Finance, group holding company Bajaj Finserv (up 777 per cent) stood the second-biggest gainer among the bluechips in last five years. It was followed by Britannia Industries, Biocon, Pidilite Industries, Titan and Reliance Industries which advanced 200-300 per cent between November, 2014 and November, 2019."

One is that definitely there is a possibility of the government giving some kind of a moratorium to the telecom companies on the payment of the Rs 28,000 odd crore AGR dues that they have to pay to DoT. 

Secondly, sanity returns as we are hearing the news that both Vodafone and Bharti would consider a price hike. We do not yet know the quantum but when you see a price hike after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it. 

Most importantly, for a company like Bharti, there is an under-ownership both at the retail and institutional level because of the issues that they were grappling with. There could be a sense of urgency as far as some of the institutional investors are concerned to own stocks like Bharti. 

So, a combination of these factors are playing out. We too have revised our price target upwards to about Rs 440 and we think that the next couple of years are going to be extremely positive for Bharti.


What is happening in Glenmark?We have seen that people have turned positive selectively in the pharma stocks, either because of some revival in the US business or the fact that even the domestic market for some of these companies is huge and after the price controls, we have seen some kind of a stabilisation. We have seen some pharma companies including Sun Pharma, Divi’s Lab and Aurobindo Pharma all going up. 


When you see a price hike in telecom sector after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it.-Hemang Jani
As far as Glenmark Pharma is concerned, the stock has gone up in the last couple of days but our view has been that because of the kind of debt that they are sitting on and the fact that whatever guidance the company had earlier given in terms of growth, the actual performances have been far lower. Recently we have booked out of Glenmark Pharma so we would be more comfortable buying into a Divi’s Lab or a Cipla or a Biocon.


What are you reading into the aviation data? Finally, a positive tick has come in for October as domestic passenger traffic has grown by roughly about 4%. Would you still avoid aviation or could one buy into these stocks?When we look at the aviation sector what has really surprised me is that despite the fact that there are only two or three meaningful players, the growth has come off. Overall, because of Jet moving out of the system and the fact that the market share has gone to Indigo and maybe SpiceJet and Go. We are not able to see any meaningful performances either from Indigo or SpiceJet, even when crude prices are at a more reasonable level. 

Also, post Jet, the prices had really shot up. Insane pricing was prevailing both for the domestic as well as international market. Even when the best of the situation is there in the pricing and crude oil prices, if these companies are not able to report any worthwhile performances, then you know what is the point of trying to give them any sort of a valuation or why would one really want to go for those companies? My sense is because of certain season coming in, you might see good data points etc. but operationally none of these companies have been able to demonstrate the ability to grow EBITDA on a sustainable basis. That keeps us away from the airline space for a while.


All insurance stocks are going higher but nobody is able to tell me why at a time when the private insurance or growth numbers have declined from 20 % to 7-8%, these stocks are rising and how! SBI Life is 76% higher in last one year, ICICI Lombard 50% higher in last one year and ICICI Life , 40% higher in the last eight months?There is a preference for the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) where one can really look at a structural growth story. In terms of the growth rates having come down, I agree with you but given the fact that we have gone through so much of pain for some of the banks and particularly PSU banks and NBFCs, the investors have preferred companies where there is a non-funding exposure. 

Of course, when you look at the insurance sector per se -- be it life or general insurance space -- there is definitely a case for a significant growth from here on and typically the business model of insurance is such that initially for about five years, companies do not make profit, but after that, there is a significant ROE that one can really expect. 

Most of the companies have gone through that curve plus a lot of M&A 2 has happened. This sector overall looks quite promising. We as a house have a preference for an HDFC Life and Bajaj Finserv, because these are the two companies where we are seeing much higher visibility and much better pedigree of promoters etc. We would continue to be positive on those names."
29,2019-11-19,Bajaj Finserv,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."
30,2019-11-20,Bajaj Finserv,"BENGALURU: Fintech company Lendingkart Technologies has announced two key senior appointments as part of its continuing strategy to grow services and outreach - Mohit Bajaj as chief financial officer for the group’s NBFC arm, Lendingkart Finance, and Bharat Aggarwal as the senior vice-president of operations. 

With extensive industry understanding and strong past experience, Bajaj and Aggarwal will further aid the company’s vision of growing its geographical footprint, leadership team, and enabling financial inclusion for MSMEs across India. 

“With the fintech industry and the emerging entrepreneurship spirit in the country growing at a rapid pace, it is becoming increasingly important to fuel this progress and build an exceptional team that will support us in fulfilling our commitment towards empowering MSMEs,” said Harshvardhan Lunia, co-founder, Lendingkart.

Bajaj has spent a considerable amount of time at Media Guru as their group chief financial officer. With an experience of over 17 years, he has also worked with Religare Macquarie Wealth Management, Fullerton Securities and Wealth Advisors, Actis Global Services, Fortis Healthcare, and Dixon in varying capacities. He specialises in corporate finance, business planning, investor relations, treasury management, core accounting and diverse industry verticals.

31,2019-11-26,Bajaj Finserv,"BENGALURU: Bajaj Auto, the world’s third-largest motorcycle company, has invested $8 million (about Rs 57 crore) in bicycle and electric scooter rental startup Yulu. 

As a part of the deal, Bajaj is also going to manufacture customised electric scooters for the Bengaluru based startup. The Rajiv Bajaj-led company, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 92,615 crore, will also consider facilitating the vehicle finance needs of Yulu, through its financial services arm Bajaj Finserv. 

“At BAL, we believe that the two factors of congestion reduction and pollution control will drive the segment of shared micro-mobility in the future. That coupled with the expansion of Mass Rapid Transport System like Metro in large cities will further boost the demand for flexible last-mile connectivity,” said Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, said.

Yulu plans to increase its fleet size to 100,000 electric two-wheelers by December 2020. It currently has a fleet of 15,000 vehicles. The Bengaluru-based company claims to do between 30,000-35,000 rides a day, of which 12,000-13,000 comes from its electric scooters.

In June, Uber partnered with Bajaj Auto to launch UberXS, a new category of rides on its platform using quadricycles called Qute. Interestingly, Uber has also partnered with Yulu, where users can book its vehicles using the ride-hailing major’s app.

“Shared mobility is an ecosystem play. We started working with cities, corporates and citizens to solve for safe parking..metro authorities to solve for public transport..on the private mobility side we partnered with Uber...same way as a part of the ecosystem we needed an OEM, that is where Bajaj comes in,” said Amit Gupta, chef executive of Yulu, said.

Yulu is a dockless, lithium-powered scooter focusing largely on the sub-5 km first- and last-mile connectivity, the same market which Ola backed Vogo and Sequoia, Accel backed Bounce are targeting. 

This also comes at a time when investor interest in two-wheeler startups have continued to remain strong. In 2018, two-wheeler startups raised $2.6 billion across 67 rounds globally, 2019 year-to-date, the number has touched $2.1 billion across 52 rounds to date, according to data collated by Tracxn.

“In the Indian EV ecosystem, electric two and three-wheelers will be the first form factors to scale rapidly,” Anand Ayyadurai, chief executive of Vogo Automotive, which competes with Yulu, told ET. Separately, Bounce, also a leading player in India’s still-nascent mobility space, is also piloting with a fleet of 1,000 EV scooters."

6,2019-12-02,Bajaj Finserv,"Only if YES Bank can prove that bad loans were behind it, one can pay a 2X book or a 1.5X book for it, says Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

The nearly $2-billion fund raising at YES Bank was much anticipated but the market remains curious about the gentleman who has put in the $1.2-billion bid. What is your view?That is true. We would have thought that somebody in YES Bank would find more institutions that were recognisable but I do not want to cast aspersions because we do not know who this gentleman is. Perhaps he is known to have a lot of money. I feel there is not much point in speculating but I feel they may be diluting nearly 50% of the bank because $1.2 billion is Rs 8,000 crore plus and the bank valuation is about Rs 17,000 crore. 

If you have to retain the same price, the valuation of the bank will become nearly Rs 27,000-28,000 crore just by infusion of so much capital. Some part of the funds raised will perhaps go into paying off some of the older loans and then a part of this capital will be wiped out. In that case, you are still valuing the bank at around 1X book without any adjustments at this point roughly. 

It may not actually be very highly priced, considering there are so many uncertainties or a very low price rally. Considering so many uncertainties continue to exist in the book, this makes it more stable and if the money does come, it will be good. 

This should not be a case of somebody putting a bid and then not paying up because that would be disastrous for the bank and for the reputation of the management. Nobody will believe the next time they say they are going to raise funds. that they are actually going to raise funds if this does not go through. I really hope it goes through, for their own sake and even if it does, I do not think this is a very low price to buy the bank. 

Only if the bank can prove that the bad loans were behind it, we will say you can pay a 2X book or a 1.5X book for it.


How do you look at banks and NBFCs? Would you look at companies which are now trading at lower valuations or which have underperformed the market?The finance space is divided a lot. There are housing loan NBFCs and we have seen HDFC outperform everything else there. But they are hardly that, They are a sum of all parts but their housing loan business is also likely to be impacted by the housing slowdown and commercial realty exposure. 

But a company like CanFin is in much better shape and is probably likely to be sold as well, given all the ramifications. So there is a dichotomy over there. CanFin is priced at a much lower price compared to the likes of HDFC. Some of that valuation gap will get bridged because CanFin is actually much better shaped compared to an LIC Housing or perhaps a PNB Housing, where the ALM issues will continue to bog them down and Indiabulls as well.

Although they have gone up in the recent past. They have had some funding problems both in debt and equities. The winners will actually increase market share whereas the losers will lose market share across the financial space. There will be return to some kind of market share by the PSU Banks. 

It will take three more years until they consolidate and SBI is the largest winner in that space. It will continue to make gains with Bajaj Finance or Bajaj Finserv and perhaps some of the other companies. Good companies, which are able to raise debt or even commercial paper at 5.5-5.6%, are the companies that will do really well because the spread between their lending rates and their borrowing rates has increased due to the fall in borrowing rates. 

There are clear winners here and you should bet on the winners. There will be signs when the whole sector itself will start to do well but this is not the time for that. At this point the bet has to be that the winners will win over next year. 


What do you make of the fund raising activity apart from that of YES Bank? Are markets slowly and steadily opening up?There is an institutional demand for sure because Bajaj Finance also closed the Rs 8,000-crore issue. We had Manappuram talking of foreign issue of certain amount of money as well. RBL will raise some money and so would Ujjivan. They are raising about Rs 1200 crore, the market value at 2 times -- the book has got Rs 6,200 crore, which is fairly priced according to me. The issue will largely be about what do you do with the holdings like Ujjivan Holdings where the only thing that they do is own the bank? 

There are clear winners in the financial space and you should bet on the winners. There will be signs when the whole sector will start to do well, but this is not the time for that.-Deepak Shenoy

Now people will actually shift their ownership to the bank itself, rather than keep it in Ujjivan Holdings. So, there is a bit of a grey area over there. I do not think this is so much capital raising per se than the fact that interest has been transferred from Ujjivan Holdings which will eventually be traded at about 40% to 50% discount from whatever they are holding, which is about 80%. 

The fund raising activity in general is a good thing and money is cheap right now all over the globe, including in India, at least for institutional investors. There will be demand for good quality financials. But there are other companies which are supposedly not as good as those that have been able to raise capital. We have heard Piramal being able to raise debt funds, Edelweiss also was able to place a debt issue recently along with a bunch of others.

The market seems to be starting to ease up. Let us just hope that the DHFL resolution happens and it does not cause another crisis which will cause more capital raising issues. Right now, it looks quite positive. 


Would you say it is a given that the central bank would have to reduce rates further in its policy this week?The only thing that prevents them is perhaps onion prices because that shows inflation which may be a problem. But I do not think that is going to be a very deep problem because if you take out food and fuel, the rest is actually seeing a falling inflation. We do not have the November numbers as yet, but we have actually seen a drop in prices. 

Vegetable prices typically tend to go up at this time. So, you will see some kind of a spike but overall it will come down in the next few months. Given that inflation is not a threat and growth has been a serious problem and also that we are having more issues in transmission, banks are continuing to deposit Rs 2 lakh crore plus with the RBI in reverse repo every day, mean they have the money but they are not actually effectively lending it out.

There is a fear in the market about the ability of some institutions and corporates to pay back. The corporate books have become much healthier now and so we really need better transmission of RBI rate cuts to happen. The only way the RBI can do something is to actually force banks to lend and that has not held out well in the past. 

They will have to continue the passive effect of reducing rates on a regular basis and continuing to state that we will keep reducing until the economy recovers or the inflation reaches a crazy number. Both are far from here and if a rate cut come about, I have positions that will benefit. That is a note of disclosure."

NSE Nifty witnessed a volatile session, as it fell to the 11,832 level, but managed to recover in the last hour to close above 11,900. The headline index formed lower highs and lower lows for the fourth straight session, but made a bullish candle on the daily scale on Wednesday.

Selling may halt now, as the index respected its key support area of 11,800 after a decline of 300 points due to profit taking from its lifetime high of 12,158. The index needs to negate formation of lower lows of last four sessions by surpassing 11,923 to witness an upmove towards the 12,000-12,035 zone. On the downside, major support exists at 11,800.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest (OI) was at 11,500 followed by 12,000 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200 strike. We have seen mainly Call and Put writing at 11,900 strike, which indicates a rangebound bias in the range of 100 points. Option data suggests a wider trading range between 11,700 and 12,100 in the coming weeks.

India VIX eased 6.39 per cent to 13.37. Lower volatility could support the index to attract support-based buying with rangebound bias.

Bank Nifty continued its lower highs and lower lows formations of last four sessions, but managed to recover by around 300 points from the support of 31,000 in the last hour. Now it has to cross and hold above 31,333 to witness a move towards 31,500 and then 31,800. On the downside, supports are seen at 31,000 and then 30,800.

Nifty futures rose 0.35 per cent to 11,940. Builtup of long positions were seen in L&T Finance Holdings, DLF, Mindtree, IGL, HDFC and Bajaj Finserv while shorts were seen in Ujjivan, YES Bank, Havells, Heromotoco and L&T.

Analysts’ view
“Nifty formed a dark cloud cover candle pattern on the daily chart, which is a bearish reversal pattern. Now the index has good support near 12,000 and if it manages to hold above this zone, then we may see some recovery, otherwise sharp profit booking can be seen. Immediate resistance is coming near 12,100-12,150 zone” -- Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities“Inflationary pressure and static manufacturing activity impacted sentiment while trade deal optimism buoyed global markets. Global factors are likely to be more supportive in the near term and market anticipates a better economic growth in the coming years, which is giving support in every consolidation. Investors are also keenly waiting for the upcoming GST council meet to get any cues on overcoming revenue shortfall” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

Global marketsAsian peers mostly closed lower as investors’ initial enthusiasm over a phase one US-China trade deal gave way to concerns about the lack of concrete details on the agreement. Japanese shares ended lower as survey showed the manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in December, and at a slightly faster rate. Though, Chinese shares ended higher after the United States and China reached a historic agreement on a phase one trade deal and key Chinese data beats forecasts. China industrial production and retail sales expanded at the fastest pace in five months in November as steps taken by the government helped to boost domestic demand.

“We expect Indian market to stay under pressure in the near-term, as there are no visible positive triggers, which could boost sentiment.

35,2019-12-17,Bajaj Finserv,"The global economy is suggesting that 2020 would be the year of growth and India would be no exception. A lot of measures have been taken for growth and I would be surprised if growth does not return to India, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How would you look now at the auto pack? Merrill Lynch upgraded Maruti but how would you rate largecap auto companies?In my viewpoint, most of the pain in the auto space is over. Now, the revival process is yet to be seen. To me, the bigger possibility going forward should be seen in the commercial vehicles because BS-VI transition is something which people have been waiting for in 2019. As a result, some demand has been postponed. This is a relatively more interesting space. 

Companies like Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland are already indicating that they have a larger amount of orders coming in from the buses segment and once the commercial vehicle segment orders start flowing in, the actual revival could be seen. 

Fortunately, we are seeing some green shoots in the economy. Coupled with a stable global market, we should be seeing relatively better times going forward. We are a little bit more optimistic than before as far as the auto space is concerned. 


Do you think midcaps, smallcaps can make a comeback or would you wait and watch right now?Midcaps and smallcaps are not bad but the inherent classification of into midcaps and smallcaps has prevented the funds from buying these stocks in their portfolios. This classification would mean that they cannot have the stocks in their portfolio till the size of their fund meets a criteria. For example, if a fund with Rs 10,000-crore AUM and 3% exposure, want to take in a midcap, they would not get Rs 300 crore worth of stocks in the market place as far as liquidity is concerned. 

At the same time, the classification itself would prohibit them from getting into such stocks because adding a smaller quantity to the portfolio does not make sense as far as NAV is concerned. I guess corrective actions are required from Sebi. In April 2018, they classified into smallcaps, midcaps and largecaps. They should do away with this kind of classification. At some point of time, midcaps and smallcaps will be in favour as far as the market is concerned. 


What are the top trades that you are going to track?We continue to like the life insurance business and we feel that we will be accumulating the investments in life insurance. We continue to like HDFC Life, SBI Life and Bajaj Finserv where they hold insurance businesses. So that is our pick. 

Private sector banks and corporate banks where the monetisation of assets is a distinct possibility are Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank. It is an opportunity to buy into some of these companies from the investment perspective. 

We continue to like the life insurance business and we feel that we will be accumulating the investments in life insurance. We continue to like HDFC Life, SBI Life and Bajaj Finserv where they hold insurance businesses. So that is our pick.

Some of the IT names did well yesterday. Tech Mahindra, TCS, HCL did well. What are markets trying to factor in?TCS pulled up largely because the selling in this particular counter probably got arrested. I believe that that has led to the buying into other IT counters as well. Generally seen, ahead of results, IT results would start finding favour if the stocks are available at lower levels. That could be one of the reasons as well. 

At the same time, I am observing that majority of the ETFs are allotting money into India markets and they are doing portfolio weight balancing and IT figures in that particular space as well. So multiple reasons for the way the IT pack performed yesterday. I do not think that the fundamentals of IT pack have changed beyond a point. 

I continue to believe that they would see near double digit growth rate in some top line companies but beyond that, I do not see too many fireworks as far as the IT space goes. So yes, at a corrective downside, it becomes a buy opportunity because the allocation of funds in this space is largely coming from ETFs. 


We have seen strength in some of the tech names. Would that be more of a defensive play? Heading into 2020, would some of these traditional defensives -- be it tech or pharma, start to take centrestage?2020 appears to a time when people will come back to growth and not defensives. Up till now, people have stayed with defensives but in 2020, growth would be asked for. 

In the global market, in the US also, we are seeing economic growth. In China, we are seeing growth as well. Europe though stagnated, is showing signs of muted growth. But there is some element of growth there as well. 

The overall world economy is suggesting that 2020 would be the year of growth and India would be no exception. A lot of measures have been taken for growth and I would be surprised if the growth does not return to India. My take would be to buy into the growth investments and not stay with defensives for 2020 strategy."

30,2019-12-17,Bajaj Finserv,"India’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market index is set to rise as the Finance Minister on Friday confirmed implementation of the Budget announcement of increasing the statutory foreign portfolio investment limit in a company from 24 per cent to sectoral foreign investment limit effective April next year, said Morgan Stanley.

“Using the current list of constituents, we expect MSCI India’s weight to rise by about 70 bps (basis points) in the semi-annual index review of May 2020, implying passive flows of US $2.5 bn (billion),” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said MSCI India’s weightage in MSCI EM will go up to 9.6 per cent from 8.9 per cent.

Companies have until March 31, 2020, to reduce the FPI limit through an approval of the board of directors and a special resolution passed by shareholders. Such companies will retain the option to increase the FPI limit to a maximum of the foreign sector limit at a later date.

“Once the FPI limit increases, it cannot be reduced. Thus, unless companies pass board and shareholder resolutions, all companies in India will irreversibly have their FPI limit at the sector limit after 31st March 2020,” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said India’s free float market capitalisation rank has been lower compared to its market cap and GDP rank because of high promoter holdings and low foreign investment limits which has constrained active and passive allocations to India from abroad.

Larsen & Toubro, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, Britannia, Tata Steel, Bharti Infratel, Titan, Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra and Divi's Laboratories are among the stocks that are likely to see the most increase in weightage given the subsuming of foreign limits.

Among the public sector stocks in the MSCI India index, NTPC, Power Grid, HPCL, Petronet LNG, Container Corporation and REC could see an increase in weight.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Holdings, United Breweries, Power Finance Corporation, Biocon, Indraprastha Gas, ACC and MRF are the large-cap stocks in the BSE 200 index that could be included from the subsuming of the foreign limits."

39,2019-12-18,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: As the benchmark equity indices trade at fresh highs, the broader market is seeing a smart recovery, with at least 104 stocks signalling strong momentum on the technical charts.

The list is not exclusive to blue chips and includes second rung scrips as well. The stocks on the list have formed bullish crossovers on moving average convergence divergence or MACD.

Such formations on this momentum indicator hints at possible upsides. Strong trading volumes on many of these counters are adding credence to the emerging trend.

The list included largecaps such as Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel and Bajaj Finance besides SAIL, Canara Bank, PNB, Avenue Supermarts, Britannia, Bajaj Finserv, IGL and Dish TV.







Others included Finolex Cables, MMTC, Aptech, Jindal Saw, Man Industries, SCI and NIIT Technologies

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed 10 stocks are showing bearish trends. They included City Union Bank, Cadila Healthcare, ICICI Securities, Orient Refractories and Bliss GVS Pharma.



Analysts say the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

As for Nifty, Aditya Agarwala of YES Securities says a sustained trade may extend the ongoing rally in the index towards the 12,250-12,350 zone. However, he expects the rally to pause temporarily, if Nifty falls below 12,100.

“The market has events like GST Council meeting and Trump impeachment vote lined up, which can materially alter market direction. It looks prudent for traders to book profit on long positions. As the market heads beyond the 12,200 level, fresh signs of weakness may emerge on any close below 12,070 level,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.


Understanding MACD
 A close look at the stock chart of Tech Mahindra shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown an upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 1.29 per cent higher at Rs 787.25 on NSE."
40,2019-12-18,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: Ever wondered which stocks on Dalal Street managed to be the equivalents of cricketing stars like Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Mr Consistent Virat Kohli in Calendar 2019? 

Reliance Industries, of course, turned out to be the biggest wealth creator, Indiabulls Ventures the fastest and IndusInd Bank the most consistent. And that, not just in 2019, but for the past five years.

These were the findings of the annual wealth creation study published by Motilal Oswal Securities. Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director, has been publishing this study every year for past two decades.

Just like run-machine Kohli’s form has made him the face of Indian cricket, Reliance Industries has become the face of a Rising India, by turning out the biggest wealth creator on Dalal Street. The oil-to-telecom behemoth added whopping Rs 5.6 lakh crore to investor wealth, the highest ever, in last five years. 

A 78 per cent surge annually over the five years has earned the Indiabulls Ventures stock the fastest wealth creator tag, something that can be the market equivalent of India’s topmost one-day cricket bowler Jasprit Bumrah.

IndusInd Bank emerged the most consistent, appearing among the top 100 Wealth Creators in each of the last 10 Motilal Oswal wealth studies. It also recorded the highest price growth CAGR of 49 per cent between 2009 to 2019, ahead of Pidilite Industries’ 40 per cent rise. 



Overall, Dalal Street’s top 100 wealth creators delivered Rs 49 lakh crore to investors between 2014 and 2019 at a pace of 22 per cent compounded annually. It was double the 12 per cent growth rate that Sensex stocks clocked during this period, the study revealed.

49,2019-12-27,Bajaj Finserv,"NEW DELHI: With the economy growing below 5 per cent and government finances seem to be in complete disarray, equity investors in India are in two minds going into Calendar 2020.

Analysts say investors would need to rebalance their portfolios in view of the various risks ahead, including a likely shortfall in the government’s disinvestment proceeds, sharp deterioration in the fiscal situation, rising inflation, drying up of global liquidity and the forthcoming US elections.

The majority of a dozen analysts, who took part in the yearend survey of ETMarkets.com, said their key worries going into the new Calendar would be a possible spike in inflation, a major slippage in the government’s deficit maths, prolonging of the economic slowdown and further deterioration in global trade situation after Donald Trump’s possible return for a second term in the White House.

G Chokkalingam, Founder & CIO of Equinomics Research & Advisory, said he counts any aggravation in global deflationary conditions, Trump winning back US election leading to more protectionism at the cost of other economies, and possible failure of both Indian fiscal and monetary authorities to reverse the economic slowdown among the key risks to domestic stocks in 2020.

“Domestically, investors have high expectations from the forthcoming Budget. On the earnings front, we are building in very high growth for Nifty50 in FY21. Any disappointment in the Budget or a cut in earnings forecast for FY21 could lead to a correction in Indian equities, as valuations are close to previous peaks. Investors can look to buy Put Options before the Budget to hedge underlying portfolios,” said Rusmik Oza of Kotak Securities.

Sunil Jain of Nirmal Bang says concerns may also emerge should socialism become a bigger agenda for the government than the economy, and if there is a disproportionate increase in stress in the SME and retail sectors.

Chokkalingam advised investors to spread their portfolios across a number of stocks, ranging from anywhere between 10 to 20, to reduce concentration risk. One should avoid companies that have high debt, high levels of share pledges by promoters, very high receivables and inventories (as a percentage of annual sales), and poor track good record in the secondary market.



Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities said a sub-5 per cent GDP growth, below-normal monsoon and the prevailing fiscal situation may result in a run on the rupee and on Indian stocks. He advised investors to take some exposure to export-oriented companies and increase allocation to gold and debt.

“For the first half of 2020, companies that are gaining market shares in India and exporters could be good options to ride out the risks. We are recommending pharma as a tactical buy,” said JM Financial.

51,2019-12-30,Bajaj Finserv,"The last five years have seen an influx of new investors into mutual funds, and systematic investment plans (SIPs) have emerged as a popular vehicle for investing savings in equities. Among the diversified, actively-managed equity mutual fund schemes, the ones that delivered the best returns were focused on growth and quality. They invested in companies with earnings visibility, had the flexibility to move across large and midcaps and were overweight on private sector banks. Here’s a look at five such schemes:


Axis Bluechip Fund5-year SIP returns: 15.57% Fund manager: Shreyas Devalkar Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, Reliance, ICICI Bank Assets under management: Rs 9,481 croreA core fund in the large-cap portfolios of many investors, the scheme has been one of the best performers in the actively-managed space. The fund focuses on big Indian companies and has stuck to high-growth companies, with an eye on quality. It has comfortably beaten its peers and benchmark over the last five years, topping the category charts. Being overweight on financials, underweight pharma & healthcare, staying away from PSU banks, and holding some cash in the portfolio have helped the fund emerge as a winner.


AXIS Focused 25 Fund5-year SIP returns: 15.25%Fund manager: Jinesh GopaniTop 3 holdings: Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance IndustriesAssets under management: Rs 8,891 croreThe fund manager has a concentrated portfolio of high-conviction ideas with 25 stocks. Companies that are included in the portfolio have the capability to go through their business cycles without being affected by short-term market volatility. The fund has a core portfolio of 50-60% that consists of stocks which are steady compounders with low volatility, another 20-25% consists of alpha generators bought with a horizon of 18-24 months and the balance 25% is allocated to emerging themes with a long-term time frame.


IIFL Focused Equity Fund5-year SIP returns: 14.71%Fund manager: Mayur PatelTop 3 holdings: ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis BankAssets under management: Rs 476 croreFinancial planners believe this fund suits risk takers eyeing high-conviction bets. The fund manager builds a portfolio of 25-30 high-conviction stocks, with no restrictions on sector exposure. The focus while buying the stocks is on investing in businesses with strong earnings growth, cash generating capital-light business model, high return on capital employed, high return on equity and attractive valuation relative to its peers. The fund is currently overweight on financials, technology and healthcare.


SBI Focused Equity Fund5-year SIP returns: 13.69%Fund manager: R SrinivasanTop 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, SBI, Bajaj FinanceAssets under management: Rs 6,526 croreThe fund manager runs a concentrated portfolio with 20-25 stocks, with the top 10 accounting for 60% of the portfolio. Currently, the scheme has allocated about 60% funds to large caps, and the balance is in mid- and small-caps. Known in its earlier avatar as SBI Emerging Business, the scheme has beaten its benchmark over time frames of 1, 3, 5 and 10 years. Managed by R Srinivasan for the last decade, the fund is benchmark-agnostic and overweight on financials, FMCG and engineering, and underweight on technology and automobiles.


Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund5-year SIP returns: 15.40%Fund manager: Ankit Jain/Neelesh SuranaTop 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI Assets under management: Rs 9,229 croreThe fund invests in a mix of large- and mid-cap companies. It currently has a 55% exposure to large caps and the balance is in mid- and small-caps. One of the top-performing consistent schemes, it does not accept lump sum investments. The money flows into the scheme only through the SIP route. It has beaten its benchmark consistently over periods of 1, 3 and 5 years. The fund management, spearheaded by Neelesh Surana, is a stickler for quality management, strong cash flows and high return rations. Financial planners recommend this to investors using the SIP route with a time frame of 5 years and above."
