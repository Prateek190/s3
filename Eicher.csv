The Nifty50 index had a volatile session on Tuesday. It opened in the positive but failed to hold its gain and finally closed on a flat note.

The index recovered from 10,400 level, but failed to close above 10,450. In the process, it formed an Inside Body candle on the daily scale.

Now, it has to hold above 10,450 to see a bounce towards 10,500 and then 10,550 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at the 10,400 level.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,300 followed 10,400, while maximum Call open interest was at 11,000 followed by 10,600. Fresh Call writing was seen at all strike prices from 10,400 to 10,700 while Put writing was seen at 10,400 and the 10,500 levels. The options band signifies a broader trading band between 10,300 and 10,700 levels for the coming sessions.

India VIX moved up 2.51 per cent to 13.68. The VIX has to hold below 13-12.50 levels to support the overall bullish bias of the market.

Bank Nifty formed a Hammer candle on the daily chart and closed on a flattish note. It has been underperforming the Nifty index and hovering near the 50-day EMA. Now it has to sustain above 25,500 to get stability towards 25,750. On the downside, supports are seen at 25,250 and then 25,000 levels.

The Index saw retracement and paring of gains after testing the high level of 10,503.60. There is a divergence in performance of Nifty even with strongly correlated Asian market like Hang Seng.

Given the kind of consolidation that the market is witnessing, and while referring the F&O data, we feel that it may consolidate, but with an upward bias. The levels of 10,490 and 10,535 will play out once again as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports came in at 10,410 and 10,375 zones.




The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 55.7909 and it continues to stay neutral against the price showing no divergences. The daily MACD stays bullish, while trading above its signal line.

A small black body occurred on the candles. However, this remains insignificant given the present formation.

The pattern analysis show that the Nifty has continued to resist to the 10,490-10,535 zones for couple of times now. It makes one thing pretty evident that that for an upmove to occur and sustain, market will have to move past this resistance area.

Overall, looking at the high correlation that the Nifty enjoys with Hang Seng Index among Asian peers, and the fact that Hang Seng Index has already broken out from its lifetime highs, it makes highly probable that the Nifty may not correct much.

There are high probabilities that the Nifty may just continue to consolidate for some more time, but finally resumes its upmove. However, until the resistance area of 10,490-10,535 is breached on the upside, positively cautious approach is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen building up in Ashok Leyland, Bosch, Eicher Motors, Cummins, TCS, HCL Technologies, Pidilite Industries and CEAT.

The three stocks soared 40 per cent, 65 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively, in 2017. 

Among the FPI-heavy stocks, smallcap firm Hexa Tradex delivered the maximum return in 2017 at 308 per cent. As of September 30 last year, FPIs held 26.85 per cent stake in the company, which is engaged in the wholesale business of cereals and pulses.

The FPI flow momentum is expected to continue in the months to come, as investor outlook on India’s growth prospects remains quite bullish in the backdrop of various reform initiatives taken by the government, says Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Securities.

Rakesh Tarway, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, says interest rate differentials between the developed world and India will determine FII flows in the medium term. In case of an abrupt increase in global interest rates, foreign flows are likely to suffer, he felt.

60,2018-01-15,Eicher,"MUMBAI| NEW DELHI: India’s auto industry is among the world’s fastest expanding, but that fact doesn’t appear to have convinced Volkswagen, Ford, Volvo or Harley Davidson to participate in the country’s mega product-showcasing event — the Auto Expo.

Seven of the top 15 carmakers, three major truck makers and two global two-wheeler majors will not be present at the biennial auto show to be held next month in Greater Noida, a south-eastern suburb of New Delhi.

Muted returns on investment, the lack of major new offerings, the profile of visitors at Greater Noida, and expensive real estate are among the reasons cited by industry executives while explaining the absence of top automakers.

More important, however, is the diminishing appeal of the event, with the Internet robbing the show of its ability to surprise consumers. The proliferation of the Web has made it difficult for automakers to maintain secrecy on product pipelines, plans for which would traditionally be announced at previous editions of the Expo.

“There are no big launches at the auto show... Companies who do not have new models and concepts to showcase have stayed away as infrastructure costs are steep… If you keep aside the top 3-4 car makers, smaller players get lost in the clutter... They do not get the desired voice or coverage,” said an industry executive who did not wish to be named.

To be sure, those not participating would account for less than a fifth of the cumulative market share locally, although the absentee companies are global automotive icons. On last count, about 60 companies are set to participate in the show to be organised between February 9-14. The show will be spread over 47,500 sq metres, with about a tenth of the area earmarked for interactive activities.

Among luxury carmakers, only two of the top five — Mercedes Benz and BMW — will attend the show. Superbike makers Harley Davison and Triumph, too, have opted out. The Volkswagen Group, which has brands such as Volkswagen, Skoda, Audi, Scania, and Man Trucks, will sit out. So will Ford, Nissan, and Fiat Chrysler — brands that had participated in the last edition.

Volkswagen Group attributed its absence to a global review of its event and show strategy that entails major commitments by way of time and planning. Volkswagen will, however, continue its focus and stay committed to the India market, it told ET.

Among two-wheelers, Bajaj Auto and Royal Enfield, which missed the earlier edition, would skip again, instead focusing resources on independent events.




The world’s top two truck makers, Daimler and Volvo, will also be absent. Daimler’s Indian subsidiary Bharat Benz has never participated in the biennial auto show, but Volvo and its joint venture partner Eicher Motors have decided to give it a miss this year.

A minimum of ₹30-50 crore is needed to participate in the auto show, depending on the space bought at the venue. Many believe it is extremely difficult to get a meaningful mindshare of prospective buyers at the auto show. Instead, an exclusive road-show may cost less than half of that spend and companies have access to a meaningful feedback mechanism.

“We reviewed our activity plan in consideration of the various event and show possibilities. For our current priorities and business objectives, we plan to reach out to our target customers through innovative platforms and channels,” Nissan Motor India said.

This is particularly true of commercial vehicles and two-wheeler makers that believe it is more economical to hold media events ahead of the auto show. “It is a car show. … Particularly for commercial vehicle makers, there is no opportunity to interact with the relevant target group,” said an executive at a commercial vehicle manufacturer. The executive added that it made more sense to conduct city tours, and engage with select customers, than spend at auto shows.

Pawan Goenka, MD, Mahindra and Mahindra, is disappointed with the turnout and says that the real estate cost is high, although there is significant value from participating in an event like expo. “One can always debate the returns from an investment like this, but for Mahindra, there is never a question of not participating in Delhi Auto Expo. After all, it is showcasing the might of the Indian auto industry…. Do expect some exciting stuff from Mahindra at the Expo,” added Goenka.

Vikram Kirloskar, vice-chairman of Toyota Kirloskar who has previously been the president of industry body Siam, told ET that he is extremely disappointed with big names missing out. Unclear long-term policy roadmap and frequent regulatory changes made it difficult to introduce new products, and that in turn prevented wider participation, Kirloskar said.

“This is one of the largest Auto shows in the world. I am disappointed to see that people are not participating,” said Kirloskar.

Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for forecasting at IHS Markit, says that India is not a small auto market and that companies should not ignore such a major event."

76,2018-01-17,Eicher,"Select smallcap and midcap stocks created huge wealth for investors over the past five years. While largecaps delivered up to 1,500 per cent return during this period, some smallcaps gave up to 8,000 per cent. 

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex spurted 75 per cent during this period, with TVS Motor soaring 1,486 per cent to Rs 768 on January 10, 2018 from Rs 48 on the same day in 2013. 

It was followed by non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, which rose 1,223 per cent to Rs 1,800 from Rs 136. Vakrangee advanced over 1,200 per cent in the same period.

Other stocks that advanced over 5 times in last five years included Eicher Motors (up 906 per cent), Britannia Industries (up 842 per cent), Aurobindo Pharma (up 606 per cent), Motherson Sumi (up 539 per cent).

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher are positive on Britannia and Aurobindo Pharma with price targets of Rs 5,226 and Rs 877, respectively.

Market experts believe Britannia is on the cusp of significant profit growth thanks to a gradual recovery in volume growth, strong tailwinds from the decline in sugar prices and SMP even as wheat and palm oil prices remained stable and competitive advantage after higher GST rate prompted Parle to increase prices. Sustained gains from cost efficiency programmes in the coming quarters will also boost bottom lines. The company’s product portfolio remained robust and re-launch of Treat has been received well in the market. 

Brokerage Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Motherson Sumi with a target price of Rs 459. The scrip traded at Rs 379 on January 17.

“Motherson Sumi offers strong earnings visibility along with improving capital efficiencies. We estimate the company’s consolidated revenues, Ebitda and PAT to grow 22 per cent, 30 per cent and 33.5 per cent CAGR, respectively, during FY17-20E,” the brokerage said.

Shares of Maruti Suzuki, HPCL, Bharat Forge, UPL, Bajaj Finserv and MRF jumped between 430 per cent and 500 per cent between January 2013 and January 2018.

Motilal Oswal is also positive on the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 11,026. Nirmal Bang Securities has a ‘sell’ rating on HPCL with a target price of Rs 321.

Most of the largecaps on the list have been reporting a rise in bottomline numbers year after year. For instance, Maruti Suzuki’s profit grew from Rs 2,469 crore in FY13 to Rs 7,511 crore in FY17. It posted profit numbers of Rs 2,852 crore, Rs 3,807 crore and Rs 5,497 crore for FY14, FY15 and FY16, respectively.

Motherson Sumi, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Eicher Motors, Vakrangee, Aurobindo Pharma, TVS Motor and Bajaj Finserv have also reported sustainable PAT growth during this period.

The BSE Smallcap and Midcap indices climbed 163 per cent and 149 per cent, respectively, during this period. With 7,980 per cent and 5,925 per cent returns, Avanti Feeds and Fiberweb (India) stood among the top gainers in the smallcap space.

At present, BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are hovering at levels never seen before. Market experts are bullish about further movement in these stocks. 

“We expect volatility to increase in the Indian stock market in 2018, as corporate earnings growth expectations seem to have built in some optimism. On the contrary, with market valuation at around 17 times FY19E consensus earnings, the downside is expected to be limited. We expect Sensex and Nifty to be closer to 37,500 and 11,500, respectively, in 2018,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Securities."

The company also said it will continue to invest in technology and talent in the days to come.

""The last two years have been phenomenal for us; we have grown by 40 per cent in our top line and also in rofits, which is very good,"" Volvo Group India Pvt Ltd President and MD Kamal Bali said. 

Speaking to PTI here, he said ""...I can say that we are looking at between 10 to 15 per cent growth rate CAGR over the next seven to ten years, and that is the rate at which this industry will comfortably grow.""

Pointing out that all the segments that the company caters to were connected with the real economy, whether it is urbanisation which needs buses, constructing roads which need construction equipment or transportation of cargo which needs trucks, he said ""all of these are going to grow."" 

In 2018, the company should grow between 10 and 12 per cent, he said, adding, that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been ""very positive."" 

Volvo Group in India includes multiple business areas and brands such as Volvo Buses, Volvo Penta Engines, Volvo Construction Equipment, UD Buses, Volvo Trucks and Eicher Trucks and Buses, among others. 

Eicher and Volvo trucks are sold via a joint venture company - VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd. 

The company said it has already invested in its facilities and capacity for the next 5 years, and would continue to invest in technology and headcount addition. 

""Over the last twenty years we have invested close to Rs 2,500 crores between us and our joint venture with Eicher... in the last two to three years we have invested another about Rs 300 crore in India,"" he said in response to a question about investment.

Stating that as far as investments are concerned in plant, machinery and capacity, they are already there for the next five years, he said ""but, of course there will be investments in technology and hiring new people."" 

More than 400 people were added last year by Volvo, which will raise its headcount close to 4,000 excluding the joint venture company. 

""We will continue to hire...similar number; about 400 people will be added this year as well,"" Bali said. 

Asked about technology related investment, he said it could be on embedded electronics, telematics or connected solutions at the company's group technology center here where about 1000 engineers are working on design of bus and trucks for the global organization. 

Stating that India will become a major hub for medium duty engines, he said, ""we will build all engines which are 8 liter and medium duty and supply it across the world.""

""We have already setup the plant and have started to supply these engines to Sweden and France. These are Euro VI engines,"" he added. 

Stating that between electric and hybrid there were about 5000 Volvo buses that are plying globally, Bali said in India they had brought in two hybrid buses in Navi Mumbai two years ago and ""they are doing exceedingly well."" 

He said ""We are already observing between 30-35 per cent lower fuel consumption compared to standard diesel bus. This is a process which will happen....we are looking at next steps in this journey."" 

""Our strategy was to start with hybrid which does not need much infrastructure around"" whereas government's stated approach is to go straight away electric. ""...we are ready for both."" 

Bali said the company exports buses and construction equipment from India to South East Asia, ASEAN countries, Latin America, South Africa, Middle East and also France. 

Noting that the company has two brands Volvo and Eicher, one top end and the other mainstream brand, he said, ""we are trying to bring in UD brand for buses, which you will see very soon. UD comes under semi luxury category."""

Shares of Eicher Motors Ltd., which have soared almost 8,000 per cent in the past decade, have hit a sweet spot, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

The stock is down 16 per cent from its Sept. 8 record of 33,483.95 rupees even as the broad market posted a fresh record. Eicher’s retreat has pushed down the valuation to below its five-year average and presents a buying opportunity, according to analyst Pramod Kumar.

While the street took Eicher’s sequentially flattish third-quarter sales as signs of demand saturation for Royal Enfield -- a British wartime motorcycle brand -- the moderation was mainly due to plant rejig and model year change, Kumar wrote in a Jan. 18 note. He added the stock to regional conviction list with a target price of 35,208 rupees, implying a 26 per cent gain from Friday’s close, when it had a market value of about $12 billion dollars.

Demand from ecommerce companies has traditionally been limited to smaller trucks and light CVs used for last-mile connectivity, senior industry executives said. However, in the past few months since GST and implementation of rated load regime, traction from the segment has started spilling over into heavier vehicles as well, they said. The country's largest commercial vehicle maker Tata Motors’ sales to ecommerce transporters have increased 20% in the first eight months of the fiscal year.

Its rival Ashok Leyland, which has several logistics providers to leading ecommerce companies among its customers, said there has been a major surge in sales of 16T and 25T commercial vehicles used for transportation in the ecommerce, parcel and logistics and two-wheeler transportation sectors since September last year.

“All above applications put together, there has been a significant uptick in demand in H2 in comparison to H1of the current financial year,” said Anuj Kathuria, president (global trucks) at Ashok Leyland. “While GST has resulted in better turnaround time and longer operating leads, rated load regime has triggered off an increase in demand of higher GVW (gross vehicle weight)/horsepower vehicles,” he said.




Vinod Sahay, chief executive officer at Mahindra Truck & Bus, said GST will impact and drive demand for CVs in ecommerce sector. “Growing inclination towards hub and spoke model is the driving factor for this segment,” he said.

According to Sahay while ecommerce sector has been preferring 25T long wheel base vehicles with modern technology, better fuel efficiency and reliability, “in the past few months, we have noticed a shift towards 31T long wheel base vehicles by this segment”.Ecommerce still accounts for a small part of the domestic freight industry. But the potential is significant. With the government recently approving 100% FDI in single brand retail and the number of online shoppers projected to increase to 175 million by turn of the decade, some industry executives said the revenue potential of commercial vehicle sales to the ecommerce industry could be $500 million, or Rs 3,195 crore, over the next 2-3 years.

“The logistics sector pertaining to the ecommerce industry in India stood at $460 million in 2016 and is expected to grow at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 48% to reach $2.2 billion (or about Rs 14,057 crore) by 2020,” said R T Wasan, head (marketing and sales), commercial vehicle business unit, at Tata Motors.

“Online retailers now deliver to 12,500-15,000 pin codes out of nearly 100,000 pin codes in the country. With logistics and warehouses attracting an estimated investment of nearly $2 billion by 2020, the reach of online retailers to remote locations is set to increase,” he said.

Analyst estimates on India's ecommerce market vary, but all point to exponential growth with more Indians getting online to buy everything from groceries to highend gadgets and garments from Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal and other ecommerce sites. According to a report by the Retailers Association of India and the Boston Consulting Group, ecommerce market is expected to grow to $50-55 billion by fiscal 2021from $ 6-8 billion now. Commercial vehicle makers are therefore bullish.

“We are extremely confident of (growing in) the ecommerce segment,” said Shyam Maller, executive vice-president (sales and marketing) at VE Commercial Vehicles, a joint venture between Volvo and Eicher Motors."

92,2018-01-27,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Auto sales are improving and that's showing in leader Maruti Suzuki's stock price, which is hitting new highs each passing day.

This is one sector, which is coming out of multiple shocks, such as the cash ban, regulatory changes like transition to BS IV norms, and GST rollout, among others.

Analysts feel that likely sops for agri and rural India may benefit two-wheeler makers and farm equipment firms such as Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motor and M&M.

They see a few restrictions in commercial vehicle (CV) space to increase volumes for CV players such as Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors. Electric vehicles too may get a lift and may influence players for first movers such as Tata Motors and M&M.

The BSE Auto index has gained 22 per cent in the last one year compared with 32 per cent rise in BSE Sensex during the same period.

""We do not expect any changes in indirect taxes. However, we expect higher allocation toward rural-focused schemes,"" said Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities in a note.

The brokerage said that focus on rural markets could place the two-wheeler industry back on the growth path. It is positive on Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motor and M&M.

Motilal Oswal Securities expects introduction of a scrappage scheme, which would incentivise scrapping of trucks older than 10 years. Depending on whether it is mandatory or voluntary, the move could drive 15-18 per cent CAGR for CVs players from around 12 per cent at present. Ashok Leyland and Bosch are plays on the theme.

 Sharekhan expects GST rate on electric vehicles to be reduced to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. The brokerage also expects additional incentives such as exemption of road tax to promote sales of electric vehicles.

Reforms targeted at improving farm income/farm yields coupled with the likely increase in rural allocations would be positive for tractor companies such as M&M and rural-focused companies such as Hero MotoCorp, it said.

Meanwhile, IIFL Wealth Management sees high possibility of extension of custom duty concessions for additional critical components for electric vehicles. It sees reduction in cess for hybrid vehicles to zero, which would be good for Maruti Suzuki and M&M.

There are also expectations that the government may exempt 10-13 seater ambulances from the levy of compensation cess. There could be fund allocation for vehicle fleet modernisation plan by STUs and an announcement of mechanism by which transporters can set off GST on goods transportation with input credit for tax paid on fuel expenses. These expectations have probability rated as 'medium by IIFL Wealth Management."

107,2018-01-30,Eicher,"For long-term retail investors, it makes sense to be with schemes with focus on large-sized companies that have shown relatively better resilience in their financial performance in the December 2017 quarter. One such scheme that has performed well in the past three-year and five-year periods with respect to its benchmark (Nifty 50) is ICICI Pru Focused Bluechip. The scheme invests close to 90% of its portfolio in large companies, while the remaining is invested in mid-sized companies. In the past three-year and five-year periods (annualised returns), the scheme has given 11% and 17% returns, while its benchmark, the Nifty 50, has given 7% and 12% returns during the same period. In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers — S Naren and Rajat Chandak — have bought companies which represent a contrarian theme. The companies have a high earnings growth visibility in the next two to three years given their dominant market share, robust business model, good dividend-paying record and high cash flows from operations. These companies are Eicher Motors, HDFC, ONGC and Asian Paints.

As per Section 10(38) of the I-T Act, gains on equity investment beyond 12 months are exempted from taxes if the securities transaction tax (STT) is paid on the sale transaction. In case of non-equity mutual fund schemes, the duration to qualify for LTCG is 36 months. The long-term capital gains tax (LCGT) in this case is 20 per cent after indexation.

9,2018-02-04,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Dalal Street investors would want to quickly forget the Black Friday, but the bulls will have newer challenges waiting during the week ahead, with RBI policy review and adverse global cues threatening to keep investors on the tenterhooks.

Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty plummeted over 2 per cent on Friday, posting their biggest single day fall in nearly 15 months.

Re-introduction of LTCG (long-term capital gains) tax on equity, concerns over fiscal slippage, profit booking and a global sell-off together broke the back of the bulls, who were, till now, the clear winners in the battle.

The RBI policy review will be the next big event, scheduled for this week. Here is a look at the key events that will steer the domestic market in the coming week. 


RBI Policy meet: The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is slated to meet on February 6 and 7, with its decision due on Feb 7. This will be the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy meet of FY18. Speculations and reports suggest the central bank may tighten its stance, as the government’s fiscal deficit target has been revised upwards to 3.5 per cent from 3.2 per cent projected earlier. Retail inflation rose to a 17-month high of 5.21 per cent in December.

Other reports suggest inflation worries are overdone and RBI may cut interest rate by 25bps in April meet. “We expect RBI MPC to look through the jump in inflation to 5.4 per cent in April-June, which is spooking some parts of the market, as it emanates from the base effect of low 2.2 per cent April-June 2017 inflation,” analysts at Bank of America-Merril Lynch said recently.

“We still expect the RBI MPC to cut policy rates by a final 0.25 per cent in April,” it added.


Budget after-effects: It will be worth a watch how investors react when trading resumes on Monday. Friday's mayhem was knee-jerk reaction as the FM Jaitley delivered the bitter pill in the form of re-introduction of LTCG tax, thus spoiling the mood of investors in a big way. However, commenting on Friday's market fall, Jaitley said profit taking, Asian selloff and confusion over grandfathering were the main culprits behind the bloodbath on Dalal Street.


Next batch of quarterly earnings: Among prominent names, Bosch and Tata Motors will announce Q3 results on Monday, February 5; Hero MotoCorp and Lupin are slated to release their numbers on Tuesday, February 6, while Cipla and Eicher Motors will declare theirs on Wednesday, February 7. BPCL, HPCL, M&M, ONGC, SBI and Tata Steel will announce numbers on Friday, February 9.


Nifty may slide to 10,500 next week

""The pace with which the Nifty50 fell suggests a trend reversal in favour of the bears and, hence, a multi-week top might be in place at the recent high of 11,171, as the index breached critical short-term support points,"" said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. Selling shall get extended into the next week and take the index towards the 10,500 level, Mazhar added. Another market expert, Milan Vaishnav, CMT MSTA, feels the market may still take some time before it fully digests the Budget.


Macro numbers: The performance of India's services sector in January, 2018 will be known on Monday, February 5. The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) Business Activity Index rose to 50.9 in December from 48.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion, while a reading below 50 points toward contraction.


Global cues: The domestic market will take cues from global stocks and tread accordingly. US non-farm payrolls grew by 2,00,000 in January and the unemployment rate stood at 4.1 per cent, while wages saw their biggest jump since the end of the Great Recession, said a CNBC report. Economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting jobs growth by 1,80,000.

11,2018-02-06,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles are set to reach a new high this financial year and continue the growth momentum into next year, with the positive rub-off from the government’s infrastructure push and implementation of GST, as well as strict enforcement of rules against overloading driving demand.

Sales of commercial vehicles in the 16-49-tonne category this fiscal year are set to top the record of 245,000 units achieved in 2011-12, industry executives estimate. In construction equipment, sales are expected to cross the 50,000-unit mark for the first time and be as much as 55,000 units, thanks primarily to the rapid pace at which the country is building highways and other infrastructure.

Commercial vehicle sales, particularly of higher tonnage trucks, are seen as an indicator of economic activity. The strong showing by the sector and expectations among industry executives for the momentum to continue into the next year and beyond bode well for the government, at a time when it is striving to push economic growth with just over a year remaining for polls.


Agencies

“The next two years look positive for the truck industry,” said Anuj Kathuria, head of the global trucks segment at Ashok Leyland, the nation’s second largest maker of commercial vehicles. “The continued expenses on infra, housing and other major projects are bound to create good demand. Schemes such as Sagar Mala, freight corridor construction, smart cities, etc., will require commodity movement, which will drive vehicle demand.”

The drive against overloaded trucks is making operators to purchase new vehicles, said industry executives. Another boon is the scrappingof check posts on state borders after GST created a national market by subsuming several state and central taxes. “Enforcement of overloading restrictions and optimisation of warehousing solutions post GST have prompted large fleet operators to replace older vehicles with modern multi-axle trucks,” said Vinod Aggarwal, managing director of VE Commercial Vehicles that makes the Volvo and Eicher tagged trucks in India. “Sales of medium and heavy duty trucks have already crossed 224,000 units in the first nine months (April-December) of the fiscal year. We should surpass the peak seen in 2011-12.”

GST has made long haul multi-axle vehicles more economical, as transportation of commodities will happen from plants to the market directly, Ashok Leyland’s Kathuria said.

Demand for intermediate commercial vehicles, too, is expected to remain strong with an increase in the need for intra-city movement. Including light commercial vehicles, industry executives expect sales in the commercial vehicle sector to grow 13%, the fastest pace in seven years. A Looking Ahead Conclave organised by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers projected sales to grow 9-11% in the medium and heavy commercial vehicles segment next fiscal year starting April and 10% in construction equipment. Sales of light commercial vehicles are expected to expand 10-12% next fiscal year."

16,2018-02-07,Eicher,"After a few days of battering, the domestic market looks poised to make a comeback on Wednesday, thanks to a dramatic recovery in US stocks in overnight trade and a rise in the Nifty50 futures in Singapore trading. Let’s check out what all might influence Dalal Street all through the day:


Singapore trading sets stage for gap-up openingAt 7.45 am, Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 143.30 points, or 1.37 per cent, lower at 10,639, indicating a gap-up opening start for the Nifty50 in India. ""For most clients, we are advising a wait and watch approach and not to hastily buy or sell,"" said Anirudha Taparia, Executive Director at IIFL Investment Managers. 


Nifty needs to rise above 10,650 level
The index slipped below 50-day moving average of 10,554 on Tuesday. At close, it stood at 10,498, down 168.30 points, or 1.58 per cent. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said the index has been making lower lows for past seven trading sessions. ""Weakness is visible the world over. Till it remains below 10,650, weakness could continue to take it towards 10,400 and 10,350,” he said.


RBI policy outcome today
The two-day policy outcome of RBI's monetary policy committee is due later in the day, wherein the policy makers are expecting to turn a bit hawkish on the policy rate. ""We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to undoubtedly turn more hawkish at its monetary policy meet and lay the ground for a rate hike, possibly at its next meeting. Our base case is a rate hike in 1QFY19 as an inflation- targeting central bank will prefer to act pre-emptively, and raise rates sooner than later,"" said Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. 


Dow sees biggest percentage rise in 2 years
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. The Dow posted a 2.3 per cent increase, its biggest daily percentage gain since January 29, 2016, while the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent, its biggest one-day gain since November 7, 2016, the day before the election of Donald Trump as president, Reuters reported.


Asian markets on recovery mode
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.7 per cent, recouping some of Tuesday's 3.5 per cent fall. That had been its biggest daily drop since August 2015, Reuters reported. Chinese blue chips rallied 1.2 per cent and Japan's Nikkei rebounded 3.1 per cent. The latter had slid 4.73 per cent on Tuesday for its steepest fall in 15 months. 


US bond yields not a problem for stocks
The hardening of US bond yields over the past few days has led to a sharp fall in the markets across the globe. However, empirical data suggests this could be a temporary phenomenon. Data for the last 20-years show a high correlation between 10-year US bond yields, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Sensex over medium and long-term, except for the temporary adjustments due to shift in the flows between asset classes.


Largecaps can be better investment options
For retail investors seeking to navigate the choppy waters, largesized companies appear to be better bets now as appetite for risk assets diminishes in India. Besides having relatively cheaper valuations compared to smaller peers, large-sized companies continue to record double-digit growth in earnings and revenues in the December 2017 quarter, given established business models and greater resilience against business cycles.

18,2018-02-07,Eicher,"Good morning, welcome to ETMarkets Morning Podcast!

Wall Street picked up the pieces with a modest pullback after Monday mayhem. That should come as some solace for the badly bruised local stocks on Wednesday. However, technical charts indicate more pain ahead. Plus we have RBI policy announcement ahead.

RBI takes centrestage today, as it is due to unveil its monetary policy later in the day. It is expected to take a hawkish stand on interest rates, given an uptrend in prices. 

Oil prices rose on Wednesday amid a recovery in global stock markets, supported by a report that US crude inventories fell last week. Brent crude futures traded 43 cents higher at $67.29 and US WTI crude futures were at $63.89 a barrel.

The rupee slid 17 paise on Tuesday to end at a fresh seven-week low of 64.24 against the dollar, unnerved by stock mayhem and heightened global currency volatility.

However, the RBI found it too early to evaluate the impact of the hike in minimum support price for the foodgrains and its impact on inflation.

Although it was widely expected that the RBI will maintain status quo, equity market reacted negatively to the policy outcome and slid down to close in the negative zone, erasing early gains.

""The RBI has maintained status quo on expected lines citing various reasons which can lift inflation in the coming days. In the near term, domestic markets could remain volatile, mimicking global market performance, mainly the US.

23,2018-02-08,Eicher,"Kolkata, the City of Joy, has produced a couple of value investors who are well-known among the investing community. 

Abhishek Basumallick, 41, is one of them. As many of his ilk, this IT professional-turned-investor considers legendary investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger as his idols.

He spotted a couple of smallcap as well as midcap companies early in his life and they have delivered multibagger returns over past 10 years. 

Basumallick claims to have bought Supreme Industries in 2007 at around Rs 24-25. The stock gave him 45 times return, excluding dividend, when he sold it at around Rs 1,100 a few months back. During all these years, he kept adding Supreme Industries shares in bits and pieces.

Basumallick has a bachelor degree of electrical & electronics engineering (BE) from Bangalore University and has done an executive management programme from IIM-C. 

Early into his life, he earned his bread working as an IT professional, but his heart and soul lay in the investing domain.

Basumallick says Robert Kiyosaki's ‘Rich Dad and Poor Dad’ enthused him to enter the stock market. 

“The book resonated perfectly with me. With no business background and very little money, investing was the only option left for achieving financial freedom. The journey started in 2000 and somewhere along the way, it turned into a passion and love for the market. Initially, my major knowledge sources used to be Economic Times and investopedia.com,” he said.

Later on, he started reading Warren Buffett. Being a voracious reader, Basumallick read up everything about him and his investing style. 

Since 2004-05, Basumallick started buying quality stocks at reasonable valuations. “I looked at different approaches, but my instincts are always to go where there is value,” he said.

Commenting on his investment style, Basumallick said he tries to look for companies with a demonstrable track record of earnings, large opportunity size, reasonably ethical management and relatively cheap valuations. 

“Companies with differentiated business models or superior execution skills attract me. I mostly look for stocks with a three-year investment horizon,” Basumallick told ETMarkets.com. 

Some of other stocks he has been holding for some three years now include PI Industries, Hester Biosciences and Bajaj Finance, all of which have more than doubled his wealth in this period.

ETMarkets.com could not independently verify his holdings at present or back then.

Basumallick also claims Cera Sanitaryware, Mayur Uniquoters, Astral Poly Technik, Symphony and Century Plyboards gave him multibagger returns in a range of past five to eight years. However, he has exited these names when valuations got stretched. 

“I keep track of these businesses even today. If Mr Market gives an opportunity to buy them back at more reasonable valuations, I will do so,” he said.

Indian equity benchmark Sensex has corrected some 5 per cent from its peak point in just over a week following worries over a spike in fiscal deficit, a new levy that the Union Budget has imposed on long-term equity gains and also a spike in bond yields globally amid inflationary concerns.

What gives Basumallick the conviction to hold a stock even after getting multibagger returns? If a business continues to perform well, there is no problem in holding it longer, unless valuations become too expensive, says he.

However, the Kolkata investor feels the term ‘multibagger’ is grossly misused these days. “If you buy a quality company at reasonable price and sit patiently, it will inevitably become a multibagger. The idea of sound wealth creation is to identify strong businesses and just sit and do nothing,” he said.

Basumallick has a detailed self-made checklist to judge a business before investing in a stock. The checklist contains such factors as quantitative, qualitative, valuation, promoter behaviour and reasons for past mistakes. 

“I have made it discipline to not buy any stock before going through my checklist. Also, I keep updating this checklist with new learnings regularly,” says he.

As a tip for new investors, Basumallick says a stock is a part holding in a business. If the business does well over time, the stock will do well too. 

“Try to buy stocks in businesses that you understand. Read as much as possible about the businesses and industries, where you are investing to get a better understanding. Read annual reports, magazines, newspapers, trade journals, books on the industry, conference call transcripts of the company and their competitors and global peers,” he prescribes. 

One should also try to keep things simple while investing and not try to go for complicated businesses, which s/he does not understand. 

Legendary investor Warren Buffett once said, “Never invest in a business you cannot understand.”

Basumallick says one should invest with a long term (five years-plus) horizon. But keep checking how the business is performing every quarter. 

“Long-term investment does not mean you invest and then forget about it,” he insists.

Basumallick did have his share of failures, which he now considers the pillars of his success. Basumallick says he failed many times in the past, but that rate has been coming down progressively. 

“My mistakes have been mainly of three kinds, i) where I have not allocated sufficiently when my conviction was high, ii) selling too early and iii) when I ignored an opportunity because I was lazy enough not to work hard on it,” he confesses. 

Basumallick rues missing out on Royal Enfield (Eicher Motors) and Maruti Suzuki in the recent past, also selling Avanti Feeds too early by overanalysing the risks. Shares of Avanti Feeds have soared over 11,000 per cent in last six years.

“Another thing that I do is sell my positions early if I am losing more than what I thought I would. Basically, when I get into a position, I write down what I would do if the stock suddenly spurts or declines, say 20 per cent or so. So, that way, I don’t have any stocks where I have seen any major downside,” he said.

Considering the present market conditions when the benchmark equity indices are hovering near their all-time high levels, Basumallick thinks equities, especially midcaps and smallcaps, are clearly overvalued.

He sees pockets of opportunities for long-term investors in some of the unloved sectors such as pharma, capital goods and cyclical stories like cement (especially south-based players), hotels and metals. 

“But one has to be aware that you are not buying long-term secular growth stories. So there is need for extra vigilance,” he said.

He believes 80 per cent of investing success depends on one’s behaviour. This is an area which very few people talk about. For investors to get good results, it is as important to work on their own psychology as it is to refine their investment process. 

“An investor can be, and most often is, his/her own worst enemy. This is why I try to use my checklist-based approach,” he said.

Being an avid reader, Basumallick prefers reading biographies, histories, behavioural psychology, value investing and market manias. 

Another value investor Hitesh Patel, who has known Basumallick for past five years, said: “Abhishek is a wonderful investor. He usually sees what others miss out. I often interact with him to discuss stocks.” 

Basumallick closely follows Charlie Munger, Howard Marks, Seth Klarman, Peter Lynch, Michael J. Mauboussin, Bharat Shah, Parag Parikh, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Prashant Jain, among others. 

The Snowball, The Most Important Thing, One Up on Wall Street, Beating the Street and Margin of Safety are among his favourite books.

He said Prof Sanjay Bakshi’s writings on investing is must read for all investors, because they inculcate the right approach to thinking."

25,2018-02-09,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity markets are likely to see a gap-down opening on Friday tracking Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX Nifty) and global cues. Here's what brokerages have to recommend for today's trade: 


Vachana Investments

 Adani Ports is a 'Sell' call with a target price of Rs 380 and a stop loss of Rs 415.

Dish TV is a 'Sell' call with a target price of Rs 62 and a stop loss of Rs 75.

ITC is a 'Sell' call with a target price of Rs 262 and a stop loss of Rs 278.


Shrikant Chouhan, Senior VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities
Eicher Motors is a 'Buy' call with a target price of Rs 29,400 and a stop loss of Rs 27,590.

Rain Industries is a 'Buy' call with a target price of Rs 405 and a stop loss of Rs 374."
26,2018-02-10,Eicher,"This week, the market opened in the negative mirroring global cues. A correction in the developed markets was led by the US, where Dow Jones slipped more than 6.5 per cent during the week and erased 10 per cent from the high point, recording the fastest fall in recent times.

The Indian market, too, acted in concert with the global rout. All major markets from Europe to Asia have wiped off on an average 10 per cent of their market-caps, which resembled the orchestrated fall seen during the 2008 global meltdown. 

Quarterly earnings of companies have been showing signs of revival, as the effect of GST fades. A sharp rally, particularly in the pharma stocks on the back of positive earnings reported by Cadilla Healthcare and Cipla, seems to have boosted sentiments intra-week, but eventually the effect faded away. 

Monthly automobile sales volume showed a strong performance for commercial vehicles and tractors. A farmer-friendly Budget and government’s continuous push to increase farm income may result in good performance in the coming months, especially in the tractors segment. The two-wheeler segment also displayed commendable growth.

Eicher Motors reported a 23 per cent revenue growth for December quarter in line with market estimates. The moot question is whether this high growth was caused principally by a low base effect in the wake of demonetization and if it would sustain. Maybe, the market is unwilling to believe and that could be one of the reasons the market is adjusting to lower expectations in the future.

Events of the Week
For the third consecutive time, RBI kept the rates unchanged in the current monetary policy and signaled a hawkish stance. Inflationary pressure is building up slowly and expectation of further rise is a worry. There is an inverse correlation between interest rates and equities. High inflation and interest rates can be a lethal combination to kill the bull market.


Technical Outlook
The violent fall of the week most likely indicates a change in the broader market trend but the same is not confirmed yet. Only a lower top or double top will confirm a change in trend. For the time being, the Nifty50 has found support in the lower trend line and, therefore, it is likely to bounce for a while.
Once the trend line is broken, the market can be said to have entered the bear zone. Traders should ideally wait for the market to settle down, as a matter of safety, periods of such high volatility should be avoided.

Expectation from the week 
In the coming week, earnings of some major companies are expected, but market mood has completely changed, at least for the time being. Howsoever the numbers have been, Mr Market has hammered them all. How the US market recovers and bounces back will be a key factor to watch.

Will the US downtrend continue to grip the entire globe or will this be just a temporary correction which will reverse? The best way to react to such situations is not make any decision in a haste but wait for the bounce to happen.

What will be the depth and breadth of the market during such a bounce will be an important indicator to know whether this would turn out to be a normal correction or the beginning of a larger bear market. The Nifty50 closed the week at 10,454, down 2.84 per cent from the previous week."
27,2018-02-12,Eicher,"Indices logged a second consecutive weekly loss last week and technical experts believe the bearish trend is likely to continue this week as well even as stock indices in the US closed higher on Friday. Rising bond yields in the US have sparked a sell-off in global markets, including India. Indian benchmarks fell 2.8-3 per cent, the worst weekly performance since August 2017. In the US, major indices ended up 1.4-1.5 per cent on Friday but were down for the week. The S&P 500 recorded its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. All this indicates that global markets, including India, are still vulnerable in the short term. Nifty has fallen 6.4 per cent from its record high of 11171.55 on January 29. Technical analysts said 10,350 on the Nifty may act as a temporary halt. Overall, they expect the market to trade in the broader range of 10,200-10,750 in the short term, but with a bearish bias.


NAGARAJ SHETTITECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, HDFC SECURITIES

Where we are: The Nifty saw a sharp follow-through weakness last week and closed the week lower by around 2.84 per cent. A long-range bear candle was formed last week with rare opening downside gap. The formation of opening downside gap as per weekly timeframe is rare and it could be indicating a bearish breakaway gap. Normally, bearish breakaway gaps are formed after a sustained uptrend and they are usually part of important top reversal patterns. Hence, previous week’s high of 11,171 is going to be an important top for the Nifty for the near term.


What is in store? We observe emergence of minor buying from near the key lower support of around 10,350-10,400 levels (20-day EMA and up trend-line). This above-mentioned support could act as a temporary halt in downside momentum in the Nifty around 10,350 levels, but eventually this support is going to be broken on the downside.


What could an investor do: The near-term trend of Nifty continues to be down and a top reversal in Nifty seems to have confirmed as per weekly timeframe. There is a possibility of minor halt in downside. Any attempt of upside bounce is expected to be a sell-on-rise opportunity for the next 1-2 weeks and the downside targets to be watched is around 10,000 mark for the next couple of weeks.


RAHUL SHARMAHEAD – TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES STRATEGY - CENTRUMWhere we are: Our market traded in a broader range in remaining part of the week and eventually concluded the week with a loss of 2.84 per cent over its previous week’s close. This is the biggest weekly loss since August 2017. In the past two weeks, the Nifty washed out the entire work done by bulls in five weeks.


What is in store: After the formation of a ‘Bearish Engulfing’ pattern on weekly chart in penultimate week, Nifty posted a negative close in last week, which doesn’t bode well for the bulls. Also, the call writers were very strong from the past couple of weeks and dragging the index lower. Currently, the Nifty hovering around the ‘100 EMA’, which also coincides with the ‘Horizontal Trend line’ support on daily chart. On oscillator front, ‘MACD’ stays in the negative territory, while ‘RSI’ on daily chart is hovering around its support zone of 30–35. Thus, a pull-back move from current level cannot be ruled out. But considering the weekly chart structure, index is expected to face strong hurdle in the zone of 10,700-10,750.


What can we do: Going ahead, Nifty is expected to trade in the broader range of 10200–10750 in coming weeks with a negative bias. Thus, we are advising our clients to hedge their long portfolios with long-dated Nifty options. At the same time, a few large-cap counters, such as Reliance, Eicher Motors, M&M, Larsen & Toubro and TCS can be bought on some corrections.


ANAND JAMESCHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT GEOJIT FINANCIAL SERVICES

Where we are: In Nifty terms, we have lost about 8 per cent from the record peaks. That compares to about 11 per cent cut during the Sep-Nov 2016 period, and 22 per cent cut in 2015. Certainly, not a significant fall yet in terms of percentage. Unsurprisingly, fear and greed looks evenly matched which reflected in the swift pullbacks every day which saw gap-down openings. Midcaps had lost more, but that is in the nature of the segment. Distribution was visible among midcaps during early January, even while indices were setting newer and newer peaks. VIX, a measure of volatility, had spiked to the November 2016 period when demonetisation was announced, and has henceforth eased.


What is in store: Primary uptrend has not been disturbed as yet, keeping the 13,000 target intact for Nifty. Base-case scenario sees at least an 18-month consolidation with the index heading systematically lower in the next 18 months before the next powerful move higher. Meanwhile, the distribution that was visible in midcaps even as early as early January looks to be slowing down, hinting at at least a relief rally. Such a move should realise in Nifty by way of a push towards 10,900.


What you could do: The coming months shall be an attractive phase for accumulators, and those looking to re-enter hitherto expensive index stocks. Positive on insurance stocks even as US volatility has slowed down recovery in IT stocks."
28,2018-02-14,Eicher,"ET Intelligence group: Consumption is reviving as the effect of demonetisation fades and companies get used to the goods and services tax (GST), with some recording multi-quarter highs in volume and sales in the October-December period, exceeding street expectations.

They include Jubilant Food-Works and Westlife Development in quick service restaurants (QSR), Titan in jewellery, Maruti Suzuki in cars and Page Industries in apparel, among others. The buoyancy has allowed some to raise prices without eroding demand. Meanwhile, personal loans have assumed a bigger share of business for banks.

Jubilant FoodWorks and Westlife Development reported same-store sales growth (SSSG) rose to a 21-quarter high in the October-December period. The total organised QSR industry is around Rs 10,000 crore and is expected to see a compounded annual growth rate of 22% in the next four years. Jubilant Food-Works is the India franchisee for Domino’s Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts.

Westlife is the McDonald’s franchise for the west and south through its Hardcastle Restaurants unit. SSSG growth for Jubilant FoodWorks in the December quarter was 17.8%, compared with low-single-digit expansion in the previous 15 quarters. Jubilant’s orders improved owing to the combination of new customers and repeat orders by older ones.

Westlife Development posted SSSG growth of 20.7% in the December quarter. According to CLSA, the company’s growth was the highest in the QSR industry. The management attributed this to higher footfalls and consumer-led menu innovation. Westlife’s annual report said it had 200 million footfalls in FY17, up 8.1% from FY16.

Titan’s jewellery revenue grew 29% in the first nine months of FY18, with SSSG expansion at 24%. Revenue at Titan’s Eye Plus spectacle unit rose to 23%, the highest in 10 quarters. Titan has guided for revenue growth of 25% in FY18 and FY19. Titan said in a call that its average ticket size has been increasing and growth in new customers outstripped repeat customers.

PC Jeweller had SSSG growth of 25% in the December quarter, which helped it post 40% revenue growth. Apparel sales also reflect a broad spending revival. Leisurewear was the fastest-growing segment in the last three quarters for Page Industries, India’s franchisee for Jockey, at 20% in the October-December period, aided by 13% volume growth and 7% realisation. The company was able to hike prices thanks to positive consumer sentiment.

In the automotive sector, Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors as well as leading battery and tyre makers raised prices by 1-10% in the past three months. Average discounts on cars have been dropping in the past two years as demand improves — to Rs 17,600 in the December quarter compared with more than Rs 24,000 two years ago. Maruti said in the post-December quarter earnings call that enquiry levels had risen 20% from the year earlier."

42,2018-02-16,Eicher,"BENGALURU: The inordinately long time prisoners in India have to spend in jail without being convicted while their trial inches forward has been highlighted by different bodies, from the highest court of the land to non-profits. Now, the philanthropic trusts of Azim Premji, Tata Sons and Eicher Motors are uniting to remedy this, in partnership with national law universities and Maharashtra’s prisons department.

 According to preliminary estimates, the first phase of the initiative will look at helping secure bail for around 2,500 undertrials in Maharashtra, which has one of the largest under-trial populations in the country, over a period of two years. 

The enormity of this problem has been underlined multiple times, buttressed by National Crime Records Bureau data which states that close to two-thirds of prisoners in India are under-trials, or those who have not been convicted. Last October, for instance, the Supreme Court expressed shock over the confinement of a large number of under-trial prisoners in violation of their fundamental rights while the Law Commission pointed out in its 2017 report that “... the powerful, rich and influential obtain jail promptly and with ease whereas the masses, the common, the poor languish in jails.” 

“We’re aware the judiciary is seized of this challenge, as well as the prisons department. We’re trying to see where we can intervene and lend a helping hand for the specific issue of undertrials remaining in jail for long periods,” said Zulfiquar Haider, chief strategy officer of Bengaluru-headquartered Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives (APPI). For this, APPI is partnering with Eicher Motors’ Lal Family Foundation and Tata Trusts, which has been working in the area of criminal justice for over 25 years through Prayas, a social work initiative under the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “This is an important initiative. We need more people to give importance to this work, and were very happy when APPI approached us,” said Shireen Vakil,head for policy and advocacy at Tata Trusts. 

Eicher Motors founder Vikram Lal said the Lal Family Foundation decided to lend it's support because they found considerable merit in the APPI proposal. ""It is well known that we have far too many undertrials in prison. Even those eligible are not getting bail because they do not get quality legal support from the state when they can't afford their own lawyers,"" says Eicher Motors founder Vikram Lal. 

The programme will initially focus on helping facilitate bail for under-trials who are juveniles, face mental health issues or have been in jail for at least half of the maximum sentence of imprisonment specified under law -- all conditions which should entitle them to bail automatically but which, in reality, does not happen. Though the law provides for legal aid, it has not proven effective for various reasons, including poor remuneration. “The judiciary has a system of legal aid but there are some gaps and challenges. We’re looking at how to address this by involving young lawyers as fellows, who would assist the district legal services authority’s empanelled lawyers,” said Haider. 

Under the first phase of the programme, a grant has been issued to National Law University, Delhi, which will select and train young lawyers interested in criminal litigation to assist lawyers who provide legal aid through the district legal services authority. “We are very clear that we do not want to develop a parallel legal aid system. The idea is to provide assistance to legal aid lawyers, just like law clerks assist Supreme Court judges,” said Anup Surendranath, assistant professor at NLU, Delhi, which will be working with prisons in Nagpur and Pune. They were also looking to select local talent interested in criminal law litigation careers and train them, instead of air-dropping graduates from top law schools, he added. Fellowships would also be awarded to social workers through TISS, who would be critical in engaging with prisoners and their families. 

Agreements with NLU (Delhi) and Mahrashtra’s prisons department have been signed, and the fellows will be recruited from May. The programme will later be extended to other states. A reduction in the number of under-trials would also ease the burden on the country's prisons, some of which are functioning at a capacity of over 100%. 

Prior to this, Bharti Enterprises had attempted to help impoverished undertrials through an initiative called Nyaya Bharti, for which chairman Sunil Mittal had announced in November 2015 that he would be taking a Rs 5 crore cut in his annual compensation. The aim was to provide legal and financial aid, and 56 underprivileged under-trial releases had been affected under the programme as of November 2017, according to the Bharti Enterprises website. Haider declined to specify an outlay for the new initiative, only saying that “Resources would be employed depending on the partnerships that emerge. It’s not really cast in stone.” However, the idea, as of now, is not to set aside money for a bail fund but to look at bringing about systemic changes within. “It’s unsustainable for someone else to keep coming up with bail money -- we need to have a bail law that is sufficiently reflective of our socio-economic reality,” said NLU’s Surendranath."

43,2018-02-19,Eicher,"Ramesh Damani, Member, BSE, in discussion with S Naren, ICICI Prudential, Anoop Bhaskar, IDFC MF, Navneet Munot, SBI Mutual Fund and Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC on the state of the market.Edited excerpts:


Ramesh Damani: Is there a bubble situation in the market? Could the market correct 50%?

S Naren: When you are managing other peoples’ money and you have a bubble it is very bad. I would say that we do not have a bubble situation. Having said that, from a sentimental point of view, things have been overextended. I would not call this a bubble yet and so the chance of a 50% correction looks highly unlikely. 

Having said that, can you have corrections from here over the next 12-18 months? It is quite possible. Will you have a 2008 style correction? Certainly not. Are large-caps likely to correct much lesser than small and mid-caps? The answer is yes. I feel that people are underinvested in debt. Based on what I see from a mutual fund point of view, it looks very simple that they should get investors into debt and they have not been investing in debt for the past few years.


Ramesh Damani: S&P earnings are going from $136 to $172 in the next two years. Japan has recorded 20 months of uninterrupted growth, the longest it has; Europe is bouncing back; in America, the animal spirits have been unleashed. Do you really see a bear market or a recession developing with such good economic news coming or has that all been factored in already?
Navneet Munot: So, some part of it is already factored. There are two ways to look at it; on one side, unemployment rate globally is at the lowest level in history. Look at the consumer confidence, the PMI data. The capex cycle is just starting, the fiscal expansion is starting from the US. The tax reforms in US, have brought down taxes. There would be a race to the bottom by most of the other countries and so there are all of these positives. But a part of it is already there. My fear about US and other markets is that in the US, as you mentioned about the S&P earnings, if we extrapolate this quarter’s earnings, it will almost touch 11% of GDP next year and that is the highest in history.

The corporates never made as much money and actually if you add the tax benefit next year from 35% to 21%, the fiscal spending next year actually goes up even more. At some point in time, it is going to create some political backlash somewhere. I think the wages will rise, labour will ask for higher wages and that will lead to probably higher rates and we will have a problem on the corporate profitability side. As of now, it is very difficult for the analysts and the market because the human brain thinks in a linear fashion. You look at the number today and you talk to companies on a bottom up basis and then you add the tax benefit. It all looks too rosy but can corporates get the entire economic pie? 

The interesting part about India is that and it may support the market if we get a little bit of more correction which I think we will get as we are at the other extreme. So, while we have fully participated in the global equity market rally, we have not participated in all the global growth momentum and the profit cycle.


Ramesh Damani: Why did you pick Eicher?
Anoop Bhaskar: We picked it for the wrong reasons. Now one can say that we bought it only for the truck business and we were actually pleading with the management to sell the motorcycle business …


Navneet Munot: Same here, so I mean we had a large bet on Eicher and for a long time we never thought that motorcycle can be so big.
Anoop Bhaskar: Seriously, at around Rs 2500, we sold almost a third of our position and to date I keep on telling that fund manager who gave me that suggestion to lighten up on Eicher saying that this is your cause; you bought it because at that point of time the cash was equal to the market cap and it was a profit making company with a business which was growing at a faster pace and our bet was that it will become the number two company in truck manufacturing in five years’ time, which it never has and never will. So there goes for forecasting or trying to see the future and then the motorcycles came and almost every idiot in India wanted to buy a Royal Enfield and the rest is history.


Ramesh Damani: Are you seeing any parallels between the fall we had in 2007-08 and the fall that we are going through in 2018? 
Nilesh Shah: The 2008 fall was from 21000 to 8000. This one is from 36000 to 34000. If you are calling this a fall, then I am a bit surprised.


Ramesh Damani: Trajectory, does the trajectory look similar?
Nilesh Shah: The trajectory from 36000 to 34000 is a correction, it is not a fall.


Ramesh Damani: No, no, I agree with you. It is a correction in a bull market but a lot of fund managers feel that we have topped out as in 2008. They are anticipating it, I mean that is what we do. We anticipate either it is going to recover or not recover, so what is your view?
Nilesh Shah: One, if we had ability to predict the top, we would have predicted 21000 top correctly. None of us have done that. In fact, at 21000, one very famous broker had predicted 25000 and at 8000 he had predicted 6000. On both sides, he was welcomed by the market. So, let us accept the limitations that we do not have ability to predict future. We have to buy good companies and continue to hold on to them. Bottom up, every single company which we have met in the last three months are talking about better business outlook, capacities are improving in terms of utilization, margins are improving and despite high real interest rates and overvalued currency, the companies which are doing well are looking hopefully to the future. 

We are now in a slightly different conundrum compared to 2017, 2000, top down looking good, bottom up not looking so good, 2018 bottom up looking good, top down not so looking good.

Ramesh Damani: How did the PNB scam happen? How does one walk away with Rs 17000 crore and how worried are you about that? Does SBI have to buy out PNB to finish this saga? Is there any other option left?

Navneet Munot: I hope it does not happen.


Ramesh Damani: It is logical, right, I mean if you think about it?Navneet Munot: I do not think that survival of PNB is at stake. We have seen some of these frauds happening over the years. The scale is bigger but I do not think that depositors will run to PNB and withdraw?


Ramesh Damani: Maybe they should, there is a Rs 30000 crore…Navneet Munot: I mean, the whole industry is owning so much of the AT-1 bonds which are the next after equity. They should get a lot more worried about the tier-1 bonds which some of these PSU banks have issued."

61,2018-02-24,Eicher,"It was November 2017. Goa was warming up for holidaymakers. Beer bottle in hand, wearing his trademark carefree look, Siddhartha Lal, 48, made a surprise appearance on the Vagator hilltop. The managing director of Royal Enfield (RE) was there to unveil his two new bikes — Interceptor INT 650 and Continental GT 650. 

Away from five-star hotels, this was a community unveil, out in the open on a makeshift stage, amid diehard RE fans giving thunderous applause. Goa was the last stop for RE’s highly popular Rider Mania where aficionados from across the country rode down for some adrenaline rush. Reportedly, 10,000-odd RE fans had congregated. India’s motorman was playing both host and brand ambassador for RE, the country’s iconic bikemaker with a cult following.

Lal’s carefree demeanour hides a hardnosed entrepreneur who knows how to combine his passion and business. Under his watch, Royal Enfield has had a dream run. Its sales have surged — from under 50,000 units in 2010 to about 7.53 lakh in 2017. Even better, he has turned around a struggling, loss-making company that was on the verge of closure when he took over in 1999. 



In 2016-17, Royal Enfield chipped in over 80% of the Rs 1,667 crore net profit of Eicher Motors, which had a revenue of Rs 7,033 crore. On the back of its impressive growth, Eicher Motors’ stock (including the commercial vehicle joint venture with Volvo) has sizzled on the bourses, rising from around Rs 600 on NSE in early 2010 to Rs 27,300 today.



Royal Enfield, however, is now facing up to competition. Indian consumers, which were focused on sub 120 cc bikes, are thinking bigger. Mid-sized bikes (250-750 cc), a niche dominated by RE, is getting all-round attention from buyers and manufacturers.

Bajaj Auto, which launched Dominar 400 in 2016, is partnering with British bike maker Triumph Motorcycle to focus on this segment. Hero MotoCorp has identified this segment as a priority. TVS, in partnership with BMW Motorrad, is launching bikes in this segment. 

""Growth in premium and executive segments of motorcycles will outperform the economy. Most launches are happening there,"" says Binaifer F Jehani, director, CRISIL Research.

Already, RE’s 25-30% monthly sales growth has moderated to 17-20%. Analysts are re-rating the company that has had a fantastic ride over the last decade.




""Pricing power that RE enjoys may not be there in the future,"" says Bharat Gianani, research analyst, Sharekhan.

Before his rivals catch up, Lal knows RE has to shift gears, change the playing field and find a bigger game to keep the vroom factor intact. ""In the world of motorcycle, we see an enormous gap. And we see a huge goalpost. We want to create and lead the middle weight (bikes in the 250-750 cc category) market globally, which does not exist. We want to be the global leader,"" he says.

He is quick to add: ""I am a reluctant entrepreneur. I would rather do one thing very well then be mediocre at 100 different businesses."" That has been the leitmotif of his journey at Royal Enfield. Even as a young boy, he was passionate about bicycles and motorcycles. When he became the MD of the Eicher Group in 2006, it had 15 ""mediocre"" businesses. He got rid of most of them, including its core tractor business. 

""For entrepreneurs, revenue and market share run their ego. I was happy to shrink my business, run a Rs 350 crore great company rather than a Rs 10,000 crore mediocre one,"" he says.


London Ride
Lal is now readying RE for its future ride from his spartan home-cum-office in London. He shifted base in 2015, following Royal Enfield’s acquisition of sports product specialist Harris Performance, a UK-based firm that designed and manufactured race bikes for Grand Prix and World Superbike and had customers like Yamaha and Suzuki.

At that time, Lal was suffering from a prolonged period of ill health — a bout of dengue and typhoid, among others — and London offered him an opportunity to shake things up. ""I don’t really love day-to-day operations. I get bored easily. I have to make my job interesting,"" he says.

London allows him just that — to move away from daily operations, give elbow room to his India team and focus on crafting RE’s future trajectory. ""This way, I can do my passion projects and focus on areas like technology, culture and hiring where I can add value,"" he says.

RE now has a world-class tech centre in the UK, which works closely with the India team to develop new products. Meanwhile, Lal, who travels to India about eight times a year, is scouring global markets to expand RE’s horizon. Why did he choose London? Globally, he says, all big consumer brands are the exclusive domain of rich countries in Europe, US and Japan. 

""They know something about building consumer brands. I thought London would be a good base to learn the nuances."" It has also helped shift his focus of thinking. ""My world view is not that India-centric anymore. Once outside, you are forced to think global."" London has helped him build a global perspective around product development and strategy.

He also finds time to read, reflect and ""go on long walks with my dog"". He also gets a lot of family time. He is home when his children, aged 11 and 8, return from school. Lal is a hands-on dad and the good cop between the two parents. Some parenting tip? ""What do kids in such fortunate situations need?"" he exclaims, before answering, ""Right manners and values like perseverance so that they don’t give up easily."" ""I want them to play, have fun, have feelings and relationships, get let down by friends.

It’s a good thing. They should learn to manage life and emotions,"" he says. 

Lal also keeps his worldview updated. ""I frequently get obsessed about things. Right now, it is connectivity,"" he says. So, he reads everything he can on connectivity. Earlier, he deep-dived on business models of companies like Red Bull. ""I don’t idolise anyone. I don’t have many friends in business. But there are slivers and aspects of people that are impressive,"" says Lal, who likes the approach of Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr, Netflix cofounder, in managing people.


Road Ahead
Has the other businesses — VECV Ltd (Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicle) and Eicher-Polaris JV — suffered because of Lal’s single-minded focus on RE? ""If RE wasn’t there, VECV would have been enormously successful. We have grown multi-fold. But the best is yet to come,"" he retorts. 

He thinks the real pivot for VECV will be in 2020 when Euro VI norms kick in. The Eicher-Polaris personal mobility business has been a bit of a struggle, but Lal is giving it a fresh shot with a new CEO and a tweak in business thrust towards a full-people carrier.

RE is, evidently, his favourite child. His strategy to make it the global leader in midweight motorcycle rests on three legs. One, he has to tap into its R&D capabilities in London and India to build a compelling product pipeline while tackling quality niggles. Besides the Classic 350 and Bullet 350, it has the café racer Continental GT, the highway cruiser Thunderbird and the adventure bike Himalayan even as it readies the Twins (twin-cylinder bikes) Continental GT and Interceptor for a global rollout.

Experts flag product quality issues and Lal is aware. Even as he pushes his team to tackle such worries, he says, ""A product delayed by a couple of months (to fix issues) doesn't matter. Think of it 10-15 years from now. Would that matter?""

Two, he is exploring new markets, especially emerging economies in Southeast Asia and South America, to scale up exports. RE already exports small numbers to over 50 countries and set up operations in the US, home of Harley-Davidson, in 2015. His USP?

""With India scale, we can produce and sell mid-weight bikes globally at a compelling price,"" he says. With early experiments in Thailand and Indonesia, RE is ready to scale up its operations with the Twins even as it helps protect its turf in India. ""The rivals have to contend with a player that has scale and a compelling brand proposition,"" says Ashwin Kumar, program manager (mobility), Frost & Sullivan.

Finally, Lal wants to build an entire ecosystem of products, brands, services and experiences to build a sticky customer relationship. ""It is not just about price and scale. We also have the sensibilities and capabilities to build a brand and motorcycle for the world,"" he says. 

In the digital era, products are increasingly about experiences and Lal is building that ecosystem. A range of initiatives has been rolled out - retail stores like Garage Cafe in Goa, interesting rides like the Rider Mania and creation of a tight-knit community. As part of its CSR engagement, RE worked closely with an NGO to organise a trip for its riding community. They drove down to light up a remote village in Leh with solar panels that they carried with them.

""We are not trying to be fashionable. This is who we are. But these things also differentiate us in a market that is increasingly getting commoditised,"" says Lal. 


We want to be the global leader in the mid-weight segment: Siddhartha Lal, MD of Royal Enfield





On Royal Enfield’s future
We are a super focused company. We do a few things but we put all our might behind them to do them well. We want to create and be the global leader in the mid-weight segment.


On shifting overseas
Sceptical about default options in life, shifting overseas helped me pull out of day-to-day operations and gave me think time to focus on crafting our next phase of growth.


On London as a base
All big global brands are the exclusive domain of rich countries. They know something about it. As we try to build a global brand, this is a good base to have.


On Rajiv Bajaj & rivals
I don’t look at them as competitors but extended circle of friends and colleagues. At a personal level, Rajiv and I are close, the kind of friendship you can have with very few.


On parenting
What kids in fortunate situations need are exposure, values like perseverance so that they don’t give up. The should be polite and caring. Have fun, feelings and relationships and learn to manage life.


On updating his world view
Every few weeks or months, I get obsessed about certain topics or projects. It could be Red Bull’s money-making strategy or Formula 1 business model. This season, I am obsessed about connectivity. And I have been reading up on everything I possibly could on the subject."

64,2018-02-26,Eicher,"In a conversation with ET Now, at the Citi Investor Conference 2018, Surendra Goyal, Director & Head, India Equity Research, Manish Shukla, Director, Equities Research and Jamshed Dadabhoy, Citigroup Global Markets discuss whether the present blip is a buying opportunity or should one patiently wait it out. Citi is betting selectively on pharma, gas stocks, auto and finally private banks, where it remains overweight. Edited excerpts:


Give the broader view. What is the message at this Conference -- run for cover or put money to work?
Surendra Goyal: There is a lot more volatility this year compared to last year where we just saw the markets go one way up through the year. So, there is volatility and to that extent, there is more interest. People want to understand if the blip is a buying opportunity or should you still patiently wait it out. 

Interest is high, our view still remains that this is going to be a moderate return year. We expect single digit returns for the market by December of this year which is the view that we have already put out. Globally, our view still remains that this is not the end of the bull market. In fact, we put out an interesting bear market checklist which is saying that only 3.5% out of 18 indicators are flashing red. This essentially means that the bull market has more legs. We are taking the global view and in the context of that, India is still positive but this year is likely to be a moderate return year given the kind of spectacular returns that we saw last year.


When we look back six months from now or may be a year from now, do you think February 2018 will just look like a blip or is this the one time when you really need to reassess your equity allocation because a lot is changing? Central bankers are normalising their policy, bond yields are moving higher. Should we not get carried away by all the global literature which is floating around about bonds doing something and equity doing something?
Surendra Goyal: I try to articulate by saying that we are not really expecting the kind of returns we saw last year but to that extent, people should look at their asset allocation and they should look at what kind of returns to expect. We do not expect returns to be spectacular this year. What we are building in is a 7-8% return into year end, now accordingly, people will have to take a view of the kind of asset allocation to keep it this way.


Manish, you have mentioned that the cost of capital is going to go higher. Yet, you prefer private banks and NBFCs. My follow-up question would be if cost of capital is going to go higher, why do you like banks in general and NBFCs also?
Manish Shukla: If you look at the universe and Indian financial space, private sector banks -- at least the top ones -- have consistently delivered strong balance sheets and earnings growth and whenever they have come to raise capital in the market in the form of equity or raising bonds, investors have been more than willing to give them that capital. 

The distinction between the private bank and the PSU banks just keeps widening with every passing year. To that extent, wherever there is visibility on growth especially in case of banks’ operating profit growth momentum, those are the stocks that we like and that is the reason we believe that private banks will do well. 

Relatively, NBFCs are in a slightly weaker footing given the way bond yields are moving up because the cost of funds will go up. So, last three years, we have seen that everybody, every NBFC has went up probably it is time to distinguish the point that Surendra was mentioning that NBFCs across the board may not necessarily give you the same returns. You need to be a lot more selective in case of choosing NBFCs.


Surendra says that you should keep return expectations diluted. Do you think banks and NBFCs will outperform the broader market or will they also give diluted returns?
Surendra Goyal: If you look at our India model portfolio, we do have private banks as a significant overweight. That is the call that we are taking that these are banks which have been market share gainers and of high quality. Of course, valuations are high because the quality is good and the growth is good. We expect that compounding to continue. We are still taking a call that private sector banks are overweight in our model portfolio.


Do you like corporate banks? We know that the credit cycle has not picked up. Banks are still focussing on the retail piece per se. The retail piece is getting more comparative and some would argue that most of the retail banks are not cheap. Why do you like corporate banks when the higher frequency data points are not indicating a pickup in demand?
Manish Shukla: Our preference for corporate banks is driven by two factors. One we believe that we are probably at the bottom in terms of corporate stress. Incrementally in the fiscal 19 we will see asset resolution and we are already seeing the first 12 names of the NCLT list the top three-four names are very close to resolution. 

Once these resolutions kick in, we will have provision right back and we will have income recognitions coming in which will help your earnings. I am with you that the demand per se is not going to come back in a big way but you have inflation coming back which will push up working capital demand and given the way bond yields are moving, somehow the demand which had moved to the bond market would again come back to bank borrowings. We have seen that inch up in the system corporate loan growth as well. 

We believe that the trend will continue but our thesis on selectively adding overweight position on corporate banks is not premised on growth coming back, it is premised on NPA recoveries and it is premised on your ability to recognise income on NPAs which become standard assets.


I am sure a year ago, when you would have interacted with your clients they must have asked you only word, impact of Patanjali on the consumer staple sector but now for a moment it looks like the worst of the storm for the entire consumer staple sector is behind us because the volume growth for the quarter gone by was not bad?
Jamshed Dadabhoy: If you take a step back, it was good for the quarter for most of the corporates but you have to remember this was a demonetisation quarter. Go back and look at it on a two-year CAGR. Adjusting for the demonetisation quarter, you still have volume growth in the low to mid-single digits between 3% and 5%. It is not spectacular but we are probably out of the woods in terms of the issues that we have seen over the past couple of years. 

Last year, in FY18, GST disrupted things in the first half., before that you had demonetisation which disrupted for the second half of FY17. I would say we have had four quarters of wobbles for whatever reasons and now we are coming out of that phase. Hopefully, things are looking better.


But are the stocks pricing in all the good news? In a stock like HUL or even Colgate, the PE multiples are nearing 40-50 times. These are good businesses but are these good stocks to buy?
Jamshed Dadabhoy: Honestly, we are being very selective. We are not saying that these are good businesses. They have weathered a lot of storm and that will continue but we are not saying that they are good stocks. We do not have buys on both the stocks that you mentioned at this point in time. 
Surendra Goyal: If you look at our portfolio over the last say couple of years, we have generally tried to play the theme through some other sub-segments of consumers. Autos is something we have been positive on. The consumer durables space is again something we have been positive on. What we have been trying to do is play the same thing with stocks where valuations are lower. Within the staple space, I have generally had a big underweight and trying to figure out proxies to play that space so that is what we have kind of had over the last couple of years.


One very powerful call from Citi and you have bene on it is that you do not like IT as a sector and there is a great mention in your report where you talk about high frequency data points which are not indicating that the sector revival is here but when you see a stock like TCS trading at an all-time high, what are the markets missing out on? Are we missing on something or markets are missing on something?
Surendra Goyal: That is a very good question and in fact that is what the big debate has been since the start of this year. You have to keep a couple of things in mind here. While a lot of investors believe that the sector struggled over the last two-three years, it has broadly underperformed every year practically because global growth was slow and it is kind of picking up. 

But the fact is global growth or particularly US growth was not really bad even the last two years. Jobs data has been good for three years in a row and our negative view always premised on the business mix. 

If you look at these companies, they still have a lot of legacy business and that argument still remains unchanged. 

Having said that, there was always this risk because if you look at the end of say, the October, November, December quarter, both foreign investors and domestic investors were biggest underweight on IT. We always knew that if there is a little bit of a hope based recovery people will chase because they are big underweights. You want to cover your underweights because it really hurts performance in the short term and which is what we are seeing play out. If you look at some of the data points which have been coming out, all the companies globally who have guided for this year, are talking of a growth which is similar to last year. It is not materially different. The large US peer which just guided in early February, is talking of a growth which is very similar to last year. So where is the acceleration?

We will really figure things out in April when a couple of the Indian companies also come and guide but at this point, we still think that there is a lot of hope in the stocks and the underweight positioning partly got covered. This is what has driven this outperformance. On the point about stocks being highs, honestly every sector stocks are at all-time highs and IT did play a bit of a catch up in the last two months.


Which sectors do you think are at an inflection point either in terms of earnings or in terms of a market share gain or in terms of industry dynamics changing because the endeavour of any investor is to identify these sweet spots of inflection where markets are not bullish and businesses may be at the cusp of a turn?
Surendra Goyal: To be fair, in India we have had a few good years in the markets. So, it is difficult to say that valuations are cheap anywhere. The sector which has possibly been the most beaten down is pharma or healthcare. Even their valuations are not really cheap in any manner. Our view is in pharma and we are taking some selective stock calls which are a part of our model portfolio where we are saying that yes the sectors has gotten beaten down and some of the franchises which were doing reasonably well have also been beaten down. That is one space which we like. 

On the gas side, there are a quite a few mid-cap plays. Again, this is not really an inflation point but these are multiyear secular businesses where risks are low, they continue to compound at a very healthy pace. Again, on the auto side, we have a few good names, a combination of value and visibility. Those are the kind of pockets where we have a big overweight. Private banks still remain an overweight. Those are the big overweights for this year.


Most of the private banks are reaching the threshold limit for FII investor. Is that the biggest challenge that you like in this sector but – a) it is over owned and b) the existing large players do not want to sell. That does not really create enough elbowroom or headroom for a new buyer?
Manish Shukla: That is an issue if you really think the government will merge the FDI and FPI limits. The limit theoretically is 74%. Foreign ownership is really an issue only for one or two entities but these are reasonably large and liquid names. It becomes an issue only for guys who are benchmarked to indices where these stocks do not necessarily have weight because they have less foreign room. But other than those segments of investors, who are handicapped by their benchmarks, it is generally not an issue yet.


If a client walks up to your office after this interview and say Manish explain to me the entire NCLT process. How will banks benefit? Is this process transformational in nature or will nothing change in FY19? What is your view?The biggest question that we keep getting on NCLT is how is it different this time because over a period of years, we have had multiple laws to address insolvency in India. There is still an element of scepticism and that is the reason we need resolution of two or three large names from the first list of RBI for investor confidence to come back that this process is actually working. 

We actually have a stressed asset resolution panel tomorrow where we have two representatives from ARC, one law firm. We are going to debate those issues but the fact is if you see the way courts have been proactive in giving the verdict, it is not taking a long time. The message from the system is reasonably clear that we want to make this work and once we have the resolution of two or three large names, probably the confidence will come back. But I am with you that as of now, there is still scepticism among investors whether it will work because in the past we have seen that such laws have not necessarily worked.


Up until now, retail has been the great go to space for bankers and for investors. If you bought any retail franchise whether it is NBFC or private banks, you have made money. But I just get a sense that – a) the retail space is getting very competitive and the HFC companies at least the big ones are feeling the heat of some NPAs. So betting on retail do you think from a three-year perspective both in terms of trend and also in terms of cycle could that backfire?Retail as a segment is growing strong. That would probably continue especially as we discussed corporate capex is not there on the horizon. If you look at retail credit penetration in India, we are significantly underpenetrated by any benchmark. 

However, because of competition, the profitability may not be same as what you had seen in the past. While you will see the loan growth, it would be at lower margins. 

The question really is when does the NPA if at all it come and hit us, the beauty of the entire retail credit cycle in India has been there has hardly been any NPA. As you said, there have been some nascent signs right now in housing finance. We will have to wait and see if that actually spreads at the systemic level. What has changed in the last 10 years, since the DeMo crisis to now, is that the credit bureaus are working very well. Credit scores are working. Banks have implemented their internal scorecards and that is allowing them to price the risk better but it is a question of how long does the competition behave in a similar manner. 

So at least the way we stand right now, the NPA issue seems to be in very select pockets. We do not see it as a systemic risk but that is a space that we need to watch out for. But in terms of growth, there is enough room for retail as a segment to grow.


Is there is historical correlation between rising interest rates and auto demand?
Jamshed Dadabhoy: Very loose correlation. There is nothing very significant but I would say there is a very loose correlation and it comes with a lag of probably two years or so. When rates start to rise from the bottom, it is probably a positive sign because it means that the economy is picking up. So the issue that you have on rising rates right now, is not going to transpire into a cutback in auto credit at least for another year, year-and-a-half. It is when inflation starts going up even more, rates have already moved up 150-200 bps, that is when you start seeing a slight cutback in terms of credit. 

The sensitive sectors which typically go first include commercial vehicles followed by auto and then finally two-wheelers because the penetration of financing in two-wheelers is any way is very low compared to the rest of these sectors.


Is it getting difficult now to pick spots in autos because you got Eicher and Maruti on one side, and you have got Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp which are languishing for a variety of factors. You have got Leyland somewhere in between. How do you view things for the auto sector, two-wheelers, four-wheeler or CV?
Jamshed Dadabhoy: We have generally preferred four-wheelers over two wheelers. In our two-wheeler coverage, the only buy we have is Eicher Motors. In four-wheelers, we have a bias on Tata Motors, Mahindra, Maruti. We had buy on even Ashok Leyland till about two-three months ago. We have generally had a skew towards four wheelers and I think that positive bias continuous.


How do you think that the 2018 conference apart from the fact ET Now is covering it is different from 2017?
Surendra Goyal: I am often asked is the interest low? Absolutely not. We have around 300 clients who have already registered here.


Is that a big number from last year?
Surendra Goyal: Yes it would be higher than last year. Corporate participation is as strong as ever. We have two days of meetings here and then we go to Delhi where we have a macro day. We have people from the government, experts, participating. I would say interest is pretty here.


Normally it is said low interest is good news that means bargains are available. If you have a high interest, that means cheery consensus wants to buy Indian stocks. Should not it be the other way round, low interest sometimes is good news?
Surendra Goyal: Yes, low interest is sometimes good news, But then low interest happens when the market does badly for a long period of time, here we are coming of a good year. We finally have some volatility. Market is down 6-7% from highs."

The Nifty50 index continued its weakness for the third consecutive session and corrected towards the 10,450 level on Thursday. The index has been making lower highs and lower lows for last two sessions, and there has been sustained selling at every small bounceback.

The index formed an inverted candle on the daily chart, which indicated that the bears are putting pressure at higher levels. As long as it remains below 10,525 level, weakness could continue till 10,430 and then 10,380 and 10,350 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,550 and then 10,660 levels.

The Nifty50 has been consolidating between 10,276 and 10,637 levels for last 17 sessions and forming contradicting patterns, which is generally a sign of sideways momentum with limited upside.

On the option front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,400 followed by 10,300, while maximum Call open interest was at 10,800, followed by 10,700. Significant Call writing was seen at strike prices 10,800, 10,700, 10,500 and 10,600 levels, which restricted its upside while Put unwinding was seen at immediate strike prices, which created scope for further declines. The option band signified a shift in the lower trading range between 10,300 and 10,600 levels for the coming sessions.

India VIX moved up 1.97 per cent to 14.07.

Bank Nifty opened in the negative and continued its weakness towards the 24,850 level. It formed an inverted hammer candle after forming a Doji on the daily scale, which implied that the bears are holding a grip on the market and putting pressure at higher levels.

Overall candle patterns indicated limited upside and volatile swings for next few sessions. As long as the Nifty50 holds below 25,250, further weakness could drag it towards 24,750 and then 24,500 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 25,350 and then 25,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed with a loss of 0.74 per cent at 10,442. Long buildup was seen in IDBI, NIIT Tech, Bajaj Finance, Voltas, Eicher Motor and IndusInd Bank, while shorts were seen in Torrent Pharma, OFSS, ZEEL, ICICI Bank, Vedanta, SAIL, Hindalco, HDFC Bank, Lupin, Reliance Infra and Canara Bank.

4,2018-03-03,Eicher,"Since the market is not in its prime when it comes to spotting a trend, the best approach to go for is to have a mix of longs and shorts, Chart Advise founder Dr C K Narayan told ET Now during an interaction. Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Does it look like the pressure on PSBs could continue next week as well or do you think there will be an attempt to rebound?Dr C K Narayan: Well, I think there was a mild attempt to rebound already. That is because the long weekend would have prompted short sellers to lock in some profit, take it home and perhaps spend it across this long weekend, too. But I do not see any case here for going long on it. There would have been definitely some people eyeing some bottom fishing in these names, but I do not believe you will see that spillover next week. When the new week starts, approach to these banks stocks may be somewhat tentative. So, I do not believe there will be too much action, but it might not be a repeat of the selling action unless new skeletons really come out of the cupboard.


ET Now: Some recovery came in for some of the beaten-down auto names. Even Maruti after that touch and go moment with the 10K mark aided a smart move in the week gone by. You had some buying coming in for Eicher, and even Tata Motors had its good days in the week gone by. Anything that you would look to buy next week?Dr C K Narayan: Well, in the whole pack, Ashok Leyland wears the best look on the chart and is the most trended. And even today, it is trying to make big strides and was only marginally beaten back at the higher level. Eicher Motors numbers have come in line, but since the stock had got down over the past many many weeks, that is attracting some sort of short covering and maybe, a little bit of value is dropping. 

Tata Motors looks a little bit interesting. The auto numbers have come out quite encouraging, but today’s price action was perhaps not too robust, considering the fact that the overall market itself was quite somnolent. But the way Tata Motors is currently poised on the chart, if it makes a little bit of effort, it can get itself into the Rs 380-390 bracket without too much difficulty. For that, a little bit of support from the market should be sufficient. 


ET Now: For next week, what would be your trading idea and the stocks you would recommend?Dr C K Narayan: Well, with the market not looking overly robust in terms of a trend, we should have a mixed kind of approach mixing longs and shorts. IDBI stands out with its performance for this week. Not just for the week, the monthly set-up on the charts is also quite attractive as against the rest of the banking pack. 

There is something different with this particular stock. That would mean this is a stock to be pursued with a long position. It is trying to get out of a congestion. It is not a one-day, two-day kind of play, but then one will have to maintain some bit of patience. 

But I do think that will be avoided if you were to keep patience with Rs 80 current price. Buy it in that range of about a couple of points here and there. Maintain a stop at Rs 75, a move towards Rs 90 seems likely. 

BPCL could be another stock, for a rally has formed. It's is not very strong at Rs 440 levels. Buy it for a run to about Rs 450-455 during the week. We can mix this up with a short position in Motherson Sumi. There was some press call or an analyst meet which really has not gone down very well. The stock continues to remain pressured at the end of the week in the Rs 320-322 price zone. With a Rs 5-6 kind of stop loss, one can short it for an expected downmove to Rs 300-310."
3,2018-03-03,Eicher,"Market bounced back in the beginning of the week from oversold levels, but closed moderately lower compared to previous week levels. Local and international issues were hotly contested by bulls and bears trying to overpower other’s territory, but none won. The government has given an ultimatum to PSU banks to report all skeletons of fraud within 15 days and this is expected to keep bulls away till that time. But all is not bad for PSU banks. 

Binani Cement lenders will face zero hair cut which has been acquired by Dalmia Bharat for Rs 6,700 crore through the bankruptcy court. Fast track loan recovery mechanism should eventually recover a good part of approximately Rs 6 lakh crore, which are choking the financial system. However, the current pessimism surrounding the PSU banks should slowly turn positive when the recovery bounty begins.

MOIL has increased the price of magnesium ore by 5-10 per cent. NMDC has regularly hiked the prices of iron ore by 25 per cent in the last two months. Aluminum, copper, zinc and other commodity prices are increased every fortnightly. SBI has increased interest rates on all deposits by 0.5 per cent. Local and global inflation rates are on a rising spree, US Treasury bonds are pointing up on expectations of increase in interest rates. All these factors historically are against the equity bull markets. 


Technical outlook
In the last week note, we had mentioned that market will test 10,630 levels which it did during the week, following which the fall accentuated. The market is decisively into a correction of long haul. One more bounce is expected, but irrespective of that, another leg of downfall will begin sooner or later. Market will trade range bound for some time, which is the worst time for traders to participate. 



Expectation from the week
Market is glued on the global state of affairs currently. The domestic economy has kept the momentum at the ground level, February auto numbers prove that. Maruti, Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto posted 15 per cent, 25 per cent, 31 per cent YoY growth in their respective vehicle sales numbers, which are encouraging. This should support a bullish case for the market. 

Comments of the new US Fed chief were nothing but reiteration of the previous policy stance, which has again rattled the bulls across the globe. Treasury yields are slowly falling after a rapid rise, which should offer some solace to the equities for the time being. But if the yields go beyond 3 per cent for the 10-year US Treasuries, then a massive fall is expected across the markets. It is time to be cautious and wait patiently before investing. Profits can be booked at every rise. The longer term trend is under pressure. Nifty 50 closed the week at 10,458.35, marginally down by 0.31 per cent."
5,2018-03-05,Eicher,"Bears held sway last week as benchmark NSE Nifty failed to retake the crucial 10,500-mark. The index slipped to 10,458.35 for the week ended March 1, from 10,491.05 on February 23.

Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan, said, “With a weekly negative close for the week gone by, the pullback looks done at the swing high of 10,631. On the hourly chart, the Nifty has broken lower end of a reverse rising channel. Overall, the set-up looks ripe for next leg down to start off, which can test the recent low of 10,276 and can eventually target 10,070 in the short term.”

Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities

Mindtree | Buy | Target price: Rs 900 | Stop loss: Rs 750The weekly timeframe of Mindtree is indicative of an excellent upside momentum over the last few months. After showing a sharp upmove in the previous week, the stock price has shifted into consolidation last week. The recent consolidation in the stock price could be a temporary halt in upside momentum, and one may expect continuation of further upmove for the near term. Volume is supporting an upmove, and the momentum oscillator like 14-period RSI is showing positive indication. One may look to buy Mindtree at the current market price (CMP) and add on dips at around Rs 775 for the upside target of Rs 900 over the 3-4 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 750.


NIIT Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 960 | Stop loss: Rs 809

The present upmove is expected to form a new higher top of the sequence in the next few weeks. Weekly momentum oscillator like RSI is moving up from near 60 levels, which is indicating an increasing strength of upside momentum in the stock price. The overall positive chart pattern is suggesting a long trade set-up.

DLF | Buy | Target price: Rs 245 | Stop loss: Rs 202This counter has made a decent basing formation for the last five trading session and is positioning itself for a short-term upmove on back of its positive consolidation. Positional traders can go long with a stop loss of Rs 202 for a target price of Rs 245.

8,2018-03-07,Eicher,"Taking to ET Now, Mayuresh Joshi, Angel Broking, says he is positive on both Yes Bank and ICICI Bank and Dewan Housing and Chola among rural focused NBFCs, on any decline, in a staggered manner.Edited excerpts: 

A very interesting note from Credit Suisse says they are maintaining their outperform rating on State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB). On the other hand, Jefferies says that Axis and ICICI Bank have been sharply off highs and they make for attractive buys. Would you say that these private corporate banks like Yes, Axis, ICICI Bank make for a good buy? Further correction is probably not ruled out for the corporate lenders but what you have largely seen specifically for the private corporate lenders is that the loan book has largely become a lot more diverse with aggressive lending happening on the retail side. The stress that you probably saw in terms of reported asset quality issues is slowly and steadily dwindling down. The reported watch lists and the divergence from the RBI list, the provisioning thereof, did take a toll into the excess provisioning that was required and elevated credit costs but my own sense is that these banks are far better equipped to both manage the excess provisioning at their end.

The new NPA norms that RBI has mandated would also have a say in terms of both their provisioning and cost to income ratios but with a large element of capital adequacy ratio, specifically tier-1 remaining strong and the skew towards retail advance growing at a fast clip and at the same time as PSU banks go into the recovery mode, the aggressive lending part for the private banks will continue. So, yes, the next quarter or two, you might see sluggishness in terms of reported numbers but the aggressiveness in terms of advance growth along with stability in asset quality should get reflected. 

So, yes, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank in terms of all key parameters -- whether it is the capital adequacy part peaking off on their credit costs and ROAs and ROEs improving drastically over the next few quarters -- cannot be ruled out. I remain positive on both Yes and ICICI Bank on any decline in a staggered manner.


On NBFCs, some of the brokerages believe that there is not much merit into buying into NBFCs. There is a downgrade from Morgan Stanley on both Inidiabulls Housing as well as Aditya Birla Capital. They are saying that higher rates are a reality right now and not an easy backdrop for NBFC multiples. Do you also believe that there is bound to be EPS pressure on these companies going forward?For a select few companies yes, but you cannot paint the entire sector with the same brush. Having said that, the kind of underperformance that PSUs can actually mete out in terms of advance growth as their entire portfolio shift happens towards recoveries and upgrades, you are probably going to see the NBFC universe and banks with their niche product offerings actually have a very stellar performance over the next two to three quarters. 

The second element becomes their borrowing mix and a lot of NBFCs have a varied borrowing mix composition at this point of time. Banks, NCDs, CPs, you have probably got that mix going in for them. Though bond yields have moved up very sharply over the last few weeks, there might be some constraints in terms of the refinancing for these NBFCs with a time lag. My own sense is that the NIMs should not get impacted significantly and at the same time the loan growth should be quite stable. A lot of the rural-focused NBFCs have actually moved to the 90-day reporting bucket on the asset quality part which actually gives them a lot more stability because their cost to income ratios have started coming down.

The asset quality pressures have started coming down and the natural leverage will create the impetus that the balance sheet requires. Within this entire universe, select housing finance names like Dewan Housing on significant declines is something that we will still continue to prefer with the kind of capital raising that it has done, the leverage that it can create on the balance sheet in terms of advances growth can be stupendous. 

On the other rural-focused NBFCs, Chola Finance is something which I believe can deliver stupendous growth. Asset quality pressures have come down significantly. You have probably seen strong advances growth specifically in its rural financing segment or the home financing segment and even the MHCV/ PV side of the business. So, strong earnings momentum, stable NIMs and again stable asset quality probably holds them out in this entire universe. I will be a little bit selective but a few stocks like Dewan, Chola is something that I will still continue to prefer on declines.


Do you think it is worthwhile to wait it out on Tata Motors or do you say leave it, there are many better opportunities within autos that you can have exposure to?Tata Motors has faced some stress over the past few years. First, the phasing off of their old models, then creating new platforms on the JLR side, they had created a Chinese JV operations which is looking far more stable but the reported numbers in terms of UK JLR sales have been patchy and that leads to a lot of disruptions as far as estimates are concerned. Though valuations might look very attractive, even the hedging policy issues is something that can be a cause of concern and headwinds when you are probably trying to pencil in numbers. 

On the domestic side, improvement has largely been seen both on the PV side of the business as well as the CV side of the business with discounting expected to come down but JLR is something that drives EBITDA for Tata Motors. The market likes growth stories and growth is very evident in stocks like an Eicher and Maruti I think we prefer staying in those stocks and a clear disclaimer we might be owning these stocks in our portfolios. So, for Tata Motors, better times might come but the struggle in terms of reported numbers and volumes might just continue to plague the company and the stock might actually underperform the auto universe over the next two to three quarters."

10,2018-03-09,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: BSE flagship Sensex has come a long way from a multi-year low of 8,160 (on March 9, 2009) nine years ago to a record high of 36,444 this January -- and is still trading four times higher than the 2009 level.

While the market barometer jumped 4 times during the period, select stocks have raced ahead a whopping 763 times. This translates into up to 76,278 per cent return in 9 years.

On Friday, the index was ruling at 33,450 level.

Most of these stocks were smallcaps then, but managed to become midcaps later -- some even broke into benchmark indices. A few are still a ‘buy’ call by brokerages, but chances are slim that the scintillating show of the past will repeat itself.

Let's have some illustrations. Had you invested Rs 1 lakh in Avanti Feeds on March 9, 2009, you would have been sitting on a portfolio of Rs 7.63 crore. The investment in this stock has grown 763 times in the past 9 years. During FY09-17, the company’s revenue jumped 37.73 times. Net profit stood at Rs 224 crore in FY17 against Rs 6 crore loss in FY09.

This processed shrimp exporter is looking to increase its feed capacity by 1,75,000 tonnes annually soon. The company expects total feed sales of 525,000-550,000 mt in FY19, implying 25-30 per cent volume growth. Avanti Feeds is just one example. 

From a market value of mere Rs 174 crore, Bajaj Finance has climbed 35,000 per cent in the last 9 years to become a Rs 94,000-crore company in terms of market capitalisation. The NBFC’s annual sales have grown 18 times while its profit have swelled 54 times annually since FY09. The company management highlighted that the mortgage, rural business, new category expansion coupled with geographical penetration will drive growth for the next 5 years. 

Brokearge JM Financial values this company at 5.1 times March 2020 book value. The brokerage has a 12-month target of Rs 2,050 on the stock, suggesting a potential 24 per cent upside on the stock.

Despite the sharp slide in the Vakrangee stock, it is still up 388 times at 38,764 per cent over the last nine years. Sales rose 13 times, but profit skyrocketed 120 per cent since FY09.

Astral Poly, La Opala RG and Ajanta Pharma are three other stocks that have delivered 20,000-25,000 per cent returns in the nine-year period. 

Mayur Uniquoter has rallied 166 times during the said period. Centrum Broking expects this company to perform well in coming quarters, aided by continued recovery in the footwear segment, higher traction in exports.

“The company’s foray into the PU business and its new plant in Mysore will also add to its growth momentum, albeit in the medium term. Construction work has already started for the PU plant at Morena (MP) and production is expected to start towards the end of FY19. We remain convinced of Mayur’s medium-to-long term growth opportunities,” the brokerage said.

Shares prices of Sundaram Clayton and Indo Count Inds soared 140-150 times since the index hit multi-year lows in 2009. Royal Enfield maker Eicher Motors, with 128 times returns, made it into the Nifty50 club during the period.

""Increased acceptance of leisure biking trend is expected to continue, which would result in continued double-digit growth for 2-wheeler division Royal Enfield. However, moderation in growth rates due to supernormal growth in last 4-5 years coupled with expensive valuation would restrict gains from the stock,"" Sharekhan said.

Poly Medicure, KRBL Johnson Controls, Hitachi Air Conditioning, Natco Pharma, Venky's (India), Balkrishna Inds, V-Guard Inds, Somany Ceramics and Igarashi Motors too returned 7,000-10,000 per cent in the same window."

16,2018-03-12,Eicher,"US President Donald Trump has put the global market on tenterhooks with his aggressive rhetoric on import tariffs. Highlighting the skew in trade balance, Trump has threatened reciprocal taxes on goods imported from countries that impose ‘unfair’ duties on US exports. 

While his ire is mainly directed towards large trading partners like Europe, China, Canada and Mexico, India is also in his crosshairs. How will a full-blown tariff war impact India Inc. and what will be its effect on the stock market? In a series of tweets, the US President recently pointed out that the US had lost $800 billion in yearly trade deficit because of its ‘very stupid’ trade deals and policies. 


Why the US is itching for a trade war 
The country has been running a trade deficit with India for several years.
 Figures are in $ billion
US jobs and wealth are being given to other countries and they have taken advantage of the US for years, said Trump, warning that he would not allow it anymore. Sounding confident of coming out on top, Trump has effectively let out a war cry: “When a country (US) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,” he says. He has already set his plan into motion, proposing 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminium. These increasingly protectionist measures by the US, however, threaten to derail the global economic growth engine, warn analysts.

Trump’s rhetoric has prompted other countries to threaten retaliatory tariffs, followed by counter-threats by the US, raising concerns of tit-for-tat protectionist measures that were a feature of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market expert, feels an all-out trade war will prove detrimental to global markets. “Global economic growth hinges on the free movement of goods. 

If we revert to large-scale nationalism, it could set growth back by a couple of decades,” he says. If this plays out, capital markets will feel the heat. India is ninth in the list of US' trading partners that have a trade surplus. Trade surplus means that we export more to the US than we import from the country. India's exports account for a hefty 15% of US' aggregate trade with the world. Gems and diamonds are India’s biggest goods exports to the US, followed by pharmaceuticals, textiles, fish and petroleum products. 

As of now, these exports are not on the radar of the US, but there is a risk of retaliatory tariffs on these goods. Trump’s clamp-down on steel and aluminium imports will not impact India much as just about 4% of the steel exports flow into the US, while aluminium exports constitute 2% of total US aluminium imports. While the direct impact of higher metal tariffs on Indian firms will be limited, there is a possibility that muted metals demand, owing to cooling off in global trade, will put pressure on prices of these metals. 

Further, there is a chance that unabsorbed steel and aluminium exports from other countries may be rerouted and dumped on Indian shores. This incremental supply in the domestic market is likely to put metal prices under pressure, hurting the operating profits of Indian metals and mining firms, such as Tata Steel, SAIL and Hindalco, among others. “The US trade protection measures will lead to a temporary disruption in a few regional markets as new trade channels open up to cater to supplies left behind from reduced US exports,” says Abhishek Poddar, Analyst, Kotak Securities. 

However, the potential steel mill and aluminium smelter restarts in the US will not significantly weaken the outlook on global aluminium and steel. Especially, given supply side reforms in China in these industries, says Poddar. Trump has also come down heavily on higher import duty on US-made Harley Davidson motorbikes. He previously threatened to slap retaliatory taxes on motorcycles coming into the US from India. 

While the Indian government responded by slashing customs duty on imported high-end motorcycles to 75% from the earlier 100%, and eventually cut it down to 50%, the US President was left unimpressed and made it clear that the cuts were not enough. If the US decides to levy equivalent duties, it could affect USbound exports of two leading Indian twowheeler manufacturers—Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto. The former exports its Royal Enfield range of motorbikes, while Bajaj Auto ships the KTM brand to the US. 

However, the volumes are limited to a few thousand units, with the total value of Indian motorcycle exports to the US at just about $6 million (`40 crore) in 2016-17. As such, tariffs are not likely to create a visible dent on these firms’ profitability, which enjoy a strong domestic demand. India’s IT services firms have been exposed to Trump’s protectionist policies for a while. Tighter immigration laws have affected how these firms hire local talent in the US and has restricted the flow of skilled personnel to the US. As things stand, India is not directly affected by the US actions, but the likely spillover effects could bring the domestic markets under pressure."

40,2018-03-22,Eicher,"China has become synonymous with cheap goods in India. But that can change soon. From cheap toys and phones that gave Indian manufacturers a run for their money, Chinese companies have now started rushing into the Indian automobile sector. 

A few days ago, Chinese auto maker SAIC Motor said it would invest over Rs 5,000 crore till 2025 to establish its presence in the country. It will introduce the Morris Garages (MG) brand in India in 2019. It's a British brand that SAIC acquired from Chinese firm Nanjing Automobile about a decade ago. 

Chinese automobile market is slowing down. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers estimates China’s overall vehicles sales to grow a relatively lackluster 3 per cent this year, the same as in 2017 but significantly below the stellar 13.7 per cent gain in 2016, according to a Reuters report. 

China’s auto market, until recently an engine of growth worldwide, will only deliver “slow and steady growth” from now, Shi Jianhua, the association’s deputy secretary-general told The Wall Street Journal this month. The association anticipates 3% growth in 2018.

The Indian passenger vehicle market is one of the fastest growing — by over 9% in 2016-17 — and is projected to be the world’s third largest car market by 2020. That's one reason why Chinese automakers are looking at India. Of the $278 million Chinese FDI that entered India in 2016-17, 60% was in the automobile sector. 

However, Indian market would not be as easy for Chinese auto companies as it has been for toy makers or smartphone makers. Credibility, quality and after-sales service matter a lot for car buyers. Maruti's hegemony over Indian market through value-for-money products will leave little scope for Chinese auto makers to acquire any significant footprint in the Indian market. 

Yet, Chinese companies cannot be taken lightly. They know how to evolve to quality products as is evident from smartphone maker Xiaomi. Many of Chinese auto makers have acquired stakes in global auto brands which have presence in India. India's massive push to shift to electric vehicles will open up vast opportunities for Chinese companies which have already developed expertise in the new technology as China has become the world's biggest market of electric vehicles. China’s biggest electric-vehicle seller BYD, a joint venture partner of Hyderabad-based Goldstone Infratech, has bagged electric bus supply contracts along with Tata Motors for nine out of 10 cities. 

The two companies have beaten rivals such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and JBM Solaris."
39,2018-03-22,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: India's leading mid-sized motorcycle manufacturer, Royal Enfield, has unveiled its new parallel twin powered 650cc motorcycles in Australia. The company showcased both the Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650 in the country, however, they will be launched first in the UK and European markets.  While both the new Royal Enfield bikes are being manufactured at the company's Chennai plant, their India launch will take place only after April 2018.  The Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650 were introduced to Indian enthusiasts at the Royal Enfield RIdermania last year, following a global debut at the EICMA 2017. The company, however, refused to provide an estimation of their prices for the Indian market.  Like most of the Royal Enfield motorcycles, both of the new bikes are retro styled models. While the Continental GT 650 is a cafe racer -- almost identical to the existing single-cylinder Continental GT 535 -- the Interceptor 650 is an easy-to-ride, relaxed bike like the Triumph Bonneville.  The motorcycles are powered by an all-new 650cc, air-cooled, parallel-twin engine that delivers 47PS of power at 7,100rpm and a peak torque of 52Nm at 4,000rpm. The fuel injected motor also gets an oil-cooler for better performance and dual exhaust mufflers for true parallel twin harmony.  The bikes get features like large 320mm front and a 240mm rear disc brake, adjustable gas charged rear shock absorbers, premium Pirelli tyres and antilock braking system (ABS).  During the unveiling of the bikes Siddhartha Lal, CEO of Eicher Motors (which owns Royal Enfield), had announced that the gap between these new 650cc bikes and the 350cc bikes will be similar to what's between a 150cc and RE's 350cc motorcycles.  The upcoming Royal Enfield bikes are not expected to cross the Rs 3.5 lakh price barrier, and even if it happens, they will still be way cheaper than their respective competitions.  Other twin-cylinder options available in India include the Kawasaki Z650 and its siblings (Ninja 650 and Versys 650) which come with an ex-showroom price tag of slightly over Rs 5 lakh while the Triumph's modern classic starts at Rs 7.17 lakh (ex-showroom) for the Street Twin model."
36,2018-03-22,Eicher,"Tata Motors and a joint venture between Hyderabad-based Goldstone Infratech and China’s biggest e-vehicles seller BYD have bagged electric bus supply contracts for nine out of 10 cities, leaving rivals such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and JBM Solaris empty handed.

Competition termed some of the winning bids as unviable, saying that the two players quoted nearly 30% lower than the market price. The winners exuded confidence though. The development revs up the e-vehicle market in the country.

Goldstone Infratech’s joint venture with Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which is described by many as China’s Tesla, bagged contracts of Bengaluru, Mumbai and Hyderabad to supply 290 electric buses.

Tata Motors emerged the lowest bidder for contracts in six cities — Jaipur, Indore, Lucknow, Kolkata, Jammu and Guwahati — to supply 190 e-buses. Ashok Leyland bagged contract for 40 e-buses in Ahmedabad. The 10 cities called tenders in the last two months in a pilot programme partly funded by the central department of heavy industries.

Delhi is yet to come out with a tender to procure 700 e-buses using state budget, people familiar with the development told ET.




The government is encouraging e-vehicles with its Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme, which provides 60% subsidy to cities to procure e-vehicles either as outright purchase or on supply-operate basis.

Given the different tender conditions in the 10 cities, there was a huge variation in prices discovered under both models, sources said.

Tata Motors placed the lowest bid of Rs 77 lakh per bus for a 40-bus outright purchase contract placed by West Bengal Transport Corp for Kolkata. The company placed bids varying between Rs 77 lakh and Rs 99 lakh for different models. “The price quoted by Tata Motors is an unviable number for many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),” said an executive in one of the auto making firms.

“The Rs 77 lakh bid was a desperate attempt from the company after they lost to Goldstone-BYD in Karnataka,” the person alleged, speaking on condition of anonymity.

At current market rates, similar models could cost between Rs 1.2 crore to Rs 1.7 crore, depending on specifications, industry insiders said. Girish Wagh, president of commercial vehicle business at Tata Motors, however, said the company has a clear line of sight of profitability and remains committed to invest in the sector. He said Tata Motors has been investing extensively in research and development of electric vehicles for past decade.

“We have taken a longterm view regarding electrification as we believe that sustainability and development of full EV ecosystem would hinge on strong participation of local players who invest in end-to-end value chain,” Wagh said.

Goldstone-BYD placed bids as low as Rs 29.28 per km to bag a supply-operate contract for Bengaluru, followed by Rs 36 per km bid for Hyderabad. “This is an aggressive entry pricing strategy,” said another bidder on the condition of anonymity. “I don't think it will make commercial sense for any OEM to sell their bus at this price.”

Goldstone Infratech and BYD could not be immediately contacted for comments.

BYD has grown spectacularly in the decade after Buffett invested $230 million in what was then a little-known maker of mobile phone batteries.

The department of heavy industries had in December 2017 sanctioned Rs 440 crore to 11 states for procurement of electric buses, electric taxis and e-autos as a pilot project under FAME scheme. The sanction was for procurement of 390 buses — 40 buses per city, except 15 buses each for Guwahati and Jammu.

Bengaluru, however, called tenders for 150 buses while the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation in Hyderabad sought bids for 100 buses."
38,2018-03-22,Eicher,"The recent sell-off in domestic equity markets has dragged the NSE Nifty below its 200-Day Moving Average (DMA), signalling that the index is losing momentum. So far this year, the 50-share benchmark has already slipped over 2 per cent to 10,155 till March 21.

More than 30 stocks on the Nifty50 are trading below their 200-DMAs. The list included Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Bosch, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Hindalco, HPCL, Lupin, ONGC and SBI.

Even on the Nifty500, as many as 294 stocks that constitute nearly 60 per cent of the pack, are trading under their 200-DMAs. This shows that the market is facing selling pressure across sectors.

Stocks trading below this crucial support line include names like Aban Offshore, Advanced Enzyme Technologies, Asian Paints, Aurobindo Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Bank of Baroda, Cipla, Colgate-Palmolive, Corporation Bank, Cox & Kings, DCB Bank, Dewan Hosing Finance Corporation, Dish TV, ICRA and NMDC, among others.

Moving averages are a tool for analysing the trend of a stock or even an index. They provide useful information on the support and resistance points.







Usually, any trader or investor uses three major DMAs - Daily Moving Averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 DMA. When a stock is trading above all of its DMAs, it is usually said to be in a continuing uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks are often seen coming off their highs and are slipping below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks testing their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause the stock not only to test 200-DMA but also slip below it.

Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, said, “If any stock trades below its 200-DMA, that means it is undergoing a serious corrective action. However, just because a stock trades below its 200-DMA does not mean that it is in a major bear trend. It just implies it is undergoing a major corrective move.”

Vaishnav told ETMarkets.com: “Bear trend in a stock sets in only if shorter term averages start trading below the longer term averages. As long as 50-DMA trades above 100-DMA and 100-DMA trades above 200-DMA, the stock just remains in a major corrective activity without any bear trend being initiated.” 

The 200-day average, also known as long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for the index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. A 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks.

S H Kelkar, Shree Renuka Sugars, Siemens, SJVN, SML Isuzu, Snowman Logistics, Tata Coffee, Tata Power, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Va Tech Wabag and Vardhman Textiles are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs.

The NSE Nifty index was trading 49 points up at 10,204 in early trade on Thursday. 

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking, said, “We reiterate that traders should remain light within this consolidation and should rather focus on individual stocks with a proper exit strategy. Directionally, the market is still not done with the corrective phase and hence, booking timely profits in existing longs with a short-term view makes a good play for the momentum traders.”"

Steel giant ArcelorMittal, whose bid too was rejected, may also move NCLT.

41,2018-03-23,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The entry of China’s giant e-vehicles company BYD in India by bagging large tenders for electric buses is worrying Indian auto majors but the Union government is weighing their concerns against the benefits of competition, which has led to a sharp fall in prices.

Indian industry executives say the decision to allow a company the size of BYD to participate in the recent tenders goes against the government’s ‘Make in India’ mission and will create jobs in China instead of in India.

Domestic companies said BYD has access to low-cost funds and subsidies from China that pose a threat to Indian companies to scale up manufacturing.

“The kind of pricing BYD has done is not possible without subsidies. More importantly, we are shocked the government is wanting to go entirely with a Chinese player, which is a concern for ‘Make in India’,” said an executive with a Delhi-based auto firm, on condition of anonymity.

BYD’s Indian partner Goldstone Infratech, however, said, “We comply with all requirements and norms under the (government’s e-vehicles) scheme and Make in India framework and are active contributors to the Make in India initiative. Goldstone-BYD buses are capable of running up to 300 km per charge and have longer life cycle, a feat that competitors cannot match. Therefore, we are able to offer much lower/comparable per km cost as compared to competitors. Concerns on subsidies are unfounded as China does not give any subsidies on battery exports.”



A senior government official, however, said localisation of the electric buses of the Goldstone Infra-BYD joint venture is as good as most Indian companies including Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. “The localisation factor of Tata Motors is 35% and that of Ashok Leyland is 37%,” the official said.

“The government has an ambitious plan to shift to e-vehicle fleet without subsidy. Entry of foreign company has brought costs down as Indian firms were earlier offering electric buses at Rs 4 crore. Now Indian companies are matching prices,” he said.

An official with another auto company raised doubts about the viability of low bids and the company’s servicing ability, alleging it only assembles buses here, although the Chinese company denies this. “BYD-Goldstone Infra does not have a manufacturing setup in India. If a corporation is buying huge number of buses, you need to have a solid partner on ground and ready to support you for the next few years. Second, you need to have a network to take care of buses,” he said.

A Goldstone-BYD spokesperson, however, said the joint venture has a manufacturing plant in Telangana, which meets the 35% localisation requirement under FAME scheme.

The Chinese firm had faced resistance in a tender floated by Gujarat transport department for e-buses. The company moved high court asking for directions to the state to alter bid conditions so it is able to participate.

BYD approached the Supreme Court after the high court rejected the plea. The Supreme Court last week disposed of the matter since Gujarat had scrapped the tender and invited fresh bids.

ET had on Thursday reported that Tata Motors and Goldstone-BYD bagged nine of 10 contracts, part-funded by the Centre, leaving competitors like Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and JBM Solaris in the lurch. The winning bids placed by the two companies were nearly 30% lower than the market price. Ashok Leyland bagged a contract for 40 e-buses in Ahmedabad.

The Department of Heavy Industries had in December 2017 sanctioned Rs 440 crore to 11 states for procurement of 390 electric buses, electric taxis and e-autos as a pilot project under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme that offers upto 60% subsidy on e-bus procurement."
42,2018-03-23,Eicher,"Post Budget 2018, Indian stock market has been on a roller coaster ride. In recent times, they have been hovering in the negative territory. This is largely related to the PSU banking stocks that have been ruffled with news flows and developments related to one of the largest PSU banks.

 And this has had a negative impact on the headline indices, considering that the banking stocks, in general and the PSU banking stocks, form a substantial chunk of the same. Small and midcap stocks have also taken a beating in the process, which is a common trait seen with this category of stocks whenever there is any kind of negative news in the market.

 Our stance for investing in PSU banking stocks has been consistent -- taking a ‘better to be safe than sorry’ approach. In fact, we have been maintaining this stance for a while now, as we continue to believe that issues related to them make the fundamentals unappealing despite their attractive valuations.

 Aspects such as poor quality of assets/loans advanced, the instances of mismanagement and the lack of autonomy environment that the banks’ managements operate in make the fundamentals of most players in this space, unattractive.

 These have only impacted the performance of the PSU banking space over their many years of their existence.

 So far, this call has worked in our favour. And we do not see any reason to change our stance anytime soon.

 Looking beyond this space and focussing on the broader market situation at the moment, we expect 2018 in general to be a relatively volatile year compared with 2017, which saw a run-up in stocks across the board.

 As more news unfolds, we believe that the pressure will only increase within the public sector banking space, and thus keep things quite shaky in the near term.

 Over the medium term, news flow related to the elections in key states this year will keep the market on its toes. Not to forget that the earnings numbers will play their part as well, especially at a time when expectations are running quite high.

 As such, investors would do well to brace for volatility in the short to medium term, but make the most of it by increasing exposure in a gradual and staggered manner.

 We say this because the broader situation is not bleak, as the broader fundamentals are unbroken. The fact is that the problem of housing shortage does remain and the need for quality infrastructure in the country is strong. The story of higher consumption and discretionary spends is very much intact. The government’s push towards improving the livelihood of the rural and agri space is real.

 One should always keep in mind that at the end of the day, investing in equities is essentially taking a call on corporate India, and how well it is doing and performing. Therefore, as long as companies grow and do well, equity markets will deliver healthy returns. And with India being one of the fastest growing large-sized economies of the world, it is a market that cannot be (or rather should not be) ignored.

 One may argue that broader valuations are not in the favourable zone. But simply going by history, one can infer that there are many stocks that have been massive wealth creators in short span of time. Despite one having invested in these stocks at the peak of the market before the 2008 crisis, one would have made good money over time.

 Some prominent examples include names such as Page Industries, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints or Balkrishna industries – all of which have moved up multifold in the decade gone by.

 Apart from having been multibaggers, what else is common amongst these stocks? Well, they are companies, which have seen strong growth, have above average return ratios, are compounding machines and possess good pricing power. This in itself is a combination that one can follow.

 At the end of the day, the fact remains that there is no close competition when it comes to equities being the best asset class to invest in for wealth creation over the long term. And thus having exposure to this asset class is a must. But goes without saying, should be in conjunction with one’s risk profile, of course."
43,2018-03-24,Eicher,"As the factory to the world, China helps the average Indian consumer fill her shopping cart. Yet, the Made-in-China label often causes the nose to wrinkle when the product is weighed on the fulcrum of durability. Therefore, it might come as a major surprise to auto buyers in India that vital components in their cars and bikes – the most durable and expensive consumer products sold – have their origins in our giant northern neighbour that now sells more automobiles than the US. And the range extends from the spartan to the sublime.

Much of the sourcing traces its origins to global M&A. In the most recent such deal, Li Shufu, the chairman of Chinese automaker Geely, a Chinese multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, acquired a 9.69% stake in Daimler, the German automobile major that has a strong presence in India.

Daimler’s Mercedes Benz India is the country’s largest luxury car brand, while Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV) is also a formidable player with Bharat Benz trucks and buses. The $9-billion stake purchase by the Geely chairman is making him the biggest-single shareholder in the group, with a strong say in decision making.

Geely had already made its indirect entry into India with the acquisition of Swedish passenger car company Volvo Cars in 2010. It acquired one of the world’s ‘safest car’ manufacturers from Ford for $1.3 billion in cash and issued $200 million notes payable to the American company. Hence, it is a myth that a Chinese-owned car is yet to debut on Indian roads!


NICHE PLAYER
Volvo Cars has been in India for long and operating in a niche luxury segment. Looking at the mega trend in the automobile space, Volvo Cars is planning globally to launch all new models after 2019. Reports suggest that Geely’s latest move of buying a stake in Daimler is mainly motivated at strengthening its presence in the electric vehicles (EV) space. Even now, most local EVs have their components imported from China.

Last year, Geely invested $3.9 billion to become the biggest shareholder of Volvo -- a leading truck and bus maker. Volvo has a joint venture with Eicher Motors and it also sells high-end trucks and buses independently in India. Geely has also shown its interest in coming to India directly.

In 2005, China’s Qianjiang Group Co bought Italian bike maker Benelli, and a few years ago, the Chinese Group signed a joint venture with Pune-based DSK Motowheel for selling Benelli bikes in the country. Currently, Benelli sells premium bikes at prices ranging between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 12 lakh.

Similarly, Chinese electric bus maker BYD is setting up a plant in India with an investment of Rs 200 crore, partnering the Hyderabad-based Gold Stone Group and the Indian entity is called Goldstone Infratech. Sales have begun.

Goldstone Infratech recently supplied 25 electric buses to Himachal Pradesh Transport Corporation, and it has bagged other contracts. One bus costs at least Rs 2 crore and about 75% of the components are now imported from China or elsewhere by BYD.

BYD Company, the parent company of YD Auto Industry, a public listed company, is one of the top 500 Chinese enterprises with interest in automobile, new energy and light rail. Earlier, it had supplied 12-metre low-floor AC electric to Chandigarh Transport.

China’s largest automaker and General Motors’ (GM) partner in China, SAIC Motor Corp, has already started a fully-owned car company locally, MG Motor India. SAIC Motor Corp is setting up a factory at Halol in Gujarat with an investment of Rs 2,000 crore. This facility was earlier with GM. The first SAIc product, an SUV, is expected to roll out in 2019. SAIC sells more than 6.5 million vehicles annually around the world.

Recent ly, Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Groupowned SEG Automotive bought the starter motor and generator business divisions of the Bosch Group that has a strong market presence in India. For this deal, India’s leading component maker Motherson Sumi System was also in the fray.

The acquisition of troubled airbag and safety parts maker Takata by Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp further strengthens China’s hold in the India OEM supplier space. Takata has a strong base in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Ningbo Joyson reportedly made this deal through its 100 per cent-owned American entity Key Safety Systems.





WIDENING TRADE GAP
Such deals would further stretch the Indo-China bilateral trade deficit. Last year, the Indo-China bilateral trade reached its highest at $84.44 billion, with India’s exports to China at $16.34 billion, compared with imports at $68.10 billion. The difference totals about 70% of the country’s total crude oil import bill of $72 billion.

The inequality further widens in the automotive sector. China exported auto parts worth $3.95 billion to India in April-Feb 2018, while India’s dispatch of auto parts to China stood at $295 million. Chinese imports of auto parts were at $2.6 billion in FY14.




The Make in India programme aims to raise the contribution of the manufacturing sector to 25% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025.

Currently, manufacturing adds only 17% to the India’s GDP. The automotive industry commands 22% of the country’s manufacturing GDP and 7% to India’s overall GDP.

The industry has a major bearing on safety. Every hour, 17 people die due to accidents in India, which is one of the highest rates of fatality in the world. “The biggest concern is on the safety of the vehicle due to the quality of the auto parts coming to India, especially from China…With increasing stakes by Chinese vendors, the situation is going to be further challenging,” said Vinnie Mehta, director general of Auto Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA). In the last study conducted by industry groupings SIAM & ACMA, more than 30% of the total aftermarket auto parts were found to be spurious.

Tyres too have a distinct Chinese tread. Of the 115 BIS licenses given for selling tyres in India, 36 are to Chinese companies. The import of automotive tyres from China surged more than three-fold from Rs 582.86 crore in FY14 to Rs 1,650.01 crore, said Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association (ATMA).



In FY17, China accounted for 89% of the TBR tyres imported into India, cornering 23% share in the total TBR tyres market. Imports continue to cater largely to the replacement market.

“Import of Chinese tyres, particularly TBR tyres, is often at dumped prices, resulting in market distortions, loss of revenue to the exchequer and below expected level of service and support, warranty, claims, etc. for the tyres buyers,” said Rajiv Budhiraja, director general, ATMA.

China National Chemical Corp recently acquired Italian tyremaker Pirelli in 2015 for $7.86 billion, and it is also exploring aggressively the Indian market to establish Chinese control in the premium passenger vehicle segment.


THE RED IMPRINT
Chinese influence in the Indian automotive industry is only going to grow in the future as the world’s biggest car market at about 28 million a year finally begins to report slowing growth. A large number of Chinese automobile companies and auto parts makers — Changan Motors, Great Wall Motors, Beiqi Foton, Kingfa, Lesso, and Wanfeng Auto - are looking at the Indian market seriously.

With EVs becoming the future industry standard, China will have a strong influence in the global market as well as in India due to the geographic proximity.

As India makes more EVs, China’s dominance will further increase because of its leadership credentials in Lithium, the key ingredient for car batteries of the future.

“China enjoys significant scale and cost advantages in the sector. The same is also getting rapidly replicated in the electric vehicle space, with active policy support by the Chinese government. And with large investments in the new energy space, China is likely to emerge as a trendsetter and significant technology driver in the electric vehicle space in the coming years,” said Subrata Ray, senior group vice president, ICRA.

China is already the world’s largest EV manufacturer with almost 60% of the global market share by way of volume. From next year, China has mandated that at least 10% of the total sales of cars from OEMs have to be NEV (New Energy Vehicles: BEV, FCV, Plug-in Hybrids).

“The Chinese market next year will be close to 28 million vehicles. Around 10% (2.8 million vehicles) will be NEV, which is almost as big as India’s passenger car market. So with such huge sales of NEV, China will create a huge ecosystem for battery manufacturing, recycling, charging infrastructure and other related components of the EV package,” said Rajesh Singh, an auto industry veteran.

“These huge numbers would lead to a large number of companies from the NEV ecosystem eventually evaluating entry into the Indian market, which is taking baby steps in the direction of NEV,” Singh added.

Therefore, the biggest threat to the ‘Make in India’ programme could well be China as it threatens to dominate both the local market and where India traditionally exports. That might please some consumers here, but could cause the brows to be furrowed at the automotive boardrooms in India."

0,2018-04-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: India’s vehicle sales are estimated to have grown in strong single digits last financial year despite the temporary slowdown in demand due to demonetisation and the implementation of the Goods & Services Tax (GST), backing up the revival story in the world’s fastest-growing economy. 

Auto makers such as Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors reported steady growth with new models Swift and Nexon pushing up sales numbers last month. Commercial vehicles and tractors also made a strong showing, with the budget having pledged greater spends in infrastructure and increased support for farmers.

The country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki reported a growth of 15.3% to sell 147,170 units last month. While sales of mini cars (Alto, WagonR) rose 21.1% to 37,511 units, those of compacts (Swift, Baleno, Ignis, Celerio, DZire, Tour S) surged 13.5% to 68,885 units. Demand for midsize sedan Ciaz dropped by 12.1% to 4,321 units. However, utility vehicles (Ertiga, S-Cross, Vitara Brezza) sustained their growth momentum - sales rose 24.3% to 22,764 units.

The company ended the year on a high, growing domestic sales by 13.8% to 1,643, 467 units.



Meanwhile, homegrown auto major Tata Motors reported a 31% increase in passenger vehicle sales at 20266 units for March. Though passenger car sales for the company declined by 4%, demand in the utility vehicle segment more than trebled in the period under review. For the entire fiscal year (2017-18), the company’s passenger vehicle sales grew by 22% to close at 187,321 units.

Mayank Pareek, president, passenger vehicle business units at Tata Motors said, “We have ended FY18 with robust sales performance with a growth of 31% on the back of our new generation cars. With Nexon, we are making good progress in the UV segment. We look forward to sustaining this growth rate and continue this momentum in FY19.”

As the country’s largest commercial vehicle manufaturer, Tata Motors continued to gain momentum growing by 37% to 49174 units. “The government’s push towards infrastructure development, restriction on overloading of trucks, road construction and mining activities has boosted demand in the MHCV segment...”, said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicle business unit, Tata Motors. Demand for movement of aggregate, sand and coal pushed up tipper sales by 58%. Volumes in the intermediate and light commercial vehicle segments too nearly doubled last month driven by new product launches, e-commerce and logistics sectors.

Cumulative sales of commercial vehicles (April 2017 – March 2018) for Tata Motors in domestic market stood at 399,318 units, which is a increase of 23% over 325,211 units sold the previous fiscal.

At VE Commercial Vehicles, commercial vehicle sales in the domestic market went up by 22.5 % to 8146 units in March. The company sold a total of 56920 units of Eicher and Volvo branded trucks and buses last fiscal.

The upswing in demand was reflected in sale of tractors as well. Last month, Sonalika Tractors increased sales by a whopping 80% to sell a total of 12,791 tractors. In the entire fiscal year, the company grew volumes by 22% to sell 100,001 tractors.

Sonalika said favorable monsoons, combined with the government’s pro-agriculture allocation should enable the industry to grow at a steady pace in 2018. Raman Mittal, Executive Director, Sonalika International Tractors Limited, said, “With the growth trend seen in Q4, we are confident to continue this growth momentum, surpassing industry growth.”"

If the index manages to cross and sustain above the resistance zone of 10,200-10,250 on a consistent basis, then the strength of the relief rally towards 10,450-10,550 levels is expected to increase, according to technical analysts. They are bullish on Mahindra and Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Finance, Bata India and HDFC Standard Life.


Where are We? The Nifty has recently formed a reversal candlestick after four weeks of consecutive decline and has bounced from the oversold levels. There are strong support clusters at 10,050-10,000 levels which are likely to provide cushion in case of declines. With emergence of positive divergence on the daily chart and bullish crossovers by the momentum indicators, expect a short-term trend reversal only on a decisive close above the 10,200 levels.


What is in Store? The Nifty faces immediate resistance at 10,200-10,230 levels on the upside; and on a decisive close above, expect a retracement rally towards the 10,450-10,550 levels. The Bank Nifty faces crucial hurdles around the 24,500 levels, which is a weekly resistance zone, and will need to close above the same for any bullish confirmation. The bank index has also tested its two years’ rising channel support line and one can take select contrarian trading bets for next few weeks. Maintain a bullish view on HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Bank of Baroda.


What could an Investor Do? We expect the auto sector to show relative outperformance in the coming few quarters as most of the stocks have tested long-term support levels zone and provides high margin of safety. Our top picks are Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp and Eicher Motors and expect 15-20 per cent returns. We are bullish on mid-cap IT stocks like NIIT and FSL which have formed a strong bullish support and indicate limited downside from the current levels and can expect 20-25 per cent return within 6-8 months.

8,2018-04-04,Eicher,"Talking to ET Now, Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Centrum Broking, says the auto ancillary sector has generated multibaggers and he continues to be bullish on it.Edited excerpts: 

Can the tyre sector sustain the rebound from recent lows? Also, can this extend to auto ancillary players as well? We had a recent listing in Sandhar Technologies.Do you like that sector?
We have always been bullish on auto ancillaries. This space has created a lot of wealth. Being a B2B play, the margins will be less and the kind of multiples may not be as strong but in the last three-four years, the kind of wealth that auto ancillaries have created is amazing. Stocks like Minda Industries have been multi-baggers. We are positive on the space. 

Another name which is slowing coming back is Minda Corp, which has missed out the entire rally in the last two-three years because of their joint venture related issues. Now, slowly some of those issues are getting addressed and auto ancillaries are making a comeback. 

In that space, Endurance Technologies was the last one to come out with an IPO. It appears to be a very credible name and they have good customers with guaranteed order book. So, there are good pockets in auto ancillary where one can keep an eye on.


Markets currently are focusing on the entire Chanda Kochhar issue but do you think we should look beyond that? Is ICICI Bank a good contra stock to buy right now? 
The overhang of this entire episode definitely will keep the upsides a little challenged for some time. If one has the stomach and the wherewithal to go through this volatile period, then it is a different thing but considering there are other opportunities available in banking, one may be better off focussing in there. 

But having said that, I am sure institutions will survive and so eventually, there can be hiccups but eventually the institution has enough depth to stand on its own. Keeping all those things into account, as a banking pick, there are probably better choices. But whether one should get contrarian on this stock, I don’t think that stage has come yet in my opinion.


Let’s talk about Eicher Motors. They are going to look at capacity expansion that augurs well for the overall profile of the business. The stock is already trading at elevated levels when it comes to price to earnings valuation parameter. Are you still recommending Eicher Motors at near Rs 28,000?
I believe so because the stock has given reasonable correction and Eicher Motors is one of those stocks which was there in high quality HNI portfolios from very lower levels, may be sub-10,000 levels also. 

If you are having that kind of margin of safety and if your purchase price is so low, you obviously have more wherewithal to go through the current volatility. Even if somebody had bought at those levels, they need not worry much as also those who bought it recently also. Eventually the stock price will come back. It is a high wealth creator and a lot of steam is still left and healthy margins and healthy balance sheet will be going in favour of the company. It is a buy on dips.


What about Bharat Forge? Are the positives already in the price or is there opportunity to get into the stock even now?
We had discussed about auto ancillary in the beginning and if somebody is looking at relatively large cap in auto ancillary, then Bharat Forge can be one. But having said that, many midcap auto ancillaries can be good wealth creators because there are chances of giving higher percentage returns.

There are more names like Minda Corp or even Endurance Technologies in this sector. The chances of them doing well are much higher. Bharat Forge is facing some headwind in terms of margin pressure, etc, but with the loyal customer base, midcaps have a better chance of doing better.



How are you viewing the earning season? The countdown will start soon enough. What are you hoping to hear from the IT majors?
It will be an interesting earning season with clear differentiation between the way BFSI stocks and the non-BFSI stocks are going to report. In Q3 FY18, it was clearly reflected that non-BFSI stocks earnings performance, green shoots were already appearing. So, 15.4% was the PAT growth and 13% was the top line growth. Non-BFSI stocks have shown profit dip and that was understandable because of the asset quality issues and the NPAs, extra provisioning, etc. 

BFSI was the weakest link last quarter and that will remain the case even in the coming result season as well. With RBI changing the NPA and reclassification measures on an ongoing basis, we can expect banks to post very bad results even in this quarter as well. Exceptions maybe one or two private sector names. Barring that, in general banking sector may post a profit dip.

But for non-BFSI sectors, the green shoots may get stronger and we can expect a better performance from the non-BFSI names. Coming to IT and TCS, the expectation of pickup in earnings is very low. When you get into the earnings season with lower and muted expectations, sometimes it can throw a pleasant and positive surprise. 

Considering the way market is, the forgotten IT sector may come back under investor focus. TCS and Infosys results will be keenly watched and the best part is we are entering there with muted expectations."

The stock broke above a resistance at Rs 1,800.4, the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci projection level of the uptrend from December 22, 2016 low to September 7, 2017 high, suggesting a new uptrend for the stock has started.

20,2018-04-04,Eicher,"By Chandan Taparia
The Nifty50 index failed to hold above its crucial resistance at the 10,276 level and witnessed sustained selling till the end of the session.

The index wiped out the gains of previous two sessions and formed a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart, which implies complete dominance by the bears.

Now, as long as the Nifty50 holds below 10,180 level, weakness could be seen towards 10,050 and then the psychologically important 10,000 mark, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,222 and then 10,276 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,000 followed by 9,800 while maximum Call OI was at 10,500, followed by 11,000. Put writing was seen at strike price 10,000 and 10,200 while significant Call writing was seen at strike prices 10,300 and 10,400 marks, which could restrict the upside.

Options data suggested a broader trading range for the Nifty50 between 10,000 to 10,250 levels.

India VIX moved up by 7.64 per cent to 16.34. A sudden spike in volatility after consolidation of last six sessions has given the bears an upper hand. Volatility is at higher levels since last six weeks. We are expecting volatility to continue because of volatile global cues and RBI policy.

Bank Nifty opened on a flat note. However, it corrected by more than 400 points on weak global cues. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily chart, which indicated supply at every bounce. However, it respected the crucial vertical support trend line.

Now, if it sustains below 24,100 level, then it may slip towards 24,000 and then 23,750 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 24,350 and then 24,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed with a loss of 1.42 per cent at 10,139. Long buildup was seen in Page Industries, Bajaj Finance, Colgate-Palmolive and Eicher Motors while shorts were seen in Godrej Industries, Voltas, PC Jeweller, Amara Raja Battery, MindTree, Bharti Infratel, Hindalco, Tata Steel and NTPC.

19,2018-04-04,Eicher,"In a chat with ET Now, Harendra Kumar, MD-Institutional Equities, Elara Capital, says aviation, infrastructure and metals could set the tune for the market resurgence over next 12-24 months.Edited excerpts:



The overall global scenario leading to a US-China trade war seems to be affecting us. With China responding the way it has, it is a case for not who wins, but who gets hurt the least. In light of this, how are you looking at the overall global set up impacting our markets?
Currently, India’s leadership in the emerging market space has started deteriorating much before this problem cropped up. Closer to December, India started giving off some of its gains. My guesstimate is that India will bottom out ahead of some of the other emerging markets. Global trade wars typically have huge contribution, a lot of volatility and net effect plays up in the currencies. 

If you want to figure out exactly how this is going to play up, keep watching the currencies and the level where it stabilises. It can tell us potentially whether the disruption is getting managed or when it is potentially time to re-enter the market. As of now, there is a lot of disequilibrium on various counts. The markets are edgy and they will likely drift downwards from here. We are still 4% to 5% away from a intermediate bottom before you start to cherry-pick stocks. Till such time, you should be on the sidelines.


You are making a point that there is 4-5% further correction is needed before cherry-picking starts. How do you see the overall script in the next 6-10 months? 
You have to get the macro picture right and see where things have gone wrong. Before you look to buy the market, one should look at the levels. The key variables over so many years has been the earnings yield. The market corrects another 5%, the earnings yield on 19-20 will be closer to 7.5% to 8%. That is quite respectable and this is where equity investors will start looking at the market seriously. 

From there on, you are looking to price in 19-20 earnings as well. And so, the market becomes cheaper. Given the resilience of the Indian economy and the fact that we are on an economic recovery cycle, anything lower priced will be bought into, but there is some amount of disruption before it settles down. 

It is more a local rather than global case. The local news is also not helping India -- GST, the banking mess, the slew of financial issues that sucked up liquidity in the market. This also will subside but you need time for it. Hence our call is that the next couple of months is going to be a little more volatile.


Speaking of volatility, another factor that could be impacted was going to be the implications on the political sphere. Do you think that to a certain extent, has been baked into the markets or would the elections have a further bearing in terms of the direction of the equity markets?
Election is a variable as much as we wish that it would not be. Our consensus is that may be the incumbent government will win back the subsequent election but the state elections are getting prominence -- be it the Gujarat Election or even the northeast election – and the market is on tenterhooks. Volatility has caused higher pre-election market selloff . So, yes, that would be an opportunity to enter the markets because subsequent to that, the markets have rebounded. So, politics is a variable but not something to be overtly worried about in the bigger scheme of things.


The auto sector has been doing very well even after almost 45% cut from recent highs Tata Motors has rebound, Eicher after 20% correction is witnessing upgrades after they hike their guidance for FY19 capacity but Bajaj Auto continues to remain a big laggard in the space, CV cycle is doing well, how are you analysing different elements of the auto sector?
Yes, clearly tractor is coming back very strongly. We see a huge rural impetus playing through the year up to the elections may be in December or May next year. So, rural is the theme. Two-wheelers have become a kind of a staple and could end up attracting FMCG multiples. Tractors is seeing a recovery in road construction, real estate as well as rural recovery. Mahindra & Mahindra, which has not done well, is just about getting the required attention from investors which it has not been over so many years.

Tata Motors, I would not be so sure as of now, because we are not sure how the volume month on month is going to be holding up. The street is a little over optimistic over the next two or three ensuing months. If the volume numbers disappoint, the stock could give up a lot of gains even from this level. So it be too early to call a bottom. The stock is down 50% from its peak but I would want to wait for the numbers to turn before taking a call on Tata Motors.


What is the outlook when it comes to Q4 earnings, particularly for the IT space? 
I do not think IT stocks are pricing in the earnings expectations. It is more importantly the structural problems that they face in terms of growth, the internal structures of the company or the long-term alignment of opportunities. Apart from say a TCS or a Wipro, which are seeing recoveries in terms of its earnings after a long restructuring exercises, the space is still a little on the softer side. 

There are selective opportunities in the digitisation space which will work for small and midcap companies and small cap companies in the IT space. Overall, it is going to be a tepid six months for the tech sector. May be things could recover in the second half, but it is too early to call that. What goes in favour of tech is obviously valuations. There is no two ways to say that they are extremely cheap, given the overall context. But IT has disappointed, time and again, in terms of earnings. It is kind of a neutral at this point of time.


If one were to talk about next 12-24 months, once the dust settles down, which sector or what theme do you think will be the leader? 
There are several micro themes that would continue to do very well and which could have decadal values. One is aviation. It is on a structural growth curve at this given point of time and it is not going to look back irrespective of what happens on the crude side.

Second, we are in the early stages of infrastructure and capital goods recovery. A lot of infrastructure stocks will come back in investors’ focus. 

Third, metals. A huge correction has set in this space because of the global problems but the India steel outlook is very strong. You will find value there sooner than some of the other sectors and of course Reliance is still underpriced. It will be a large contributor to Nifty gains in the ensuing rally."

The Nifty50 index formed a Hammer candle on Wednesday, as it fell to 10,355 and then recovered to close above 10,400. It engulfed the trading range of last session but witnessed buying interest from lower levels.

Price patterns indicated absence of buying at higher levels while every decline is being bought into. This suggests a positive to rangebound move in the market.

Now, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,350 and then 10,333 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,000 followed by 10,300, while maximum Call OI was at 10,500 followed by 10,600. 

There was significant Put writing at 10,400 and 10,300 levels, which shifted its support on the higher side while Call writing was seen at 10,600 followed by 10,400 levels. The option band suggests a broader trading range between 10,300 and 10,500 levels.

India VIX moved up 1.52 per cent to 14.72. VIX has to remain between 13.50 and 13 to start the fresh leg of upmove.

Bank Nifty finally negated the formation of higher highs of last six sessions and remained under pressure for most part of the day. It formed a bearish candle on the daily chart, which means supply is visible at higher levels.

Now an immediate uptrend could remain intact only as long as it holds above 25,000 level, while on the upside hurdles are seen at 25,250 and then 25,500 levels. If Nifty slips below 25,000 level, then a small dip could be seen towards its next support at 24,750 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,416 with a marginal loss of 0.05 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Bata India, IRB, Amara Raja Battery, Exide India, McDowell, Hindalco, Jubilant Foodworks, Hexaware, Jindal Steel, HUL, Eicher Motor, TCS, KSCL and Titan while shorts were seen in BPCL, IOC, TVS Motor, Marico and Engineers India.

33,2018-04-12,Eicher,"Talking to ET Now, Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets & Corp Affairs, India Infoline, says this is the time to nibble in some stocks and sectors as after first week of May, market will be up and running. IIFL is extremely bullish on four large caps from 10,000 levels – ITC, L&T, Hindalco and Eicher Motors.Edited excerpts:

How should we cut noise and focus on investment? Where is a good hunting ground?
Markets are caught between the devil and the deep sea. There is negative rhetoric, geopolitics, oil price hike and yet stocks are far from the 10,000 low which they had hit. I do not rule out another bout of volatility in the next fortnight but I would say that is the best time to buy. Fear is a very good time to build portfolios. If you come closer to 10,000, add positions. Right now, you should nibble into certain stocks and sectors because after the first week of May, markets are going to be up and running. 

You will be discounting most of the geopolitics and there will be a smooth transition from pessimism to earnings outperformance which can drive the way forward. I would say we are extremely bullish on four large caps from 10,000 levels – ITC, L&T, Hindalco and Eicher Motors. These make up different sectors and all four are outperforming. 

In the midcaps, we are relatively bullish on some of the construction names. NBCC is our top pick over there. We like a small company called Trident on home furnishing and on the paper side, that is giving you an extremely good risk reward. We are also bullish on Nestle. We have been long on that since it was Rs 7000. Now it is Rs 8500 and you could look for targets of Rs 9000; and fourthly would be the likes of consumption like Jubilant Food or a Tata Global which can add more flavour to your portfolio.


What about OMCs? The way they got hammered yesterday, it does not seem like this is going to be a one-day story. If another excruciating fall comes in today, are they anyway close to a buy zone?
 A large part of the pain maybe there because of this buzz about one rupee relaxation on prices. I do not think the government will do that. There is a buffer of excise which they can use. We are in tough times on the oil front but I do not see that escalating. Most people have forgotten that oil is a key indicator of a bull market and globally, that is up and running. 

Now on the OMCs, they have made enough cash. Around 30 bps of underperformance may be already priced in. I would stick my neck out at Rs 400 on a BPCL or Rs 325 on HPCL. They offer immense value and we have seen that their ancillary businesses have added on to that. GRMs may surprise on the upside because of the high price of crude and this rhetoric is a good opportunity to buy because I do not see the government coming down too hard on them.


Going back to consumer names, the common perception on the Street is that flows are coming back and money is moving into quality stocks and consumer companies give you near term visibility. Why would anybody like to buy stocks like Jubilant Foodworks, Titan where the valuation risks could be higher? You do not make money when you buy stocks at PE multiples of 50 plus!
Yes, that is a glass half full or half empty but it is the huge flow of mutual funds which are driving those prices because these are the best places to hide.

Secondly, if oil is going to go up to $72, it may be hurting India but there is a broader phase of the world where exporters are going to be making hands over fist and that needs the consumption rally to be up and running. 

The consumption part of the beverage, the middle income, the rising consumption is going to be a very key conduit. Obviously, these are stocks hitting all-time highs. It is not easy to justify earnings but like I said, this is a glass half full or half empty. If you want to be in a safe spot, then these stand out. As the market matures and understands that risk reward now will start to ebb towards taking more risk over the next month, then again you would see a return of the larger market outperforming. 

Like I said, these have been very key stocks in the last two years and I see no underperformance because earnings are going to be very much on the upside for the likes of Jubilant, Titan because of gaining market share and Nestle, Tata Global are in a very sweet spot as input costs have fallen and prices have risen after the GST implementation.


As the earning season starts tomorrow, which company’s earnings will you look out for?
It will be Tata Steel again on the EBITDA front. Ferrous stocks are going to come out with very strong earnings. It is going to be ferrous. It is going to be consumption. It is going to be auto. You will see the same from Maruti. You will see the same from an Eicher Motors. Like I said, Tata Motors could actually surprise on the upside given the pound weakness. They have a huge hedge against. 

So these three companies plus the dark horse for me would be NBCC. The management has guided that last quarter because of GST, there was some underperformance on reporting and this quarter onwards they are looking for a 30% to 35% growth on both top line and bottom line. 

The likes of L&T, NBCC, Sadbhav Engineering, Dilip Buildcon -- all the road construction infra play are going to be very strong outperformers. The only thing is that the execution has happened in this quarter or the next quarter because the order inflows are extremely strong."

37,2018-04-19,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Chinese e-vehicles giant BYD, which has won major orders in India, does not get any subsidy in its country, its Indian partner Goldstone Infratech has said, refuting Indian rivals’ claims that they face unfair competition.

Additionally, a Goldstone Infratech spokesperson told ET, the company will be able to localise half the components for electric buses being built for India, in the next two years. “BYD is a global company, widely held and backed by marquee investors like Warren Buffett and Samsung Electronics, with manufacturing facilities across the globe.

There are no export subsidies given on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. Such concerns are unfounded,” he said. “Goldstone-BYD buses comply with all localisation norms under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) policy and Make in India. We expect to ramp up localisation component above 50% in next two years,” the spokesperson said. A government official said Ashok Leyland has localisation of 37%, while Tata Motors is at 35%.

Batteries that comprise a major cost of EVs are not manufactured in India and companies import them from the likes of China, Japan and South Korea.




On March 23, ET reported that BYD’s entry into India by bagging large tenders for electric buses has started worrying the domestic auto industry. Indian companies questioned the government’s decision to allow a company of the size of BYD to participate in the recent tenders and also said the move is a spoiler to Make in India. “It’s conjecture. We don’t have facts and figures to support that they (BYD) are receiving subsidies.

BYD, like any Chinese company, has very deep pockets and obviously, it is heavily backward integrated, as we understand. They will have a price advantage. Any company which wants to make a mark, looks at very predatory pricing. So everybody wants to be there and get the first mover’s advantage. Predatory pricing is anybody’s prerogative. How much is subsidised, one doesn’t really know,"" said an industry player who did not wish to be quoted.

Tata Motors and Goldstone-BYD bagged nine of 10 contracts, partfunded by the Centre, leaving competitors such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and JBM Solaris empty-handed. Winning bids placed by the duo were nearly 30% lower than market price. Tata Motors bid as low as Rs 77 lakh per e-bus in some tenders. However, some of the tenders bid on supply-operate basis have been put on hold by the government as it is figuring out ways to evaluate the exact cost of e-buses.

Indian companies said BYD has access to low-cost funds and subsidies from China that pose threat in terms of competition and scaling up manufacturing. ”It’s what we call Chinese dumping with home benefits,” said an industry player on condition of anonymity. The e-bus tenders were part of a pilot scheme of the Department of Heavy Industries that had, in December 2017, sanctioned Rs 440 crore to 11 states for procurement of 390 electric buses, taxis and autos under FAME that offers up to 60% subsidy on e-bus procurement."
38,2018-04-25,Eicher,"ET Intelligence group: In the past decade, Eicher Motors was the prime example of value migration in India’s automotive industry. The maker of Royal Enfield made its stockholders richer by a jaw-dropping 113 times in 10 years, as riders across the country did bite the Bullet.

But that frenetic pace of growth may be showing some signs of fatigue – after all, the statistical base effect by itself is a drag. Hence, funds seeking multi-bagger gains in India’s automobile industry are switching gears – in favour of the good old Maruti Suzuki.

Funds are reviewing volume growth in the long-term, and the exercise could effect a portfolio churn, resulting in redistribution of weights in the auto sector. It has a 10-10.5 per cent weight in the portfolios of the mutual funds and foreign portfolio investors (FPI), of which 2.2-2.5 per cent is the weight of Maruti Suzuki and 0.5-0.9 per cent of Eicher Motors. In the past six months, the stock of Maruti Suzuki has outperformed Eicher Motors by 17 per cent.

The stocks of both have generally found favour with investors in the past three years, enjoying premium price earnings multiples owing to little competitive intensity and bulging order backlogs. However, several factors seem to indicate that Maruti Suzuki now offers a better risk-reward ratio to that of Eicher Motors.



Investors had high interest in the stock of Eicher Motors owing to order backlog – or waiting period for its vehicles. However, the order backlog of Eicher has been consistently decreasing as the installed capacity has increased over the last few years. The order backlog of its key model Classic-350 has come down to less than a month from four months two year ago. On the other hand, the order backlog at Maruti has been increasing with the launch of successful new models such as Brezza, Baleno, new Swift and Dzire.

Both companies are expanding their installed capacity. Eicher Motors has recently announced it plans to resume the second phase of Tamil Nadu plant, and it will increase the total capacity to 12.5 lakh from current nameplate capacity 9.5 lakh units a year. Maruti will increase capacity by another five lakh units after the phase two of the new plant at Gujarat will be commissioned.

Besides this, Eicher appears to have high dependency on Classic-350, while Maruti volumes have been quite diversified. Classic-350 contributes nearly 70 per cent of the total volume of motorcycles for Eicher Motors. By contrast, topselling models of Maruti Alto, Brezza, Balano and Wagon-R together contribute more than half of the total volume at the carmaker.

The recent launches of Eicher Motors — Enfield Continental GT and Interceptor — show that by focusing on 650-cc bikes, the company is seeking to boost export growth. The launch of a premium motorcycle by Bajaj in collaboration with Triumph will intensify competition in domestic market.

By contrast, given the low penetration of cars in India and latent demand, the local market continues to drive volume growth for Maruti and would be easy for funds to monitor. Also, the pace of net additions slowed down to 4 models per year for cars over FY13-16 and has been negative in the past 1.5 years, which means models phasing out from Indian car market is higher than the new introduction.

This shows that competitive intensity for cars is shrinking, and Maruti Suzuki has been gaining market share in the past three years: It now commands a share well above 50 per cent.

New safety and emission norms will increase Royal Enfield prices as compared with Maruti Suzuki models. Thus, Maruti Suzuki will be better placed than Eicher Motors to pass on higher input costs to the customer.

The impact of volume visibility is reflecting in the P/E multiple of Eicher Motors. The P/E of Eicher Motors dropped to 47 times in July 2015 to 30 times currently, while in the same period Maruti’s PE expanded to 26 times from 22 times."
39,2018-04-26,Eicher,"Superior economies with reasonable competitive moat of a business can create long-term wealth for investors. An efficient business with consistency and sustainability normally creates value for shareholders, which can be measured by incremental return on capital employed (I-RoCE).

According to Edelweiss Securities, a Mumbai brokerage, I-RoCE is a true reflection of a management’s ability to redeploy incremental capital at higher returns, not clouded by past capital allocation decisions. Hence, it’s a lead indicator of future RoCE.

A screener using this criteria throws up companies like Kajaria Ceramics, Avanti Feeds, MRF, Atul, Sheela Foam, Vardhman and La Opala; evergreen companies that have either been improving or sustaining high RoCE at over 20 per cent for at least 10 years now.

Edelweiss classifies Heritage Foods, CCL Products, KPR Mill and Nilkamal as rising stars. From low historical RoCE of less than 20 per cent, these companies are now moving up the curve.

Kajaria Ceramics, Nilkamal, Avanti Feeds and La Opala have seen their RoCE increase from 12.81 per cent, 15.33 per cent, 4.77 per cent and 5.59 per cent, respectively, in FY08 to 32.19 per cent, 23.29 per cent, 61.69 per cent and 29.26 per cent as of March 31, 2017.

KPR Mills, CCL Products and Heritage Foods have also witnessed a substantial rise in RoCE during this period. Shares of these companies have delivered between 740 per cent and 9,000 per cent returns over the past 10 years.

Kajaria is the leader in tile industry, with 22 per cent market share (from 13 per cent in FY10) and enjoys highest Ebitda margins, whereas Heritage Food is focusing on high growth, high margin value-added products (VADP) segment, aiming to increase market share from 24 per cent to 40 per cent by FY22. 

CCL Products is the largest manufacturer and exporter of instant coffee. Its focus on B2C branded sales, high margin freeze-dried capacity and cost efficiency are projected to help the business grow faster.

Avanti Feed, a leader with around 42 per cent market share in feeds business, is already a multibagger stock. It is targeting $1 billion revenue by FY22, and has been focusing on the value-added shrimp processing segment.

Incremental- RoCE is a key metric that measures value creation in a business. This rule of measurement is not limited only to the field of management. Higher I-RoC usually is a reflection of superior quality of an underlying business such as, high earnings growth, superior pricing power and hence higher operating margin as well as higher working capital efficiency, says ArunaGiri N, CEO & Fund Manager, TrustLine Holdings.

Edelweiss has picked Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, Britannia and Pidilite as evergreen stocks in the largecap space, and sees D-Mart as a rising star.

While doing stock selection, one should focus on I-RoCE as it reflects a management’s capability to redeploy incremental capital for superior returns (only 25 per cent BSE500 companies, excluding banks, could do this) and it is also a better tool to assess new capital allocation decisions made of CEOs. 

“Companies with high I-RoCE have outperformed Nifty & BSE500 with an alpha of around 11-14 per cent CAGR over 10 years,” Edelweiss said.




A sectoral RoCE analysis done by the brokerage threw up media and entertainment, textiles, retail and building materials with superior I-RoCE, while industrials, metals and mining, cement, tea, coffee, sugar, real estate and electrical equipment showed deterioration on this count."

2,2018-05-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Auto stocks will be in focus on Wednesday after domestic auto companies on Tuesday posted strong sales data for April, mostly beating Street estimates.

This should create upside prospects for some of these stocks even after baking in a weak base.

The country’s largest passenger carmaker Maruti reported a 14.2 per cent surge in domestic sales at 164,978 units against estimates of single-digit growth due to capacity constraints. Total April sales rose 14.4 per cent to 172,986 units.

Tata Motors reported 86 per cent growth at 53,511 units compared with 28,844 units sold in the year-ago month. A strong show by the commercial and passenger vehicles businesses aided this growth. Passenger sales rose 34 per cent to 17,235 units, while the commercial vehicles segment reported total sales of 36,276 units.

The company attributed the growth to improved industrial activities and robust demand from the private consumption-led sectors.

Companies producing commercial vehicles (CVs) were expected to report strong growth on a low base because of the shift to BS-IV emission norms in April 2017.

M&M reported 22 per cent growth in April sales. The company sold 48,097 units compared with 39,417 units in April, 2017. Domestic volumes grew 19 per cent YoY to 45,217 units, while exports rose 88 per cent YoY at 2,880 units.

Eicher Motors clocked 27 per cent YoY jump in sales at 76,187 units.

Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto were yet to report their sales numbers till the time of filing of this report. Two-wheeler companies are expected to continue with their growth momentum and report double-digit volume growth backed by an improvement in rural demand and on wedding season demand, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said in a note.

0,2018-05-01,Eicher,"The March 2018 quarter yet again proves the resilience in earnings of large-sized companies even after several structural disruptions. Given this, it makes sense to be with a scheme which has high focus on large-sized companies and has consistently delivered superior returns in the long term. 

One such scheme is ICICI Prudential Focused Bluechip Equity. One of the factors that works in the scheme’s favour is its consistency in performance. This has been the hallmark even after its leading fund manager Manish Gunwani quit the fund house. Fund managers S Naren and Rajat Chandak have been managing the consistency in its performance quite well. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has delivered 13 per cent and 17 per cent returns, while its benchmark index Nifty50 has given 10 per cent and 14 per cent returns in the same period, respectively. 

This consistency in performance can be attributed to the fact the scheme follows its benchmark index quite closely. Considering this, it is quite evident the scheme has high weight to financial services companies. In the past six months, the fund managers have enhanced exposure to companies which have not participated in the rally of the past one year but hold the promise of strong earnings’ growth. These are Eicher Motors, Asian Paints and Larsen & Toubro.

1,2018-05-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks settled at a nearly 3-month high on Monday as strong corporate earnings and firm global cues gave risk appetite a lift. 

The BSE Sensex closed up 191 points, or 0.55 per cent, at 35,160. NSE's Nifty gained 47 points, or 0.44 per cent, to finish at 10,739.

But a look at momentum indicator -- moving average convergence divergence, or MACD -- suggests bearish crossovers for 65 stocks on the NSE.

MACD is a tool used for identifying trend reversals.

Stocks that saw bearish crossovers included Nalco, MMTC, Eicher Motors, Glenmark Pharma, Shriram Transport Finance and Indraprastha Gas. Some of these have been witnessing strong volumes, lending credence to the emerging trend. Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Jindal Stainless, Havells India, Dollar Industries and Finolex Industries were among others with bearish crossovers.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the 'signal' line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD breaches below the signal line, it sends out a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward movement, and vice versa.


MACD crossed below signal




However, MACD alone may not be sufficient to help one take an investment call. Traders should make use of other tools such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm such a trend.

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers at 59 counters on the NSE, giving ‘buy’ signals. They included Axis Bank, NHPC, HDFC, Bata India, Dena Bank and Karnataka Bank, among others.


MACD crossed above signal



The Nifty index on Monday formed a small bullish candle on the daily chart. The index has successfully closed above the gap zone between 10,736 and 10,702 levels hit on February 5. It has registered a robust bullish candle on the monthly chart as well, which has erased all the panic losses seen in March. Sustaining above this gap area logically gives the next target of 10,928, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

""We expect the Nifty to continue its positive momentum. But in the short term, we are expecting the correction to continue, which is part and parcel of the trend. Any dips from this point of time of more than 10 per cent should be bought into for a potential upside of 20 per cent,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.


Understanding MACD

A close look at the MMTC chart shows that whenever the MACD strip has gone beyond the signal line, the stock has shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

Here's a list of seven developments that may move the market in the coming week:


Next batch of earningsAmong notable names, ICICI Bank, Tata Chemicals and Tata Coffee are slated to announce January-March results on Monday, while ABB India and Jubilant FoodWorks will unveil their score cards on Tuesday. Eicher Motors and JSPL are scheduled to announce results on Wednesday.

Adani Enterprises, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Tata Communications, Titan Company, Union Bank of India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises will release their quarterly numbers on Thursday. Gillette India and Tata Global Beverages will announce January-March numbers on Friday.


Karnataka pollsThe Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections 2018 is scheduled to be held across the state on May 12. Results of the poll will be out on May 15. Leading parties, the ruling Congress and the BJP, have been campaigning aggressively in the state for the last few months to woo voters. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will be fighting against BJP's BS Yeddyurappa for the CM's post in the upcoming polls. Market will keenly follow the developments from the state.


US jobs dataUS job growth increased less-than-expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17.5-year low of 3.9 per cent, as some out-of-work Americans left the labour force, Reuters reported.

The report also showed wages barely rose last month, which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening. Financial markets across the globe, including India may react to it when trading resumes on Monday.


All eyes on US sanctions against IranOil prices rose about 2 per cent on Friday, with US crude hitting its highest in more than three years, as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported. On May 12, the US President Donald Trump will decide whether to extend waivers on economic sanctions against Iran. If it doesn’t, the global market could lose about one million barrels of oil a day, says a Market Watch report.

The sanctions on Iran were lifted under a 2015 agreement among a group of world powers, including the US and Iran, aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear activities.


Tech ViewThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a ‘Dark Cloud Cover’ pattern on daily chart, suggesting possible downside ahead. The pattern may have negative repercussions, which will be confirmed if the Nifty50 closes below the 10,600 level, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

However, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan has a bullish outlook on the index for the short term with a target 10,910 and reversal placed at 10,500. ""The short term trend will remain bullish as long as it does not close below 10,500. On the way up, 10,708 – 10,785 will be crucial resistance in the near term. The rise in the benchmark index can stretch towards 10,910, if it breaks the crucial resistance level of 10,785,"" Ratnaparkhi said.


Macro numbersThe government will release industrial production data for March on Friday. India's industrial output grew 7.1 per cent in February from a year earlier. This apart, the government will also unveil inflation data based on consumer price index (CPI) for April. Retail inflation stood at 4.28 per cent in March, slowing for the third straight month from a 17-month high, according to data released by the Central Statistics Office.


Global cuesThe big central banking event of next week is the Bank of England’s May 10 meeting, with market expectations overwhelmingly in favour of interest rates being held at the current 0.5 per cent. Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early April when investors priced a 90 per cent chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points, Reuters reported.

In addition, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting minutes will be unveiled on Monday, 7 May 2018."

Nifty futures in Singapore traded lower early today, signalling a rough ride in Mumbai trading.

Asian stocks traded lower. Major indices slipped after Trump decided to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. This has put West Asia into a fresh spell of uncertainty.

Wall Street cut losses to end almost unchanged on Tuesday. Energy stocks rallied.

Oil prices rose more than 2 percent to a three-and-a-half year high on Wednesday. The fresh curbs of Iran may stall the OPEC member’s crude exports in an already tight market.

Edelweiss Financial Services: Edelweiss Financial Services has raised Rs 2,000 crore and made a first close of its maiden fund to buy out infrastructure assets in India as rapid urbanisation and push for sustainable development provide room to financial investors.

Shares of Jindal Stainless ended down 5 per cent at Rs 85.35 on Tuesday.


Power companies: The Reserve Bank of India has rejected the government’s demand to relax the guidelines on resolution of stressed assets for power companies, pushing over 20,000 MW projects closer to liquidation. “The regulator has said it was difficult to give any special treatment to any one sector and has said such issues must be addressed by the concerned ministries,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. “RBI has made it clear that the administrative ministries, lenders and the developers need to find immediate solution to the stressed assets or send them into liquidation without wasting any further time,” another official said.

41,2018-05-10,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Profit margins of a business tell a story. Market veterans say good margin is one of the things multibagger stocks are made up of.

Phillips Carbon, Eicher Motors, Finolex Cables and Balkrishna Industries have at least two things in common: one, they are known multibaggers, and two, they have logged consistent rise in operating performance over the past few years.

At least 10 companies from BSE500 and BSE Midsmallcap Select index have reported a steady rise in PBIDT, or operating profit margin (OPM), in last four financial years.

And Dalal Street has rewarded these stocks handsomely.

Phillips Carbon, the country's largest carbon black maker, has seen its PBIDT margin expand for four consecutive years to 15.92 per cent in FY18 from 2.05 per cent in FY14. A financial ratio, OPM measures operational efficiency of a company.



ICICI Securities says the stock has more room on the upside given robust product demand, sound financials and prudent management pedigree. The brokerage has had a buy rating on the stock ever since it traded at Rs 35. It traded at Rs 245 on Thursday. 

The company is focusing on increasing penetration in the non-rubber segment, which accounts for only 9 per cent of volumes and 12 per cent of revenues at present.

""PCBL has overcome the commodity tag in the past to shift to a more structurally sound manufacturing setup, producing key material for tyre, paints, plastics and ink industries,” the ICICI note said. 

The stock has surged 1,632 per cent in last five years. With a capacity utilisation level above 90 per cent, the company is setting up a greenfield plant in Tamil Nadu and going for brownfield expansion in two of the existing plants that will raise capacity by 50 per cent to 7 lakh tonnes. 

Shares of NOCIL, which is engaged in the rubber chemicals business, have surged 1,272 per cent in last five years. With ace investors Ashish Kacholia and Dolly Khanna as investors, this company has seen operating Ebitda climb 32.9 per cent compounded annually over FY15-FY18 while profits grew 43.8 per cent in the same period. 



In last five years, PBIDT margins of the firm expanded to 28.93 per cent in FY18 from 11.99 per cent in FY14. Total debt declined from a high of Rs 147 crore in FY15 to Rs 5 crore in FY1.

Cable manufacturer Finolex Cables has grown margins steadily despite a rise in copper prices. The stock has climbed 1,200 per cent in last five years. The company follows the cash advance approach while selling products. This strategy helped it generate superior FCF/OCF ratio of more than 0.5 times during FY12-17. The company management expects to adhere to this strategy to generate higher free cash (Rs 1.5 billion in FY17) as well,” Edelweiss Securities said in a recent note.



The company plans savings in working capital and administration costs by rationalising depots post GST, Edelweiss Securities noted. Brokerage Sharekhan has a target of Rs 755 on the stock while Edelweiss Securities sees the stock at Rs 800 level. 

Balkrishna Industries has seen operating profit margin expand to 36.59 per cent in FY17 from 17.26 per cent in FY12. Analysts expect its 60,000 mt carbon black plant to commence operations by FY19.

It may help the company expand margins by 1-1.5 per cent at full utilisation levels. The company's focus on radialisation, high exposure to off-road tyres (OTR) and savings in power and logistics costs -- Mundra port is only 60 km away -- will act as buffer for margins.

Eicher Motors, Gabriel India and JK Tyre are three other companies that have logged consistent rise in margins in last couple of years. Strong demand for Royal Enfield bikes and margin improvement have resulted in an 880 per cent rally in the stock in last five years. 

Gabriel India has managed to expand margins through various cost reduction initiatives. Operating leverage from healthy volume growth and improvement in product mix are likely to aid the company's margins in the coming years.

Tyre maker JK Tyre is poised to see a pick-up in volume, while a reduction in manpower cost and steady input prices should help it improve performance, say analysts .

Among others, Bharat Forge, Goodyear India and Carborundum Universal have also been seeing consistent margin improvement, which has also boosted their share prices."

Motors will focus 
on its 
motorcycle business through Royal Enfield and will not

The company, which currently has a 50:50 joint venture with Volvo for trucks and buses (VECV), had recently announced shutting of another JV -- Eicher Polaris Pvt Ltd (EPPL), which produced and sold personal utility vehicle Multix - in March this year.

53,2018-05-15,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: India Inc is slowly overcoming its inertia despite turbulent politics, choppy markets and hardening oil prices. For a consumer economy plagued by supply overhang, promises of capital expenditure by several private sector companies after a year-long lull have stoked hopes of a rebound. Tata Steel, Ambuja Cements, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, CEAT, Apollo Tyres and Jubilant FoodWorks are among the companies that have announced investments totalling Rs 50,000 crore in the past four months.

Jubilant FoodWorks, which paused store expansion in the previous fiscal, plans to open 75 new stores in FY19 following a six-year-high growth of 26.6% in the March 2018 quarter. High capacity utilisation and better demand visibility are major triggers for companies to commit — and in some cases even go ahead with — fresh capital investments. The growth in private capex in India slowed down to less than 7% annually between FY11 and FY17 for the BSE 200 companies (excluding banking and finance firms and IT). But this figure comes down to 2% if investments by Reliance Industries, which was largely driving the capex growth, are excluded.

Capex growth had risen at a rapid pace of 35% between FY03 and FY11. The gross capital formation of Indian companies, which reflects investments in assets, dropped to a decade-low 27% in the September 2017 quarter, according to the ministry of statistics and programme implementation.





‘Fund-Raise to Help Capex Cycle’ 
But industry trackers believe that the cycle is turning for the good and chances of a more evenly distributed capex growth are stronger.

“Uptick in housing cycle, revival in select industries and continued government support are the key positives. Also, companies are expected to raise $60 billion (around Rs 4 trillion) in the primary equity market in the next two years. This should help capex cycle,” said Amit Tiwari, Partner, Pineoak Capital, a wealth manager.

Morgan Stanley in a note a few months ago said, “We expect a positive inflexion point in the macrocycle in 2018. This will likely be marked by a synchronous recovery in domestic and external demand and, more importantly, a pick-up in private capex for the first time in six years.” And, in the customary chat with analysts, more and more companies are talking about capex plans — a conversation they refrained from in the past one year.

Typically, capacity utilisation of over 80% prompts companies to expand capacities. According to RBI data, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector rose to 74.1% in the December 2018 quarter from 71.2% in the June quarter. The capacity utilisation of several companies in the consumer discretionary sector has crossed 80% and some facilities are operating at the full capacity.

For Hero MotoCorp, utilisation reached 82% in FY18 on the current installed base of 9.2 million units. In the earnings concall after the March quarter results, the company announced it would spend Rs 2,500 crore to increase the capacity to 10 million by 2020. “The main objective of capacity expansion is to fulfil demand without facing capacity constraints,” said a company official of Hero MotoCorp.

Eicher Motors, the manufacturer of marque motorcycle Royal Enfield plans to increase the installed capacity to 1.2 million by FY21 from the current capacity of 0.95 million by investing Rs 800 crore. Analysts expect Royal Enfield to record 14% growth annually between FY18 and FY21, which will require the company to expand capacity.

In line with automakers, autoancillaries too are increasing capacities.

Subbiah Kumar, CFO at CEAT said, “We are increasing capacity since we expect demand to remain strong. We also anticipate increase in the wallet share from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)”.

The capacity utilisation of CEAT is more than 80% and its truck and bus redial facility is at full utilisation. CEAT is investing Rs 4,000 crore in the next 2-3 years to increase its capacity to 1600 tons per day from around 1000 tons per day.

Its peer, Apollo Tyres is putting up a new greenfield facility inAndhra Pradesh by investing around Rs 1,800 crore.

Satish Sharma, president for Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa at Apollo Tyres, said: “With the automotive sector being the shining star of the GDP growth, there is an increased demand for tyres. Amid the increased demand for tyres, our products, across categories, is getting a good traction. While the de-bottlenecking and brownfield capacity expansion will help us meet the demand now, the Andhra Pradesh greenfield, once ready, will cater to the increased demand for the next five years.”

The buoyancy in the disposable income is prompting multiplex operators to expand capacities.

PVR, India’s largest multiplex operator, plans to open 90 screens in the current fiscal with an investment of Rs 450 crore.

Nitin Sood, CFO of PVR, said the company is stepping up the pace of screen additions and upgrade of existing screen portfolio.

The other large multiplex operator, Inox plans to open 55 screens in FY19 by spending Rs 250 crore."

The ruling Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fought in all 222 constituencies while the Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) fielded candidates for 201 seats. Its ally Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) contested 21 seats. The market would possibly be happier with the JD-S allying with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instead of the Congress. 


Oil Cos Resume Raising Prices
State-run oil companies have resumed raising prices of petrol and diesel following the conclusion of voting in Karnataka.

No Units or Offices in India, Yet MNCs Slapped Tax Notices 
The I-T department's zeal to scoop up extra revenue continues. A US-based multinational company without a subsidiary or representative office in India received a notice by post asking it to file returns for assessment year 2011-12 for income that India’s tax department claimed had escaped assessment. Tax experts said many companies had been served similar notices for not filing returns. This could also result in transfer pricing compliance issues if the payer is a related party in India such as a subsidiary. The recent budget amendment enables authorities to initiate prosecution proceedings for not filing tax returns.This has many MNCs worried.

58,2018-05-16,Eicher,"Macros, not politics will be more important now and on this correction, one should be looking at opportunities to buy, says Neeraj Dewan, Director, Quantum Securities, talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:


How are you looking at the market positioning right now? In which range would the markets move in lieu of what may come by on the political front with a slew of elections lined up and the market still awaiting the Karnataka verdict?
It was all building up -- the kind of macros we had, rupee weakening, crude going up, yields rising. All this plus waiting for the election results, the markets were holding on till yesterday. Once the initial results have come, they were expectations that the market will correct because broader market was anyways correcting for almost a week now. 

There were some large-cap names which were supporting the market or keeping the market on elevated levels. We have seen that selling, which was due, happening now. But I do not think this will be a deep correction. This could be a correction where one can look to buy on dips. 

Karnataka finally will also matter a bit but not too much because the BJP has come out with a strong performance and that is a positive that can be taken from the elections. And who makes the government now will not have too much of a bearing on the market because I think that news more or less would have already played into the market. Macros will be more important and on this correction, one should be looking at opportunities to buy. 


Where do you spot those opportunities?
I would say that a lot of these are in infrastructure related spaces and even capital good or pure infrastructure or related ancillary plays related to capital good. Even spaces like steel for that matter. All these sectors have corrected. Steel stocks also corrected a lot since the last peak we saw in the end of January. So, that is one space.

Another space which no one really wants to touch because of negative news around them are corporate banks. Whether it is private banks like ICICI Bank or PSU banks like State Bank or Indian Bank. We know the pain in these stocks and we know this is the peak pain that they would have seen and incrementally things will only improve for them. So, one should look at opportunities in some of the corporate banks also. 

Another space would be the auto and auto ancillary sector. There will be a segment like Eicher which is still a 10% above what it was when the market hit the last high but there will be other stocks which have corrected a lot. Even Maruti has corrected almost 9% from those levels. 

I continue to be positive on midcap IT. The results were very encouraging.


Would you say that PSU banks are a complete avoid or could there be a contrarian opportunity?
There is a contrarian opportunity there but one needs to be stock specific. I mentioned Indian Bank which took approximately Rs 4000 crore of provisioning and incrementally they will need only Rs 2000 crore more. So, you have to analyse the bank separately and among the PSU banks, you have to pick two or three better performers and stick to them. Out of the results which are already out is Indian Bank and Canara Bank would be the one, where one can take a contrarian call and invest for a medium to long term. For other banks like even State Bank, I will wait of the results to come out and then take a call.


How are you approaching the consumption space? Growth only seems to be favouring them and the debate in your head is whether or not you would pay that extra buck because that is what quality demands?
That is what has been happening with these stocks for the last couple of years. We have been looking at growth coming but growth has not actually come in. Growth comes only in the consumption space and so that is where people have been chasing and these stocks have turned more and more expensive.

I would rather see these stocks consolidating, I do not think they will correct because portfolios will be chasing these stocks and they will still give them the premium. But at these levels, I do not see too much of an upside in the short to medium term in these stocks.


How would you look at some of the expensive names in autos and consumption space? Should one book profits there and if so where would that money go?
In the auto space, you see stocks like Eicher Motor which also has been getting that premium valuation and there will be stocks like Maruti but tha thas corrected also. So, there will be stocks like a Maruti or there will be stocks which are into commercial vehicle space like Ashok Leyland where I feel that the stocks have corrected almost 10% from the peak that they saw end of January- February. These are the kind of stocks where I would look at opportunities to increase my positions as far as autos are concerned. There will be auto ancillary companies also which are more exposed to commercial vehicle space. That is one segment I am positive on."

65,2018-05-21,Eicher,"In March, a Tata Motors joint venture bagged electric bus supply contracts for nine out of 10 cities. What turned the heads was a Chinese company that was part of the JV. China’s biggest e-vehicles seller BYD is backed by Warren Buffett. By bidding nearly 30% lower than the market price, the JV left other bidders Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and JBM Solaris empty handed. The stormy entry of China’s giant e-vehicles company in India worried Indian auto majors.

Two months later, there is talk of another biggie jumping on to the electric bus bandwagon. An ET report citing sources said that Gautam Adani-led Adani Enterprises was set to make a big-ticket entry into electric buses manufacturing. The group, which plans to set up a manufacturing base in its special economic zone at Mundra in Gujarat, is in talks with a Taiwanese electric bus maker for technological tie-up, the sources told ET. 

Experts believe that Adani's entry, along with a foreign player, will change the dynamics of the Indian electric buses segment that has limited players.

Why are big companies with deep pockets queuing up for India's e-bus market? The government is aggressively promoting electric vehicles for mass transit and the market potential is seen too huge. 

The department of heavy industries had in December 2017 sanctioned Rs 440 crore to 11 states for procurement of electric buses, electric taxis and e-autos as a pilot project under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme. 

The government is now working on the second phase of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, which offers a slew of incentives to manufacturers of electric vehicles for public transport, battery manufacturers and charging infrastructure developers. The policy proposes to extend huge subsidy support to the electric bus segment in the next three years. The draft Fame-II policy provides incentives for purchase of bulk batteries for a fleet of above 50. The policy provides for bulk procurement of EVs by agencies such as EESL.

States such as Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Pune are soon likely to come out with bulk e-procurement tenders for electric buses. The Andhra Pradesh cabinet recently cleared an electric mobility policy that aims to replace its entire bus fleet with electric tenders by 2030.

The Union Cabinet may soon consider for approval the proposal entailing financial support of Rs 9,381 crore in the second phase of the FAME scheme spanning five years, PTI reported a week ago. The second phase of the scheme will be restricted to new energy vehicles used for public transport, commercial purposes and high-speed two-wheelers.

With an aim to promote eco-friendly vehicles, the government had launched the FAME scheme in 2015 offering incentives on electric and hybrid vehicles of up to Rs 29,000 for bikes and Rs 1.38 lakh for cars. Under FAME II, the report said, demand aggregation would be attempted for city buses, electric three-wheelers and electric four-wheeler taxi segment to bring down the cost of vehicles. Agencies such as EESL, ASRTU (Association of State Road Transport Undertakings) could be considered as potential aggregators. 

India's huge public-transport sector will offer a bonanza for electric bus makers as more and more cities and states would want to shift their entire fleet to electric vehicles, inspired by the Central government's aim to have only electric cars by 2030. Bidding wars for electric buses are going to be messier due to the attraction of bulk orders and government subsidy. Already, competition is revving up. After Tata Motors-Goldstone-BYD joint venture won contracts for nine out of 10 cities, other bidders termed some of the winning bids as unviable as the JV quoted nearly 30% lower than the market price."

66,2018-05-22,Eicher,"LONDON: India's Royal Enfield today launched a new limited-edition model of a classic motorcycle inspired by a World War II bike used by British paratroopers behind enemy lines.  The Classic 500 'Pegasus' is inspired by the legendary RE/WD Flying Flea 125 motorcycle, which was manufactured at Royal Enfield's underground facility in Westwood, UK, during the war.  It has been conceived as a chance to own a piece of motorcycle history, with only 1,000 units to be made available globally, of which 190 will be available in Britain. The Pegasus will be open for bookings online from July at a price tag of 4,999 pounds.  ""The story of the Flying Flea is both remarkable and inspiring, and it has a history like no other motorcycle,"" said Royal Enfield CEO Siddhartha Lal after a grand launch ceremony in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, today.  Describing the Classic 500 Pegasus as a homage to the legendary war stories and to the resilience and pedigree of Royal Enfield, he added: ""Rugged military motorcycles have been an integral part of Royal Enfield's heritage and continues to be till date, as we endeavour to build classic, simple, enduring motorcycles.  ""Our machines have played important role in both World Wars, earning a reputation for endurance in the toughest conditions.""  Royal Enfield, which pitches itself as the oldest motorcycle brand in continuous production, produced munitions, artillery equipment and motorcycles during both World Wars. It continues to supply the Indian armed forces with motorcycles today.  ""Royal Enfield was called upon during World War I to supply motorcycles to the British armed forces and also for the Imperial Russian Government, and continues to make simple, authentic, classic motorcycles till today. But by far its most storied wartime creation was the airborne troops' 'Flying Flea', a compact and capable, two-stroke 125cc motorcycle that saw action in some of greatest battles of World War II, including D-Day and Arnhem,"" a company statement said.  As the Allies fought to establish a beachhead in Normandy, Northern France, in preparation for the invasion of German-occupied Western Europe, hundreds of Flying Fleas and James ML motorcycles streamed from landing craft on to the beaches.  Speaking about the Flying Flea's role during the D-Day operation, Gordon May, Royal Enfield historian, said: ""The ramp would touch down and out would come the motorcycles. They were used as a means of rounding up troops and getting them forward and also accompanying troops much as a convoy escort rider would have done.""  During World War II, tens of thousands of Royal Enfield motorcycles were shipped to almost every theatre of conflict. But the Flying Flea was the only ""proper"" motorcycle to be dropped successfully behind enemy lines with paratroopers, with the UK War Department ordering more than 4,000.  Mark Wells, Royal Enfield's Head of Global Product Strategy and Industrial Design, explains: ""It was really important to work closely with the Ministry of Defence, so we approached the Parachute Regiment about 18 months ago and said we'd like work together on a project and the collaboration has been great.  ""These new Classic 500 Pegasus motorcycles encapsulate a lot of the history and legacy of Royal Enfield. This is something only Royal Enfield could have done. Many brands have military motorcycles in their past but only Royal Enfield has the Flying Flea.""  Each of the 1000 new Classic 500 Pegasus motorcycles wears a maroon and blue Pegasus emblem - the official Parachute Regiment insignia - on the fuel tank along with an individual stencilled serial number. The famous Royal Enfield ""Made Like a Gun"" decal on the battery box is another reminder of the machine's heritage.  The Pegasus motorcycles' markings are based on a genuine World War II Flying Flea used by the 250th (Airborne) Light Company, now in Royal Enfield's official collection at the company's UK Technology Centre. The new motorcycles will be painted in the wartime colours of Service Brown and Olive Drab Green, except in India, where only Service Brown will be available.  An array of Gear, inspired by this decorated motorcycling legacy, will also be made available. Ranging from shirts, t-shirts, caps, lapel pins, bags and helmets, the limited-production and accessories of this collection are also adorned by the official military insignia and the Pegasus emblem, the company said.  Each of limited-edition motorcycles will come with a bespoke set of military-style canvas panniers bearing the Pegasus logo. Each motorcycle will have authentic markings of military motorcycles, including brown handlebar grips, a leather strap with brass buckles across the air filter, blacked out silencers, rims, kickstart, pedals and headlight bezel to complete the period look.  Royal Enfield, a division of Eicher Motors Limited, made its first motorcycle in 1901."

The Nifty50 index failed to cross the previous day’s high and corrected towards the 10,420 level on Wednesday. It formed a bearish candle on daily chart and witnessed sharp selling in the later part of the session.

It was making lower highs and lower lows for last six sessions and was not ready to surpass any immediate resistance. Now if it sustains below 10,500 level, then weakness could drag it towards 10,350-10,333 zone. The index needs to negate the formation of lower highs and lower lows in order to get any short-term stability, else weakness could persist.

There was significant Call writing at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,600, which shift its resistance lower while Put unwinding happened at 10,500 and fresh Put writing was seen at 10,400.

76,2018-05-24,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: It's a sweet and sour feeling the way March quarter earnings have panned out so far.

The short point is there were only a few positive surprises as the season enters its last lap. And the numbers at best are in line with market expectations. 

A few consumption-driven sectors continued with their recent volume-driven growth. But red flags are going up. Rising raw material costs could play a spoilsport for some of them, going ahead. PSU banks with record losses disappointed the most. 

Combined sales of 1,040-odd companies -- apart from PSU and private banks -- climbed 14.9 per cent while their net profit surged 37 per cent on a low base last year. The March quarter of 2017 turned out to be painful for India Inc because of the cash ban announced in November 2016.

Top line rose to Rs 11,55,547 crore compared with Rs 10,05,488 crore in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line for the universe swelled to Rs 1,06,437 crore from Rs 77,801 a year earlier. 

On a sequential basis, sales for these companies went up 7.62 per cent. Profit advanced 4.14 per cent, Capitaline data showed, as compiled by ETMarkets.com.

Banks, especially PSU ones, made jaw-dropping NPA provisions during the March quarter. The result: as many as 14 banks reeled under losses amounting to Rs 46,593 crore. This includes PNB's record loss of Rs 13,416.90 crore. SBI (Rs 7,542 crore), Canara Bank (Rs 4,860 crore) and Allahabad bank (Rs 3,510 crore) suffered huge losses too. 

To give you a perspective, these 14 PSU lenders had reported Rs 4,338 crore loss in the year-ago quarter. If private and public lenders are taken into account, the 1,070 firms reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 71,072 crore for January-March.

""So far, the earnings season has been on expected lines. The upgrades and downgrades are by and large equal to each other following which the earnings estimate for the next year has only been marginally cut by about a per cent,"" said Neelotpal Sahai of HSBC Asset Management India.

From the Nifty bloc, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints, SBI, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Vedanta, HCL Tech, Wipro, Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel fell short of profit estimates. Others such as Bajaj Auto, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Lupin, Zee Entertainment, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Yes Bank came out on top.

""Consumer-oriented sectors from paints to consumer staples delivered not only good results, but very strong commentary on revenue and margin expansion. In some ways, that bullish guidance actually surprised me because I felt that commodity price spike would make them a little more circumspect about margins. Both consumer discretionary and staples are doing fine. Energy companies too performed well,"" Manishi Raychaudhuri of BNP Paribas told ET Now.

For the FMCG sector, what worked is the revival in rural growth, which has beaten the figure for urban areas for three quarters now. 

Metal companies have been putting up a strong earnings show, buoyed by a pick-up in metal prices. This partly hurt outlook for automakers though, which points to further impact of raw material inflation in H1 FY19. They may partially try to offset it by passing on the cost to consumers, said Motilal Oswal Securities. 

The squeeze was on the telecom sector, which saw ARPU downtrading due to renewed competition. That means Ebitda margin for the telcos may remain under pressure, going forward.

""Earning have been mixed bag so for, with IT , Cement , FMCG, Metal, Select private sector banks performing better on revenue, margin and net profit parameters. Some of the high frequency economic data-points such cement production, air traffic growth, petrol/diesel consumption, automobile sales among others, suggest a strong recovery in the economy. Revival in urban demand along with good monsoon led recovery in rural demand would augur well for the economy and corporate earnings,"" said Hemang Jani of Sharekhan. 

For the IT sector, FY19 should see an improvement on a low FY18 base, but the outlook is not exactly euphoric, the brokerage noted. According to Raychaudhuri, the currency depreciation has been a tailwind for software firms.

""In oil and gas space, refining margins have been good. Marketing margins have also been good after a tepid Q3 FY18. Outlook remains uncertain in light of high oil prices, a depreciating rupee, unwillingness of the government to cut excise duties on auto fuels, and the upcoming elections,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said.

Results of cement companies came in above expectations, led by lower-than-expected price decline and a better cost curve. The impact of higher petcoke and diesel prices was mitigated by better operating leverage and other cost efficiency measures, the brokerage added.

Jani said that the outlook for cement sector remains neutral as players across regions except eastern markets will continue to experience pricing pressure.""Moreover high Fuel expenses & logistics cost will keep margins under pressure,"" he said. 

So, where does that leave us with? The market will continue to be more truncated in favour of companies that can grow with earnings visibility, said Dhananjay Sinha of Emkay Global Financial Services.

""A rise in crude prices which can put pressure on margins due to higher Input costs. It could havesome growth and revenue repurcusion for FMCG, Cement , automobile sector. A rise in metal prices can be dampaner for construction & automotive industry & electrical component industry. Most of the Managements have shown concern regarding higher commodity prices . However, they said they will take price hike if required to pass on the higher RM cost. But we believe price hike might be challenging,"" Jani said."

80,2018-05-28,Eicher,"Shubhranshu Singh, who was head of marketing at television network Star Sports, is set to join Royal Enfield on Monday as the head of global brand, people in the know of the matter said.

Prior to his long stint at Star, Singh was the marketing director at Visa and Diageo India and a marketing manager at Hindustan Unilever.

Royal Enfield didn’t respond to an email seeking comment until press time. Singh couldn’t be contacted.

Singh is joining the maker of the Bullet motorcycle at a time when it is trying to expand the Royal Enfield brand appeal to international markets and attain leadership in the mid-size motorcycle space.

Approaching a sales milestone of million motorcycles a year, it will now be challenging for Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield to sustain growth of 25-30%, said a person close to the company adding, it will be the role of a marketing manager to look from where he can help the brand secure the next one million.

Eicher chief executive Siddhartha Lal, who has fashioned a major comeback for 115-year-old British iconic brand after the company took over Royal Enfield, says he wants the brand to be India's first global consumer brand.

While product is at the core of company's future growth, Siddhartha Lal, the CEO of the company has told ET in the past, that he is in the business of brands and his vision is clear to be global brand and eye leadership in the mid-size motorcycle space in the world by offering leisure biking option to the upgrades.

Securing an MBA degree specializing in international business from Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, Singh kicked off his career with Hindustan Unilever as area sales manager overseeing sales and distribution for the soaps and detergents portfolio in the northern belt of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Chandigarh.

He eventually worked with various organizations, which include Seranova Inc, HCL Perot system, Syntel Inc, before joining HUL again in December 2004.

In his second stint at HUL Singh worked as marketing manager for household care (Vim Domex and Cif portfolio), marketing Manager Lakme (Color Cosmetics and Skincare) and Marketing Manager Deodorants (Axe and Rexona). Various terms at Diageo, Visa and Star Sports offered Singh a diverse experience which will put him in good stead at Royal Enfield.motorcycles"
78,2018-05-28,Eicher,"Over the past 18 months, fund managers faced two structural disruptions — demonetisation and GST — which posed a challenge in selecting companies. Besides, while the micros improved, a few key macro indicators — crude oil and interest rates — showed signs of deterioration. A few largecap and midcap funds sailed through these challenges and delivered more than 15 per cent returns. Buying into financials, consumption, consumer discretionary and playing themes like unorganised to organised and spotting good investment ideas in IPOs helped these fund managers create alpha.


INVESCO INDIA GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FUND

Fund Manager: Amit Ganatra and Taher Badshah 

Assets Under Management: ₹484 crore 

Top Holdings: HDFC bank, Reliance and Indusind Bank

Return: 21.31 per cent
A mix of large- and mid-cap stocks, style neutral, with 75 per cent of its portfolio allocation to growth, and 25 per cent to value, helped the fund emerge a winner post demonetisation. Buying growth at a reasonable price and rarely buying a high price stock have helped the fund come up with stellar returns. Buying IT as a contra play with stocks like HCL Tech, Cyient and Infosys ahead of others along with participation in IPOs such as Mishra Dhatu, Shankara Building and Apex Frozen helped deliver higher returns.


AXIS EQUITY FUND

Fund Manager: Shreyash Devalkar 

Assets Under Management: ₹1,989 crore 

Top Holdings: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti

Return: 20.42 per cent
A stickler to quality and growth, the fund manager picks up companies with high ROE, superior quality cash flows and corporate governance. Post demonetisation, the fund manager was quick to spot money coming into the formal banking system and went overweight on banks and NBFCs, like HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance. This along with being overweight on consumption and automobiles, participation in IPOs like Avenue Supermarts and Endurance Technologies helped the fund deliver superior returns. The fund avoided value traps like PSU banks, pharmaceuticals and information technology, which helped it stay ahead of its peers.


ICICI PRUDENTIAL FOCUSED BLUECHIP EQUITY FUND

Fund managers: S Naren, Rajat Chandak 

Assets Under Management: ₹17,142 crore 

Top Holdings: ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Infosys

Return: 16.64 per cent
Post the demonetisation announcement, a key mantra which the scheme’s managers followed was sticking to the leader in a given sector. This strategy worked especially well when normalcy returned. The fund managers focused on buying companies in the consumption space, especially discretionary, such as Maruti, TVS Motor, Motherson Sumi and Bajaj Finserv. The fund managers already owned these in their portfolio. Post demonetisation, they enhanced exposure to these stocks. The fund also made profitable gains in IPOs such as Avenue Supermarts.


KOTAK SELECT FOCUS FUND
Fund Manager: Harsha Upadhyaya 
Assets Under Management:₹19,228 crore 
Top Holdings: HDFC Bank, L&T, RIL
Returns: 15.33 per cent
One of the key themes which helped the fund manager sail through demonetisation times is revival in the rural economy. Keeping this in mind, he bought in FMCG and auto companies. Besides rural recovery, he also focused on the consumer discretionary theme. Some of these companies which he bought in due to cheap valuations include Britannia, Godrej Consumer Products, Bata, Mahindra & Mahindra and Hero MotoCorp. To insulate the scheme’s portfolio from any downfall, the fund manager was prompt enough to stay away from stocks which have been facing adverse business situation.


RELIANCE LARGE CAP FUND

Fund manager: Sailesh Raj Bhan 

Assets Under Management: ₹9,833 crore 

Top Holdings: SBI, HDFC Bank, ITC

Returns: 16.37 per cent
After the announcement of demonetisation, a large number of quality companies were available 30-40% cheaper than what they were trading before. This fall in premium in valuation of quality companies attracted high interest from fund managers. The fund manager focused on companies which could generate aggressive growth largely because of their size and market share. These were Eicher Motors, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Larsen & Toubro. He stayed away from defensives and enhanced exposure to companies which captured the consumer discretionary theme quite well. These include Bajaj Finance and Chola Finance.

83,2018-05-31,Eicher,"Overseas portfolio investors, or FIIs, have been largely bearish on Indian equities so far in 2018. But there are a few companies FIIs would not desert no matter how bad the future outlook gets.

For last 40 quarters, FII holdings in nearly 100 companies from the BSE500 index have been hovering above their mean and median. No marks for guessing, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is the most favoured firm among them all. 

FIIs held 74 per cent stake in the country’s biggest mortgage lender as of March 2018 compared with the median and mean of 73.40 per cent and 69 per cent in last 40 quarters, data available with corporate database Ace Equity showed. Shares of HDFC have grown nearly 275 per cent in last 10 years.

HDFC reported strong growth in loan disbursement for March quarter as well as for FY18. Reliance Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,372.

Then there are a couple of private lenders FIIs seem to be backing steadfastly. They include HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and City Union Bank. At the end of March, 2018, FII holding in each one of these was higher than the median and mean holdings of past 10 years. 



“I would stick with HDFC Bank, because it has got the balance sheet strength to move into the corporate space and take up market share, which has been vacated by PSB banks,” Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities, told ETNow in an interaction.

Foreign portfolio investors have been rather cautious on Indian equities this year, having been net sellers in 32 out of 40 sessions till May 29; meaning they offloaded more shares than what they bought on all these days.

FIIs’ net outflow so far in 2018 has been Rs 640 crore against total net DII inflow of over Rs 48,000 crore. 

A shift in yield dynamics between the developing and developed world, weakness in emerging market currencies against the greenback, softer earnings growth, concern over corporate governance issues and political risks ahead of the general elections in 2019 are some of the factors that have kept FIIs jittery. 



Auto companies Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra and Mahindra, Eicher Motors also have pride of place on the list of FII favourites. Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied over 9,500 per cent in last 10 years, while those of Maruti Suzuki have jumped over 1,000 per cent in the same period. Global brokerage Credit Suisse is ‘neutral’ on Maruti Suzuki with a target price of Rs 9,800.

Jefferies recently upgraded its target price for M&M to Rs 975 from Rs 860 earlier. “Mahindra & Mahindra is among our preferred rural picks and FY19 growth outlook remains positive across tractors, LCVs and PVs,” the brokerage said.

FII holdings in pharma firms IPCA Laboratories, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Jubilant Life Sciences at the end of March quarter were nearly the same as the average and median of the previous 40 quarters.

Centrum Broking has maintained a ‘hold’ rating on Dr Reddy’s Labs with a target price of Rs 2,000 (earlier Rs 2,450). The stock traded at Rs 1,983 on May 29.

Several midcap stocks, many of which have been multibaggers in recent months, such as Astral Poly Technik, Page Industries, Kajaria Ceramics, Supreme Industries, Britannia Industries, Motherson Sumi System, Balkrishna Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, SRF, Shilpa Medicare, Phillips Carbon Black and Titan Company too figure on the list of top 100 FII favourite companies in India. Even in the most bearish times, these overseas investors have rarely sold shares on these counters.

Edelweiss Investment Research is positive on Phillips Carbon Black with a target price of Rs 328, indicating an upside of over 30 per cent from current level. 

Cholamandalam Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on Balkrishna Industries with a target price of Rs 1,327. Shares of Balkrishna Industries are up over 1,600 per cent in last 10 years.

FIIs are also looking confident on oil and gas majors Petronet LNG, Hindustan Petroleum, Gujarat State Petronet, IGL and Bharat Petroleum. At the end of March quarter, their stakes in these companies were higher than their mean and median holdings of last 10 years."

13,2018-06-05,Eicher,"After giving a lacklustre performance for the past several years, Axis Bluechip Fund has managed to reverse the trend and it is back in the reckoning. The scheme, which invests primarily in largecaps, has beaten its peers in the past year by a wide margin. It has given close to 20 per cent returns in a year, while its peers have generated returns in the range of 7-12 per cent.

There are a few reasons why the scheme has done well. First, the scheme’s fund manager Shreyash Devalkar, who joined the fund house in November 2016, focused on quality and growth companies which was in sync with the flavour of the markets. The factors he kept in mind while selecting companies included high return on equity (RoE), revenue and margin growth, and market penetration. Three sectors met these criteria: retail-focused banks, auto and auto-ancillaries, and consumption. Recently, Devalkar also enhanced exposure to quality companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors and Larsen & Toubro.

Besides, unlike his peers, Devalkar reduced the scheme’s exposure to midcaps to 6 per cent and took the share of large-sized companies to over 90 per cent. Hence, in the past year, when mid-sized companies fell, Axis Bluechip’s returns did not fall as much as its peers. This has helped in outperformance of the scheme. In the past three- and five-year periods, the scheme has delivered 11 per cent and 15.6 per cent returns, respectively, while its benchmark, Nifty50, has given 9 per cent and 13 per cent returns during the same periods. Therefore, investors may consider investing in the Axis Bluechip Fund.

Expert take: HARSHVARDHAN ROONGTA, CFP, Roongta SecuritiesThe scheme’s AUM is relatively smaller when compared to some of the other largecap schemes. This has enabled it to invest in selected high-conviction companies, which resulted in better performance when compared to its peers and the benchmark index. Investors looking for a concentrated portfolio aiming to benefit from growth in consumer spends can invest in this scheme with a minimum time horizon of three years."

21,2018-06-08,Eicher,"Smart investors, who spotted the trend early and shifted focus to largecaps in early 2018, have not only managed to protect their wealth in the recent carnage, but have made money too! Some have done it even in midcap and smallcap stocks, and how! 

Nifty Smallcap100 and Midcap100 indices are down up to 20 per cent this year, while the benchmark Nifty50 is still holding its head above water. 

A couple of largecaps drew investors’ attention this year, with IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surpassing the $100 billion market capitalisation in April, and stocks like HUL, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints scaling fresh all-time highs over the past one month. The Infosys stock is hovering around its highest level in two years. 

The theme is pretty clear: it’s a year for fundamentally strong businesses and those that have been trying to tap demand revival.

Most analysts are bullish on the largecaps despite the depression in the broader market in recent times. They are advising investors to add some stocks from this segment to protect their portfolios against volatility ahead of the general elections in 2019.

There are expectations that the largecaps may provide some cushion to investor portfolios as their valuations are lower compared with those of midcaps and smallcaps.

As many as 21 stocks from the Nifty pack were trading in the green so far this year, with Tech Mahindra up 37.50 per cent till June 6, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 31.58 per cent), Tata Consultancy Services (up 30.46 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 25.21 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 22.78 per cent), Infosys (up 19.73 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 18.23 per cent).

The 50-share index moved from 10,435 on January 1 this year to trade at 10,684 on June 6. 

Largecaps look attractive compared with midcaps and smallcaps at this point of time, Sankaran Naren, Executive Director, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, told ETNow in an interview.

Brokerage Sharekhan prefers HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS. HCL Tech has advanced over 3 per cent on a year-to-date basis. Managements of most IT companies have indicated that CY2018 would be better year compared with the previous one, thanks to some large deal wins, improving macro environment in key geographies, demand in certain industry pockets, emerging demand in digital, higher outsourcing demand from European clients and benefits of a weaker rupee.

Shares of HUL, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints and HDFC have gained between 10 per cent and 17 per cent in this period.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse has a ‘buy’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,750. Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target of Rs 2,251.

“Largecap valuations are far more reasonable than the second-rung stocks. Select largecap companies with rich valuations are also among the top picks right now when it comes to future growth visibility,” said Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director, Ladderup Wealth Management.

Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says the margin of safety is better in largecap names than in midcaps and smallcaps.

“There is certainty in terms of how the numbers will pan out,” he said.

More than 70 stocks from Nifty Midcap100 index gave negative returns to investors in 2018. Vakrangee, PC Jeweller, Adani Power and Suzlon Energy have plunged up to 93 per cent.

On the other hand, select midcap names like Mindtree, Indiabulls Ventures, Jubilant FoodWorks, Mphasis and Gruh Finance have risen up to 67 per cent in the same period. Gruh Finance hit an all-time high of Rs 381 on June 7.

There are takers for quality in any market. “I think it is time to buy into some of the quality companies in the midcap space, where the comfort level is on the higher side. Forget the index, this correction is a welcome opportunity for investors,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Smallcap stocks like Gitanjali Gems, Diamond Power, Bombay Rayon and Electrosteel Steels have slipped up to 91 per cent. 

There are specific pockets in the midcap and the smallcap segments, which are qualitative in nature, and earnings growth in this space can still be far better over the next two years, said Joshi of Angel Broking.

Coal India, YES Bank, L&T, Titan Company, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, ITC, Power Grid and Eicher Motors are other largecap stocks, which have been trading in the green so far in 2018.

23,2018-06-09,Eicher,"In the quest to milk its iconic motorcycle brand Royal Enfield, widely called Bullet, the favourite of the best bikers in India, its owner Eicher Motors is adopting a strategy that mirrors what other iconic brands have successfully monetised.

Royal Enfield is not just a bike. The company wants to create a new revenue stream by selling its own branded gears, accessories, apparels and more. Royal Enfield gear like T-shirts and helmets can be found in standalone stores at Khan Market in Delhi or in Colaba, Mumbai, where the core business is just gears and accessories and not bikes.

The non-motorcycle business (spares, apparel’s, accessories etc) accounted for 8% of Royal Enfield’s total business in FY-17, which is estimated to have crossed 10% in FY-18 and Eicher sees it more than doubling in the next five years. People in the know say it could potentially be a $800 million to a billion dollar business - about the same size as Ferrari’s non car business or Harley Davidson or Triumph motorcycles - i.e. a quarter of the total revenues.

As the riding culture grows in India, motorcycling is becoming a way of life say biking connoisseurs. Owning a brand like a Royal Enfield, Triumph or Harley is a fashion statement now. Not surprisingly, the company is ensuring that its gears and apparels are found in upmarket locations across the country. Royal Enfield gears, T-shirts, jackets, helmets and shoes can be found in standalone stores of Khan Market in Delhi or in Colaba, Mumbai, where the core business is just gears and not bikes.

Apart from standalone stores, the company has gradually seeded itself in retail chains like the Central Mall across half a dozen locations, which eventually will turn into double digits, where Royal Enfield will retail its gears, helmet and apparels amongst other things.

Speaking on the sidelines of Royal Enfield Classic 500 Pegasus limited edition launch, Samrat Som, head, apparel and accessories business at Royal Enfield told ET “the whole idea is how do you convert the newly converted motorcycling chap? Inspire him to adopt motorcycling as his “way of life?” through the apparels and accessories the company is constantly able to engage with the customer during the entire ownership lifecycle, says Som.


Som declined to give the numbers but agreed on the potential growth of 100s of millions of dollars.

“I can’t quote numbers but these are potential opportunities. We know that a successful motorcycle business like ours could have a sizable turnover coming from non-motorcycle business like global peers,” added Som.

And the potential is something that has begun to look apparent. At 8 lakh units, Royal Enfield branded helmet was the fourth largest brand in the country in FY-18. In the year gone, Royal Enfield sold more than 1 lakh riding gears and 8 lakh helmets. For every 7 motorcycles that Royal Enfield sold last year, it sold one gear.

The company says usually jackets and helmets are considered purchase decision, but out of its experience of selling gears and accessories, the company has started getting a lot of impulse buying at these retail stores. Interestingly 33% of the total helmet sales come from the central departmental store for the company. Eicher is focussing on high footfall areas or malls to generate additional business. It is also in discussion with several other mall majors like Phoenix for further expansion.

All this is apart from more than 800 touch points – which will cross 1000 in few years where it sells gears, apparels, shoes in some form or the other. Royal Enfield is also leveraging the online platform to give access to brand Royal Enfield, apart from its own online platform. The company sells its merchandise through Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra among others. Sales through ecommerce accounts for 16% of the total non-motorcycle business.

Vimal Sumbly, managing director of Triumph India Motorcycles, said 12.5% of his company’s revenues come from non-motorcycle business of gears, accessories, parts and that segment of business has been doubling every year.

“Globally, bike majors enjoy about 15% to 25% of their total revenue from gears and accessories business, but the potential in India is huge. Our nonmotorcycle business should touch 20% in the next three years,” added Sumbly.

Triumph has been increasing its fashion clothing collection rapidly and with every new launch, the company offers over 50 customisation or accessorisation option to its customers. Triumph has summer, winter and core biking clothing options. The apparels are no more restricted just for the male rider. Either. There are options available for the entire family including the women and kids.

Indian brands can potentially enjoy almost a third of their business from allied segments, which is double of the global average thanks to the huge bike park and growing number of millennials, said the head of Triumph Motorcycles in India. “The youth of today is not buying a product; he or she is buying into the brand.

They are buying into a lifestyle. Their understanding of brand is very sharp and they like to express and indulge themselves. All this presents a huge opportunity for motorcycle brands like ours to keep them engaged with the brand,” added Sumbly.

This area of business is a big space for vehicle makers to tap into and these are highly margin accretive to the business as well.

Even for a new entrant like Ducati which entered in 2013, the share of apparels and accessories already accounts for 16-21% of the overall market. “It is a very important part of business and an avenue to build a brand. We always say, that when you sell a bike, you dont sell just the bike, you also need to sell accessories along with it. There are hundreds of options available for a rider to personalise his bike. He can buy add ons that match his personality or the kind of ride he prefers - on road, off road, ride on the hills, appropriate accessories are available to enhance the ride,”said Sergi Canovas, MD at Ducati India Pvt Limited."

A football team is composed of 11 players; attackers or commonly known as forwards, midfielders, defenders and a goalkeeper who work in sync to score goals and defend the territory.

In the same way, an investor’s portfolio should be made up of high-risk, high-return stocks – the forwards in the football terminology, growth stocks – the midfielders, stocks performing in line with the markets - the defenders, and high dividend yield stocks who perform in good or bad times by giving out dividends – the goalkeeper.

When the above combination of stocks is made, then the portfolio can provide protection against loss and at the same time deliver big gains.

Yuu have culled this very interesting quote from Phil Fisher which says that it seems logical that even before thinking of buying any common stock, the first step is to see how money has been most successfully made in the past. Is it imperative that the stock has to have given 20-30% returns in the past?
The quote is much broader. What happens is that in every country, every market, a set of companies do well. It is not that in every country, every business does well. Take two-wheeler companies. In India, they are the bluest of blue chips. You have three-four of them and they are thriving and making money. There is no other country like that. In China, they may have bigger two-wheeler companies but even there, no two-wheeler company I making money. They make lot of two-wheelers but they do not make a lot of money. 

Even the way private sector banks are making money in India is seen in very few countries. They make money but not that much. So, you have to understand in which country which business is doing well. Once you grasp that, then you go to find the companies which are likely to do well because say we go from India to Japan. The companies in Japan are different from companies in India. I was there in Japan two-three months back, the businesses are very different. They are more electronic components, global market share.


They are way ahead…
I mean not ahead or anything like that…


In terms of technology…
Yes. Their whole focus is very different, competitive advantages are very different. Their competitive advantages are global in character because it is a very small country relatively but they have global ambitions. Most of the companies are globally competitive and so that is a very different dialogue when you go to the management room than what it was in India.


Let us drill it down to how you are looking at hunting for quality in this market. You are talking about indicators to classify a stock. At the very core, that is the problem that people have. There is such a big universe of stocks. What are the indicators that will drill it down to specific names that one would be interested in investing?
That is a process. Find out what is the current profitability? The Code Of Great, Good, Gruesome in 2007, page seven of Buffett letter is very illustrative of how to look at the companies. Companies or business will keep moving from one to other. 

There are three types of companies in every country, every market. If we look at only India, 4,000 companies are listed. There are three types of companies – great, good, gruesome. These are like three bank accounts. Buffett started investing in 1941. After 60 years, he realised that there are three types of businesses only. He explained in 2007, what is a great business and what is a good business? First, good business is something where cost of money, says 8-10% in India, earns about 19-20%. All the good banks like HDFC Bank and others earn about 19-20%. So on Rs 100 crore, they make Rs 20 crore profit every year.

You put in Rs 100 crore at the beginning of the year and the output you get is Rs 120. If you want to double the money, if you want to double the profit from 20 to 40, you have to put another Rs 100 crore. So, after three or four years, if you do not pay out dividends, all the money which you earned has to be redeployed to double the profit in three years’ time. 

So 20% return on equity. 20% you put in the bank, it will again earn 20% more and hence year after year, keep compounding and in three-and-a-half – four years it will double the profit. But at that point of time. your money deployed will be about Rs 200 and on that he will earn Rs 40. Again, your ratio remains the same 20%. That is a good business, this is what typical good capital intensive businesses like banks and all they keep doing. 

Now what is great? Great is what you start with say 20% first year, second year you do 25%, then 30%, then 40%, then 50%, 60%, 100% and then you do not need any capital to make money. It is like getting cane juice without putting in canes. There are very few of them like that.


In the Indian context…?
Yes Asian Paints, Nestle, Lever, IndiGo and so far unless they change the base model and all these global companies, FANG companies your Google, Microsoft, they all make money without putting any money.

So, that is a great company. 1% or 2% would be great companies. In India, if you have maybe 50-60 companies which are great companies, about 300 to 400 companies will be good companies. Then there is a long list of gruesome companies. 

It is important not to understand good and great. But what are the bad companies? Time is a friend of good companies and a big enemy of bad companies. This is a difference between gold or real estate and stocks. It is very necessary that if you want to become rich through the stock market, in the long run, you have to buy good companies.


You are looking at such a polarised market. Only 15-20 stocks are looking good….
Do not jump, let us finish this gruesome because that is the most important part. I read 45 times before I understood these gruesome companies are the companies which not only earn less than cost of capital, say 10% is cost of capital, for some reason you are earning 4-5% or you are actually making losses. Losses are no problem because you realise that this is a danger zone but if you are making 5% return on capital, on Rs 100, you are making Rs 5. If you want to double the profit from Rs 5 to Rs 10, and you have put in Rs 100. it will take like 15-20 years to make Rs 100. 

So, you go and borrow that money from the banks and put in that use as business. Eventually if there is any tough time and typically these is low return companies always face bad times. It becomes a process of capital destruction all the way for the banks, for the entrepreneurs and of course the person who has invested year after year. Nothing goes go zero straight away. They will go from 20% to 10%, 10% to 5% and then negative.


How easy is it to identify gruesome companies?
Very easy.


In hindsight everybody knows a JP Infra went bust, RCom went bust but at that time, was it easy to identify ? Or would think two years ago that ICICI Bank which is a great retail entity, will face such issues?
Yes, actually it is very easy. You look at the 10 years return ratios. The EBITDA margin, PAT margin, asset turnover and then finally they give you ROC and ROE. Whenever you look at the company, first you go to that ratio screen. At least, I do that. You ask me some new company anywhere in the world I will go to that ratio. It is like a janam patri (horoscope) of any company. 

It will tell you how it has been doing, its profitability, capital efficiency. You have to use the ratios in combination, it is like artwork in the sense that it shows what ratio is to be seen in a particular company. It will show if the company is temporarily profitable with a lot of compromises in the terms of trade. 


Can I use an example here, Dish TV?
I do not remember. It was not a great company till say a year back. I do not know what is the situation today. Have they actually turned around?

They did but then they are again making losses. Now, of course Mr Jhunjhunwala is buying into it. So, return on equity and return on capital employed are very important ratios and you have to look at them in conjunction with the overall profitability of the business but is there something that helps?


Past and future are two different things. Past had been patchy but you know that. What is lying in future? There could be a change of the competitive structure, say like say telecom. Till 2003, telecom was in gutter in the sense that nobody was making money.
Suddenly the regulation changes and Bharti was available at 25 bucks, in three years time it went to Rs 1200 and it became one of the most fantastic businesses ever. Then we saw the emergence of 16-17 licenses and the whole competitive structure got destroyed and now from that 16, it has come down to three. Now the repairing of competitive structure is done.

Yet the competitive structure is very intense among these three so it will take some more time but right now it is a bad business. All of the three companies are not making money but it is creating a potential for a huge upside at some point of time. Someday return will come but when, only time will tell.


Once you have identified the good, the great and the ugly, what about pricing because in this kind of a market scenario. the good and the great is coming at a very high price. It is only the rubbish which is available cheap?
Not all, not all.


But largely how important is pricing according to you?
 It is very important. There is no investing unless you buy at reasonable price. Margin of safety has to be there, maybe at times it is 50%, at times it is 33%, at times it is 80-90%. There are companies which have 70-80% kind of margin of safety in mind. 

Margin of safety is in the mind of investor. You may disagree, I may agree so that is where you will sell and I will buy. In our QGLP formula, one is the quality of business. Once quality of business is done, you have to go one by one. If quality of business is not good, you have no business to look at the other four buckets of quality of management, growth, longevity of growth and price. All have to be clear but I can do it simultaneously. But the process is; look at the quality of business, if quality of business is good, look at quality of management, which is most dicey in India. Every company is a piece of art. If that guy in charge does not want to make a nice, clean company in the future, you will not get a nice clean company in the future. Sitting as a minority shareholder what can you do?


I want to put in examples over here. How do you look at the ICIC Bank story? It is a great management…
You are putting an example and you are asking me a direct question.


Do not tell me what you think about the business but since you brought up managements, the lack of trust the business has right now is only because it is going through a leadership transition. Axis Bank has also faced that, PSU banks have faced that. How would you classify these businesses?
Yes. I am reading a book by Taleb, Skin In The Game. It’s a book worth reading, particularly in this context of Indian banking. Mr Kotak gave an interview recently. It was a wonderful interview and there he talked about Skin In The Game of the bankers.

When you are giving Rs 5,000 crore, Rs 10,000 crore, do you really feel that you are giving Rs 10,000 crore to somebody? How much pain do you feel about giving and how much due diligence will you do, apart from the process? Do you feel that money you are giving? When you have skin in the game, you will feel that. 

How do you bring skin in the game in Indian banking? The other side, the borrower has skin in the game. Unlike European and American corporations which are also run by boards and the lenders are also board driven. So, both sides are tie-walas. But in India, the borrowers are entrepreneurs and the lenders are tie-walas. 

One set of bankers have skin in the game and the other set of the bankers do not have skin in the game. How do you bring a level playing field wherein the risk assessment or risk measurement is taken with proper care? Lending is a very simple business at one level and yet very complicated, if you do not price the risk well. 

If you price the risk well and lend to some crook at 30-40%, you will make tons of money. 


Let us talk about the possibility of a gruesome company becoming good and then a good company becoming great. You know which company has actually done that journey and has come on tops. 
We see a lot of these turnarounds. There are tonnes of it. If you keep doing this thing, a company like say Bajaj Finance 8-10 years ago, was a very ordinary non-descript NBFC trying to do financing for two-wheelers as a sister concern. And then everything changed. The new management team came Rajiv Jain and the first two- three years, people like us who were watching from outside, did not realise what is happening and it was already 10x.

 Then at some point, we realised that these guys are winning and they are doing some very extraordinary things. In the same space, they have found a completely new strategy and new target and new way of doing things using computers, AI and all sorts of big data in a much more effective way to give loans in few seconds or few minutes to the customers.

They appointed a completely new segment on the customer loans. It gave a completely new life to that company and you see what has happened to the company. From less than a Rs 1,000-crore market cap to more than Rs 1 lakh crore market cap! It is a 100x in just about five-seven years. 

It is one of the most wonderful stories. In fact, other banks, NBFCs are trying to do a Bajaj Finance in their own banks or wherever. There is admiration for this company. From a completely gruesome or non-descript business or company, it has become one of the awesome examples for the entire finance sector.


Calling Bajaj Finance gruesome would not be really right. It was just another indifferent company. Any gruesome company where you feel the story could turnaround with change of management?
No, how do I know? I would not know.


Nothing on your radar.
No, we would not know. We look back and then we see some signs of it. One of the signs is that whenever a company turns around, the quarterly results will show 70-80% growth, top line 15% growth and then80% profit growth in first quarter, then in second quarter, then third quarter, then yearly. First year, from Rs 50 crore, it goes to Rs 100 crore. You realise something is happening. Then second year again, from Rs 100 crore to Rs 300 crore. Wow! These guys are now rocketing. You know by that time markets do not bother about it. Some insiders, close guys would buy it. The smart guys from Pune or Hyderabad or people close to it. Market caps will be Rs 1000 crore, Rs 2000 crore, Rs 3000 crore and still nobody in the institutional set up will look in.


They will be scared that is the point, they would be like okay there is something…
Something is happening but firstly they should come in radar. Right now the condition of the market is most of these rockets are already taken care of. The close guys the midcap, smallcap, PMS guys and the value pickers have picked up most of them. Five-six years back, that was the fun. You run a screener and you will find one or two ideas and then do masti. That fun is lost right now.


So I can think of two examples where the management really helped in this transition from gruesome to good to great. Maybe not even gruesome but just good to great. Eicher Motors and IndusInd Bank. Again Mr Sobti and Mr Lal are examples of good management changing the business.
So one of the ways a very ordinary or written off or non-descript business becomes great businesses or great companies is when the great managements or right time comes for the management. IndusInd Bank is a absolute classic case. Stock price was Rs 18-20. It is now 100 times or 150 times more.


It is an index company now.
Yes, index company and it is one of the foremost though it was one of the oldest private sector licensee but had not made much headway. Today it is one of the most aspirational private sector banks. In India, there are lots of these stories. That is why India produces the highest number of multibaggers. The number of multibaggers that are produced in India is not found in other parts of the world."

48,2018-06-25,Eicher,"Global trade wars between top economies, surging oil prices, high interest rates, and an uncertain domestic political environment in the run-up to the general elections next year have made the stock markets choppy and volatile. Hence, wealth managers believe investors should look at multi-cap schemes which invest across market capitalisations. Currently, most multicap schemes are tilted towards large caps with reasonably good exposure to highgrowth investment ideas in the midcap space. ET takes a look at five multicap schemes, which have performed better than their respective benchmark indices by a fair margin and have been able to sustain their performance.


Motilal Oswal Multicap 35 Fund
Top 3 holdings: HDFC, HDFC Bank, Maruti 
Assets under management: ₹13,181 crore 
3 year return: 14.52 per cent 
Fund Manager: Gautam Sinha Roy 
Top 10 holdings: 56.03 per cent

The fund manager has built a concentrated portfolio and looks for long-term secular growth stories. He is overweight on financials with NBFCs, housing finance, insurance and private banks accounting for about 45% of the portfolio. As the global environment improved, he added TCS and Infosys to the portfolio. The fund manager has stayed away from telecom, pharma and PSU banks, which helped the fund deliver superior returns. Stocks such as Bajaj Finance, HDFC Standard Life and Eicher Motors have worked well for the scheme.


Axis Focused 25
Top 3 holdings: Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, TCS
Asset under management: ₹4,217 crore
3 year return: 15.44 per cent
Fund Manager: Jinesh Gopani
Top 10 holdings: 55.5 per cent

The fund manager implemented three basic ideas: one, he focused on secular growth stories, which took him to companies with high credit ratings. These companies have been naturally blue chip, which, to a large extent, ensured high growth given their leadership position in their sectors. Two, he generated alpha by focussing on Initial Public Offerings and some listed companies which have a unique positioning in a given sector in comparison with their peers. Lastly, he focused on cyclical themes, and companies that embarked on capex. A few prominent companies which have helped lift the scheme’s performance are Bajaj Finance, Endurance Technologies, Bandhan Bank, Gruh Finance and Kotak Mahindra Bank.


Aditya Birla Sun Life Equity 
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, ITC
Assets under management: ₹9,376 crore
3 year return: 13.92 per cent
Fund Manager: Anil Shah
Top 10 holdings: 35.7 per cent

One of the key variables the scheme’s fund manager has kept in mind while selecting companies in the portfolio is free cash flow. Besides, having a large-cap bias which ensure high-growth sectors. Shah has been prompt enough in buying companies which have shown noticeable improvement in cash flows either through selling non-core assets or reducing debt. This has largely worked for the scheme. Also, the fund has preferred companies which have high earnings visibility, rather than being particularly concerned about their valuations. These factors have helped the fund in creating a diversified portfolio which would largely cover high-growth stories. A few prominent companies that have spruced up the scheme’s returns are Tech Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Tata Steel.


Tata Equity PE Fund
Top 3 holdings: HDFC, Yes Bank, Reliance Industries
Asset under management: ₹3,924 crore
3 year return: 16.3 per cent
Fund Manager: Sonam Udasi
Top 10 holdings: 49.9 per cent

Following the scheme mandate, the fund manager has selected 70% of stocks whose trailing price-to-earnings (PE) multiple is lower than the Sensex’s PE multiple. The remaining 30% of the portfolio can have companies whose PE multiples may be higher than that of the Sensex. The fund manager’s focus on companies with encouraging return ratios, quality management and high visibility of earnings has paid off well in the past three eyars. Winning ideas in financials, such as Yes Bank, City Union Bank and Bajaj Finserv have helped it post a stellar performance.


Invesco India Contra Fund
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, HDFC, Reliance Industries
Assets under management: ₹1,689 crore
3 year return: 14.90 per cent
Fund Manager: Amit Ganatra, Taher Badshah
Top 10 holdings: 46 per cent

Companies that trade below intrinsic value, are in a turnaround phase or have been de-rated due to a temporary change in sentiment are the stocks the fund manager looks out for. These strategies play out over a three-year period. The fund is fairly concentrated, even though it has a long tail, with the top 10 stocks accounting for 40-45% of the portfolio. Early entry into the IT space with exposure to stocks like Infosys, Cyient and HCL Tech has worked well for the fund. IPO bets like Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Apex Frozen gave handsome returns to the portfolio over the past year. The fund was one of the early entrants into the IT space. Higher allocations in IPOs of Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Apex Frozen Foods helped it earn extra returns."

Batria, in his 33 years of building experience has also been associated with Tata Steel (Cement division), Century Textiles & Industries (Cement division) and Eicher Motors and has held key leadership positions. 

""We continue to strengthen our leadership team and are pleased to have Mr. Ujjwal on board to head our manufacturing, sales & marketing and logistics teams,"" said Mahendra Singhi, group CEO at Dalmia Cement (Bharat). ""We are confident that his rich experience and leadership will be a tremendous asset for driving further our growth story,"" Singhi said. 

Dalmia Bharat has been on a major growth drive which is led by the acquisition of distressed cement assets that the company has undertaken since last year. Under the bankruptcy code, the Puneet Dalmia led company has bid for three companies including the 6 MT Binani Cement, the 3 MT Murli Industries and the 1 MT Kalyanpur Cement; assets that will collectively help the company increase scale as well as tap unexplored markets in the heavily regional cement business. 

Out of these, while Murli Industries and Kalyanpur Cement has been bagged by Dalmia Bharat, bidding for Binani Cement saw it locking horns with cement giant UltraTech and is likely to result in the latter's favour.

MUMBAI: VE Commercial Vehicles, India’s fourth-largest commercial vehicle maker, plans to invest more than Rs 2,000 crore in the next three years to enhance capacity and expand its product portfolio. VECV is a joint venture between the Volvo Group and Eicher Motors.

The funds will be utilised in expanding engine making capacity as well as vehicle output by 50%. Plans include an investment into a new plant, the decision on which is going to come up for board approval next month.

Besides annual capital expenditure of Rs 500 crore for the next three years, VECV will be investing an additional Rs 600 crore in the new plant. The company, however, was non-committal on the cumulative investment.

Engine output is being expanded from 50,000 to 75,000 units to meet Volvo’s global needs. And once the new plant is commissioned, VECV’s capacity will be increased from 90,000 units to 140,000 units. Speaking on the side-lines of the launch of the new 41-tonne heavy duty truck in Mumbai on Wednesday Vinod Aggarwal, MD of VECV told ET that the demand environment is very robust and that the company is operating at optimum capacity from the existing plant.

“We are trying to produce more from the existing set-up. We have produced 8,000 units a month, so we can stretch our existing facility. However, we would need a new plant. The decision is likely to be made next month. Once the decision is taken, it will take another 15 months to roll out the first product from the new plant,” Aggarwal said.

Growing consumption, sustained infrastructure and construction activity, ban on overloading and GST benefits are driving demand for commercial vehicles in the country. Aggarwal expects the industry to sustain the double-digit growth momentum for the next two years at least before the BS VI norms kick in, which may lead to price increase of about 10% and subsequent impact on demand.

“We have just crossed the peak of FY12 in the last financial year. For five years, the industry was in hibernation, so clearly there is much more room for growth in the coming two years and we are preparing to participate in this growth,” he said.

Astrong challenger in the light and medium duty truck segment with 33% market share, VECV has remained a marginal player in the heavy duty truck segment with a small 5% market share. The company is banking on the two new launches to help boost volumes. Aggarwal says he expects the heavy duty truck volumes to grow 50% to 1,500 units a month this financial year. After posting 12% growth in FY18, VECV has sustained double digit momentum in the two months of FY19 at 33% on account of alow base of last year."

2,2018-07-03,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Soccer does teach us life lessons. And Fifa World Cup 2018 has simply been outstanding on this count!

Major upsets at both group and knockout stages of the tournament echoed not just the uncertain times we live in, but also behaviour of our markets.

Financial markets globally have become more volatile in recent times than they were a decade ago amid economic shocks, changing money flow dynamics and protectionist trade policies.

Investment gurus say that what Russia did to Spain, South Korea to title defender Germany, Uruguay to Cristiano Ronaldo-led Portugal and France to Leonel Messi’s Argentina have similes to what technology changes have done to many frontline businesses and newer, more aggressive rivals have done to established market leaders.

Dalal Street’s talking class these days is making regular references to the world soccer’s biggest spectacle in Russia to back every investment brief.

We picked a few that show the substance of soccer in your investment world.


Germany’s exitThat’s the biggest lesson, say market pundits. In their failure to get past the group stage, Germans in a way kept a tradition alive: that of title holders biting the dust early.

It happened with 2010 champion Spain in 2014, 2006 champion Italy in 2010 and 1998 winner France in 2002.

Curiously, the bull phases of Indian stock market since the economic liberalisation of 1991 show a similar trend.

Recalls market veteran Basant Maheshwari: In 1992, the entire market was led by Harshad Mehta. There were hopes that the liberal rules would pave the way for more infrastructure development and, hence, cement stocks got rerated. But stocks like ACC, Apollo Tyres, Tata Steel, which had become market darlings, failed miserably thereafter.

Maheshwari is the Managing Director of Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers and author of The Thoughtful Investor.

In early 2000, the entire market was led by Ketan Parekh and the K10 stocks -- also known as the KP pack -- which included Himachal Futuristic Communication, Satyam Computer, Silverline, DSQ, GTL and Aftek Infosys, among others. They hit new highs every second day, only to fizzle out with the dot-com bubble burst.

In 2008, the market was led by infrastructure and real estate stocks such as L&T and Unitech. Telecom major Bharti Airtel, too, enjoyed its day in the sun. Their leadership ended soon after. 

Between 2010 and 2015, the market had a new set of favourites in Page Industries, Eicher Motors and MRF. But in 2017, leftover stocks of the 2008 bull run – GVK, GMR and Lanco Infra – rose from the ashes, Maheshwari points out. 

Leadership has an expiry date, and that applies to stock market, like every other area of life.

“The replacement cost theme of Harshad Mehta days, blue-eyed boys of Ketan Parekh days and 2008’s theme of ‘India as a runner without shoes’ did well without fundamental support, but for very brief spells. Eventually, India never got its shoes, but investors lost their pants,” Maheshwari said.

If valuations are cheap and things are ripe for a bull run, investors should focus on sectors that are getting tailwinds. After taking a ‘top down’ look, pick the stock with best fundamentals, says Gurugram-based value investor Gaurav Sud.


Fall of tiki-taka
Spain is known for the 'tiki-taka' style of soccer, which they use to control a game and frustrate the opponents till the latter commit costly errors.

“When it was new, it made a mark. But now football teams know how to counter it, as was seen not only with Russia, but in the group rounds. But Spain never really changed the base strategy; they never played like champions,” says Sud about the red brigade's early exit from the World Cup.

Creating a moat -- read competitive advantage -- is as important as preserving it. How Patanjali ate into the market shares of established FMCG companies is an example. Dabur India was hit by Patanjali’s honey and Colgate saw pressure in its oral care segment. Patanjali's rise made Hindustan Unilever rethink and come out with Lever Ayush. Both domestic and MNC players have since altered their strategies to counter Baba Ramdev’s company.

Investors should always keep evaluating prospects of their investments, even if the money is invested in the bluest of blue chips. Who knows what emerges next?


Russian roulette
Russia’s victory over Spain is being seen as the biggest upset of the tournament. Football fans worldwide are still in disbelief because they underestimated the determination and home turf advantage of the Russians. 

When oil major Reliance decided to venture into telecom via VoLTE, the analyst community, even while acknowledging that the Mukesh Ambani company had deep pockets, thought lack of VoLTE infrastructure and mobile instruments would stymie the firm’s ability to eat into incumbents’ market share. But Reliance Jio surprised one and all; it not only shook up the entire industry, but also quickly grabbed a large market share, setting off a wave of consolidation. 

The Ambani firm has just pipped Vodafone to become the second largest telecom player in India in revenue terms. 

In Indian IT, industry giants fell behind because they were lazy in capturing the technology shifts, which swept through the industry and completely changed legacy business models.

Investors need to gauge whether a disruption is temporary or has the potential to permanently change industry dynamics. Spain and other football majors paid the price for not evolving their game plans with time! 


Croatia's determinationBe it in soccer or stocks, one has to hold one's nerve. Those who lose theirs and give in to bouts of greed and panic at precisely the wrong moments are bound to suffer, says Jayant Pai, CFP and Head-Marketing at PPFAS Mutual Fund.

Resilience and patience can earn rewards. That’s true for everything in life and investment. That’s the lesson one can draw from dark horses like Croatia or Mexico, which surprised everyone to progress in the tournament upsetting more established rivals.

On the other hand, it also shows overconfidence can bring disaster in any life situation.

Be it in stock investing or football, even gods may fail. Mimicking big investors’ style of investing may not always lead to growth path. How some of the leading wealth managers failed to generate returns for their clients is a fresh example. 

Past performance too is no guarantee of future return. It reminds investors of Warren Buffett's famous saying: ‘In the business world, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield’.


Coaching blunders
Sacking of Spain’s coach Julen Lopetegui at the 11th hour of the event is a case in point.

Julen Lopetegui was sacked for failing to tell his federation about his plans to join Real Madrid. While Spanish media wondered what made Lopetegui accept the coach's job at Real Madrid on the eve of the World Cup, it also squarely put the blame on Spain’s interim head coach Fernando Hierro's decision to bench star player Andres Iniesta in favour of Marco Asensio in the early part of the match against Russia. 

Management change is crucial, even in listed companies. It can be good or plain bad.

Those who had invested in Gitanjali Gems would vouch for it. As CBI and ED chased Mehul Choksi, promoter of the jewellery firm, on money laundering charges, investors paid through their nose.

Nobody can predict scams, but one can always react quickly. One should seriously reconsider an investment rationale when such incidents occur and avoid averaging positions at lower price levels on hopes of getting rewarded in the short term.


Mbappe's Pele moment
French teenage player Kylian Mbappe’s two goals in France’s 4-3 victory over Argentina in the World Cup Round of 16 game has broken a 60-year-old record: he became the first teenager to score more than once in a World Cup match since 1958.

“While Mbappe was being seen as the next big thing in France football, nobody outside France knew him well. The hidden gem came to light only when he sank the Argentine boat. Those who showed faith in the player hit the jackpot. Try identifying performing companies early in their growth cycle,” adds Sud.


What star power? Bye-bye Messi, Ronaldo 
Some called them legends, but Messi (Argentina) and Ronaldo (Portugal) not just failed to take their teams through the first knockout round, but broke hearts of many of their fans, too.

""Over-reliance on one or two ‘stars’ can be hazardous. While they are important, they also require the support of the team. Similarly, it is important that one's portfolio is balanced so that overall returns are not unduly dragged down in case the leaders do not perform as expected,” Pai says further.

“Just the way a team cannot hope to progress solely on the performance of its stars, one’s portfolio should also cannot rely on just a couple of high performers to deliver big gains. A more broadbased portfolio can only help cushion against wild fluctuations in returns,” he points out.

Besides, if you bank upon a stock looking at just the past performance, you may end up in a trap!"

5,2018-07-08,Eicher,"India’s auto industry is likely to report double-digit topline growth for the quarter ended June 2018. A low base effect, strong rural demand and healthy growth in overseas sales are likely to aid top lines and bottom lines for the quarter. 

The sector witnessed a healthy growth momentum in Q1FY19 with two-wheelers growing 15 per cent year-on-year, three-wheeler 67 per cent YoY and commercial vehicles 50 per cent YoY.

The industry took a beating last year as original equipment makers (OEM) had lowered dispatches of vehicles to dealer in order to ensure clearance of channel inventory ahead of GST implementation.

Emkay Global Financial Services believes all automotive manufacturers are likely to report double-digit revenue growth with best performers being Ashok Leyland (over 42 per cent YoY), Bajaj Auto (over 40 per cent YoY), Maruti Suzuki (over 28 per cent YoY), Eicher Motors (over 26 per cent YoY) and TVS Motors (over 26 per cent YoY). 

Despite higher commodity prices, aggregate Ebitda margin (ex-Tata Motors) is likely to expand on a QoQ basis, owing to price hikes and operating leverage benefits, according to Emkay Global. 

The impact of increasing commodity prices including steel and crude oil will partially offset by fall in the price of aluminium, rubber and lead prices. 

Motilal Oswal Financial Services said that Ebitda margin for their auto OEM (ex-JLR) universe is likely to expand (200bps YoY and 60 bps QoQ to 13.8 per cent) for the fourth consecutive quarter, as high commodity costs are offset by price increases and operating leverage. 

Emkay expects companies including Maruti Suzuki (130 bps), TVS Motors (50bps) and Mahindra & Mahindra (40bps) are likely to see a material improvement in margins. “Overall, we forecast Ebitda margin for companies under our coverage (ex-Tata Motors) to expand by 40 bps QoQ (170 bps YoY),” the brokerage house added. Maruti Suzuki is among the top picks of Motilal Oswal, where it believes that Mahindra & Mahindra is the best play on rural market recovery.

The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on July 1 reported a 36.3 per cent increase in total sales at 1,44,981 units in June as against 1,06,394 units in the year-ago month, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported a 26 per cent increase in total sales at 45,155 units in June.

Kotak Institutional Equities also estimated a strong quarter for auto companies with revenue, Ebitda and net profit improving by 26, 50 and 56 per cent YoY. “We expect revenue growth of companies under our coverage, excluding Tata Motors, to increase by 26 per cent YoY (aided by low base effect) and Ebitda margin to improve by 210 bps YoY as the increase in input costs will be more than offset by operating leverage benefits,” Kotak said.

The brokerage expects Ashok Leyland, Balkrishna Industries, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and bearing companies to report a strong quarter. 

Tata Motors is likely to witness a steep compression in margin (250 bps QoQ) on account of lower scale in JLR/standalone operations and commodity inflation.

Going forward, automobile industry is looking in a sweet spot on the back of a cyclical recovery across segments. The stage is looking set for strong growth in automobile demand during the ongoing financial year led by rise in government's infrastructure spending and persistent focus on the rural economy, strong rural demand and new launches. Two wheelers, tractors, passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles segments are likely to witness double-digit volume growth over FY18-20E.

Emkay Global further added that the ongoing financial year would be a good year for companies that are direct or indirect beneficiaries of revival in rural demand, such as Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, M&M, and Escorts. “We also believe that Ashok Leyland would be an outperformer given that it is the best proxy for the MHCV sales upcycle. Tata Motors could spring a surprise, as currency worries subside and momentum in volume growth persists,” the brokerage house said."

8,2018-07-11,Eicher,"By Anjani Trivedi

A moment of silence, please, for the world’s cheapest car, which has all but died in India. It was almost 10 years old. The Nano’s death was confirmed by production numbers: Tata Motors Ltd. produced 1 unit in June, down from 275 in the same month last year. Exports were zero, versus 25 in June 2017. The company acknowledged that the car in its “present form cannot continue beyond 2019.”

The expiry of the “people’s car,” as Tata Motors branded it in 2008, holds lessons for automakers hoping to make it in India: While consumers may be value-conscious, cutting costs to the bone in pursuit of a gimmicky claim to fame is no use if the end result is a second-rate vehicle with a tendency to catch fire.

The Nano’s failure to sell stands in stark contrast to the rest of the Indian car market. From motorbikes to cars and trucks, growth in every segment is picking up. Passenger vehicles, including SUVs, jumped 38 percent in June. Commercial vehicles climbed 42 percent, while two-wheelers – which dominate the market – gained 22 percent.

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the nation’s biggest carmaker, posted volume growth of more than 40 percent. Even a newly defined segment, the quadricycle – a vehicle that weighs less than 475 kilos – is showing signs of an uptick.

This is a market where electric vehicles are non-existent and the chatter over fancy ideas such as future mobility and autonomous vehicles, which pervades the rest of the auto world, is muted.

Still, Indian automakers have tried to get innovative. A widely held view is that they have largely misread the value-oriented psyche of a proud and aspirational middle-class, which scorns handout-like product propositions.

The much-touted Nano – hailed as a “milestone in frugal engineering” – fell short on safety, ran behind schedule and produced questionable crash test results. Eicher Motors Ltd.’s Multix pickup truck that doubled up as an electricity generator was also unsuccessful. Both companies have written off millions of dollars in investment costs.

Tata remains hopeful: A spokesman for the group said the Nano “may need fresh investments to survive.” Yet the evidence suggests that pursuit of the lowest price above all else was misconceived. A more realistic view is that India is squarely a high-volume, few-models game and consumers are focused on value – which means getting as many features as possible for their money.

Large numbers haven’t led to price wars yet, and probably won’t for a while. Indeed, India’s car market has the brightest profitability outlook globally, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts.

Take Hyundai Motor Co., for instance, which has the second-biggest market share after Maruti Suzuki. With some input costs rising, the South Korean carmaker has raised prices of several models and, after decades in India, has started repositioning itself as a high-end brand.

Maruti Suzuki is following a similar trajectory. The company has begun churning out higher-margin vehicles, with its Baleno, DZire and Brezza models now accounting for a larger part of the sales mix than the more basic Alto and Wagon-R. 

The market leader continues to win out, with a share of close to 50 percent across India’s various regions. Maruti Suzuki has been adding capacity and announced last week that it would produce another 750,000 cars over the next two years at its Gujarat plant.

Scale has protected Maruti Suzuki so far. The last time the likes of Volkswagen AG and other foreign carmakers entered the heavily protected Indian market, between 2011 and 2014, its share fell to 40 to 45 percent. This could repeat on the margins if Maruti Suzuki doesn't keep up with the supply pressure. Demand is strong but waiting times are also rising for its cars. In such a market, volume is a good defense as long as it’s sustained.

Past follies will probably be repeated. The idea of recasting the Nano as an electric vehicle for fleet sales has been floated. That’s misguided. Ultimately, the barrier to electric cars is high costs, making the technology unsuitable for an ultra-low-price brand.

Meanwhile, the Indian government isn’t helping by wavering on its grand electrification plans. The high initial price gap means that “we do see a need for incentives to kick-start EV adoption,” analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. note. This is probably why Maruti hasn’t waded into this market in a big way – it can’t do big numbers that make sense.

India may not be ready for the pizazz of futuristic vehicles. But it’s past the point of no-frills metal shells. In between, there’s a sweet spot where carmakers with the right strategy can do well.

11,2018-07-13,Eicher,"Benefits of GST and its offshoot financialisation and formalisation have not even begun to play out and will emerge over next seven years. Those midcap names that are in these spaces will thrive, Vikas Khemani, President & CEO, Edelweiss Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 

What is your view on the market?
The market is in a very interesting phase. The breadth may be missing but the market looks to be touching new high. Only about 10 or 12 odd stocks are contributing to the entire rise.


Is there something wrong with that because everybody is saying this should not happen, this is bad news.
No, there is nothing is wrong with that. It just does not show conviction in the overall width and breadth of the market. But this is only a temporary phase of the market primarily because of a) a lot of macro uncertainty overhang right now. In this environment, the last thing an investor wants to be stuck with is an illiquid scenario. We have largecaps which are liquid, delivering good earnings and have a robust future. 

Investors are looking into defensive kind of ideas which is explained by the rally in the top 10-12 stocks at this point in time and that has contributed to a 800-900 point rise of the Nifty over last year. When the big macro uncertainties around the global rates, elections and oil prices recede, you will start seeing confidence coming back into the market.


But do you fear that at any point these 15 stocks in the Nifty may fall prey to the broader market trend? Could the Nifty stall after making a peak as we are very close to an all-time top? Would it be the broader markets that will catch up with the 15 names? Would the divergence between the slump in the broader market and steadfast rise of the 15 Nifty stocks continue?
It depends on the liquidity and how the macro factors turn out. If the overall liquidity profile towards markets change, you will see all these stocks also giving up some of these gains and that will not have necessarily to do with fundamentals. 

Fundamentals of many of these stocks have remained the same for quite some time and TCS has been up 40% in last few months. They have been guiding earnings growth reasonably well for last three-four quarters. Given the defensiveness of the market, given the fact that most mutual funds have 8- 9% cash in hand, investors are hiding in some of the 15 names. Even if you have confidence in earnings of some of the midcap or smaller caps, the macro environment is not giving you confidence to invest into those stocks.


Is there a higher chance that broader markets will catch up with the index?
Absolutely. The only caveat I would put is that if something untoward were to happen at a global level, then the situation might change. This uncertainty probably will continue over next six to nine months. 


What will drive that uncertainty? Are global cues the biggest risk in the market right now?
There are three big risks. A) Oil price is a very big risk for India and especially as we go towards November 4, when the Iran embargo kicks off. If oil were to go towards $80, $90 or $100, India will be in a very tight spot and we might see some implications both on inflation and interest rates. 

B) We have big elections coming up and that uncertainty looms large over our entire policy front. 

C) How the currency pans out due to trade wars. 

All in all, we are seeing a pretty uncertain environment. We could get clarity on some of them over next three to six months. Some of them might continue for longer but we will get clarity on elections and oil price front.


What could support the markets at these levels? It boils down to earnings and within earnings, IT has rolled out the red carpet. TCS came out with a great set of numbers. Do you think other IT majors can follow through? That overweight position builds only on IT from the start of the year till now, post these earnings call?
We think earnings recovery is on way and we are seeing a broad-based recovery happening. If you were to take corporate facing banks or PSU banks out of the Nifty, you will see almost 25% plus earnings growth in this quarter and a kind of profile that you have been seeking for a long time. 

Earnings growth is definitely happening, demand recovery is there. Across the board, consumer and automobile numbers are picking up very well. We think that IT, automobiles, consumer stocks, banks especially the private sector banks, NBFCs will continue the earnings momentum. 

In our opinion, IT is on a recovery path for next couple of years at least. The recovery has just begun, the order book is very strong, most of the companies are guiding that the demand scenario is very strong and currency weakening only helps them. In that sense, IT trajectory is here to stay for a couple of years.


Are the stock markets already factoring in that or is there still scope to jump on to the IT bus even now and make money?
As long as you are clear about earnings growth which is going to continue, markets are not likely to leave it. We have seen how stocks have continued to remain expensive as long as the earnings growth was there. There would still be fund managers who would not be invested into IT or would be underweight IT and would want to increase weight of IT. They would come and buy. We have seen this trend for the last one year. We have been bullish on IT and we have seen this outperformance happening gradually. As long as earnings continue. I there will not be any let down in IT.


 I am checking at the top traded counters right now purely in terms of value. It is TCS, Reliance, Infosys, HCL Tech. It is not Fortis, it is not any of the midcap stocks. If you have to make a lock and key portfolio where you can see earnings visibility, what would you like to buy today assuming that we will talk about it in 2025 and these can give you a 20-25% return?
In my opinion, definitely some of the private sector banks would be there because we have seen just the beginning of a very big financialisation programme and shift of markets share from public sector to private sector.


Among private banks, there are corporate banks and retail banks. now there are also new age banks like AU Small Finance Bank, Ujjivan Bank, Bandhan Bank. Would you stick to an HDFC or a Kotak Mahindra or would consider the new age banks as well?
All these banks will do very well because everybody is playing in a niche segment. HDFC Bank or a Kotak Bank are largecaps and would give 18-20% return over next 10 years. Even 10 years ago, people used to says HDFC Bank is expensive and every year it has delivered. As long as the organisation is geared to capture the growth opportunity, it is better to stay in a name which is a little expensive but has a good management, a good business model and which had delivered continuously year after year.

These are some of the very fine organisations. Some of them are very expensive. Eicher is expensive but it keeps on delivering returns. I do believe that these will be very large companies 10 years down the line and they would definitely compound.


Where does it leave the alpha opportunity in the market because with compounding names, you will get consistent returns. Where are you looking for that value play where you can pick the stock at the right point and ride the wave as and when it comes through?
I believe that in midcap, there are lots of value plays as some of the stocks have corrected 50-60%. Those business models are not broken, they are still there. Just because of liquidity profile changing and some of the headwinds, they are not doing well. They will grow but you have to get the cycle right. You have to be patient and take risks in those names to get the value at right point in time. You have to track them. Typically, you will find that in cyclicals when this kind of selloffs happen. But they might test your patience before they start delivering and that is the key characteristic of a value pick. 

I believe that today also, in midcaps there are lots of names and lots of stocks which are offering fairly good amount of value.


Anything new that is coming out on your radar, not from a buy/sell perspective, but just as a story that you are fascinated by?
We like Some of the chemical companies. Look at Fine Organics public. It is a great company. It has historically delivered and continues to deliver. It is an Indian MNC. Their margin profile is like consumer company. It’s ROE profile is like that of a consumer company and it keeps on delivering year after year. But it still remains a very tiny company. Can that become fairly big over next 5-10 years? The answer is yes. 

There are opportunities emerging in new segments. In chemical space, there is a huge opportunity going forward. Another name is Galaxy Surfactants. We were bankers to both the companies but these are pockets emerging and they will create compounders. These are very fine companies with good balance sheets, very little debt and you will get them in this kind of market only at a right valuation. 

In a bearish market you will get them at 30 PE, 25 PE and you will probably carry those kind of risks but this is the time to build a portfolio as you will get these names at a reasonable price. 


About a year-and-a-half back, you said that the big picture in the market is – A) the financialisation theme which you still continue to like and the B) in anticipation of GST was the shift from unorganised to organised. Is that still a theme that you are betting big on or do you think the story is done with over there?
It has not even begun. The e-way bill has just started and that has slowly changed the game in favour of organised players. Again with this correction, some of the names in the midcap space which are a part of this theme will benefit. This is not a one-two-year theme. It is going to play out over next four-five-seven years and not only because of the regulatory aspect. That is only one part, premiumisation is another aspect, technology development is another aspect, brand related issues are another. 


So shoes, textiles all of it?
Absolutely. You will find many more. Yesterday, a plastic industry promoter was in our office and he was saying that earlier they had 28% tax and 14% was sales tax. Earlier an unorganised player could evade that sales tax and be more competitive. Now, the only tax is 18% and they are getting input credit. That has made unorganised player completely unviable."

14,2018-07-15,Eicher,"Homegrown companies Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra were the biggest spenders on research and development in 2016-17 among 25 automakers in India which together invested Rs 6,344 crore, latest industry data showed.

The five biggest spenders on R&D were Tata Motors, M&M, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI), Honda Cars India and Ashok Leyland, according to data sourced from SIAM and CMIE.

While the homegrown players have to develop their technology mostly on their own, the likes of MSI and Honda Cars India rely heavily on their Japanese parents for new products.

In 2016-17, Tata Motors invested Rs 2,100.1 crore in R&D despite reporting a loss of Rs 2,619.2 crore.

Similarly, M&M invested Rs 2,075.8 crore on R&D, which was 40.02 per cent of its gross profit that stood at Rs 5,187.5 crore.

Country's largest carmaker MSI's R&D spend stood at Rs 640.4 crore in 2016-17, amounting to 6.44 per cent of the gross profit which stood at Rs 9,941.3 crore during the period under review.

Although the company has set up a centre at Rohtak in Haryana to scale up R&D activities in India, it is still heavily reliant on parent Suzuki Motor.

Likewise, Honda Cars India invested Rs 549.7 crore in 2016-17 although it incurred a loss of Rs 98.9 crore.

Commercial vehicles major Asohk Leyland put in an amount of Rs 389.5 crore on R&D, 23.39 per cent of its gross profit of Rs 1,665.5 crore in 2016-17.

VE Commercial Vehicles, a joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors, invested Rs 268.6 crore, while Force Motors spent Rs 113.4 crore on R&D activities in 2016-17.

The leading 25 manufacturers invested a total of Rs 6,344 crore on R&D, which was 35.04 per cent of total gross profit of Rs 18,106.6 crore made by the companies in 2016-17.

In the two-wheeler segment, Hero MotoCorp led the R&D investment in 2016-17 with Rs 701 crore followed by Bajaj Auto which put in Rs 367.6 crore.

Chennai-based TVS Motor Company invested Rs 244.7 crore followed by Royal Enfield at Rs 128 crore.

The leading 15 two-wheeler companies put in a total of Rs 1,479.1 crore for R&D during the year under review.

Leading three enginemakers - Cummins India, Greaves Cotton and Simpson & Co - put in a total of Rs 86.4 crore for research and development in 2016-17.

Across three segments, the country saw a total investment of Rs 7,909.6 crore in 2016-17, according to the SIAM and CMIE data."
17,2018-07-16,Eicher,"If you have a strong conviction on a stock but are worried about the gestation period, investing may not be your cup of tea. Maybe, you should trade!

Some 10 stocks from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) took 20 years for gestation, but have delivered up to 2,619 times return in this period. They were penny stocks back then; five are part of the elite Nifty50 club today. They are Eicher Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UPL, Lupin and Titan Company.

Others which made their investors millionaires included Bajaj Finance, Shree Cement, Gruh Finance, JSW Steel and Ashiana Housing.

No, it has not been a steep climb for any of them. UPL, Titan, and JSW Steel tested investors’ nerves for several quarters or even years before they took off. 

That’s what you face on the path to richness. 

Ian Cassel, a well-known microcap investor, said in a recent tweet: “Every multibagger will have long periods (even years) of stagnation, as fundamentals backfill, old shareholders get bored, and new shareholders enter.”

So how long is it, really?

UPL remained in the Rs 3-8 range all through 1998-2003; Titan traded in the Rs 2-4 range around the same time. The former is at Rs 637, today and latter at Rs 832.

Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied 2,61,772 per cent from Rs 10.70 on July 12 in 1998 to Rs 28,020 on July 12, 2018. The company has no debt on its books and continues to redeploy cash for further expansion and product innovation.

Data available with Ace Equity showed Eicher’s net profit swelled to Rs 1,712.90 crore for the year ended March 2018 from Rs 23.50 crore reported for FY01. Net sales soared over 20 times during this period. 

An investment of Rs 55,000 in Eicher Motors shares in 1998 would have become over Rs 14 crore today. 

Kotak Mahindra Bank is the second biggest gainer on the list, up 1,29,337 per cent from Rs 1.10 in July 1998 to Rs 1,394 at last Friday’s close. Net profit of the lender multiplied over 50 times to Rs 4,084.30 crore for the year ended FY18. In comparison, shares of HDFC Bank rallied 16,022 per cent from Rs 13.40 to Rs 2165 in the same period.

Brokerage Sharekhan says Kotak Mahindra Bank is among a handful of banks that have been able to maintain strong asset quality in sharp contrast to most banking peers that have become fraught with challenges. Kotak Bank is well positioned to capture incremental market share in the advances market.

“With PSU banks hobbled with non-performing assets (NPA) and capital-related issues, private banks (such as Kotak Bank) have a great opportunity to grab market share and gain access to attractive clientele,” the brokerage said in a report.

UPL has multiplied investor wealth by 647 times in last 20 years. The scrip jumped from Rs 0.90 on July 13, 1998 to Rs 582.70 on July 12, 2018. Net sales and net profit have soared manifold in the same period.

UPL is engaged in the crop protection business, comprising agrochemicals, industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and specialty chemicals.

HDFC Securities in an April report said UPL’s long-term prospects remained positive led by its focus on branding and launch of innovative products, maintaining geographical presence and catering to major crops.

It has increased its share in the global agrochemical market (4 per cent in CY16 against 3 per cent in CY14), and improving Innovation Turnover Index, which rose to 19 per cent in FY18 from 15 per cent in FY17. The company has been investing consistently in backward as well as forward integration, resulting in better cost management.

Shares of pharma major Lupin have rallied 46,370 per cent to Rs 885.30 from Rs 1.90 on July 13, 1998, while Titan has soared 35,415 per cent to Rs 808.90 from Rs 2.30 during the same period. 

Lupin’s profit has jumped from just Rs 2.90 crore in FY2000 to Rs 1,344 for the financial year ended March 2018. It is the market leader in 51 out of the 158 products it sells in the US generic market. As many as 109 of its products feature among the top three in the US generic market.

Lupin plans to launch around 30 new products in the US during FY19. With 163 ANDAs pending approval by USFDA, Lupin is poised for good growth, according to Centrum Broking. The management has guided an EBIDTA margin of 19-21 per cent and single digit decline in revenues for US generic business in FY19.

Titan’s bottomline has soared to over Rs 1,150 crore in FY18 from Rs 25 crore in FY05, while top line has grown 15 times.

The previous financial year turned out to be a robust one for the company, with the jewellery division delivering healthy expansion in bottomline and topline. Revenues for the jewellery division grew 25 per cent YoY to Rs 13,257 crore.

29,2018-07-20,Eicher,"Foreign institutional investors (FII) turned net sellers during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. However, they were found picking select stocks from across sectors, such as staffing, auto ancillary, construction, chemicals, information technology, pharma, housing finance and stock broking, among others.

FIIs offloaded shares worth Rs 20,443 crore during the April-June period against Rs 13,722 crore inflow in the same period last year. Soaring crude oil prices, a depreciating rupee and higher bond yields in the US were among the primary reasons that led to the outflows.

Among the largecaps, FIIs increased holdings in Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, UPL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Lupin, Power Grid and Bajaj Finance. They increased their holding in HDFC Bank to 40.86 per cent at the end of June quarter from 40.43 per cent as of March 31, 2018. 

Barring UPL and Power Grid, shares of these companies rallied between 2 per cent and 27 per cent during the quarter.



Shareholding data available with Ace Equity till July 18 shows overseas portfolio investors hiked stakes in around 75 companies by more than 1 percentage points.

Tiles manufacturer Nitco drew strong interest from FIIs, who raised stake in the firm to 24.25 per cent at the end of June quarter from 1.18 per cent at the end of March. 

Among others, Indiabulls Integrated Services, SE Power, Mercator, Gokaldas Exports, MEP Infrastructure and BSEL Infrastructure Realty saw FII holdings go up by more than 10 percentage points during the quarter gone by.

In the real estate space, Sobha, Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty attracted FII interest. FII holding in the Bangalore-based Sobha rose to 30.27 per cent from 28.53 per cent in the previous quarter, while in Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty, FIIs raised holdings by over 4 percentage points.

Sales bookings at Sobha jumped 22 per cent to Rs 762.40 crore during June quarter on bigger volumes as well as higher price realisations.

FIIs showed a lot of interest in midcap IT firms, including L&T Infotech (from 6.92 per cent to 7.98 per cent), Sonata Software (from 14.67 per cent to 15.94 per cent), Cyient (from 40.42 per cent to 43.08 per cent), Mphasis (from 22.79 per cent to 29.17 per cent) and Aptech (from 5.19 per cent to 7.12 per cent) during the quarter. 



From the pharma space, Neuland Labs, Suven Life, Ipca Labs and Marksans Pharma saw strong FII interest.

A depreciating rupee will provide a fair amount of tailwind to IT and pharma companies in terms of margin expansion, but one can’t be sure whether it can improve the prospects of IT and pharma on a headline basis, Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher, told ETNow in a chat.

“Selectively, some of the stocks would look good, but as a sector, it would be more defensive and may not help make big money on a proactive basis,” he said.

In the textiles space, Lakshmi Machine Works, Ambika Cotton Mills and Gokaldas Exports saw increased interest from FIIs, who also hiked stakes in Dish TV from the broadcasting space.

Staffing players found favour with foreign investors, who took their stake in Teamlease to 40.30 per cent in Q1FY19 from 32.46 in Q4FY18. Likewise, Quess Corp saw FII holding rise to 13.70 per cent from 4.70 per cent.

“Staffing companies will be a natural play on formalisation of businesses, because you are taking a labour force, which is primarily informal. They will now start coming into the formal world,” independent market expert Saurabh Mukherjea told ETNow. 

Staffing companies are a kind of go between. They are the brokers of people. Staffing as a space and formalisation as a theme would be two mega themes that will work wonderfully well in the years ahead, he said."
31,2018-07-22,Eicher,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS and Bharti Airtel are among the 291 listed companies that will have to appoint a non-executive chairperson on their boards by April 1, 2020 to comply with regulator Sebi's directive and most of these firms will need to split the roles of chairman and managing director for compliance.

Currently, many companies have merged the two posts as CMD (chairman-cum-managing director), leading to some overlapping of the board and management, which could lead to conflict of interest.

Under the new Sebi norms, the top 500 listed entities will have to ensure that the chairperson is a non-executive director from April 1, 2020. It will eventually lead to a split in the post of chairman and managing director.

These norms are part of the series of recommendations given by the Sebi-appointed Kotak committee on corporate governance.

A total of 291 companies (or 58.2 per cent) out of top 500 NSE listed entities by market capitalisation will have to appoint non-executive chairpersons, including by splitting the CEO/MD and chairperson position, according to data provided by Prime Database based on information available till July 18.

Apart from Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS and Bharti Airtel, other major firms that need to split the two posts are -- Hindustan Unilever, ONGC, Coal India, Larsen & Toubro and HCL Technologies.

Sunil Bharti Mittal is currently the executive chairman of Bharti Airtel, while Gopal Vittal holds the position of CEO and MD.

Interestingly, Reliance Industries, earlier this month, extended the tenure of Mukesh Ambani, who also holds the position of chairman on its board, as the managing director of the company for another five years.

RIL, Bharti Airtel and TCS will also need to appoint a woman independent director on their respective boards by April 1, 2019.

Some of the other companies that need to have a woman independent director by next year are Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC), State Bank of India (SBI), Indian Oil Corp and Hindustan Zinc.

A total of 145 (29 per cent) companies out of top 500 NSE listed entities would require to appoint woman independent director by April 1, 2019.

Besides, 335 firms (33.5 per cent) out of top 1,000 NSE listed entities by market capitalisation would require to have one woman independent director by April 1, 2020.

Moreover, 56 companies (5.6 per cent) of the top 1,000 firms listed on the NSE would have to increase the size of their board to at least six directors by April next year.

Presently, 43 companies (4.3 per cent) have 5 directors on their board, 12 companies (1.2 per cent) have 4 directors and 1 company (0.1 per cent) has 3 directors, Prime Database noted.

As such, 70 new directors will have to be appointed in these companies, it added.

Some of the firms that need to increase the size of their boards are InterGlobe Aviation, which operates IndiGo airlines, Fortis Healthcare, Eicher Motors, Dish TV India and Monsanto India.

34,2018-07-25,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: This $164 billion fund owns roughly Rs 80,000 crore worth of Indian shares, making it the largest foreign portfolio investor (FPI) in India.

Private lender HDFC Bank (fourth), Reliance Industries (sixth), Kotak Mahindra Bank (14th) are a few Indian stocks, which were among its top 25 holdings in value terms as of June 30.

A part of American Funds, owned by investment management firm Capital Group, this is EuroPacific Growth Fund.

As the name suggests, the fund focuses mainly on Europe, but its exposure to India as percentage of its net assets was significant at 7.4 per cent as of June 30, according to the fund’s website. This, at a rupee-dollar exchange rate of 69, stood at Rs 84,000 crore.

PRIME Database Group pegs EuroPacific Growth Fund’s total Indian stock holding at Rs 78,473 crore, and that of Capital Group as a whole – which includes Capital World Growth & Income Fund, New World Fund Inc, Smallcap World Fund and Europacific Growth funds – at Rs 96,764.20 crore. 

Individual fund or group-wise, it is India’s largest foreign investor, PRIME Database confirmed to ETMarkets in an email. This, it says, is based on data available for only those companies where the fund or the group holds more than 1 per cent stakes. 

Two years back, the fund’s total holding in Indian market stood at Rs 51,564 crore.

Portfolio
The US-based fund hiked stake in HDFC Bank, TVS Motor, UltraTech Cement and State Bank of India in June quarter while trimming its exposure to Grasim Industries and Eicher Motors, June quarter shareholding data showed.

Data suggests the fund held 10,70,36,464 shares, or 5.02 per cent stake, in HDFC Bank as of June 30, against 9,88,65,874 shares, or 4.66 per cent stake, it held as of March 31, 2018. This 5.02 per cent stake alone was worth roughly Rs 29,000 crore.

In case of TVS Motor, the fund increased its exposure to 3.12 per cent at the end of June quarter from 2.74 per cent at the end of March quarter and 2.68 per cent at the end of December quarter, Ace Equity data showed.

At a time when there were concerns over the health of public sector lenders, this fund bought 49,22,000 additional shares in SBI to raise its holding to 1.17 per cent from 1.12 per cent. In UltraTech Cement, it hiked its stake to 1.15 per cent from 1.03 per cent. 

Calendar 2018 has not panned out well for emerging markets, thanks to the onset of Sino-US trade war, rise in crude oil prices and concerns over the Fed tightening. India, too, has been at the receiving end. The country has seen outflow of portfolio money worth Rs 6,430 crore in the first six months of the year.

Despite this, the equity indices have hit new highs, as money continued to chase the largecaps. Thus, a look at what the biggest FPIs are doing is noteworthy.

Ace Equity data suggests EuroPacific Growth Fund cut its holding from 2.37 per cent to 2.20 per cent in Eicher Motors and from 2.41 per cent to 1.61 per cent in Grasim Industries, sequentially, in June quarter.

During the quarter, the fund maintained its holding at 3.38 per cent in Reliance Industries, 1.25 per cent in ACC, 2.65 per cent in Ambuja Cements, 2.66 per cent in Axis Bank, 1.89 per cent in HDFC, 4.94 per cent in Kotak Mahindra Bank, 1.34 per cent in Mahindra & Mahindra and 1.59 per cent Motherson Sumi.

This list may grow when more companies report their shareholding patterns in the days to come."
35,2018-07-25,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: India is fast emerging as a market for premium products with rising per capita income and improving infrastructure. 

Today, a customer does not mind waiting a couple of months for a premium motorcycle or paying a few extra bucks for better services.

And reading between the lines, analysts say companies that focus on premiumisation would be the biggest winners as the economy slips into the next stage of growth. Value growth will gather steam over volume growth in a couple of sectors, they say.

Premiumisation requires rarity, and demands focus on design ingredients, craft, customer service, status, performance and reliability. 

Value investor Safir Anand believes rising income levels should be a good catalyst for businesses in multiplexes, consumer durables, auto, travel, hotels, tyres, wealth management, improved healthcare and even ready-to-wear clothes. 

Even select footwear companies with premium products and high-end motorcycles may also gain market share in the coming years.

Edelweiss Securities says within the two-wheeler space, demand for scooters and motorcycles of over 250cc capacity will continue to grow at a faster clip given their low penetration, shift in consumer preference, rising female literacy and higher purchasing power.

The brokerage expects that 250cc-plus motorcycles to continue to gain share within 2W and scooters segment.

The brokerage expects Eicher Motors and Honda Motors and Scooters India (unlisted) to benefit from this shift in preference. 

Other analysts say Hero MotoCorp is well positioned to benefit from the much-anticipated recovery in rural demand and strong brand equity in commuter bike segment. Rural sales constitute 50 per cent total sales for the auto firm.

However, sustainable market share gain in scooters and premium motorcycles segment will be key to any re-rating. The company has low presence in these segments. 

Hero MotoCorp’s value market share loss over FY08-18 (around 1,400 basis points) has been much severe than its volume market share loss (around 800 basis points) due to weak presence in the expanding premium motorcycle segment, the brokerage said. 

In the passenger vehicles segment, Edelweiss expects utility vehicles (UV) to continue to outpace industry with burgeoning demand for crossovers (replacing sedans). Traditional rugged UVs have been losing market share fast.

Tier-II and below cities are likely to be key demand drivers in this space. “Maruti, Hyundai, M&M and Tata Motors are well placed to capitalise on this opportunity with right products. How Maruti Suzuki plays the next leg of premiumisation will determine its course over the next five years,” it said.

In a strategy shift, Bata is focusing more on volumes and recalibrate its balance between premium and mass segment products to fuel its next phase of growth, Chairman Uday Khanna told PTI.

“To put it bluntly, our volumes have not grown because our focus was premiumisation. Therefore, we have a portfolio where we feel the emphasis will be on both premiumisation and volumes. That will be our next line of growth,” he said.

Nirmal Bang Securities said Bata India is getting into a virtuous cycle, where higher footfalls driven by advertising will lead to a higher pick-up in same store sales growth (SSSG) and the revenue mix would shift towards premium products. This will, in turn, help fund higher brand spend while still driving margin expansion. 

The brokerage believes this should help push Bata India’s revenue growth to low-mid teens and earnings growth to mid-high teens on a sustainable basis.

Jitendra Gohil, Head of India Equity Research at Credit Suisse Wealth, says when per capita income goes up, consumption ability rises and this trend is clearly visible in India.

“First of all, we are seeing a change in food habits. You will see fitness centres come up. People have the tendency to go out and eat, and so restaurant businesses are booming in India. The movie exhibition industry is growing by leaps and bounds and we are seeing good capex in that area. So, the premiumisation trend is very much visible,” he told ETNow in an interaction in May.

There is still a long way to go for India in terms of per capita income. Last calendar, India became the world's sixth largest economy overtaking France, according to World Bank data on gross domestic product (GDP) of countries for 2017. 

“We will soon become the fifth largest economy in 2018 after the US, China, Japan and Germany. But our per capita income is still 20 times lower than that of France. So we cannot stop here,” Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, Niti Aayog, said in an interview recently."

  Edited excerpts: 

Is it looking good for corporate banks or is this looking good because of the base? After one quarter, we realise that the hole only has got deeper.
There are two ways of looking at it. One is in terms of the current asset quality cycle and this is reflective of the fact that you have reached the bottom or are reaching the bottom and that incremental stresses have already been captured or they are diminished. In that sense, this is very illustrative of what has happened. The second part is when are these guys are going to be ready to go and put out money. When they have the risk appetite to go and lend is really the next phase that you need to look at and the jury is out on that. Most of these people have had a really rough ride over the last couple of years and risk appetite often comes back a little slowly. That is going to be the challenge rather than the numbers suddenly deteriorating in any material manner going forward.


Did you think that they would manage to get that gumption because someone on the Street believes it may not be PSBs because they are going to tighten their purse strings further and that share could actually be taken away by NBFCs?
That is absolutely my point. It is one thing to say that the asset cycle is ending. There is a story there. You have seen some response in terms of stocks. You will see more of it. The second bit is do they have the appetite to go out and lend? Also, where do they lend? They obviously have some appetite but if it is going to be completely at the top end where there is no margin, it is not going to have the same impact in terms of stocks. You have to think about how you are going to play rather than that the asset quality cycle is done.


A large part of that will depend on corporates wanting to borrow and which has not come through?
Yes in any case, you are right. But that is something where the change in risk appetite has been more gradual. Risk appetite has tended to build up a little bit. There is a little bit more appetite there but the reality is it has to be matched from a supplier side also. If they are going to stay out, then it is the private banks who have the appetite and who are actually going to get a disproportionate share.


In two-wheelers, the cycle may be great but there is fight for market share. Within the four-wheeler space, there is talk of electric vehicles and the disruption it could have. For the commercial vehicles, there are axle loading norms which in the short term will ensure that demand will remain subdued. Is the near and medium-term outlook looking slightly shaky for the sector across the board?
If you were to look at an extended cycle, where you need to be really watchful about competition is when you have new entrants or people who want to change their positioning entirely. That is not the case as far as two-wheelers is concerned. It is a fairly consolidated market. You had this problem three-four years ago when Honda was coming in. 

As far as the four-wheelers is concerned, Maruti continues to be dominant. There is simply not enough disruption going on in that space. As far as the CV space is concerned, you could see a little bit of it again but it is basically a two-player or a three-player market. 

While you can have a quarter or two in terms of disruptive pricing or disruptive strategies, these disruptions do not sustain for too long in an oligopolistic kind of structure. They happen when the market is tending to widen. In the NBFC space and housing finance space, you could have a lot of distortion. There is a possibility that you have new players who are going from zero to wanting to get to two or four. They can try and sustain it a lot. In segments where you have a fairly well entrenched competitive landscape, disruptive pricing seldom goes on for an extended period of time. 


Bajaj Auto historically has been a profit- and margin-conscious company. They have gone on record saying they were not there for market share. They wanted to be India’s most profitable two- wheeler company. Rajiv Bajaj in the past has said that his margins at 21% were very good. The same guy comes out and says sorry I would do whatever I can to regain market share. Eicher has been the darling of everyone and now Harley says that I am going to come and hit you on the same turf, even BMW. So, within the two-wheeler space, there is competition and there are new entrants.
But as I said, when you have relatively limited players, it is unlikely that two players are going to drag themselves completely down into a ditch…


Will you be a buyer in autos?
Yes. In the two-wheeler space we are more neutral. We want the dust to settle down but if you ask me whether it is going to be as competitive four to eight quarters down the line as it is expected to be upfront, first of all, I would say no. 

Second, in these spaces, because brands and products are more entrenched, the impact can be somewhat limited and is going to be a test of the brand and the product. So, obviously, the next couple of quarters is going to be a little tense. But I will be surprised if this extends for an extended period of time. You will have a two-four quarter period when they will try. If it works, then you will have some kind of a base reset. If it does not, then they revert to normal.


One of the darlings of the market, the hottest sector till about six months back was aviation. We always talk about the fact that irrespective of what crude is doing, some of these aviation companies have not been able to adjust pricing according to the spike in crude prices. What happens to aviation now which was being looked at as a quasi consumption play? 
Aviation is something that is very influenced by the external environment. It is a volatile consumption play rather than a pure consumption play as seen in the Indian context. To that extent, you have to be watchful about the external developments.

If you compare the competitive landscape in aviation vis-à-vis two wheelers, it is very different. Here the competitive landscape is such that it allows you to go down a lot but caps how much you can effectively charge. This is more a volatile kind of consumption play and you have to be cognisant of the external environment.


Is it avoidable right now?
Right now, those prices have taken a beating but unless you have a greater sense of where crude is going, it does become a little bit of a challenge. If this was a two-player market, it would be a different story. The demand has actually been very resilient even as prices have gone up a little bit. The traffic numbers have actually continued to be good but people are taking it on the jaw when it comes to the profitability that is there. This is something that is a little bit more cyclical. Consumption is a demand side, profitability is the external side for this one.


We Have a Preference for IT Largecaps

Are IT and pharma the definitive alpha opportunities right now in the market?
We have been very bullish on the IT space for the last two quarters or so. This is really a three-four year trend and it is going to sustain. We are very clear that what will happen within the sector is that business will tend to shift to the larger businesses and the large caps and the smaller ones. We have a distinct preference for larger ones like Infosys over midcap stocks where we believe there is a certain amount of overvaluation.


You prefer Infosys to TCS as well? 
Why?
There is a valuation gap, there is a catch up game that is effective.


Purely on valuation parameter?
Valuation and a certain amount of catch up in terms of business momentum. To some extent, IT is a little bit more of beta simply because the whole sector has got a huge amount of tailwind and there we prefer the larger caps to the midcaps. As far as pharma is concerned, it is a little bit more alpha there. I do not think it is necessarily a sectoral tailwind. There still remains fundamental challenges as far as the US market is concerned, but there are specific stock opportunities like Dr Reddy’s where they are lined up in terms of their product profile.


Reliance is up more than 10% after the AGM and now everyone is saying they are trying to achieve what Tencent has achieved globally by becoming an AI company. Are markets right in giving the extra PE multiple or the perception benefit to Reliance?
In many senses, Reliance is falling in a very sweet spot and we have been pretty bullish on the stock for the last year and a half. That has played through but the interesting thing is the old business is not getting rusty. The cash is coming and at an incremental pace from the older businesses that are continuing to expand on new platforms. The sweet spot lies there. 

In between, the cash that had been invested in telecom is now actually looking after itself fairly well. Getting on to that oil data in a new oil kind of economy, AI is the option on it. If you get that backbone going, it looks after itself and doing everything that they promised.

It is a sweet spot if you say that the move is on the back of all the AI talk. I would say it has run ahead of itself but if you were to combine the fact that the old business, even though a lot of it is new, is generating a huge amount of cash; if you look at the invested business which is telecom and that is getting decent revenue numbers and traction. AI is more in the option value that they are seeking having created the platform as far as the data economy is concerned.


Leaders Get All Growth & Profitability 

Right now, there is a disproportionate amount of premium which some of the consumer names and private banks are enjoying. The second one is a mega trend. About 15 years ago, if you bought into private banks, you hit a homerun. 10 years ago, it was retail managed NBFCs that made you rich. What do you think will work for next three years and what is the mega trend in the making for next five years?
Market leadership is really going to be the defining feature of businesses that do better and generate higher profitability. Largecaps or midcaps, wherever you have market leadership, you are going to get disproportionate growth and profitability. That is really the mega trend.


Give me an example.
All the market leaders – be it consumer, banks or automobiles are market leaders and tend to grow faster. It is being able to do so on its own profitability. You attribute that to scale, brand and efficiency, but effectively a lot of that is coming through and that is the key that you really need to look at over the next couple of years.


But you yourself are betting on Infy not TCS?
Aditya Narain: Between large businesses, you have to balance between valuation and between…


Number one and two?
Yes. By market leadership, I do not mean number one. The top three or four in every sector are what really going to count, and it is not whether it is a largecap or it is a smallcap. You can have a lot of smallcaps that look very attractive but are number 15th in their sector. Be a little more watchful about the valuation. Even if they get a lot of growth rather than a number two who is actually a very small player. But the fact is he is meaningful in that market.


Are L&T and ACC examples of that?
Absolutely. L&T is a classic case that business will move towards there.


 Why is not the market giving them value then?
It is giving them a fair amount of value relative to a lot of the others. It is a question has a stock moved enough or not? Has it been valued up for a while? Are they getting a disproportionate share of every business that they are entering? I think they are.


Instead of market leadership, we are using the word disruption that is challenging the market leaders. A lot of market leadership patterns which are intact and where we thought they had a moat around them and nothing is going to change are getting disrupted by a range of products, services and technology offerings.
That is very valid but disruption by a new player entirely, whether in entertainment (Netflix, Balaji) or consumption goods (Patanjali), most of the market leaders are agile and have actually gone into these spaces themselves.

They have the basic flow, they have the cash and it is not very hard to get into a disruptive business when you can hire people and technologies off the floor. It can be a Tesla kind of a product but all the auto manufacturers are also getting into the same thing. Tesla might have changed the way the world looks at things, there may have been disruptors but other than a few global guys, for the rest, it has been a win for the incumbents who have been alive to the risk and have grabbed the opportunity. 

Look in the media space. Anything that is net based or YouTube based, all the existing guys have become very strong or have entered new segments very aggressively. Patanjali was big but the Ayushs of the world are all coming back very aggressively.


It is true. Volume growth is back for Lever’s and Britannia.
Yes.


Do you think Airtel has managed to do it in the telecom space?
Effectively they have also come back very strongly in that space. So, there is not a standalone differentiator who has been able to disrupt the whole business in a meaningful manner. Disruptors end up being monocline and invariably they are back to some extent with cash but not by the same amount of cash and to some extent they invariably lack the experience in that space.

The peak of disruption by a new player has more or less happened. You are getting plenty of existing guys who do not want to necessarily disrupt and kill their own business at the possibility of a new business but all of them are there in that new business space. That is why you are tending to see that the big boys are continuing to get a little bigger and market shares have not changed in a lot of these spaces. Nor have opportunities gone up. 

You have a Paytm, which has come up in a particular manner but again there are those three-four names in most of the other spaces where the incumbent, who has been ready to change and has managed to make a reasonable foray into these areas. 

A lot of businesses are thinking like this now. When you talk about Reliance’s AGM being about AI, it gives you a sense of the fact that this is a refining company which is talking AI because that is why they see the disruption. They see that they have made the investments and they should be leading it or at least being part of it in a meaningful manner.


What about the overall market construct? The micro is definitely improving. Besides earnings, there has been a recent bout of correction as well. But the macros continue to be challenging -- be it currency, be it crude. Tomorrow is policy day and we may have an interest rate hike as well?
We see the market in a range of about 10500 to 11500 on the Nifty. We have visualised it as a half circle because the micro has come half circle from being bad to beginning to look good and the macro has actually tended to reverse and is somewhere in the middle.

At some level, it is very well balanced and that can explain why the markets have been weak a month ago because the macro was looking like it was going to go full circle right and has actually arrested itself and it is hanging around somewhere there whereas the micro actually is getting more convincing.

In the backdrop of elections, this is a fair range for the market. For the range to change, the macro has to fall back quite a bit and start heading much lower. For it to hit much higher, you got to have the macros suddenly saying okay this is it, the currency pressure is over, the interest rate pressure is over and a year and a half down the line, you are going to be where you were six months down the line. Otherwise, it is reasonably well balanced.

In the last couple of weeks, there was a little bit of a tailwind from the micro and again a couple of weeks back, there was a little bit of tailwind or at least the easing of headwinds on the macros."

  Edited excerpts: 

What would Harley Davidson coming to India mean for Eicher?
Harley is in a completely different segment. They are in a high range of motorcycles and a higher segment of the market. That is definitely going to work in favour of companies which are in India. If we study the pattern of how Bajaj Auto has systematically built in KTM into their portfolio, it suggests that on one side, they took advantage of strong engineering and used the brand KTM for distribution purpose.

Harley probably brings in a similar kind of an equation wherein the cost of manufacturing is brought down to the level at which the world or Indian markets can afford them. 

So, certainly it would be an interesting play. I do not see too much of a problem but at the same time, you can argue that there would be a pressure on the margin for likes of Eicher who have been commanding around 30% margin. One will have to see how they react on the pricing front.


After Tech Mahindra’s earnings, how are you positioning your preference within the IT pack? I am going with the assumption that TCS would still be your top pick but other than that, is it the right climate to initiate calls among the largecaps within the space?
TCS gives us a distinct clarity. They have the visibility of long-term contracts which they have been signing every quarter. So, there is a visibility of revenue from their conventional model. The way in which the shift is taking place to the digital model is giving a conviction that somewhere down the line, inorganic growth would be a reality in case of TCS and even for Infosys. 

Tech Mahindra has already shown the desire for inorganic growth. From that perspective, TCS would still rank better compared to the others. We will continue to hold on to the positions that we have in TCS. The important part in the IT would be the growth because TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra kind of companies may end up producing 10% to 20% price appreciation, subject to price at which you enter in a given year. Only if you entered in a corrective downside, you will have the opportunity to earn between 15% and 20%. Otherwise, the outlook is 10-15% appreciation in these three companies.

But in midcap IT companies like Tata Elxsi, we find there is an opportunity to make 25% CAGR from this business given the kind of a growth programme that the three IT largecaps are continuing within each of the verticals in which they are operating. All said and done, I would prefer to stay with some of the good quality midcap IT companies like Tata Elxsi and KPIT where we have relatively larger amount of clarity about the growth going forward.


Bank of Baroda (BoB) has in a sense, rerated the entire PSB sector. Are you hopeful that after an Indian Bank and BoB, we could see similar performances from some of the other PSU banks as well? Or should the list stop at SBI after BoB?
Let us also accept the fact that due to the lower pressure of providing for the non-performing assets, PSBs are now showing relatively better performance in the quarterly results. With the NCLT programmes continuing, they are auctioning the assets and getting money back into the books. It is positive only, going forward as well. As the downside in the PSB has been kept limited, the upside in PSB would depend a lot on the basis of earnings outlook with the produce from lending.

Currently, that is an area where most of the analysts are not as confident as they would have been otherwise. The PSU banks are passing through a restructuring programme in their operations including for lending and other activities. I am not too sure whether you would have an equal amount of credit growth which some of the private sector or the corporate banks are registering as of now. But, valuation wise, these PSBs have become attractive. Downside is limited and any kind of positive news could result in upside in stock prices and that is where the traders delight as they function in a market where positive news would drag the stock price up while the fundamentals take time to catch up. 

It would be a buy in dips strategy for PSBs at this point of time.


Vedanta is going to come out with earnings. Last week, the Aleris buy by Novelis helped lift sentiment on Hindalco. The three metals majors -- Tata Steel, Vedanta as well as Hindalco -- come on the back of a two-year mega bull run in commodities. Does that continue?
Certainly the white metals as well as the ferrous metal would continue to have volume-led growth in the economy. All these companies fortunately do not carry even the inventory for few days in their godown. This means the offtake is much faster than one would have imagined in the past. Because of the global market conditions including China factor where they have switched over to the electric car furnaces in steel, the prices of steel have remained stable comparatively. As a result, realisation is better. So, on one side, you have a high demand scenario and on other side, realisation is better. 

Crude oil price is increasing and that is having the impact but at the same time you have much favourable delta on the pricing front vis-à-vis the cost. That is giving opportunity for white metal as well as the ferrous companies and that is an area where the demand scenario along with the profit margins, would probably drive the stock prices. 

Any corrections would be meaningful. This is not generalisation. There would be a correction in respective companies from time to time. But that would be a meaningful way to look into the commodity players like the metal companies and buy them into portfolio during downside. We believe that two-three years of upcycle in metal is a given. If the scenario is buoyant, you should make money in the upcycle in the commodity space.


Why would anybody in their right mind vote against Deepak Parekh? The large wealth which has been created for HDFC shareholder is because of the way the checks and balances and the corporate ethos of HDFC Ltd. HDFC Bank has evolved in last 30 years. Now, 22%, nearly one-fourth of the total shareholders, do not want him as the Chairman anymore?
Generally, as an entrepreneur, promoter and a prudent manager of the finance business, you ultimately end up managing the risk well. That is what Deepak Parekh’s USP has been. He has been managing his risks so very well that we have seen some of the best institutions coming out of the HDFC group. Today there are investors in the company who are not necessarily looking at the risk in a same manner in which he has been looking at it. They probably want to accelerate the pace of growth in various businesses in which they are operating. They are trying to position themselves more aggressively.

Ever since I have started learning how to read corporate annual accounts, I have seen HDFC remaining the most prudent company in management of risks. I am more convinced that the style of working is far more superior than one would have asked for but yes some part of investors have been demanding a aggressive path and that is where the discontent is. 

I have not talked to any investor honestly but this could be the reason for which there may be some kind of a negative voting against Parekh."
51,2018-07-31,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Eicher Motors, parent company of motorcycle manufacturer Royal Enfield, fell as much as 2.84 per cent on Tuesday amid reports that American motorcycle major Harley Davidson is turning aggressive on Asia.

54,2018-07-31,Eicher,"Huge growth ahead in consumer space and within that in FMCG space, Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBI Cap Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Can Dabur continue to beat itself or is this quarter’s results a one- off? If they are reporting volume growth of 21% in Q1, which has surpassed their 
  
  
  own expectations, what does one pencil in for the remaining three quarters?
Basically, in consumer space and within that in the FMCG space, there is huge growth ahead. That can be partly seen because rural incomes are getting better. We have a normal monsoon although the spatial distribution is not so great. There is a situation where a lot of GST rates have been moderated. 

Some of this is applicable for consumer durables but that is translating into a consumption boost which will continue to have momentum for two-three quarters more. While the growth rate in terms of volumes that we have seen from the likes of Levers, Daburs and Asian Paints have been in double digits, those double digit growth numbers will moderate because the base effect will catch up. The numbers, nevertheless will be strong. 

In an FMCG company, one has volume growth plus the pricing advantage and then comes the premiumisation effect. All three combined would drive growth on the top line and that growth will be in double digits.


Harley is now eyeing Royale Enfield’s turf. Although CLSA believes that they may not quite harm Royal Enfield’s market share and may not really target a very large market size, I guess pricing is the key. Could this escalate into a deeper problem for Eicher?
No not really. There is a separate niche that Eicher enjoys in the bike space in the light-weight categories. Harley while it is graduating from the heavy weights to middle weights and then the light-weights now, is not really going to affect Eicher in a big way because distribution is the key for such bikes. 

While the product is great, if you do not have great distribution network, your ability to generate sales is limited which is what Eicher has been targeting over the years. Now they have been expanding their distribution reach and they are becoming quite strong now. They were earlier the south-based distribution reach company. Now they have a well established distribution base. Overall, Eicher should not be worried about Harley coming into India in the light-weight category.


What do you make of Bajaj Auto? Are they doing the right thing by coming out in the open and saying that we will do whatever it takes to regain market share? They have become number four. I can sense the desperation in the management. But will the bid to regain market share come at a price? Is the stock pricing in a margin erosion and a price war?
Let me split your question into three parts. One is the strategy that is being employed by Bajaj Auto. It is in the right direction because you have to necessarily react to market pressures. The two-wheeler space is competitive and you cannot just stand by the way side. 

The second part of your question was will this really affect the company in terms of its margins and thereof? While the company has guided that they will not have 20% kind of margins for the next two or three years, I tend to believe that there are enough margins levers available with Bajaj Auto because of its diversified nature of business that can eventually take it to 20% margin.

The third part of your question is whether the stock price is reflecting all this. I would say no. The stock price is not reflecting the potential that Bajaj Auto has in terms of growth ahead. It is fairly cheap at this juncture relative to the peers and relative to the broader market as well for the kind of return ratios, balance sheet strength and the kind of management quality they possess.


Can Bank, Bank of Baroda have come out with excellent set of numbers. The PSU banks doing pretty well for themselves. But with Bank of India numbers, again all the factors which were looking positive for the space have turned bit negative. Should one be stock specific in PSU space?
We continue to like the PSU space as a whole but then you have to be very stock specific even within that space because RBI is intervening and there are lots of banks under prompt corrective action. That means there will be a period of virtually no growth for those companies and for investors those are not the companies to look at. That leaves the other set of PSU banks which appear quite promising because now the NPA worries are going to be over. 

Also, it is not about NPA issue alone, it is about growth as well. Unless and until you have strong capital, you really cannot grow and therefore you cannot arrest the slide. For us, there are three or four PSU banks that we like -- Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank, Indian Bank and Can Bank seems to be coming into our radar right now. That space is generally good. The moment any bank comes out of the prompt corrective action, that would be something one should be watching out for."

The index formed a Spinning Top candle on the daily scale, which indicates that the pace of buying is slowing down. Now, the index has to continue to hold above 11,300 to extend its move towards the 11,400-11,435 zone, while on the downside, major support is seen at 11,250 and then 11,171 levels.

Now it has to cross and hold above 27,650 to extend its move towards 27,800 and then 28,000 levels, while holding below 27,500 could drag it towards 27,400 and then 27,250-27,165 zone.

16,2018-08-02,Eicher,"In mature markets like Maharashtra and Karnataka and even in Kerala, Eicher has been witnessing weakness for the last couple of years, Chirag Jain, Lead Automobile Analyst, SBI Cap, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 



What is concerning you about Eicher right now?
We have been having a sell rating since our initiation about nine months back and so it is not a recent downgrade. Our thesis is fairly simple. This is a differentiated brand and they have grown phenomenally over the last seven-eight years. In many markets, there are already signs that this brand is witnessing brand fatigue and mature markets like Maharashtra and Karnataka have been witnessing weakness for the last couple of years.

In fact, our recent channel checks with dealers indicate that this weakness is spreading to even states like Kerala which is the largest market for Enfield and even Delhi. They are still reporting reasonably strong growth on a reported basis but the underlying growth in terms of same-store sales growth or in terms of numbers in the matured market, especially in the southern and western parts of India have already started to dip significantly. 

The July numbers have been a big disappointment. They have been doing roughly 75,000 units for the past few months and the 69,000 definitely comes as a big negative surprise. From our perspective, this is clearly reflective of the weakening retail trends that the company has been witnessing in many markets now. While obviously this number could be a one-off thing because there could be an element of transporter strikes as well, but by and large, we expect numbers to remain weak and year-on-year growth to keep sliding from 18-19% YTD growth that they have delivered.


Is it easy to take a call on a category because Eicher is not an ordinary mode of transport. Those who buy Eicher bikes or Royal Enfield frankly do not care about barish hoga, nahi hoga, farm income mein kya hoga (Whether monsoon is going to be good, what happens to farm income) etc. It is a lifestyle and aspirational thing. Isn’t it too early to write off this aspirational trend?
From that perspective, I totally agree. Aspirations are definitely going up and customers are looking for lifestyle oriented products. Eicher has been the leader in that space. However, I would like to highlight something. One of the reasons this brand did so well was obviously because this was a differentiated in terms of positioning. It was unique. There was novelty factor. They used to do 60,000 units in 2010 annual basis. Now, they are doing almost 800,000 units on an annual basis. So, this bike is becoming more and more common and that itself is hurting its brand appeal. 

This is not a recent phenomenon. In states like Maharashtra, the business is down almost for the past two years and this is down like big number. The retails were down 25% last year broadly as per our checks and they are down another 15-20% even this year. Same is the case with Karnataka and now even Kerala. Retail sales since April have been down in double digit as per our dealer checks. 

It is more brand specific issue as against macro issue with respect to two-wheelers or any particular category in our view.


Coming on competition, we know Harley Davidson is coming but with BMW as well tying up with TVS Motors and that product hitting the roads, is it going to be a clear and present danger to Eicher’s dominance? 
Definitely. As you said, the options for customers will go up. Earlier it was largely Enfield in terms of the affordable price range but now many global brands like BMW are coming in through tieup with TVS. Even KPM and now Triumph coming with Bajaj. Harley is planning on similar lines. They want to come in the big category but at an affordable rate. To that extent definitely competition will go up. It would not be a single brand that could challenge Enfield because Enfield is definitely on a significantly higher scale and reach but collectively these brands definitely could impact the growth going forward.

This would be over next two to three years’ perspective. Before that, the company itself is facing challenges and that has more to do with their internal issues because of brand fatigue that we are witnessing in many markets."
17,2018-08-02,Eicher,"Your capital will only get some appreciation after the growth for next two years gets factored in the company’s numbers, Manish Sonthalia, Chief Investment Officer and the Director of the India Zen Fund, Motilal Oswal AM PMS, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


It has been a good July. Do you think markets have stabilised or was it a one-month wonder and it could be back to square one?
I clearly believe that we are more up than down. These daily volatilities will continue to be there, but my sense is that markets are definitely going to be higher from these levels if you were to take six-nine months or even one year point of view. 

We have already seen the bottom in the mid and the smallcap names. I reiterate that stance. I was also of the opinion that there will be reversion to mean on both sides. You had seen spectacular run in the largecap names. They are bound to see some correction and you have seen such spectacular falls in midcap and small cap names. They are bound to see some pullback. The markets are playing out just exactly that. 

Having said that, among the largecap names that have come out with numbers so far, it is slightly amiss on the overall Nifty estimates per se because of bad numbers being posted by ICICI Bank and Tata Motors. They are pulling the overall estimates down for the current quarter and the FY19 as whole. 

Apart from that, broadly the numbers have come through and profit estimates at least on the EBITDA front have been in line with what we were anticipating. Something like 20% top line growth and a 20% EBITDA growth of course has not exactly translated into bottom line growth which is hovering around 10% in expectations for something like 13%. But this was on the back of EBITDA nuances on individual companies. But I am more bullish than bearish at this given point in time.


Eicher Motors is turning out to be a very interesting story. There was that eight-day truckers’ strike which I believe the management says has hit their monthly sales data. There were also some stories on Harley Davidson looking at targeting the same segment that Eicher is in. We have seen the stock correction play out in the last three days and now brokerages are revising their price targets downwards in Eicher. How would you approach the story?
I am not in sync with what the consensus downgrades. These are temporary aberrations on a monthly basis. There were some problems in West Bengal and truckers’ strike. My sense is this 73,000-74,000 vehicles per month is par the course and the management has reiterated time and again that 10.25 lakh is what the production looks like in fiscal 2019. 

There will be volatilities due to situations out of the company’s hands. Harley Davidson story is 2021 and by that time, the yearly volumes of Harley Davidson expectedly is to be higher than the 10.25 lakh which they have been projecting. It remains to be seen at what price points does the 250 to 500 CC bike comes out of the Harley Davidson stable because it is one thing to launch a 250 -500 CC product and another point again to make profit out of the same. 

Harley Davidson being international brand, they are going to have an Indian vendor where they are going to produce all these vehicles and the selling price will determine whether they make money and whether they are going to be a real threat to Royal Enfield. The niche point about Royal Enfield is that it is offering a superior bike at a very favourable price point. That is the competitive advantage which Royal Enfield brings on the table. According to me, the story stays and there is nothing negative but there will be volatility and one needs to live through the journey.


With yesterday’s rate hike, don’t you think that for two-wheelers, this is going to be a spot of a bother once again because that is where the pricing of loan pinches the most? For a premium brand like Eicher Motors, with competition coming in and rates going up, would that impact demand?
It is not a problem with the demand per se. If you look at quarterly numbers of all the automobile majors which have declared numbers, there is no problem with volume growth. It is a problem with the raw material cost pressure that is having a bearing on the margins. It is bringing down the overall profitability. Whether you look at Tata Motors, Maruti, Hero MotoCorp or Bajaj Auto, it is the raw material cost pressure which has not yet got fully passed on to the clients. 

Obviously these costs are not going to be absorbed in house and has to be transferred to clients over a period of time. So demand stays pretty much intact driven by both rural recovery as well as urban demand. It is not a problem with demand at all. Having said that, with the interest rate hike of 25 bps, the downfall of the rupee which was not abating, is halted for the moment. Of course, the trajectory remains down to the extent of 3% to 4% every year but with the commentary that we have heard out of the Fed and the rate hikes that was on expected lines of 25 bps, I think the depreciation in rupee has halted. That augurs well for emerging markets per se. I am not talking about daily volatilities but my sense is the rise in the dollar has halted for the moment and that will be good news for emerging markets as a whole.


The top holdings that you have maintained for a long time are Bajaj, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Page Industries and Eicher. These have been the heart of your portfolio. Are you of the view that some of these so-called expensive or the haloed stocks will still give decent compounding returns for the next two or three years and I am again referring to a Bajaj Finance or a Page Industries or a Kotak Mahindra Bank, the stock which you have been owning for a couple of years now?
I do not see any reason to sell these companies. Quarter after quarter, year after year, profit growth just keeps on coming. The markets front end the increase in corporate profits on these companies much in advance. Look at something like a Page Industries which hit Rs 30,000 yesterday. I was hearing from every nook and corner that it was very expensive at let us say Rs 15,000 or even Rs 20,000, but see the sweet spot for the company continues. I would not be surprised that the profit growth which till today was between 20-25% can actually accelerate because it is not only an innerwear company, it is a total apparel company now with leisure wear etc contributing their bit to the volume growth as well as the profitability

Till last year they outsourced 25% manufacturing, this year onwards they are of the opinion that they are going to outsource 50% of the manufacturing. So you are going to have a lower cost structure and at the same time they are going to pass on these cost benefits to the clients.

This is the best thing that could have been possible, a premium brand being available at a very affordable price. The stock just keeps on getting expensive because the longevity of growth continues and it keeps getting bigger. The same story applies for a Bajaj Finance. Look at the machine that Mr Jain has created, now he is creating a second line and it is equally good or even better. It has a long trajectory. 

Look at the Kotak Mahindra Bank. It has given more returns that HDFC Bank over the last 10 years. If you look at the CAGR, Kotak Mahindra Bank has delivered 42% CAGR whereas HDFC Bank has delivered 30% CAGR. It is a silent performer. I really do not see the need to sell any of these positions. They just keep on delivering numbers and I am happy to hold them for long periods of time.


A market truism is if you buy a good business at a reasonable price, you will make money. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala said these companies will grow but to expect that they will compound as stocks would be difficult and he gave me the classic example what happened to Lever between 2000 and 2010. It was growing but the stock was static. Are we running that risk in a Bajaj Finance or a Kotak Mahindra Bank or an HDFC Bank? The growth may be there but you may not get compoundation in stock prices?
The whole example about HUL followed time and again or even some of the other FMCG names which have remained stagnant for three years. Did you eventually lose capital in HUL? Even if you were to take from 1990 till date, the returns are spectacular! HUL would have a CAGR of 20-22% even after not performing for 10 years. The whole point is that the company announced a buyback at Rs 600 and the entire street was of the opinion that the share should be tendered in the buyback. Today the stock price is three times that. And the story is just unfolding. 

These brilliant machines and this has something to do with Lindy effect, if you have read the book Skin in the Game. Companies which have survived for long periods of time have better chances of survival.

The old notion about whether Indian markets are expensive is not important. They always appear expensive at all points in time. The crux to making money in India is not anticipating the next two years of growth, it will always remain fully priced for the next two years. The point is if you can see the next five years and you will only make money after one-and-a-half to two years from the day you deploy your capital. Otherwise, we will be owning junk businesses available at very cheap prices and they continue to become cheaper. 

The mantra to make money in India even from a foreign investors perspective is not to look at the next two years, they almost always look fully priced. 
 
 
 One should look at the next five years because your capital will only get some appreciation after that growth gets factored in the company’s numbers."

20,2018-08-04,Eicher,"Talking to ETNow, Kunal Bothra, independent market expert, says the market has sailed higher in the face of global negative cues, and this bullish streak may stay.
Edited excerpts:


ET Now: This week, we have spent a large part of our time just circling around the 11,300 mark, with some intermittent dips also coming in. What are we in for next?


Kunal Bothra: It was that kind of a week for the indices, but there were no two ways to look at midcap stocks, because the market breadth remained positive for good part of this week. I sense that, with the market breadth now coming positive and midcap stocks making a comeback, largecap stocks have got that breather in terms of correction. I believe, it is going to be quite positive to take away. 

This week Asian markets, as well as the emerging market cues were extremely negative. Despite those negative cues, our market has sailed higher. In technicals, we look at price action and respect what the price says. The prices indicate that we are into a bullish trajectory and this bullish momentum should continue for the indices going forward as well.


ET Now: The entire auto pack was active this week, especially because of the monthly auto sales numbers. There were concerns around Eicher. The fact that it is richly valued, what is going to happen to it once Harley Davidson comes into play? You saw this week that Eicher Motors got pounded for three consecutive trading sessions. Is it building up for a higher move or do you think the pressure on the stock would remain because of this report? It will report its numbers also next week.

Kunal Bothra: I believe that the pressure is now getting into the stock and it has made a negative candlestick pattern. Generally, when you expect bottom formation processes to happen, we expect the stock to remain sideways for good amount of time without any negative triggers, at least in terms of price patterns. But, what you saw this week, compared to the last week, price action is more of a bearish engulfing price pattern. The indicators on monthly charts for Eicher Motors have broken lows, which were almost closer to 2,009-2,010 when the stock was at 8,000-10,000 odd level. So, with indicator action breaking on the long-term charts and the weekly price patterns getting negative, I believe that the stock is building towards the downward trend or opening up a downward trend and you might see the stock correcting.

So, I am not sure how the stocks would react post results, but if the stock breaks this 27,000 mark support levels on weekly basis, you should see a bigger correction for the stock.


ET Now: Do we see Reliance Industries scale up fresher and fresher highs because the move has been steady after its AGM?


Kunal Bothra: Absolutely. I think from 2017, when the stock broke that 9-10-year of sideways range, it has not looked back anytime in the last one-and-a-half years. Yes, on the long-term patterns, the stock is getting into that high acceleration mode where you see higher price appreciations, that too on a short span of time. I think that should augur well for the stock. If you see volume built up happening, which is what the charts are now showing, it means there is increased amount of participation into the stock prices. 

So, it indicates that this stock may not see that kind of volatility which could have been surfacing couple of months or quarters back and the stock is into a stable uptrend. I believe Reliance could continue to ride higher from current levels as well.


ET Now: Any interesting trades for Monday morning?


Kunal Bothra: Quite a few. I think one of them which I am suggesting to buy is Hindalco from the metal pack. I think it is making a good comeback over the last couple of days. Even though it has been sideways, but the price patterns have become positive for Hindalco so that is a buy, target of Rs 230 and a stop loss of Rs 204. 

State Bank of India, I believe that the stock has now confirmed a strong weekly breakout at this 290 odd mark. It also crossed the 200-day moving average quite convincingly last week, so that is also a buy with a target price of Rs 320 and a stop loss of Rs 289. 

The third stock is a midcap stock, Bombay Burmah. I think the stock is staging to a bullish flag pattern breakout. It is a liquid midcap name, would suggest a positional buy with the strong upside of at least Rs 1,700 to Rs 1720 zone, stop loss to be kept at Rs 1,555."
21,2018-08-05,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Renewed trade tensions between the US and China and a 25 bps rate hike by the RBI failed to dampen the bulls' spirits, who showed who was in-charge in the week gone by.

India to impose import tariffs on US goods: According to a Reuters report, India will impose delayed tariffs on some US goods in September. Trade differences between India and the United States have been on the rise since US President Donald Trump took office. Bilateral trade rose to $115 billion in 2016, but the Trump administration is keen to bring down its $31 billion deficit with India and is pressing New Delhi to ease trade barriers, the report said. 


Sino-US trade war: Tit-for-tat tariff sanctions between the two largest economies -- the US and China -- on the trade front is likely to keep investors on edge. The Trump administration tightened pressure for trade concessions from Beijing this week by proposing a higher 25 per cent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Striking back, China on Friday unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft. 


US jobs data: US job growth slowed more than expected in July as employment in the transportation and utilities sectors fell, but a drop in the unemployment rate suggested that labour market conditions continued to tighten, Reuters reported. Non-farm payrolls increased by 1,57,000 jobs last month, still more than the roughly 1,20,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population, the report added. 


Monsoon progress: Monsoon rains will be normal in August and September, the India Meteorological Department said on Friday. ""The rainfall during August-2018 is likely to be 96 per cent plus/minus 9 per cent of LPA (Long Period Average) and expected to be higher than predicted in June,"" it said. However, Skymet has downgraded its forecast for this year's monsoon, stating that the country might receive below normal rainfall, citing the continuing warming of the sea surface in the Pacific Ocean.


HDFC AMC IPO listing: Shares of HDFC AMC will list on the bourses on Monday. The IPO, which ran on July 25-27, was a big hit with 83 times subscription. Experts believe that the stock will see strong listing gains. HDFC AMC is India’s most profitable fund house and made a profit of Rs 722 crore for the year ended March 2018 and ranks No. 2 by assets under management (AUM) in the local mutual fund industry.


What does the tech chart say?
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a large bullish candle, just a day after it made a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the daily chart, suggesting that the bulls were not ready to give up easily. “The uptrend shall remain intact as long as the Nifty50 stays above the 11,230 level, which can be regarded as a stop loss for all long positions. It looks prudent for traders to book some profits as we head towards the said resistance zone,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

This apart, trend in global markets, investment by foreign and domestic investors, the movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price movement are other factors that may have a bearing on investors' thinking in the coming week."

26,2018-08-08,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: The transport and highways ministry has reduced in part the additional load trucks can ferry, perhaps minimising the anxiety of investors in heavy-vehicle makers that faced a likely fall in demand.

Now, the maximum safe axle weight in a vehicle of single axle, with two tyres, has been changed from 7.5 tonnes to 7 tonnes. Similarly, the standards have revised down the load to 19 tons from 19.5 for 16.2-ton trucks. So, the effective increase in maximum load carrying capacity for this category will now be 17 per cent instead of 21 per cent earlier.

When revised norms are implemented for different categories, the maximum load carrying capacity of a truck will increase by 15-20 per cent, compared with projections of 25-30 per cent based on the notification issued on July 16. This means lower incremental load carrying capacity than earlier, giving a breather to medium and heavy commercial makers such as Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors and Eicher Motors.

Furthermore, the new notification has made it clear that old vehicles (manufactured after July 16, 2018) will be allowed to increase the maximum load. This removes ambiguity among fleet operators as they can pay nominal fees to increase their maximum load carrying capacity as per the new axle norms.



The Street had been factoring in MHCV volume growth in the range of 10-15 per cent for the current and next fiscal years. The latest modification in axleload norms is likely to result in a major tweaking in projected volume growth for several reasons.First, the incremental load carrying capacity has been trimmed by 10-13 per cent after the new notification. This would allay investor concerns of overcapacity in the system and pressure on fleet operators’ profitability.

Second, new axle norms affected only 20-25 per cent of the total MHCV volumes, and this could have resulted in only a few percentage points impact on the total demand. About three-quarters of MHCV volumes such as tippers, intermediate commercial vehicles and cargo carriers remain unaffected by changes in new axle norms. Third, the approval time for a new vehicle complying with revised axle norms is likely to shorten.

This implies that new truck sales may be affected just for a few weeks. Investor interest is gradually reviving in shares of truck makers as the underlying demand buoyancy starts reflecting in their volumes in the next few months. 

The price-earnings multiple of pure play commercial vehicle company Ashok Leyland took a sharp cut to 14 times its projected next year earnings from 20 three months ago."

30,2018-08-09,Eicher,"Till the time we are out of the election cycle, what has worked for last couple of years will continue to work, Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, Institutional 
  
  
  Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Light at the end of the tunnel now seems to be a reality. For the longest time, experts have argued that earnings recovery is round the corner and markets did not oblige. But for the first time, it looks like analysts are finally getting it right. There is reason to get optimistic about earnings recovery.
Yes, you put it right. The things seemed better this time compared to the last couple of quarters. Numbers are doing fine even though they are not surprising big time but at least they are not disappointing which we had gone used to. What one still needs to be circumspect about is that the downgrades have not stopped. 

When I look at my universe, we are still downgrading two companies for every upgrade that we are making. The upgrade to downgrade ratio is still 0.5. For the quarter at least, the numbers are in line. EBITDA across the board whether it is my universe or Nifty, is up 22-23% which is in line with expectations. 

Of course, as far as Nifty is concerned, there is some disappointment in profit because of the corporate banks where the provisions have been raised up, but markets will look beyond that because it is at least signalling that we are now nearing the end of that bad asset cycle. So yes, fingers are crossed. We are not having too much of an upside room as far as valuations are concerned on Nifty and midcaps are still trading at 20-22% premium to largecaps. That also is in a way in a rising bond yield environment and caps the valuation room for upside.


We cannot take our eyes off ICICI Bank. Within days, it has climbed up to 320 levels. Would you say that the worst is over for corporate banks and is ICICI Bank the go-to story here? Everything seems to be in its favour. 
Absolutely. This has been our preferred pick in the corporate banking space. It is part of our model portfolio since long and as you said clarity on the asset cycle, provisions have been raised further. Valuations are in its favour. Subsidiary valuations are also quite attractive. Things seems to be settling down for this bank. We will need to see a couple of more quarters whether these things are finally over and whether we can restart the new cycle as far as asset quality is concerned. 

But given the valuations, clearly the risk reward is very favourable and for the quarter also they have done pretty well. They have raised the provisioning estimates. To that extent, there was some miss on the bottom line front but the quality of earnings has turned better. The watch list has reduced significantly. Overall stressed assets have also come off and clearly subsidiaries are doing pretty okay. It continues to be a part of our model portfolio. It remains the best pick as far as corporate banking part of the portfolio is concerned.


We were talking about Eicher Motors earnings coming out later today. Do you think it is time to step away from the auto space like Maruti or Eicher Motors and start looking for that alpha play?
For this quarter, auto numbers across the board have been disappointing, save Ashok Leyland and for that matter, Maruti, Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, Hero, TVS Motors also. The numbers were well below expectations from the profitability front even though volumes were in line. 

Clearly margin pressures are mounting and we are in a rising commodity cost environment. Wherever there is lack of pricing power, it will get reflected in the numbers going forward as well. We have cut earnings estimate for auto across the board, and I am not talking about Tata Motors only. 

The other secular stories have also seen earnings cut. This quarter will go down as a disappointment for auto names. What we like within the auto space for some time now has been Maruti and M&M. Our preference has clearly been towards the four-wheeler space because we feel the competitive intensity in that space is relatively more stable and the opportunities of volume growth continues to remain very high -- be it M&M or Maruti. Within two-wheelers, we have liked Bajaj Auto for some time now. We feel that valuations are now reasonable and the market to an extent has over reacted to the fears of price war.


This morning we are talking about oil cooling off and we have seen that the OMCs have reported a good set of numbers. Do you think that the oil and gas space which is plagued by concerns of higher oil prices, can be seen as an opportunity and is there value in OMCs?
Clearly there is a lot of value in OMCs whether oil is at $70 or $75. We had actually done a report talking about the value that current market prices are discounting and there is substantial undervaluation in the space. But the problem that we need to contain within the next couple of months is that we will be heading straight into the election cycle and that is where a lot of uncertainty will creep in. 

While numbers can be fine and oil prices could remain range-bound, the markets propensity to ascribe the multiple to those numbers will be constrained in my view. This will remain a trading bet till elections are out of the way and even yesterday’s number of both HPCL and BPCL on core GRM front has disappointed big time. The numbers which were reported obviously propped up the inventory gains. I will stay sideways on OMCs.


In the past, retail banks, retail NBFCs, consumer staples and consumer durables have worked. At a time when markets are looking at a rotation, if ICICI Bank is making a comeback, if Axis Bank is recovering, do you think what has worked in last three years as a pet theme may start taking a backseat? HDFC Bank may start underperforming or get into timewise correction. HUL and Britannia may not give you any returns. Maruti may slip into a timewise correction. Could there be a very stark rotation for next 12 to 18 months?
There is non-zero probability of that happening but my view is that till the time we are out of the election cycle, what has worked for last couple of years will continue to work. And the reason is very clear. Some of these corporate banks, some of the cyclicals have done well. But as a pack you cannot take a call based on one quarter of numbers. 

My view is that the same four-five sectors which is consumption, private banks, NBFCs, autos and to an extent IT will continue to do very well at least till election related uncertainties are out of the way. While micros have clearly improved, we have seen some deterioration in macros in the last four or five months on the inflation front, rate hike, bond yields, crude, the global trade war concerns. That will keep the market little bit on the tenterhooks as far as the broad cyclical or the value part of the equation is concerned. 

We prefer quality with earnings visibility plays and selectively wherever we find things to be getting better, we increasing the weights for those stocks in our model portfolio. ICICI Bank is part of our model portfolio. We have Yes Bank as another proxy to play the same corporate banking cycle. Broadly, I will still side with the quality plus earnings visibility theme which has worked well and will continue to work well even for the next 12 months.

Consumption has done well and you will see very strong recovery going forward as well. This has been our view for last 15 odd months. Even last three-four quarters including this quarter, the commentary that has been coming in from consumers -- whether it is stables or discretionary – is that things are picking up both on urban and rural front and my view is that for the next nine months this consumption recovery will gain further strength. While clearly there is no debate on valuations from a one year point of view, those valuations can remain irrational for some more time.


In light of this mega HDFC AMC IPO, what are you making of the AMC business? Could you see a shift out of the HDFC Bank into HDFC AMC?
As far as AMC business is concerned, clearly, we are in the midst of a very important and structural shift in favour of financial assets as far as saving is concerned. So financialisation of savings which has been talked about for some time now remains a big theme to play in the next couple of years, maybe even five years, 10 years. 

But whether investors will shift from HDFC Bank to HDFC AMC looks a little improbable because of the size of the companies that we are talking about; also secondly, AMCs remain a cyclical business whereas private bank if far more structural and there is far stronger value migration away from the PSU banking set and there the opportunity is still humungous because 70% of the system is still with PSU banks. 

While on an absolutely basis people will play the AMC scheme, people will play the theme of brokerages, insurance which is a broad spectrum of financialization of savings but I do not think there is a possibility of people moving assets from the banks or NBFCs towards this. We have 40% weightage for financials already in the index and it looks like this could inch up a bit higher because we still do not have representations of the non-bank, non-NBFC space in the bigger indices. So that theme will continue to play and it looks very solid, just that as you mentioned about HDFC AMC has had a stellar listing. So, maybe from a near term point of view, there is obviously some cap on the upside that one can make but if somebody has a medium to long-term view. clearly this is a theme to play.


Themes for Value Migration

If you have to summarise one big trend for the next three to five to 10 years, where you see a strong earnings visibility and a big migration of value, where could that be? 
Just two months back, we had come out with a sequel report on value migration where we looked back to what exactly has happened in the last 12 months since our first report came out. We found that there are two areas where the pace of value migration has accelerated; one is clearly PSU to private banking or even insurance place because this is a theme which will continue to play out for the next five, ten years and I have no hesitation in admitting that even at these prices, I will not be too concerned if I am overweight on private retail banks. 

The second theme which we have highlighted is the jewellery space. Titan has been our top India consumer discretionary bet for the last two years now. Even at this price, I will be very positive there. Titan can easily compound earnings at more than 25% for the next three years. What has happened in the jewellery space is that even before GST, demonetisation itself has started the migration away from unorganised to organised. 

GST has just come in and helped and that space is big, $55 billion of jewellery industry we talk about, almost 800-900 tons per annum of gold consumption and hardly one player standing out there which has a pan India footprint and a very strong brand equity which is gaining share every single day. So, I will be very positive on that space.

Then of course, there is a broad set of consumption categories -- consumer electrical, adhesives, diagnostic space -- where the room for growth by sheer shift from unorganised to organised base trade exists for a long time.

44,2018-08-10,Eicher,"The correction is a a wonderful opportunity to ignore the so-called highest quality largecaps and come to the mid and smallcaps, Porinju Veliyath, Founder & CEO, 
Equity Intelligence India, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Last time we spoke, there was a carnage, a messy selloff in mid and smallcap stocks. Do you think that sharp summer correction is behind us?
I strongly believe so. That was a very big selloff and some correction was definitely due because of the small and midcaps space had been overheated. There had been four-five years of rally in that space while the blue-chips underperformed in general. When the correction came, it was overdone.

I feel this is an ideal time to explore value among the small and midcap companies. When we say midcap companies, according to the new definition even companies at Rs 28,000-30,000 crore valuation are midcaps. There are wonderful companies and some of them are industry leaders with a relevant business model. Some people say do not buy those things, buy only the highest quality companies today at 100 PE, 80 and 70 PE. I do not agree with that. It is a cycle. Everything has its cycle and opportunity. Those who underperformed in last five years are performing over last six months, which does not necessarily mean that this is the strategy to adopt. Maybe this is the peak of the strategy if you are buying a Lever, a Nestle, a Britannia, a or Page or an Eicher -- very high quality companies with 70-80-100 PEs. A lot of people are doing that today. But that will be like buying the midcaps in November-December last year.


Looking at Nifty and Sensex, we can see that it is only a handful of stocks that have taken us to the top. But you believe that the market is going to get a little more broad-based and it is not going to be those select few 15-10 odd stocks which are going to move, and the rest of the index stocks would play catch-up. What makes you think so?
There is a herd mentality that works in the market. Smallcaps and midcaps are moving down now and the largecap blue-chips are moving up. So, everybody jumps into that band wagon and makes it a dirty place. This is what is happening today. There are very high quality companies which in the past 10 years have done exceeding well. Their best of times are going on and the best of earnings happening and the best of margin, the least competition and those are the companies that are quoting at 100 PE at today’s EPS. I do not understand that. Expecting these companies to grow at 20-25% for next 100 years is utter nonsense. It does not work. 



There is a disruptive world out there. Competition can come from nowhere. But all said and done, I am strongly bullish on Indian markets, Indian economy. I still believe in changing India and improving corporate governance. I still believe this is the best theme to continue to play for Indian markets. That does not mean just go and buy any chor (fraud) company. What I am saying is provided there is a very relevant business model and high business value in the company, then only we should bet on improving corporate governance if that was the reason for lack of wealth creation in the past. 

There are clear symptoms that India is changing, structural economy is changing. We had been talking about this change from unorganised economy to organised, from black to white. This has a long-term positive impact on a lot of companies. The former promoter of Bhushan Steel was arrested yesterday. All these things are very important. There would not be any incentive to remain unprofessional and it is happening in many companies. 

My own experience also says that there may be a few companies doing badly and that is what is being projected today in the social media but there are companies doing wonderfully as well. I have a smallcap bought one year ago. It is a five-bagger today and it is at an all-time high. This promoters were not considered to be very professional but today they are becoming professionals, they are showing profits, they are ready to pay tax. These changes provide one-time opportunity in India since independence.


At an index level we are talking at 11,500-12,000 for the Nifty. I know you track the midcaps more but their midcap and smallcap portfolios are not reflecting that euphoria. What would you say to viewers and investors who are feeling a bit confused in the market?
Nifty and Sensex definitely represent Indian equity markets today. I am not saying that investing in blue-chips is bad. But if you buy the top quality 10 companies in India at today’s PE and valuations, it may give you 5% to 10% CAGR for next five years or ten years because these companies are doing the best in terms of margins and lack of competition. With above normalised earnings, they are giving very high PE. Investors should think twice on earnings or return when they invest. Otherwise they are going to be disappointed in next five years’ time. 

There will be some companies still giving you 20% CAGR. If you make a portfolio of the top 15-20 companies, you are going to get 5% to 10% CAGR in next five years. Whereas if you look at opportunities in the mid and smallcaps, especially after the sharp correction, you are going to make maybe 30-35% CAGR for next five years. However, that does not mean you go and buy and fraud companies, dying companies, irrelevant businesses. You should look at medium quality companies with relevant business model and which are futuristic going forward among the mid and smallcaps. In these places, after selloff you are getting maybe 10 or 15 PE. Some of them maybe in single digit PE but there are not too many of these companies. 

The opportunities are not like 2013 or 2014. Maybe it has come down by 75% but India has only 1,000 investable quality companies. You have to choose 15-20 companies from them. That is called stock picking. I think this is a wonderful opportunity to ignore the so-called highest quality largecaps and come to the mid and smallcaps. Today companies with Rs 5000-6000 crores market cap are also considered to be smallcaps. For me, they are midcaps. 

I feel the opportunities are immense and the general market continues to be good. Any further move in the market will be broad based. Last week, there are signs of a greater participation happening and we will see broad-based market move in coming days.


Next Cycle is Starting for Investible Quality in Midcaps and Smallcaps


For long term investing, is banking still a good sector? Considering the turnaround which seems to be hinted at, should one look outside private banking names?
Yes, I still feel if somebody is interested in banking that makes a lot of sense. There are small microfinance companies quoting at high valuations, five times, ten times the book value because of the growth happening. And India has definitely lot more growth prospects in that sector, especially in the consumer finance in the retail finance so this is going to grow in a big way in India. We are so much under-banked or under-financed in that segment. 

I would still prefer something like and IDFC plus Capital First is going to merge, maybe a Federal Bank kind of bank. We have exposure in Federal Bank, of course, recently we have bought after the big selloff. Maybe a JM Finance kind of stock in the capital market related activity too. So there can be similar kind of midcaps and of course, the smallcaps which have got less NPAs, more visibility and good people managing.

I feel IDFC Bank plus Capital First can be a stock to watch if somebody is looking for next five years. There is more safety and more growth prospects in long term investing. Also, it is too early to write off some of the old generation private banks which are improving their efficiencies, have got a control over NPAs. The next three quarters are very important also. They will give you much more visibility. But once that visibility happens, the stock price could be doubled and maybe you have to take some chance before the full visibility comes if you buy it at a bargain price.


What is the future of speciality chemicals, especially dyes and dye intermediaries?
I do not follow this space much because it was too much fancied and valuations have gone through the roof. They had a great time in earnings. I do not have knowledge how this industry will look going forward in the next 1-3 years. The Indian companies in speciality chemicals segment were all in a sweet spot. We even made money in a company called Balaji Amines. We used to buy it at two-digit prices a few years ago. But we have exited it. 

Some of the companies have gone up five and ten times. Graphite Electrodes people have been after that. We have a habit of ignoring the current fancy or too much fancied segments and we always look for sober valuations in the mid and smallcaps. At the same time, in our PMS, we have also got ITC. It is not that we are always into smallcap companies. We have got high quality companies also like TTK Pharma or Hawkins as well.

I consider that is a very high quality company, we have a large exposure. I am not recommending these stocks, what I am trying to tell you is look at high quality, high PE stocks and also the value stocks with medium quality . This is the game now, which one you want.


Do you think you need to have a slightly greater weightage towards largecaps and megacaps because the four-year one sided bull market in those stocks is coming to an end. Earlier, 99% of the small and midcap stocks went higher and good investors like you were able to identify stocks which have done much better than the benchmark. Do you think it is time to get very selective?
I see it slightly differently. I feel the next cycle is starting for the investible quality in mid and smallcaps. It has started last week or maybe in the last two, three weeks. So another cycle is coming up in that and people will be not very happy with the kind of return that a Hindustan Lever or a Britannia or a Page and Eicher kind of stocks may give. They are wonderful companies, the best of companies. They have created great wealth and the promoters should be congratulated.

Remember Sun Pharma, Lupin in 2015. People were saying you the best companies are infallible, they can never disappoint you. At Rs 1200, Sun Pharma was the best company in the country and today after three years it is still below half the price. So, do not think everything is so evident in the companies. There can be problems in many sectors. Many of these high quality, high PE companies which created wealth in the last five, 10 years, are going to face competition going forward. 

Today the world is becoming smarter, entrepreneurs are becoming smarter, many of the family promoted and unprofessionally managed companies or traditionally managed companies are getting into a new growth orbit. They are understanding the benefit of growing the market cap, creating wealth through the market capitalisation. They are also going to be advised by the best of the talent in this country and they will create competition for the good players today. 

Certain companies were in a sweet spot and had very high margins and growth prospects in the last five, 10 years. That need not be repeated for the next five, 10 years. New people may come up. These companies that we are mentioning were all smallcaps years ago. Page Industries was only a Rs 500-crore market cap or Rs 300 crore in the beginning. People say do not buy smallcaps. What does it mean? That means you should not have bought Page Industries at Rs 500 crore?


You are of the view that there is serious money to be made in the small and the midcap space and one should not look at equities in a linear manner. Why don’t you clarify that viewpoint? Everybody thinks that equities are like fixed deposits, badhta hi rahega (will keep on growing)?
See, India has everything. Our economic structure is like that. Large global brands have an advantage. They will continue to be there. But that does not mean you buy a high quality company at any price. That is the simple thing I am telling you because if you stay overpriced, then there can be two, three sometimes five years of stagnation. This happened in Reliance. In last 10 years, Reliance did not create any wealth because people overpaid at that point of time and then they had to wait 10 years from where the stock went up by some 150%.

Even even I identified the stock and recommended below Rs 1,000. Now the stock is more than 100% up. So, this can happen to the best of companies in this country. We do not know. Do you have that kind of visibility for TCS for the next five, 10 years? I do not think, TCS management will be confidently telling you we can grow at this rate for the next 10 years. Things can change. So this is applicable also to the highest quality, most fancied companies today."

48,2018-08-11,Eicher,"Kunal Bothra, independent market analyst, gives a buy on M&M and a sell call on Tata Motors. Bothra was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts: 
  
  
  


How would you read into Friday’s move on the index? Does the fact that we fell in line with global cues worry you because the market is bloated and elevated at these levels?
I believe that it is going to be difficult to cross 11,500 mark and that is going to be one of the key hurdles which is going to test the mettle of this bull market. There are a couple of data points which transpired on Friday and also the entire last week. For a good part of the week, the market breadth remained on the positive side except for Friday. 

There was one important factor which gave the markets a bit of a concern and that was the rise of the dollar index. For the first time in last 12 months, we saw the dollar index rising above 96 mark. 

Also, if you look at the terms of the composition of stocks which were going up, a large part of the private sector banking names like HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank etc, were the ones which are now consolidating. L&T is still below its 200-day moving average and that is a big concern for the overall market structure as well. The 11500 call on the Nifty has the highest amount of open interest and even in the last week of rise, that open interest did not recede.

In fact, it just about increased on the higher side. All in all, you could be in for a bit if volatility, maybe a bit of retracement on the indices. 11,500 is the major resistance and on the support side, 11,200 is the point where we could try and test the support over the next couple of days.


What do you think is next in store for ICICI Bank which has had a stellar move and SBI after that bit of volatility on Friday, once the street was trying to digest the numbers and then that huge rebound that played out as well?
SBI ran slightly ahead of the results. Expectations were on the positive side and the stock had run up 15-16% in the last one and a half weeks odd of price performance. Post the results, we saw SBI correcting and in that process, formed a bearish engulfing kind of a pattern. I believe that over the next ouple of days at least, from a very near term view, the stock can retrace back to that Rs 300 mark. If it settles around this 200-day moving average which is around Rs 300 mark, the selling pressure could abate. 

As regards for ICICI Bank, the stock should consolidate for at least a week or two odd around this Rs 330 odd mark. The run-up has been very sharp and swift and the indicators have entered into the overbought territory. I believe ICICI Bank should consolidate in the near term.


How would you read into the rebound in Eicher Motors which played out on Friday? Is it going to continue or is it just a flash in the pan?
This could be a false rebound. On monthly charts, it has given a breakdown of a nine-year range in terms of couple of indicators. Rarely I have seen that the stock gives you a false breakout of a nine-year kind of range and such kind of breakdowns on the indicators result into the stock going to a multi- month, multi-quarter downtrend.

I believe that could be largely the pattern for Eicher Motors. These kind of rallies in terms of trading opportunities should be used for shorting cases and at 29,000-29,250 there are ample amount of resistances. I categorically believe that another 200-400 points rally on the stock and it should come back into a good shorting opportunity.


What can we trade on Monday morning?
Again it is a mixed kind of trading ideas which I am giving. The first one is a buy on M&M. It is an interesting chart not just because of the kind of breakouts the stock has seen but over the last six months as well, it has been one of the few stocks which has not shown any kind of volatility and that is I think a positive aspect. 

If you expect the index to become volatile, M&M could continue to ride higher from that angle as well. It is a buy and Rs 980 is a one week target and stop loss is closer to Rs 920-925 zone. 

And the second one would be a sell on Tata Motors. I believe that on daily charts the stock has once again broken a crucial support of 250 mark, it has shown signs of weakness trading below its long term as well as 50 DMA and I believe it could continue to drag lower so that is also a sell, targets of at least 235, stop loss 260."
53,2018-08-13,Eicher,"Edelweiss Financial Services has a buy call on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 35,731.

The current market price of Eicher Motors is Rs 28,442.30.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Eicher Motors price can reach the defined target. 


View of Edelweiss Financial Services on the company:
Eicher Motors’ (EIM) Q1FY19 consolidated EBITDA at Rs 8.1bn came in line with estimate despite higher-than-expected commodity pressure. While the waiting list has dipped to less than a month, demand outlook remains strong for premium products—higher demand for rear disc brake options (refer, Gun Metal Grey: Gunning for growth) and faster growth for >350cc segment (4MYTDFY19 growth at 35% YoY versus 17% for 350cc models). EIM is also expanding presence in low-penetration states, which should bolster growth despite the fact that in a few states (Maharashtra, Karnataka) RE demand is synchronising with industry trend. 650cc twins will be launched in September end and delivery will commence from December. Maintain ‘BUY’ with target price of Rs 35,731."

49,2018-08-13,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: After a gap of almost five years, the Eicher Motors stock may emerge as a ‘value’ play for investors who had missed buying into the Bullet-maker when business had moved to the premium end of the road.

Now, the gap in valuations between mass-market two-wheeler companies such as Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto on one hand and Eicher Motors on the other is narrowing. Still, the upside could be limited due to consistent moderation in volume growth in Maharashtra and Karnataka, unless new markets or products compensate the shortfall in the rate of expansion.

In the past five years, Eicher Motors has been viewed as a ‘growth’ story, a differentiated bike maker in a segment having low single-digit market share but high latency in demand. Consequently, the waiting period of the most selling bike Classic 350 rose to 12-15 months.

With the certainty of high volume visibility due to the waiting period, the Street was ascribing price-earnings multiple of more than 40 times until two years ago.

Eicher then increased its installed capacity to meet the market demand. The combination of incremental capacity and saturation in some markets has caused the waiting period to disappear.

Consequently, the volume growth of Royal Enfield has started moderating. Simultaneously, the PE multiple assigned to Eicher has started falling. The P/E multiple has fallen to 22 times one-year forward from 45 times two years ago.

Interestingly, the stock is back on the radar for investors looking for ‘value’ plays as the P/E premium between mass market twowheeler makers and Eicher has dropped to just 20 per cent.



Eicher’s stock deserves to trade at higher valuation given its presence in the premium market, which is having low risk of competition in the medium term. The company is also a key beneficiary of the shift toward premium bikes from the large pool of commuter bikes.

Credit Suisse has upgraded its rating to ‘neutral’ from ‘underperformer’ after the June quarter, citing that valuations are reasonable at 22 times and deserve a premium over other two-wheeler makers.

Furthermore, the company’s management in the June earnings conference call maintained its production guidance of 950,000 units (implies 15 per cent YoY) at the end of FY19. The Street has been pricing in volume growth of 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, for the current and next fiscal years.

Volume growth will be entirely dependent on how the company performs in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and West Bengal as these markets have been the biggest contributor to incremental sales.

The premium bike market in these four geographies is less than 4per cent, compared with the all-India average of 6.4per cent, thus providing enough room to expand.

In the first quarter of the current fiscal, these four markets accounted for about 23 per cent of the total sales volumes and grew in the range of 40-70 per cent, while unit sales in Maharashtra and Karnataka fell 15 per cent and 11per cent, respectively."

58,2018-08-16,Eicher,"The pecking order among the best-performing schemes in mutual funds has changed in the past three years. It has been observed that quite a few schemes of mid-sized fund houses have been featuring in the list of the best-performing plans across categories. Veteran fund managers and distributors give four key reasons for the rise and almost domination of schemes of mid-sized fund houses in the top five best-performing schemes.

The first reason, these veterans point out, is that long and sustained investments of several large fund houses in underperforming sectors have not paid off. They say these fund houses have, to a certain extent, entered a value ‘trap’. Second, investments of fund houses large in size in low quality stocks in the smallcap space have not been remunerative. Third, several large fund houses had high focus on hybrid funds since the markets turned expensive. They functioned with the line of thought that hybrid funds would be suitable for first-time investors. It was also observed that a large number of first-time investors opted for hybrid funds. Fourth, Asset Under Management (AUM) of several large-sized fund houses has shown tremendous growth in the past three years. This has shifted their focus more to beating the benchmark index of their schemes rather than accumulating stocks with high conviction and bottomup approach.

A combination of these four factors worked in favour of schemes of midsized fund houses which played different strategies. Here is a lowdown on strategies played by schemes of midsized fund houses that helped them climb the ranks of best performing schemes across categories:


Large and midcap

Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund
(Takes only SIP, no lump sum)
Fund manager: Neelesh Surana 
AUM: Rs 5,730 crore 
3-year return: 16.5% 
3-year category return: 10.7% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 13.4%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank

Surana has proved to be exception among the list of fund managers from mid-sized fund houses. Consistently maintaining the enviable top spot in the list of best performing schemes, especially in largeand mid-cap category across various market cycles, has earned him the faith of distributors and investors alike. His ability to pick stocks and stay away from momentum themes and follow high-conviction bets has paid off. Rising cashflows, relatively low debt, dominant nature of market share, quality management and scalability of business are strict checklists of variables that play a crucial in his stock selection. These variables have ensured consistency in performance. Three prominent stocks which have boosted the scheme’s performance are HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Havells India.


Large-capAxis Bluechip Fund
Fund manager: Shreyash Devalkar 
AUM: Rs 2,568crore 
3-year return: 12.39% 
3-year category return: 10.3% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 12.03%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC

After a long patch of ordinary performance, schemes of Axis Mutual Fund are featuring in the list of best-performing schemes. Prominent among these is Axis Bluechip. The scheme is back in the reckoning in the past one year. Fund manager Shreyash Devalkar, who joined the scheme in November 2016, follows a roadmap that is in sync with the fund house’s overall strategy. He focuses on growth companies that exhibit quality and attractive return ratios. As markets have become extremely focused on quality companies, Devalkar’s bets have paid off. Factors he kept in mind have been high return on equity (RoE), revenue and margin growth and penetration in market. Three sectors that met these criteria include financials, especially retail-focused banks, auto and auto-ancillaries and consumption. Prominent stocks that helped enhance the returns include Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors, and L&T.


MidcapKotak Emerging Equities Fund
Fund manager: Pankaj Tibrewal 
AUM: Rs 3,327crore 
3-year return: 12.61% 
3-year category return: 9.9% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 12.03%
Top 3 holdings: Bharat Financial, RBL Bank, Schaeffler India

Tibrewal looks for growth strategies and avoids value traps. Companies that have made their way into the scheme’s portfolio are the ones with good cash flows, capital allocation, and sound management with ability to scale up. The fund manager prefers structural growth stories where earnings can compound by 20-25%, and avoids cyclical stories. The fund has a sharp focus on risk management, with no stock constituting more than 5% of the portfolio. Churn in the portfolio is low at just 30-35%. Stocks like Whirlpool, Atul, Ramco, Finolex Cables have helped the fund throw in stellar returns.


ValueTata Equity PE Fund
Fund manager: Sonam Udasi
AUM: Rs 4,669 crore 
3-year return: 15.8% 
3-year category return: 11.2% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 11.6%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Yes Bank

Udasi diligently follows a simple strategy that has turned out to be extremely profitable in volatile phases. He selects 70% of the stocks in his portfolio that quote at price to earnings multiple (trailing) lower than the Sensex. For the remaining 30% of the portfolio, Udasi is comfortable to have companies which quote PEs higher than the Sensex. But these companies must have high visibility of earnings and attractive return ratios. This strategy has paid off in the past three years. A few prominent companies that have lifted the scheme’s performance are Yes Bank, City Union Bank, and Bajaj Finserv.


MulticapMotilal Oswal Multicap 35 Fund
Fund manager: Gautam Sinha Roy 
AUM: Rs 13,861crore 
3-year return: 13.11% 
3-year category return: 10.3% 
3-year Nifty Large Midcap 250 TRI (benchmark index): 12.11%
Top 3 holdings: HDFC, HDFC Bank, Maruti

Gautam adopts a bottom up approach to stock picking and is benchmark agnostic. Long-term secular growth stories fit into the portfolio and he does not mind paying a premium for valuations where growth prospects are high. The fund manager has been overweight on financials with NBFCs, housing finance, insurance and private banks accounting for 45% of its portfolio, which has yielded good returns. TCS and Infosys have been recent additions to the portfolio. Avoiding value traps like telecom, pharma and PSU banks has helped it deliver superior returns. Stocks like Bajaj Finance, HDFC Standard Life, Eicher have delivered high returns."

The company, which has earmarked a capex of Rs 500 crore for the ongoing financial year towards new product development and capacity expansion, is working to drive in an affordable range of air-conditioned buses to cater to public transit.

In a message to shareholders in the company's Annual Report for 2017-18, Lal said the company is also developing light and heavy-duty buses for the Middle East and African markets.

""We plan to have a complete range of electric-mobility solutions for public transportation, offering world-class quality and comfort. We are also developing an affordable air-conditioned range of buses aimed at bringing superior comfort to public transit,"" Lal said.

The company has already commenced operations of its Skyline Pro Electric buses in Kolkata and thus joined the league of zero-emission vehicle manufacturers, he added.

VECV, which sold a record 65,932 vehicles in 2017-18, a growth of 12.5 per cent over 2016-17 volumes, is also focussing on segments like construction, mining and e-commerce to drive future growth, he added.

On capex for 2018-19, he said: ""We plan to invest Rs 500 crore in VECV towards new product development and capacity enhancement.""

On domestic business, Lal said the company continues to retain 88 per cent market share in the high performance trucks segment (400+ horsepower) and is focussed on targeting mining segments besides quarrying, road construction, and irrigation to drive growth.

He added the company is preparing to introduce the BS-VI range of trucks and buses in the domestic market much before the April 1, 2020 deadline.

""We will have them in the market ahead of the April 1, 2020 deadline,"" he said.

Bullish on the Middle East and Africa, Lal said the company is developing light and heavy-duty buses for these markets.

VECV has already entered the ASEAN market with sales beginning in the first quarter of the current financial year. It has also begun setting up assembly operations in Bangladesh, after establishing the completely knocked-down (CKD) operations in Kenya and Nigeria."
63,2018-08-19,Eicher,"She is gradually stepping into an area which has been his fiefdom for ages, as more and more automobile companies in India encourage women to take up positions in manufacturing operations.

Not just in scooter or car manufacturing, today women are making their presence felt on shop floors in making tractors and trucks too with companies like Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto seeking to accelerate the drive of gender diversity.

Four years ago, Tata Motors started with a batch of just five women with an aim of ""creating a brigade of 'Women in Blue' by enrolling, educating and skilling girls, especially from economically deprived areas"".

Today, the company boasts of 1,812 women employees working on its shop floors, which is about 4 per cent of the total shop floor workforce (as on July 31, 2018), across its different plants.

Not too far behind, rival M&M's automotive division began with 23 in 2016 and today it has over 380 women across all its manufacturing plants, while the company's farm division and subsidiary Swaraj employs over 250 women on the shop floor.

Likewise, Royal Enfield, the two-wheeler division of Eicher Motors, runs an entire engine assembly line with women workforce of approximately 140.

Two-wheeler market leader Hero MotoCorp too had embarked on Project Tejaswani with an aim of introducing women in shop floor and today the company has 160 women working in various roles in assembly operations at its different factories.

Rival Bajaj Auto has 'Women Only' assembly lines at its Chakan and Pantnagar plants. In the last four years, its women employee strength has more than doubled to 355 in 2017-18 from 148 in 2013-14.

The slowly increasing population of women on shop floors of automobile companies is a sign of the changing times when gender equality is being stressed upon.

""At Tata Motors, we strongly believe that what's good for women is good for society and what's good for society is good for business,"" Tata Motors Chief Human Resources Officer Gajendra Chandel told PTI in an e-mailed response.

He said the company has taken certain internal targets to promote diversity positively balancing the same with meritocracy.

Echoing similar sentiment, M&M Chief People Officer Rajeshwar Tripathi said:""At Mahindra, we have taken several initiatives to step up gender diversity on the shop floor...The journey started with the hiring of 23 women associates in 2016 and the number has now increased to over 630.""

The strength of women on the company's shop floors is around 7.5 per cent of the total hiring in last two years, specifically for the shop floor, he added.

Tripathi further said women deployed on the shop floor do exactly the same work as their male counterparts. In fact, one of the women workers from the company's Kandivali Auto Division plant, Arati Patole was even recognised as ""an outstanding woman welder at the International Welding Competition that was held in Beijing"" recently.

Highlighting the impact of women on shop floors, he said:""We strongly believe that the inclusion of women workforce has contributed significantly to improving the culture at the shop floor.""

Their inclusion has also resulted in the use of more mechanised hauls, lifts and robotic power for various jobs on the shop floor, thereby making the work easier for all, he added.

Such is the significance given to employment of women in various roles in auto industry that some top management officials are taking the responsibility personally.

In his message to shareholders in the company's annual report 2017-18, Hero MotoCorp Chairman, Managing Director and CEO Pawan Munjal said: ""I am personally driving the agenda of gender diversity and empowerment at Hero MotoCorp and consequently, the number of women staff ? including on our shop floors - has gone up considerably over the past few years.""

Similarly, Eicher Motors told its shareholders that it was continuously adding diverse workforce which includes diversity of gender, experience, industries, and geographies at the production sites, technical centres and the rest of the organisation.

In an e-mailed response, Royal Enfield said the percentage of women workforce in the plants has been increasing 10 per cent year-on-year for the last three years.

""The organisation aims to increase diversity on the shop floor to 30 per cent over the next five years,"" it added.

The automobile companies are taking gender diversity with all seriousness, beyond the tokenism of merely employing women.

Tripathi said M&M started recruiting women officers on shop floor few years ago, as GET/ GAT (fresh engineering graduates) trainees.

""A bold step was taken to hire a minimum of 33 per cent women GATs/GETs at entry level across all locations. Going forward, we are trying to significantly increase the first line of women engineers or supervisors on the shop floor,"" he added.

Similarly, Chandel said:""Tata Motors is highly focused on skilling them (women workers) through structured technical education programmes run in collaboration with the Automotive Skill Development Council.""

He further said:""While we have embarked on this journey, we not only hope and believe, but have made concerted efforts on diversity that will add sustained value for the company."""

70,2018-08-20,Eicher,"It took seven months for NSE’s Nifty index to move from 11,000 to 11,500 level. This period remained highly volatile for the domestic equity market amid trade war tensions, sustained outflow of foreign portfolio money, rising crude oil prices and a depreciating local currency. 

After scaling the 11,000 mark for the first time on January 23, the index hit a low of 9,951 on March 23. However, buying in 22 index stocks took it above 11,500 on August 20.

Shares of Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have rallied 67 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, since January 23. Twenty other blue chips – HUL, TCS, M&M, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank and ITC – have rallied between 10 per cent and 30 per cent during this period. 

In terms of valuation, the index is looking expensive compared with its long-term moving average. The 50-share index traded at a P/E of over 28 times on Monday compared with its 10-year average of 20.90. 

Basant Maheshwari, Co-Founder & Partner Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers LLP in a tweet said, “Comparing the average Nifty P/E across stocks is like comparing the average salaries of a scientist, doctor, engineer and part-time gardeners & drivers – high quality secular growth and low quality cyclicals. Nifty has more scientists, doctors, engineers now, than it did 20 years back.”

Among other Nifty stocks, GAIL, YES Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, Eicher Motors, Titan, Cipla, Axis Bank, HCL Technologies and HDFC have gained up to 10 per cent since January 23. 

On the other hand, Tata Motors, Vedanta, HPCL, Bharti Airtel and UPL slipped up to 38 per cent between January 23 and August 17.

The BSE Sensex also hit a fresh record high of 38,266 in early trade on Monday. Gains in capital goods, metals, realty and banking stocks amid firm Asian cues aided the market. 

From a valuation perspective, analysts are not too comfortable with the current level of the market.

Even though the Sensex typically trades at a premium to its peers, it is currently trading at a higher-than-normal premium relative to its emerging market (EM) peers. For instance, from a five-year average perspective, India typically traded at a premium of 18 per cent to the median P/E of nine emerging markets. However, today India trades at a whopping 37 per cent premium to median P/E of EMS, Ambit Capital said in its recent report.

The 30-share index currently trades at a 21 per cent premium to its 10-year average P/E ratio, Ambit said.

The recent rally in the stock market has more support from domestic flows than FIIs. On a year-to-date basis, foreign portfolio investors have taken out some Rs 1300 crore, while domestic institutional investors have poured in more than Rs 68,300 crore.

“Many emerging markets, maybe not so much in India, are under severe distress. I’m talking about some very high-growth economies, like those in Eastern Europe. And we have economies like Poland, which are doing well. Yet, these stock markets relative to the US are at multi-decade lows. Liquidity in markets like the Philippines and Indonesia has completely dried up. India has been fortunate that it has had a domestic investor base, which has kept the market humming,” New York-based investor and author Ruchir Sharma told ET in an interview."

73,2018-08-21,Eicher,"MUMBAI: CLSA said select companies could see adverse impact in the September quarter results due to impact of the Kerala floods.

The firm said it does not see meaningful adverse impact on broader corporate results for the September quarter. 

""Some companies that would be impacted include general insurance companies, select cement companies (like Ramco/India Cements), auto companies (viz, Eicher and Maruti) and jewellery companies (like Titan). Production of rubber and copra may be impacted, with a possible small impact on Marico,"" said CLSA. 

With limited presence of corporate head offices or manufacturing units in the state, the impact of Kerala floods would be felt more by way of consumption, said CLSA.

The firm said that the timing of the floods is particularly bad from a seasonality perspective, as Kerala’s main annual festival period of Onam is scheduled over 
24 August – 4 September, which could result in weaker sales for consumer durable companies, including auto. 

""Kerala is an important market for Eicher (11%), Maruti (8%) and Ashok (4%). Also, the second quarter contributed 29-33% of 2-Ws and PV sales in FY18, corresponding with the Onam festival,"" said CLSA. 

The firm said cement companies Ramco Cements and India Cements, which are both based in South India, could see a near-term demand slowdown. ""Reconstruction efforts later though could make up for the temporary demand loss,"" said CLSA. 

Ten percent of Sun TV Networks' revenues are attributable to Kerala, said CLSA."

75,2018-08-24,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: One beautiful thing about India’s stock market is that even the layman on the road can give you a 10-minute lecture on the most dominant investment theme: consumption.

It’s the demographic dividend, he would boast, and then go on to add rising incomes and superfast growth rate to do the math.

Problem is, he does not know there is a caveat: India’s household savings are falling and debt rising.

Some analysts on Dalal Street are already red-flagging what they call unreasonable volume growth expectations for consumer players, which may have led to frothy valuations. A peek into the household balance sheet of the average Indian family tells the story.

RBI’s recent consumer confidence survey (CCS) found around three-fourth of Indian households thought their income levels either decreased or remained same. More than half of them believed their income would either remain the same or deteriorate in next one year.

Income growth confidence, price projections and spending projections are key determinants of spending power of the average consumer.

Most respondents in the RBI survey felt their spending would increase in next one year, especially for non-essential items. And a large 77 per cent of those polled believed inflation will rise in the coming year.

Others
June quarters numbers of consumption-lined companies met Street expectations. 

Consumption stocks, too, have performed well. Shares of passenger vehicle major Maruti Suzuki have climbed 21 per cent in last one year. M&M, which makes tractors and utility vehicles, has risen 40.43 per cent. 

The BSE FMCG index, meanwhile, has risen 26 per cent in last one year compared with a 21 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex. Retail-linked NBFCs such as Bajaj Finserv (up 32 per cent), Shriram Transport (up 34 per cent) also have performed pretty well in last one year. With exceptions like Symphony, stocks of most white goods companies such as Bajaj Electriacals, IFB Industries and Havells India have gained between 40 per cent and 80 per cent. Two-wheeler stocks, though, have failed to pick up pace. Hero MotoCorp is down 16 per cent in last one year; Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors and TVS Motor are down up to 8 per cent.

The real test for corporate earnings from a growth perspective will come from second quarter onwards, Suhas Harinarayananan of JM Financial told ETNow.

""If you look at all the consumer companies, which actually outperformed in terms of volume growth, for a whole host of those companies, the two-year CAGR growth is actually not-so-impressive. You had a good run rate for Q3FY18, Q4FY18 and Q1FY19, but these were quarters that had some form of disruption or the other. Let us see how the numbers look from Q2 onwards. Harinarayananan said.

He said there is a sense of optimism because one of the key engines, which have driven this growth, has been better liquidity in rural India and that continues to be strong. ""But will companies achieve Q1 numbers of very high-double digits, high-teen numbers going ahead? I would be a little cautious on that,"" he said. 


Economic data tells a story
At a broader level, consumption growth of Indian households is outpacing income growth. This has come at the cost. Household savings have fallen to the lowest level in more than two decades.

Here household is a broader term that includes resident households, not-for-profit institutions and quasi-corporate houses. 

As real income growth lagged consumption growth, total household debt has also climbed to an all-time high level. Such a trend is not sustainable, Mumbai brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities said in a report.


Consumption on a rise, but at a cost
In five years till FY18, the growth in personal consumption expenditure (PCE) outpaced the growth in personal disposable income (PDI) in India.

PDI is the income available with a household for spending and saving after accounting for income-tax, while PCE is the expenditure incurred on the final consumption of goods and services by the households. 

Recent trend shows a drop in household savings to 21 per cent at $370 billion of PDI in FY17 from 29 per cent of PDI at $431 billion in FY12.

Households didn’t have to rely initially on debt to support higher consumption growth, and thus, their debt (institutional and non-institutional) hovered around 42 per cent of PDI between FY09 and FY15, the Motilal Oswal study showed. 

This was the initial phase of higher-than-income growth in consumption, when households had almost entirely depended on their savings. This phase was reflected by a continuous drop in household savings since FY12, even as institutional debt of households broadly remained unchanged between FY09 and FY14.

But over the past three years, a combination of higher debt and weak income growth has pushed this ratio to 48 per cent at $950 billion in FY18, the report said. 

This (total debt) estimate takes into account the fact that households also borrow from non-institutional sources such as professional money lenders, relatives/friends, agricultural money lenders, and thus, data for non-institutional debt is added with institutional debt to arrive at the figure, the report said. 

Unlike in FY18, in FY19 nominal income will grow faster, but that will mostly be offset by higher inflationary pressures. Real income could grow only slightly faster in FY19 at around 6 per cent vis-à-vis 5.8 per cent in FY18. This would mean household savings would fall further to 15.7 per cent of GDP in FY19, the lowest level in three decades since liberalisation. Household debt will also continue to grow unabated supporting consumption growth, the brokerage said.

""With investments and fiscal spending likely to grow slowly in FY19, we believe a pick-up in the consumption growth should be the key determinant of FY19 real GDP growth. Although, household income is expected to grow faster this year, rising household debt, falling savings and limited rise in assets are likely to cap consumption growth,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said. 


Flows to stock market at risk?
Meanwhile, should inflation rise as expected, domestic flows to the stock market may come under pressure. India’s household savings-to-GDP ratio currently stands at a 20-year low.

If inflation rises from here on owing to the fiscal pump-priming, then not only will the household savings ratio come under greater stress, but worryingly the proportion of financial savings to total savings would fall, limiting domestic flows into the Indian stock market, brokerage Ambit Capital projected in a report."

81,2018-08-27,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Kerala's ravaging floods are likely to give tyre companies a serious headache in coming one or two quarters, say analysts.

Kerala makes up close to 85 per cent of domestic natural rubber production, and the incessant rains mean production is likely to take a hit. 

According to ATMA’s (Automotive Tyre Manufactures Association) earlier estimates, domestic rubber output was expected at 600,000 mt in FY19, with imports at 5,00,000 mt. With large-scale destruction of rubber trees, imports are expected to temporarily go up. And that could lead to compression of gross margins.

Also, tyre companies with plants in Kerala -- Apollo Tyres and MRF -- are staring at production losses due to lack of civic amenities and low employee attendance, said Emkay Global Securities in its research report. 

Last week, Apollo Tyres said its production operations at plants in Kerala have been disrupted due to the ongoing flooding in the state. The company has two plants in Perambra and Kalamassery. Till then, production loss due to the natural calamity stood at nearly 1,500 mt, said an ETAuto report.

Shares of Apollo Tyres have declined 12 per cent since August 1 till Friday (August 24) while those of MRF have shed 7 per cent during the window. 

Brokerage Emkay Global Securities in its report said, ""Assuming 10 per cent shift in rubber procurement mix towards imported rubber, the raw material cost... could increase by 25 bps for Apollo Tyres."" 

India Ratings in its recent research report stated that the margin of tyre companies is likely to shrink by 1.5-2 per cent between the second and third quarters of FY19 as imports rise because of lack of natural rubber supply in the aftermath of the floods.

""Floods in Kerala will disrupt domestic supply and hence, tyre companies will resort to higher imports to meet the rising tyre demand,"" India Ratings said in its report.

Natural rubber imports attract a duty of 25 per cent.

""Additionally, with a depreciating rupee, imports are likely to be more expensive and will hurt margins of tyre companies amid a rise in rubber procurement costs,"" it said.

Input cost for tyre firms is seen to harden over the next 2-3 quarters on disruptions of natural rubber supply, it said.

However, the ratings agency is optimistic about tyre demand and sees it to turn robust for FY19. It expects production and margins to start reviving by the end of the December quarter. Production is likely to take a beating during August-October, particularly for those whose plants are located in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, reported PTI citing the report. 

The automotive sector's volume is also come under strain in the wake of the disaster. ""Near-term sales volume is likely to be impacted across segments. Kerala accounts for 8 per cent, 5 per cent, 4 per cent and 3 per cent of volume in PV, 3W, 2W and CV, respectively,"" said Emkay Global Securities.

93,2018-08-30,Eicher,"MUMBAI: Global superbike makers Harley Davidson and Triumph have announced new, low-displacement bikes for emerging markets that will directly aim at the portfolio of Royal Enfield. So the Indian company that produced Bullet has chosen to respond by making its own range of big bikes, codenamed J, P, Q and K.

Royal Enfield is today the most profitable two-wheeler maker in India with ebitda margins of over 30% and it has a market share of 90% in the 200-500 cc space, led by the Classic 350 model. Unsurprisingly, the global majors are targeting the mid-size segment of 250-700 cc. This will be the biggest product launch by Royal Enfield under the ownership of Eicher Motors. 

A dozen models are planned over next three to five years, offering a range of new bikes from 350 cc to 650 cc and above. Work is going on at the company’s UK development centre, with critical feedback from India.

Five people in the know of Royal Enfield's plans spoke to ETfor this story, all off the record. Company spokespersons declined comment on specific plans. While the J architecture is aimed at protecting its domestic turf against the ensuing competition with the new generation BS-VI version of Classic, Thunderbird, Bullet, and Himalayan, the P architecture will produce the twin cylinder bikes Continental 650 cc and Interceptor 650 cc to help the company compete strongly against Harley and Triumph in global markets.


ACQUIRING TOP TALENT
Bigger bikes will be made on the Q and K platform post 2020-2021. The Q architecture is aimed at Triumph Thruxton, whereas the K platform will come out with even bigger bikes above 600-700 cc. Royal Enfield is aiming to take its market leadership in the mid-size motorcycle space from India to the global stage. Both improved production facilities and acquiring top talent are in focus. Shubranshu Singh was recently hired as head of global brands. He comes with extensive experience from consumer and entertainment industries. 

Enfield is also talking to Vimal Sumbly, the former head of Triumph brand in India, to lead its Asia-Pacific business, which the company believes has the potential to be a big volume contributor in the future. It first hired the services of ex-Harley Davidson man Rod Copes a few years back to lead Enfield’s North American operations. 

Plus other executives from global motorbike makers like Triumph have been hired to develop these big bikes. Globally, mid-size bikes are less than 2%, or nearly 1 million, of the total 55 million market. The company will be targeting the segment particularly in markets such as Brazil and Latin America where the mid-size bike is contributing more than 5% of the total market.

The company already has some presence in these markets. However, even as global expansion gains momentum, there is a question mark on Royal Enfield’s domestic sales growth. In mature markets like Maharashtra and Karnataka and even in Kerala, Eicher has been witnessing weakness for the last couple of years. The company is betting that the new generation Bullet, Classic, Thunderbird, and Himalayan will give it further leg in the domestic market. It will need that if J, P, Q and K are to rise against Harleys and Triumphs."

0,2018-09-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Market kept its slate clean on Friday by rallying for the sixth straight week on the back of select heavyweights. But the rupee's rapid descent towards 71-mark against the dollar came as a rude jolt. 

The Sensex advanced 1.03 per cent to 38,645.10 for the week to August 31, from 38,251.80 in the previous one. The NSE Nifty added 1.06 per cent at 11,680.50, from 11,557.10 during the same period.

More than 30 stocks in the Nifty index ended the week in the green, with UPL, Hindalco, Tech Mahindra, PowerGrid and Tata Steel rising up to 10 per cent. YES Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance Industries, Eicher Motors and GAIL were not as lucky, slipping up to 8 per cent.

Rupee's diminished clout remains a big worryline. The slide is mainly a fallout of elevated crude prices, worsening current account deficit (CAD), spike in inflation and fears of foreign portfolio outflow.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes, according to Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management, show that the benchmark finished the week below the 11,700 level. However, the index bulls failing to take out 11,760 might be a point of concern on a short-term basis. Hence staying cautious on rise is advised. 

Breaking out 11,760 may unfold a fresh leg of upmove towards 11,880 levels. Further, Nifty broader trading range for the coming week is expected to be 11,880-11,520.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Hindalco Industries, ONGC, Tech Mahindra and Bharti Infratel were among the top losers in the Nifty pack of stocks."
19,2018-09-06,Eicher,"The stock market on Thursday traded on expected lines, as it did attempt to gain some stability after six days of losing streak. However, this happened amid volatility.

The Nifty swung nearly 150 points in either direction, before ending the day with a gain of 59.95 points or 0.52 per cent.

With Thursday’s trade, the index has established its current trading range of 11,760-11,395, and the level of 11,395 will be very crucial level to watch out for the near term.

There are chances that the market may spend some time in this range before it take further directional call.

Friday is likely to once again see a stable start to the trade. The levels of 11,590 and 11625 will act as immediate resistance area on Friday. Supports may come in at 11,450 and 11,395 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 55.6154 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. On the candles, a not-so-classic candle with a long lower shadow occurred. The shadow is not long enough to be called a classical long lower shadow.


ETMarkets.com
However, with the previous session’s low not taken out, the market is in the process of finding some temporary bottom.

The pattern analysis suggests Nifty is attempting to find a temporary bottom after a sharp correction in the past couple of sessions. With the index trading a notch below the short term 20-DMA, it might act as support.

What we saw over the past couple of sessions was a sharp partial reversion to the mean and this was imminent, as the market had run ahead of its curve.

The rally that it had seen was too sharp and it was visibly overextended and overbought. Now there is a high probability that the market may oscillate in a broad 11,395-11,760 range for some time.

Our analysis for Friday’s trade remains on similar lines and we recommend staying away from creating short positions. In event of any downsides, select purchases may be made. While maintaining enough liquidity to absorb volatile moves, cautiously positive outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Good technical set up is observed in stocks like Aurobindo Pharma, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, NCC, TVS Motors, Ashok Leyland, PFC, Wipro, PowerGrid, Reliance Industries, Biocon and NMDC.

21,2018-09-07,Eicher,"We are looking for companies that are very differentiated, have terrific management teams at the helm and where we see long enough runway for growth, Sumeet
   
   
   
   Nagar, MD, Malabar Investments, tells Nikunj Dalmia of ET Now, in an exclusive interview.Edited excerpts: 

Where were you hiding during the selloff? 
It has been a good environment in Dubai. Last year, when the market was moving one way up, it was very difficult to go on buying good opportunities but in the last couple of quarters, when there was a pressure on small and midcaps, we are able to find opportunities to invest more. We like environments like that. 


So, you are greedy right now. You do not think that tide has turned permanently in favour of largecap stocks.
No, there is nothing like a permanent shift. I have always said that over very long terms, the market prices will respond through fundamental improvement in companies. If you think about earnings as those fundamentals, if companies are able to grow their earnings, their market prices will reflect that over the long term. It is just that the valuation at which those earnings are valued, changes from time to time. But that is just noise. Over a very long term, if the company is able to grow its earnings, you should see that in the stock price. We can find companies like that. In current environment, if you are able to find them at slightly better valuation, so much the better.


In general, the view is that only a handful of small businesses become midcap businesses and only a handful of midcap businesses become largecap businesses. Do you think the environment is not conducive for some of the smaller businesses and medium-sized businesses because interest rates are increasing, commodity prices are increasing and the trade war fear is now real?
The challenges are always there. Nobody would allow you to become big because everybody wants to take advantage of the market, everybody wants to grow their business. You have to have something unique and differentiated about your business and the way you work -- whether it is through technology or scale, something has got to be different about you and your offering and only then can you grow faster than the others. 

You need to be in businesses which allow that sort of scalability. You want to find companies and market that are growing and where there is a lot of room to grow. You can be a profitable business but you can never scale it up to become 10-50-100 times. If you find that scalable business and a great company within that, it is a differentiated offering and those companies can actually compound for many years to come.


How many stocks have you added or how many new businesses have you invested in this financial year?
We are long-term investors. We do not churn our portfolio very much. In most cases, we add to existing positions. But selectively, we always look to find great ideas and it is always with the view that if you find a great idea that is better than what you have in the portfolio, then you make that switch. But you want to keep that concentration. The one very sizable investment that we made over the last one year was in a technology company. But we added to many of our existing portfolio companies where we thought the valuations have become reasonable and it provides a good risk-reward tradeoff.


Where exactly have you added and which is this technology company you have acquired?
It is very interesting. If you look at the developed markets like the US over the last decade or two, a great deal of value creation has happened through technology or internet companies, like Google, Facebook or Amazon. Even in developing countries like China, there are companies like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent whose shareholders have done phenomenally well by investing in companies like that. 

Even in India, there have seen some value creation happening through private companies like Flipkart or Paytm but unfortunately the public market investors have been left high and dry. We have not found any great internet or e-commerce focussed companies but we know that there is a huge value migration that is going on and is going to happen for over the next 10-20 years. We have always been looking for the right opportunity. The challenge always has been that even in private markets you find companies that are growing but they are not profitable and there are few ones which are listed in public markets they are profitable but they are not growing. We are lucky enough to find a company that had both of those.


Is it a listed company?
It is a private company today but it is going to be listed fairly soon. It is called as Affle India and not many people know but they are probably the largest mobile advertising company in India.


I did not know about this.
People have heard of InMobi. It is doing very well but a lot of their business is global but within India, Affle has become the largest player.


Are they planning to go public soon?
Yes, they should be going public over the next month, month and a half or so.


So, you have no plans to sell it when it goes public? Typically, when pre-IPO placements happen, anchor investors tend to sell out after their lock-in period.
I do not think we have any such intention. It is a fantastic business and a fantastic company if you think about the world today and the way things are evolving. There was Warren Buffett’s interview just a few days ago. When somebody asked him about Apple and why they are buying it more, he said an iPhone is still cheap at a $1000 for the value that it creates for people. What he said is that the most valuable real space in this world is actually on this phone. 

Most of the people are going to be buying things over the phone, the value of being on that mobile phone is huge and as you look forward over the next 10 or 20 years, everybody would want their apps to be installed on the phone and there is a huge gap between advertising wanting their apps have installed and consumers acting on that. Affle is one of those companies that has figured out the optimum way to find the likely users for the product and then the most efficient way of targeting them. As a result, they are quite profitable and growing rapidly.


What have you bought or added more from the public market?
From the public market, we have got many of the existing portfolio positions. One of our largest adds was in Safari, something that I had mentioned before. The luggage industry is doing very well. Within that, Safari is gaining share by virtue of being the third largest player but sort of increasing its market share over the years. With increasing size, comes operating leverage and they are benefitting from all of those trends. This has been one of our additions. We have added to the professional staffing companies as well.


Are they expensive?
They had become quite expensive in between but over the last few months they have come under pressure and have gone to reasonable levels. They are expensive if you just look at trailing numbers but if you see the level of growth and scalability, these companies can easily become 10 times, 15 times, 20 times the size of where they are today. Given that potential. they are still fairly small.


The macro regime has changed, crude is at $75-80 or in between $75 and $80, rupee definitely is not sub-70 now. Is that forcing you to think or invest the way you have not done in the past?
As you know, we are long-term bottom-up investors. The environment is important for understanding what sort of stance you want to take. In cricket parlance, whether to play front foot or back foot. You look at the pitch, you look at the conditions and in the current environment, you are better off playing slightly on the back foot. You want to make sure that the companies that you are looking at do not have exposure to the macro negatives whether it is interest rates or commodities or the currency or if they have strong pricing power, to pass that on. 

You want to be doubly sure of that. That is why I say I will be a little bit on the back foot, be circumspect of that investment thesis that you are thinking about and make sure these companies can navigate through these times. On one hand, you have these macro negatives. The elections are coming up but on the positive side, global economy is still growing fairly well. The Indian economy, after the twin shocks of last year, is chugging along very well. It is picking up and once the election uncertainty is over, it can continue along that path. It is a good balanced situation.


Are you fully invested in the funds which you manage or are you sitting on cash which is higher than the average?
No, we are actually slightly below average. Towards the end of the last year, our cash levels were higher but in the last two quarters, as we have seen prices come down, we have been able to deploy some of that. It is also taking advantage of those opportunities. Many of the challenges that you see are shorter term in nature. From a longer-term perspective, if you are able to find great companies at good prices, you want to add them.


NBFCs had a great run because interest rates kept coming down. PSU banks never had money to lend and NBFCs got the market share. The reason why I am asking you this question is because it brings in the micro part that you own -- Chola. Can the change in interest rate force you to rethink your thesis in Chola?I will answer that for NBFCs in general and not talk specifically about Chola. During the rising tide of declining interest rates, many of the NBFCs did very well. There was not much differentiation in terms of quality. But when you have a reverse environment, when interest rates are rising, quality will start to matter a lot more. 

You will see a dispersion of sort coming through and we are likely to see that going forward. The companies that have a strong pricing power should be able to pass on any sort of increases that come in. These are the ones that would do very well. Chola as a business is fairly good. Part of our thesis on Chola was the leadership of Vellayan and with that changing, the thesis changes a bit. On the leadership front, there is still a lack of clarity but as a business it is still pretty good.


Do you still own Chola?
We had reduced our position in Chola partly because of the leadership changes and partly because I think a strong run up that we had seen towards the end of last year. But as a business, it is pretty good.


Siddharth Lal is a great guy but my personal view on Eicher has been that it is an expensive franchise where numbers may slow down. Now let us look at the numbers, the slowdown for Eicher is visible because the base effect has kicked in but the stock has come down from 35,000 to 27,000-28,000. What are your thoughts on Eicher, do you still own it?
Yes, we still own Eicher. We have not added much to it but we still own it. The challenges are there, the growth has obviously come off. Obviously, the kind of growth that they were seeing in the past is tough to do on a fast enough pace. But they still have many drivers in place that have not come through yet. 

If you turn on the TV, you see ads from most two-wheeler companies but you never see a single ad by Eicher or Royal Enfield. They have not pushed on that lever at all. Part of it is that on the capacity side also, they were a little bit constrained. Once that lifts, maybe they will have the ability to sell more and maybe advertise more. This year, they have one of the biggest changes in terms of new products that is coming through. 

If you think about the twin engine technology, it is a fundamental shift. And more than the platform, twin engine is very different from a single engine. So for a mechanical engineering geek, you get that. It is a pretty fundamental shift that they have made and it provides them a platform with which they can succeed in the global markets. Whether they can or not, time will show but they have done all the right things to put themselves in the right position to succeed. 


So you are in no hurry to sell Eicher but you are in no urgency to buy Eicher as well. Can I put it this way?
At this stage, it is fairly balanced. It will still provide the upside if they add on capacity and the volume growth picks up again same time if the models do well. With the new models, see that they do not need to generate much volume growth and still do fairly high sales growth because these models are going to be at 1.5-2x the price point. In the exports market, they will probably get 3x the price points. Even with fairly modest volume growth, you can generate fairly good sales growth and with profitable products, bottom line can grow faster. At this stage, it still provides good upside but if the market becomes jittery about their prospects and we find attractive opportunity, we will add more.


The unique bit about Malabar Investments is that you are not a theme-oriented guy, you are more like a bottoms-up guy. If I look at your top eight, 10, 11 holdings, there is no common thread in them. There is Eicher, an auto company, Cholammandalam, an NBFC, a technology company like Affle, Safari a play on consumer durables, Repro, Avanti Feeds. They are not connected. That is the bottom line.
The common theme would be that each of these businesses are truly differentiated in what they do. 


Is that a conscious diversification or did it just happen?
No, it is a bottom up approach. We are looking to find the best players in each field. And we do not want to have too many players in the same area. We are looking for companies that are very differentiated, have terrific management teams at the helm and where we see long enough runway for growth. That is the common theme.

Which stocks according to you are nearing the expiry age? Businesses may not be nearing their expiry age but which stocks in your portfolio are in their last or maybe the second last lap for investors?

That is tough to say. 


Even Avanti is not in the last lap?
Avanti is at a cyclical downturn. Avanti as a business still has a runway to grow on the feed side, maybe the growth comes off but on the processing side they have a long runway to still grow. The challenge with Avanti was that on peak margins, people were willing to give it peak multiples and that is one of the reasons why we very reluctantly ended up selling that position even though we have a lot of faith in the management.


So you are out of Avanti as a portfolio investment?
Yes. We sold that off because we still believe very strongly in the business and the management theme but this notion of peak earnings or peak margins and peak multiples on top of that it usually does not end well. And that is what ended up happening but they at some point will become attractive again and over the long term, it is still a great business to be invested in."
22,2018-09-09,Eicher,"The Friday’s session on Dalal Street was relatively stable, as the market opened lower, but recovered later to end with modest gains. The market crawled back into the positive territory after trading in the negative in the morning session.

Thereafter, the NSE benchmark Nifty saw steady upmove and ended with a gain of 52.20 points or 0.45 per cent. The market breadth saw some improvement, as broader markets relatively outperformed the Nifty.

As we approach Monday, we expect a modestly positive start to the day. Though we may still not see any runaway upmove, there are brighter chances that we see a stable and rangebound sessions. The index has managed to crawl back above its short term 20-DMA and may see modest upsides from here. However, the broader range of the market is not likely to be broken too soon.

Monday is likely to see the levels of 11,635 and 11,690 acting as immediate resistance area, while supports are expected to come in at 11,550 and 10,480 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 58.7899 and it stays neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish as it trades below its signal line. A white body occurred on the candles. Apart from this, no significant formations were observed.


ETMarkets.com
If we look at the pattern analysis, it becomes visibly evident that the market was trading overbought after an overextended upmove. It showed sharp retracement in form of corrective moves, which was more like partial reversion to the mean. At present, the 20-DMA has been held and we may continue to see the market showing a range-bound behaviour.

Overall, a stable start is expected to the day and we expect the market to trade with positive bias. Some volatility might persist, but no major corrective moves are seen unless we have some negative macroeconomic data to deal with.

We also expect the broader market to do relatively better. Given the structure on the higher time frame charts, we recommend continuing protecting profits at higher levels.

Though there may be no significant downsides, upsides too may remain capped. Cautiously positive view is advised for the day.

23,2018-09-10,Eicher,"ET Wealth together with Morningstar India have selected and ranked India's best equity fund managers, across categories, based on their five-year risk-adjusted returns. Here are the top 5 in the mutli cap category. These managers have proved their mettle while dealing with stock market volatility and have delivered consistent returns over the years. Read about each of these managers, their top stock and sector picks and what they think is the promising theme for the next few years.


Has your fund manager changed focus? 
After the recent scheme recategorisation exercise, several funds have changed colours. While some have shifted their market segment focus—from large-cap to multi-cap or mid-cap to large and mid-cap, etc.—others have altered their investing style, such as taking on a focused stance or value bias from the earlier diversified approach. For funds that have seen such a visible shift in mandate, the entire track record built previously has effectively become irrelevant. 

By extension, the performance of the fund manager handling the scheme will have to be viewed differently. The new positioning may require the fund manager to adopt a different approach, so his past performance with the same fund may not be a suffi cient guide for his future performance. However, this is no reason for investors to exit the scheme. 

In such cases, it would be a good idea to treat the revamped fund as a fresh offering and allow the fund manager to build a track record under the revised strategy. Track his performance closely over the coming year. This is particularly required for schemes under the newly defined largecap or mid-cap categories, as they gear up for generating alpha without some of the earlier flexibility.

5-year asset weighted return: 23.88%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 8,620 crore


Profile
Jinesh Gopani has an impressive track record, especially in steering the country’s biggest tax-saving equity fund. His approach has been to identify secular growth stories and stay invested for the long term rather than earning a quick return by opting for momentum-based plays. He prefers leaders and potential leaders across sector that boast of a strong business model or have the ability to disrupt existing models.

Capital preservation is an important pillar in his investing framework and he stresses on ensuring better downside protection. This is evident in the superior risk-return profile of the more aggressive of his funds— Axis Focused 25. Despite the burgeoning size of his tax-saving fund, Gopani has maintained a compact portfolio as it allows him to take meaningful exposure in his conviction bets.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“After a phase focused on quality, the rally has now become more broadbased. Earnings remain key and the numbers this time have been positive. We remain quality biased, and this has helped us deal with market volatility.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Our focus remains on quality. Results of our universe of stocks have been strong. Staying with fundamentally sound companies that have consistently delivered earning growth has been key to our strategy on generating alpha.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“We are bullish on rural and consumption themes. Here we are focusing on companies that can be market disrupters. There are two types of disrupters, traditional bellwethers looking to reinvent the market place and new disrupters that enter the markets and change the way the industry does business.”

Profile
The ferocity of market reactions in recent years have taken most by surprise, admits Dhimant Shah. The market tends to react much before one can analyse the situation, which has necessitated a greater speed of response, he points out. Shah has stressed on identifying businesses with healthy growth potential, aided by visible competitive advantages and backed by an able management.

His funds have favoured companies that emerged stronger after the market downturn five years ago. Shah believes that the market will significantly mature in the coming years as domestic participation increases—and show better resilience to foreign selling. With quality of corporate results likely to improve, stock selection will be critical to sustain alpha, says Shah.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“The market appears to be overvalued with the risk-reward scenario favouring a downside. The key risks will be falling government spending, forthcoming elections, rising inflation, currency risks, external risks of oil and repercussions of a trade war.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Steering through the current market is slightly difficult as volatility has increased sharply in recent months. We could take higher cash calls, increase allocation to defensives and book profits regularly.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Companies catering to defence appear strong for the next 3-5 years as they could see meaningful growth in the offsets and the size of opportunities that come their way. Select autoancillaries also show promise, given the rising affluence, middle class consumption and the scrapping policy.”

5-year asset weighted return: 19.23%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 636 crore


Profile
Rajeev Thakkar has clearly shown what it takes to steer a value-biased fund through market conditions hostile to value-based investing. With mid- and small-caps dominating investors’ mindspace in recent years, he acknowledges that a lot more caution and spadework is needed to navigate the tricky multi-cap space. 

While leaning towards value, Thakkar has opted not for the cheapest stocks but for reasonably-priced companies backed by better earnings visibility. Thakkar’s thrust has been on companies whose return on capital employed has been consistent across business cycles. He does not believe in staying fully invested at all times, preferring to take cash calls when faced with scarcity of investible ideas. He also stresses on the need to diversify across geographies to contain volatility—select bets in foreign companies have worked in his favour.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“The market is at elevated levels relative to earnings. We are also headed toward slightly higher interest rates, both in India and globally. Further, India is heading towards state and general elections. So, you cannot rely on broad market rallies for returns. You have to be absolutely sure about the business fundamentals and the valuations of the stocks you invest in.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Our approach is to go by the merits of each company, rather than rely on broad themes or macro-economic trends. We currently have a mix of high conviction stock portfolio and some amount of cash which will be deployed when attractive opportunities emerge.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“The shift in market share from public sector banks to private sector banks is benefiting some of our holdings. The shift in advertising from traditional to the online medium is benefiting our digital investments—Alphabet (Google) and Facebook.”

Profile
In an environment where various sectors are witnessing disruption, Ajay Garg insists that companies willing to change and evolve through better ground research and product differentiation will emerge stronger. He places strong emphasis on future leaders and says there are several promising companies in every sector. 

Specifically, companies catering to the domestic market—that has huge growth potential due to discretionary spending—will benefit significantly, insists Garg. He also focuses on corporate governance practices, avoids leveraged plays, and prefers companies that are cash surplus and not in the habit of diluting share capital for expanding business. 

Pointing to the skew in stock market indices, Garg also stresses on diversification and takes a differentiated position vis-a-vis the index. He finds the financials segment crowded and has chosen not to align with the index.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“We see improvement in the economy and better earnings visibility. However, just 7-8 stocks have contributed almost 100% of the returns while the remaining stocks have seen meaningful corrections. Poor quality stocks are having a hard time justifying their valuations.”


b) Navigating current environment
“We will continue investing in quality companies catering mainly to the domestic space since the growth potential in India itself is quite big, especially because of the implementation of a mega reform like the GST tax.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Research-based firms with a technological edge over peers and a strong brand that gives them pricing power are a promising theme in our fast-changing world that is led by disruption. These basic characteristics, combined with scale, vision and management bandwidth will enable such companies to continue to have an edge over competition in the next 3-5 years.”

Profile
Mrinal Singh’s value investing tilt has often been at odds with the market in the past few years, yet he has remained steadfast in his approach. Even as prices and investor sentiments have changed rapidly, Singh has prioritised valuation, and has been tightfisted. 

He is optimistic about earnings growth and has chosen to stay invested for longer periods to allow his investments to unlock value. As investor sentiments have veered from one segment of the market to another, he has deftly re-aligned the portfolio to capture the emerging value. Singh has maintained a strict focus on bottom-up stock selection, while taking higher deviations relative to the index.

25,2018-09-11,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Auto stocks were trading mixed in afternoon trade on Tuesday.

The BSE Auto index was trading 0.19 per cent up at 24,319 around 01:05 pm. 

Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) (up 1.96 per cent), Cummins India (up 1.67 per cent), MRF (up 0.56 per cent) and Tata Motors (up 0.34 per cent) were the top gainers in the auto index.

Ashok Leyland (up 0.27 per cent), Bharat Forge (up 0.24 per cent), Apollo Tyres (up 0.19 per cent) and Balkrishna Industries (up 0.09 per cent) were also in the green. 

However, Hero MotoCorp (down 1.80 per cent), TVS Motor Company (down 0.76 per cent), Bosch (down 0.46 per cent), Motherson Sumi Systems (down 0.34 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 0.25 per cent), Eicher Motors (down 0.11 per cent), Exide Industries (down 0.06 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki India (down 0.04 per cent) were in the red around that time. 

Benchmark BSE Sensex was 49 points down at 37,874, while the NSE Nifty50 index was down 16 points at 11,422. 

In the Sensex kitty of stocks, 14 stocks were advancing and 17 were declining.

SBI, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank were among the top gainers in the Sensex index. 

ITC, PowerGrid and Bharti Airtel were among the top losers in the Sensex pack of stocks."
26,2018-09-12,Eicher,"The selloff in the domestic equity market has dragged the benchmark Nifty over 3 per cent down in September so far. The index slipped to 11,287 on September 11 from 11,680 on August 31.

In the process, more than 20 stocks in the Nifty50 index have slipped below their 200- day moving average (DMA). The list included Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Eicher Motors, Grasim, Hero MotoCorp, Hindalco Industries, HPCL, IOC, Maruti Suzuki, Power Grid, Tata Steel and Vedanta. 

On the Nifty500, as many as 344 stocks or as much as 69 per cent of the index pack, now trade below their 200-DMAs, reflecting intense selling pressure across sectors. 

Other stocks trading below this crucial support line include ACC, Aditya Birla Capital, Aegis Logistics, Ashoka Buildcon, Avanti Feeds, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bajaj Electricals, Birla Corporation, Emami, Engineers India, Finolex Cables, Godrej Properties, Indiabulls Housing Finance and MMTC, among others. 

Moving averages normally help market participants analyse an emerging trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance points.

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major DMAs or daily moving averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is said to be in a continuing uptrend. 

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections make stocks test their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause a stock not only to test the 200 DMA but also slip below it.







“Without doubt stocks quoting below their 200-day moving averages are sentimentally weak, suggesting that they are in a long-term downtrend. However, as the bull market remains intact at this point, if any scrip from the largecap space or midcap space with promising fundamentals is trading below its 200-day moving average, it can be considered as an investment opportunity,” said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

“We advise traders to read 200 DMA only as one a tool to gauge long-term trends, but not as a trading tool, unless a particular scrip has a history of testing its 200- day moving average and bouncing back. Often, we find scrips or indices yo-yoing around these averages which don’t help take a near-term trading call,” Mohammad said.

NSE’s Nifty index traded almost flat at 11,300 in morning deals on Wednesday. 

In the recent corrective move that the market has seen after marking a high at 11,760, there were many stocks ruling at or below their 200-DMAs. These stocks present an attractive opportunity for value purchase. While doing so, investors need to exercise some discretion, said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“Not all such stocks that rule below 200-DMA may offer value buying opportunity. While attempting to make a value purchase, one will need to remain highly sector specific and pick stocks only from those sectors which are showing an improvement on the relative momentum front,” Vaishnav said."

28,2018-09-15,Eicher,"Independent market analyst Kunal Bothra is guarded in his response as he stops short of calling the latest market rally a strong uptrend. It all depends on how the market behaves next week, he told ETNow.


Edited excerpts:


What is it that you have made of the rebound that the market staged on Wednesday and Friday? Do you see the momentum continuing or do you think this was a dead cat bounce on an oversold market?

Yes, I believe it is a dual nature kind of a rebound on the indices. On the one hand, a lot of midcap stocks have recovered quite well, the Nifty managed to come back from its extremely oversold territories breaking out of that 11,500 mark. 

But when you look at it from the other spectrum, there were large cap stocks such as Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance, ITC and Bank Nifty which sort of underperformed the Nifty relatively. There have been a lot of missing parts in this phase of the market rally, which is why I believe that the journey now going forward -- at least for the very near term -- could be difficult to anticipate. Because a) you are heading to strong resistance points on the indices and b) you need a lot of support from the erstwhile stronger stocks and if that does not happen, then these rallies could be feeble in nature and you might see the index coming back into a downward spiral once again. 

So, it is going to be tricky first half next week whether the market reacts to the kind of events over the weekend and if it manages to break those resistances, only then you could establish a case that the index is coming back into its stronger uptrend.


Considering Friday itself that saw a massive jump on just about any and every sugar stock, would you say one has already missed the boat if you did not buy any sugar name on Friday? Or do you think this is just the beginning of it all, one of oversold stocks which is why the move is getting so exaggerated almost double digit across the board and one can still go out and buy these names?

Kunal Bothra: One can still go out and buy even though you have seen one day of strong price gains and it is very much possible that the stocks may remain more or less sideways. But then looking at the kind of conjunction in volume patterns in the last one and a half or two weeks, these stocks were trying to test their resistance levels and the volumes were just about increasing every time the stocks were trying to break those resistances. On Friday, we saw the breakout finally happen. 

So, it was more of a breakout which was getting anticipated and now when you look at it in terms of setup on the weekly charts, most of the sugar stocks have been showing some strong bullish RSI divergent setup on the weekly charts. I expect that this should not be a short term oriented move, this should be more of a weekly or a monthly positional move which one can spot and I would not be surprised if the stocks rise another 25-30 per cent in a short span of time as well.


What is the more near term outlook on both the index as well as banks because I guess they are very critical to the recovery of the market?

Kunal Bothra: So, on the index front, I believe that the recovery pattern is quite positive because when you scan through the weekly charts for the index and then on candle stick pattern, you see some good buying which is happening at every lows the indices hit on a weekly basis. So net-net, at the end of the week, there is a recovery pattern which is giving spurt on the index. That itself is a strong enough sign. 

But on the other hand, when I scan through the internals, I think it is just that Bank Nifty has not been able to find its exact mojo back when you are looking at the mix of private sector and the PSU banks as well. The Bank Nifty underperformance is the only nagging part for the index rally. 

If the Bank Nifty manages to make a comeback, then the index targets could be revised much higher than the previous lifetime highs or the recent highs which it made. But if the Bank Nifty continues to underperform, the pressure would be much larger on the rest of the other large cap stocks to try and give you that better alpha or better price performance. 


Any individual stocks that you think are worth a trade on Monday?

Kunal Bothra: One of the stocks which I am recommending is from the sugar pack. We discussed this stock extensively last week as well and that is a buy on Balrampur Chini. I would recommend a buy with a target of 100, stop loss to be kept at 83. And Eicher Motors, I think, the stock is on the verge of a breakout of a weekly resistance. So, that also remains a buy with targets of 30,500 and stop loss at 28,780."

33,2018-09-17,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: After logging gains in last two consecutive sessions, domestic equity indices took a pause, as it opened in the red on Monday amid mixed global cues.

Optimism around healthy macroeconomic numbers and government's measures to arrest the fall in the rupee and keep a check on current account deficit did not help lift the mood of the market.

Analysts have advised caution.

A HDFC Bank report said the government measures to support the rupee may not drive overseas inflows and are a negative from a longer-term perspective, as they would increase short-term debt.

In a separate report, global brokerage conglomerate Credit Suisse said Indian equities have run well ahead of fundamentals and investors should book profit given the stretched valuations. 

The week ahead is going to be a truncated one. Equity, commodity and forex markets will remain closed on Thursday on account of Muharram. Macroeconomic triggers, global cues and rupee movement will be the key factors, influencing market movement through the week. 

While the outlook for the broader market remains uncertain, analysts see stock-specific opportunities across sectors. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are top 10 stocks that are expected to log gains over the next three weeks. 


Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities


Biocon| Buy| Target price: Rs 725| Stop loss: Rs 620

The stock has been on an upmove in last few weeks, and had moved up as per the positive sequence of higher tops and bottoms. The short-term downward correction in the stock price seems to be over, as the stock price has reversed up from the short term lows since last session. A formation of bullish reversal candlestick pattern like a hammer of previous session is indicating a possibility of a more upside in the stock price. Weekly momentum oscillator 14-period RSI is also showing positive indication. One may look to buy Biocon at current market price to Rs 663.40 and add more on dips down to Rs 635 for the upside target of Rs 725 over next 2-3 weeks. 


Eicher Motors| Buy| Target price: Rs 31,700| Stop loss: Rs 27,950
This auto stock has been moving in a larger consolidation pattern. Chart patterns of last 5-7 weeks signalled the formation of ascending triangle type pattern. This triangle pattern is a bottom reversal pattern and the upside breakout point is at Rs 29,400 level.

Buying can be initiated at CMP (Rs 29,369), add more on dips down to Rs 28,500, hold for the upside target of Rs 31700 in the next 3-4 weeks.

Voltas| Buy| Target price: Rs 675| Stop loss: Rs 575
This stock has indicated a higher bottom formation pattern in the daily chart taking support at the 50DMA moving average which lies near 575 levels and has given a decent bounce back to indicate a breakout above the significant 200DMA moving averge to signify strength and potential to carry on the momentum still further upward.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Brigade Enterprises| Buy| Target price: Rs 223| Stop loss: Rs 193
After a prolonged correction, this counter appears to be on a sustainable pullback mode as it has been registering higher tops and higher bottom kind of structure on lower time frame charts. As it registered a Bullish Engulfing kind of pattern on daily charts one can safely presume that recent downswing from Rs 220 – 195 might have ended paving the way for extention of pull back rally.


Ambuja Cements| Buy| Target price: Rs 245| Stop loss: Rs 216
This counter appears to have formed a strong base around 218 levels from the cushion which it can register a decent appreciation. Hence, positional traders can buy into this counter now and on declines around the Rs 225 level for a target of Rs 245. Stop suggested for the trade is Rs 216.


Jayshree Tea & Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 107| Stop loss: Rs 92
Of late the tea counter has been buzzing across the board as swift upmove on higher volumes is being witnessed in recent past. As this counter appears to have started fresh leg of upswing after seeing a decent correction of its three-day swift upward move from the lows of Rs 81 – 108 in just three sessions it can be initially expected to head towards the Rs 108 level once again. 


Aditya Agarwala, Technical Analyst, YES Securities (India)

As the Nifty seems to be displaying signs of a near-term top established around 11,760, investors should refrain from adding any aggressive long positions and wait for the index to head lower in order to add quality stocks to their portfolios, according to technical analysts. Oil marketing companies seem to have completed their major corrective moves which commenced almost a year ago and could be considered for bottom fishing in the near term, they said.


Where are we: The Nifty closed at 11,515 on Friday with loss of 74 points on weekly basis and formed hammer candle pattern on weekly chart showing buying interest at the lower levels.


What is in store: Technically speaking, the index is trading in an upward channel pattern and we have witnessed strong correction from the upper band of the channel making a cautious view on the index for the short term but if Nifty manages to sustain above 11,600 then we may see some more buying interest and fresh levels in the near term. On the derivative front the highest open interest is in 11,800 CE and on the lower side 11,400 PE making a strong range of 11,400-11,800 for current series.


What could investors do: As the Nifty has immediate resistance near 11,600 one needs to wait for these levels to surpass for a better entry or any dip near the 11,400-11,300 zone would be good buying bet for a short- to mid-term time frame. Also we suggest keeping more of sector and stock-specific approach. The Nifty metal index has seen good buying interest during some of the past sessions and we have witnessed very good bullish reversal breakouts so one can look for stocks like Jindal Steel, Tata Steel, Vedanta etc. Some of the technical picks where investors can catch dips for 10-15 per cent return in the near term are Bajaj Auto, MOIL, Bharat Forge, Eicher Motor and Wockhardt.

36,2018-09-24,Eicher,"Rising competition, changing consumer preferences and technological advancements make it imperative for companies to invest in research and development (R&D). 

Such investments lead to cost efficiencies, business process optimisation and improved productivity. R&D assists in the development of new products and enables a company to survive in a competitive market. 

Firms with innovative and differentiated products with lower costs tend to attain market leadership and are in a position to create entry barriers in the industry. The resultant pricing power helps in improvement of fundamental attributes like revenues, profits, margins and return ratios. The benefits of R&D are generally visible in the long run and the same could prove a drag on the profits in the short run.

We studied data for the last five years for companies with rising R&D expenses and with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore and found that their stocks had delivered market beating returns. Some 22 companies whose R&D expenses as a percentage of their revenue more than doubled between 2013-14 and 2017-18 delivered 632% average point-to-point returns between 18 September 2013 and 18 September 2018. The BSE500 index delivered 112.8% during the same time period. So, these companies outperformed the index by 5.6-times.


Healthcare and auto top R&D spends
 
Some 491 companies spent Rs 32,300 crore on R&D in 2017-18.
We repeated the study for the past four years, starting from 2014-15. 17 companies whose R&D expenses as a percentage of their revenue more than doubled in the past four years have delivered an average point-to-point returns of 89.5% between 18 September 2014 and 18 September 2018. BSE500 index that delivered 46.2% during this period. Similar outperformance was also visible over the past three years.

The numbers clearly show that the benefits of R&D investments are visible over a longer time period. Not only do such investments improve a company’s competitive strength but they also augment shareholders’ wealth. Let us look at seven stocks out of 22 stocks from the five year study universe. These seven stocks have the highest upside potential over the next one year according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:


1. Granules IndiaThe company manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients, pharmaceutical formulation intermediates and drugs. It is also into contract research and manufacturing services. 


The company’s margin for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have been hurt in the first quarter of 2018-19 due to the increase in raw material costs. 


However, the management guidance aims at a healthy growth in 2018-19 due to the likelihood of a price hike, ramp up of new launches in the US, steps taken to resolve supply constraints and likely improved profits from joint ventures. The stock has corrected 17% in the past year and could rise by nearly 20% over the next one year.


2. Atul Auto
 Manufacturer of auto rickshaws, pick-up vans and passenger vehicles chassis, Atul Auto is present across 21 states. According to a report by Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates, improvement in rural demands, new licences, launch of alternative fuel three-wheelers across India by 2018-19, improving export volumes and expansion of dealers’ network are key triggers for the company’s growth. 


The stock price has corrected 25% over the past year and offers an upside potential of 30% over the next one year.


3. Aarti Industries
A speciality chemicals and pharma company, Aarti Industries manufactures dyes, pigments, pharmaceuticals, and agro and rubber chemicals. 


Ambit Capital is bullish on the stock as the recent weakness in the rupee and Chinese production disruptions are likely to benefit the company due to import substitution—a multi-billion dollar opportunity from 700 domestic and 300 export clients. 


The stock has delivered 50% returns in the last one year and could rise 15% over the next one year.


4. Eicher MotorsManufacturer of auto products, Eicher Motors owns the iconic Royal Enfield motorcycle business. Antique Stock Broking expects the company to be the new operating profit leader in the domestic two-wheeler industry by 2021-22. 


Royal Enfield will be the biggest beneficiary of the growing trend of leisure/pleasure driving. Eicher is better placed to withstand cost pressures related to BSVI-led tech changes. 


The stock has corrected nearly 12% in the past year and has an upside potential of over 10% for the next one year.


5. IFB IndustriesThe company manufacturers home appliances and fine-blanking components. The recent agreement with Ramsons to acquire its industrial laundry equipment business will benefit IFB. 


According to a report by Firstcall Research, rising disposable income, easy access to credit, increasing rural electrification and wide use of online sales will be significant growth drivers for the company and the industry. 


The stock delivered 52.8% returns in the past year and could rise by nearly 10% over the next year.


6. PI IndustriesAn agro chemicals company, PI Industries manufactures insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, specialty products, plant nutrients, plant protection and hybrid seeds. 


Chola Securities is positive on the long-term fundamentals of the company, given its link with global innovators, strong product pipeline, comfortable order book position and capacity addition in the custom synthesis manufacturing business. 


The stock delivered just 0.16% in the past year but has an upside potential of more than 16% over the next year.


7. SRFThe company is engaged in manufacturing chemicals and polymers, technical textiles and packaging films. Edelweiss Investment Research expects that the growth from dedicated plants and deferred orders in specialty chemicals business will drive growth in 2018-19. 


In addition, a delayed agri-chemicals recovery with capacity expansion in refrigerants is likely to improve growth in 2019-20. 


The stock has delivered 21.5% returns in the past year and could rise 10% over the next year.


Note: Current price as on 18 Sep 2018. Analysts recommendations and target price according to Bloomberg. Capital and recurring expenditures are included in R&D. All stock prices and index values in charts normalised to a base of 100.

43,2018-09-24,Eicher,"Equity market saw a disappointing start to the week on Monday, as the session saw a stable and modestly positive start to the trade, but it soon dipped into the red and extended its losses.

The Nifty opened mildly below the crucial 11,170 mark. With the Monday’s session high of 11,170.15, the Nifty has resisted precisely to this level.

For the immediate short term, the level of 11,170 has now become the all-important level for Nifty. To arrest any kind of further weakness, it would be of paramount for the Index to crawl up and move past this mark. Until this happens, we will continue to see Nifty trading with a bearish intent and oscillate in a wide range.

As we step into Tuesday’s session, we need to note that the Nifty has become nearly oversold while Nifty Bank trades very much oversold on the short-term charts. The market has ended a notch below 100-DMA mark of 11,028. However, this remains within its filter and we can still, though purely theoretically, expect some recovery and expect the level of 100-DMA being held as support.


ETMarkets.com
Given the nature of the weakness that we have been witnessing, if Nifty does not scale back to 11,170 and above, with each passing day, it is increasing its possibility of testing its 200-DMA.

As for Tuesday’s trade, we can expect some theoretical support at 10,940 and 10,910 zones. For any kind of upmove, 11,170 will continue to pose resistance.

The RSI on the daily chart is 31.6132 and it has marked its lowest value in last 14-days. It stays very near to being oversold. The daily MACD continues to stay bearish while trading below its signal line.

Overall, we are seeing good amount of corrective pressure being exerted on the market. Global macros such as higher crude, depreciating rupee, failure of trade talks between the US and China are certainly taking a toll on the sentiment.

Under such circumstances, we can expect the bearish sentiment to persist, but at the same time we can also expect key averages to come into play to lend support. We believe that some small downsides being discounted for, we can expect at technical pullback in the market.

We strongly reiterate avoiding any more exposure to the markets. While maintaining liquidity highly cautious view is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Some resilience can be expected from stocks of State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Ashok Leyland, Larsen & Toubro, MRF, NCC, Eicher Motors, HDFC, Hindalco, Bajaj Finance, IOC, IGL, Manappuram Finance, Equitas and Petronet LNG.

57,2018-09-27,Eicher,"Equity market on Thursday saw a weak session on the expiry day, as Nifty slipped a notch below its 100-DMA once again. The market opened modestly in the positive, but soon drifted into the negative territory.

For the entire session, the NSE index continued to remain in a falling trajectory in a sloping channel. Though bulk of the downsides continued to remain infused and caused by expiry, the Nifty ended the day losing 76.25 points or 0.69 per cent.

As we approach Friday’s trade and beyond, the 100-DMA continues to remain all important level that Nifty will have to defend on a closing basis.

Though, it has closed a notch below that, it remains within its filter. It would be of paramount importance for the index to crawl back above the 100-DMA. Failure to do so may invite more weakness.

Friday’s session is critically important as it would be clear if Nifty is still defending the 100-DMA by crawling back above it or if it continues getting weaker.

The levels of 11,038 and 11,070 will act as immediate resistance area for Nifty. Supports may come in at 11,910 and 11,860.

ETMarkets.com
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart stood at 34.3687 and it remained neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stayed bearish while trading below its signal line.

As mentioned earlier, for Friday’s trade and beyond, 100-DMA remain critical level to watch.

In all likelihood, there are probabilities that even if the market continues to see weakness, the immediate previous lows of 10,866 may not be breached and we may see some technical pullback.

The Bollinger bands on the daily charts are now over 71 per cent wider-than-normal and this may not allow any sharp sustainable move to happen on either side.

There are brighter chances that the market continues to remain in the current range.

We recommend staying away from creating any aggressive positions. While continuing to maintain liquidity, cautious view on the market is advised.

STOCKS TO WATCH: Some resilience may be seen in stocks like YES Bank, Idea, PNB, Rolta India, SREI Infrastructure, L&TFH, Tata Motors, Larsen & Toubro, NCC, Ashok Leyland, Tata Steel, Eicher Motors, and TV18 Broadcast.

58,2018-09-27,Eicher,"Hundreds of workers at motorbike companies including Yamaha Corp and Eicher Motors are on strike in Chennai, demanding better wages and a right to form unions to defend their interests.

 Employees said the companies had employed a large number of contract workers to get around rigid Indian labour laws that make it difficult to hire and fire full-time staff and have refused to bring them on company payrolls even after years of contract work. 

 The unrest is the latest to hit the state of Tamil Nadu, dubbed the Detroit of South Asia because big automakers such as BMW, Daimler, Hyundai, Ford, Nissan and Renault have factories in the state.

 ""Our main demands concern low wages, contract employees not being made permanent and workers being denied basic respect,"" said S Kannan, Kanchipuram district president at the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, one of the leaders involved in organising the strike at Yamaha.

 Kannan said that talks to resolve the strike had made no progress. 

 A spokesman at Yamaha, which sells in India as well as overseas, said that production is running below capacity. 

 Yamaha has a 4 percent share of India's two-wheeler market. It sold about 793,000 motorcycles in the past financial year and exported about 252,000.

 Wages are low in India, making it an attractive manufacturing and export hub for companies, but workers feeling the effects of rising inflation have been agitating in recent years for higher pay.

 ""The issue is not widespread. It is in pockets, but it is a cause of concern, especially since it is an industrial belt,"" said an executive at a global automaker.

 In May protests turned violent at metals conglomerate Vedanta's copper smelter about 400 miles from Chennai over alleged environmental violations that the company said underlined the risks global businesses face in India.

 The government has tried to overhaul labour laws, hoping to create millions of new jobs and boost economic growth by making it easier to hire and fire, but has faced resistance.

 Workers at Eicher Motors, which owns the Royal Enfield motorcycle company, are protesting one such scheme, the National Employability Enhancement Mission (NEEM), said R Sampath, vice-president of the Royal Enfield Employees Union.

 ""The scheme stops contract workers from becoming permanent employees, allows management to keep wages low and fire people with one-month's notice,"" said Sampath, adding that contract workers do not receive other employee benefits.

 Royal Enfield, which has about a 4 percent share of the two-wheeler market and sold more than 800,000 motorcycles in India over the past financial year, is ""hopeful of arriving at a mutually beneficial solution"", it said in a statement. 

 ""We have forums that address matters related to the wellbeing of workmen and are working to understand the issue that compelled a few workmen to refrain from reporting for work today,"" the company said.

 Eicher Motors competes with U.S. motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc in India."

61,2018-09-29,Eicher,"Eicher Motors' Royal Enfield plant in Chennai has informed employees in a notice on Friday that resumption of production at the factory with 6 lakh units a year capacity will be informed at a later date and that the company ""may need to start with partial opening of the plant and subsequently the entire plant."" 

Late evening on Thursday, Royal Enfield workers had decided to drop the strike call and resume production based on the advice of the state labour department. However, the factory had informed workers that resumption of production would be announced later based on ""readiness of the plant to commence operations"", and that the ""advice"" given by Joint Commissioner of Labour was given in good faith and without the ""participation and consent"" of the management.

 A copy of the notice is available with ET. Queries sent to Royal Enfield remain unanswered. 

The notice further said employees would be allowed back in plant to resume work upon commitments to ""consistently support plant operations."" As per law, the notice said, there would be salary cuts for those who participated in the strike. the management thanked at the same time those who helped the plant run operations ""in a restricted manner"" for the first two days of the strike beginning September 24.

According to the notice, Royal Enfield does not recognise the Royal Enfield Employees Union, which spearheaded the strike. 

The Royal Enfield plant, set up on an investment of Rs 900 crore, provides direct and indirect employment to over 10,000 people every month, said a petition filed by the company with the Madras High Court. It has a total of 4,000 workers. The petition, filed on Thursday seeking police protection, has said trouble had started when members of the Royal Enfield Employees Union had worn badges and assembled near the factory canteen in a display of non-cooperation during the visit of the plant's managing director. ""They thereafter raised a dispute seeking revision of wages. However, as the majority of the workmen were not part of the union, the petitioner [Royal Enfield] did not give much credence to the same."" 

The union had issued a strike notice on August 13. Calling the strike beginning September 24 as illegal, Royal Enfield had sought police protection. However, the union had agreed to an advisory letter from the state labour department and dropped the strike call on Thursday evening. 

The notice to employees, posted on Friday, has led to some concerns among employees in the factory, said people in the union. R Sampath, one of the leaders on the union which led the strike, told ET: ""We have given a letter enclosing this notice to the state labour department."""

""We have decided to resume our strike again from Monday because the plant did not allow phones to be taken inside the factory. This was not the case before we started the strike on September 24,"" he said. Queries sent to Royal Enfield and Yamaha about the ongoing strikes remain unanswered. 

An official with the state labour department in charge of conciliation proceedings in Kanchipuram district confirmed that Royal Enfield workers have resumed the strike. ""The Royal Enfield strike is expected to get over soon. We were told that the reason given for forbidding mobile phones was 'safety measure.' The Yamaha issue is still in discussions at the labour department office. We are expected to convene again on Wednesday."" 

External demonstrations at the Yamaha factory in Oragadam entered their eleventh consecutive day. Yamaha’s workers are protesting the termination of two workers whom the plant has claimed to exert disruptive influences on those working in the factory.

3,2018-10-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: A sharp bout of short covering in bank, financial, auto, IT, FMCG and metal stocks in the second half of the session helped domestic equity benchmarks end Monday’s session with decent gains.

The market logged gains after three consecutive sessions of losses amid reports that the government has decided to rescue the cash-strapped Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) by superseding the board of the company and changing the company management. 

The report infused positive sentiment in the equity market. 

Reports that Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would buy Rs 36,000 crore worth of government bonds under its open market operations (OMOs) this month - a move aimed at easing liquidity conditions in the market - also helped sentiment.

At the macro front, the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed that India’s manufacturing sector activity improved in September amid gains in new orders, output and employment. The print came in at 52.2 for September, up from 51.7 in August. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

Global cues also eased after the US and Canada agreed to move ahead with the revamped NAFTA. Optimism about a reconstituted free trade agreement among the US, Canada and Mexico and what it could mean for trade relations elsewhere helped world markets kick off the fourth quarter of the year on a positive note, Reuters reported.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices trailed Sensex on Monday, closing 0.53 per cent higher and 0.25 per cent down, respectively. 


Let’s take a look at what hogged limelight in Monday's session:

Buying in largecaps boosts SensexHDFC twins, TCS, Infosys, ICICI Bank, YES Bank, SBI and HUL contributed most to the rally in Sensex. In terms of percentage gains, YES Bank (9.68 per cent), TCS (3.26 per cent), HDFC (3.16 per cent), SBI (3.04 per cent) and ICICI Bank (3 per cent) led the Sensex gainers.


YES Bank snaps two-session losing streakShares of YES Bank clocked strong gains after it released its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 2018. The company registered 41 per cent year-on-year rise in deposits at Rs 2.23 lakh crore in Q2FY19, while the Casa ratio grew 28.20 per cent YoY. 


Bandhan Bank hit record lowShares of Bandhan Bank hit a lower circuit limit of 20 per cent at Rs 451.20 after RBI last week restricted the lender from opening branches freely and froze remuneration of founder managing director Chandra Shekhar Ghosh at the existing level. RBI punished the bank for failing to reduce promoters' stake to below 40 per cent and told the lender to take prior permission before branch expansion. In an attempt to assuage investors, the bank said it would explore inorganic route to pare promoter stake. 


IL&FS group stocks gainShares of IL&FS group of companies clocked robust gains. Shares of IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company (up 20 per cent), IL&FS Transportation Networks (up 19.51 per cent) and IL&FS Investment Managers (up 10 per cent) settled up to 20 per cent higher. Shares of the companies jumped on reports that the government decided to supersede the IL&FS board and change the company management. The government’s intervention came after IL&FS defaulted on repayments and has had its debt rating downgraded, which has, in turn, roiled the markets. The net-owned funds of the finance company have been wiped out. The IL&FS group has a total debt obligation of over Rs 90,000 crore, of which bank loans account for Rs 57,000 crore, mostly from state-run lenders. 


Airline stocks plungedAviation stocks TAAL Enterprises (down 4.99 per cent), Global Vectra Helicorp (4.93 per cent), Jet Airways (down 4.74 per cent), SpiceJet (down 3.96 per cent) and IndiGo (down 2.16 per cent) plunged up to 5 per cent hit by a hike in jet fuel prices. As per a report in TOI, oil companies increased jet fuel prices by 7.3 per cent on Monday. A kilo-litre (1,000 litres) of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) will cost Rs 74,567 and Rs 74,177 in Delhi and Mumbai this month respectively, up from Rs 69,461 and 69,161 in September. Firming global crude oil prices is the main reason behind the price hike in Jet fuel by oil companies.

18,2018-10-03,Eicher,"Market expert Ajay Bagga thinks that rupee's fall could have been calibrated a lot more. He told ETNow that a high current account deficit (CAD) virtually makes light of all the good efforts on the growth front. 


Edited excerpts:


We have a scenario where macros are not good, crude oil prices going higher and currency is depreciating. One would argue currency depreciation is good for exporters, but overall it is not good. And we have macro where a lot of fund managers, a lot of fundamental experts are bullish on the earnings visibility. Will micro change macro or you think macro would change micro?

Well, the connection between the two normally is the liquidity. So, you have good micros and after a long time, you are going to see that a couple of years of good earnings growth in the Indian market. Leave aside say telecom and public sector banks, that will remain under pressure. But otherwise, largely on a very broad brush scale, corporate earnings will grow starting with first quarter of this year, which we have seen has been pretty good. Having said that, unless you have a demand and there is adequate liquidity in the markets, this does not connect and there the macro comes in, the top down view comes in. 

Right now, what is spooking foreign investors is one of the emerging market issues -- be it Argentina, Turkey. We have seen India brush off even at the height of the Greece crisis. We were one of the markets to recover the fastest. We are a domestic market, a very domestic consumption oriented market. 

But with the Fed withdrawing about $20-25 billion a month in terms of its outstanding balance sheet, there is a lack of liquidity. There is an exit of investors back into developed markets, largely into the US. Some smart money is going into Japan as well. 

The third big issue has been in the Indian macros taking over. You have growth, but the dependence on imported oil and the current account deficit means that we are getting clubbed with the more fragile emerging market economies despite our growth and despite our track record of managing our foreign balances quite well and repaying every time on time and having such a huge forex reserve available. 

And the fourth big issue is that the RBI has allowed the rupee to depreciate fast and furious, I think that could have been calibrated a lot more and definitely, there should have been some twist in the tail. You know you cannot let speculators make hay at the expense of your currency in this way. 

Some amount of intervention and some amount of sentimental talk instead of just keeping this silence is required. 


Let us then look at what this weakness would mean in terms of appetite to buy more IT stocks, by the way it has done well over the last one month plus, would you extend that benefit to IT and pharma still?

Yes, definitely and those have held up value. IT is benefiting from the global macro recovery, especially in BFSI, oil and gas. In manufacturing globally, we have seen order books increasing. And we expect good results and then the rupee-dollar definitely helps the IT pack. Again I would say, stay away from the big leveraged pharma companies with big loans on their books. That is not the place, but there are enough companies which are very light on the loan side, I think those can be looked at. 

So IT and pharma are definitely big beneficiaries of this trend and not impacted by any RBI interest rate move or inflation spiral in the economy. Those are really protected against that. So yes, IT, pharma definitely can be looked at.


I am wondering what is causing this amount of pessimism around Eicher Motors and M&M. Yes, Eicher’s monthly sales grew a meagre 2 per cent on a year-on-year basis, but it is also a very large base that we are working on and also the stock has already corrected quite a fair bit from the top?

Overall, for Eicher, definitely it is a question of valuations, the kind of growth that Eicher had shown up till about a year back. It had seen a very huge valuation premium built into Eicher and probably that is what is causing this kind of a correction. 

On M&M, it is more that you got a pretty tepid tractors number, commentary not very good, of course, it came off a much higher base in tractor sales and the PVs have not been doing well. The market leader also was not doing well, Maruti had a very flattish September. 

But I think both are getting overdone now and what we are hearing is some amount of interest is definitely coming into both. Again, I cannot give a buy or sell but just looking at valuations and the growth story, I think if domestic consumption is holding up, then you could see October second half and then the rest of the year seeing some amount of pick-up. 

I think I would be more optimistic on that side. What is also being baked in by the market is that the financiers for autos might not have the ability to finance. I think that is another story that is getting overdone with the entire shadow banking debate, the NBFCs finding an asset liability mismatch or not having adequate funds to keep growing. That might be true for a few companies, but largely companies are well capitalised and second, there are banks sitting and are not lending on the corporate side."

The Nifty50 index failed to surpass the 11,000 mark and corrected sharply towards the 10,850 level on Wednesday. It traded in the deep oversold territory, but failed to surpass the resistance levels, causing selling pressure after the bounceback.

It is near its 50% retracement of the entire upswing from 9,952 to 11,760 levels. If Nifty does not respect the 10,850 level, then it may drift down towards the 61.80% retracement, which comes at 10,650. Now the index has to hold above 10,850 to witness a bounce towards 10,929 and 11,000 levels, while a failure move beyond the first hurdle and hold below 10,850 could open its downside towards 10,700 and 10,650 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 and 10,800 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,200 levels. Meaningful Put writing was seen at 10,700 and 10,500 levels while Call writing was seen at 11,000 to 11,300 levels.

The option band signified a shift in lower trading range with the immediate hurdle at 11,000.

India VIX moved up 7.60 per cent to 18.12. Volatility is not cooling down, which is not giving any relief and suggests a tight bear grip on the market.

Bank Nifty failed to surpass the 25,500 level and corrected towards 25,000. It has been consolidating between 24,700 and 25,500 levels for last six sessions. The index has to hold above 24,700 to attract support-based buying while 25,500 and 25,650 levels could continue to act as immediate hurdles.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,880 with a loss of 1.64 per cent. Longs were seen in Vedanta, Hindalco, DCB Bank and Indiabulls Housing Finance while shorts were seen in Bata India, Jubilant Foodworks, Eicher Motor, M&M and Reliance Capital.

“Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee, as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to brent crude movements and with current pace 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels,” said Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities.

As many as 36 stocks in Nifty ended in red with Mahindra & Mahindra falling 7.03 per cent, followed by Eicher Motors (down 6.79 per cent), Bharti Infratel (down 6.45 per cent), TCS (down 4.38 per cent) and Axis Bank (down 3.62 per cent). 

On the other hand, YES Bank, Hindalco, Indiabulls Housing Finance, HPCL and Vedanta gained between 3 per cent and 6 per cent. 

Subdued core sector data further affected market in Wednesday’s trade. A government data post Monday’s trading session showed that growth of eight infrastructure sectors slowed down to 4.2 per cent in August on account of decline in production of crude oil and fertiliser. The core sectors had expanded by 7.3 per cent in July 2018.

Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research said, “Volatility continues to expand as Nifty pares its previous gain to end at 10,858, its lowest level in recent fall from 11,750 levels. Continuous rise in the oil prices with brent hitting $85 mark rose some eyebrows and worries. Crude was above $75 mark and worries over CAD and its impact of widening. Rupee depreciated to multi-year lows as it hit above 73 marks was, on the other hand, fuelled the sentiment.”"
16,2018-10-03,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The domestic stock indices Sensex and Nifty plunged to their three-month low levels on Wednesday plagued by crashing rupee and surging crude oil prices. Investors were also cautious as the Reserve Bank of India’s MPC began its three-day policy meet today.

A falling rupee and surging crude fanned fears of increase in inflation.

BSE benchmark Sensex closed at 35,975.63, down 550.51 points, or 1.51 per cent. The NSE barometer Nifty ended 150.05 points, or 1.36 per cent lower at 10,858.25.

In the 30-share index only five stocks ended higher. Mahindra and Mahindra was the worst performer and shed 6.6 per cent to close at Rs 791.15 apiece. YES Bank was the best performer and gained 5.79 per cent.

For every four declines, five stocks advanced on BSE.

Midcap and smallcap stocks outperformed benchmark Sensex. BSE Midcap index shed 1.11 per cent while BSE Smallcap pack gained 0.20 per cent.

Besides metals most of the major indices were trading in the red. Auto index was the worst sectoral performer. Fall in Eicher Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra led the auto index lower.

Among other sectors that witnessed heavy selling pressure were -- banking, financials, FMCG and IT.


Here are the factors that caused the market fall:
1. Rupee rout
The domestic rupee nosedived to a fresh record low on Wednesday, breaching the 73-mark against the US dollar for the first time ever. The domestic unit hit an all-time low of 73.41 intraday, 50 paise down from Monday's closing level of 72.91. At the time of writing this report, the domestic currency was trading at 73.24 against the greenback.

Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities said, “Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by government for stability in rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to brent crude movements and with current pace 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.”


2. Oil on boilThe oil prices traded above the $85 per barrel fuelling risks of a further increase in India's import bill.

Oil traded near a four-year high, supported by expectations that US sanctions on Iran will tighten supply and strain the ability of Saudi Arabia and other producers to pump more. Crude exports from Iran, Opec's third-largest producer, are already falling as the US sanctions kicking in on November 4 deter buyers. The drop in exports is reducing the impact of an Opec production increase agreed in June, Reuters reported.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up 38 cents at $85.18 a barrel at 0833 GMT, it added.


3. Infra sector growth slows downGrowth of eight infrastructure sectors slowed down to 4.2 per cent in August on account of decline in production of crude oil and fertiliser. The core sectors had expanded by 7.3 per cent in July 2018, according to a PTI report.

The growth rate of eight infrastructure sectors of coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity was 4.4 per cent in August 2017.


4. Weakness in global marketsAsian markets ended mostly lower on Wednesday as investors fretted about Italy’s budgetary spending and a controversial clause in the new US-Mexico-Canada trilateral pact put the focus back on the Sino-US tariff dispute. The US-China trade dispute is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon as a provision in the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement gives the Trump administration an effective veto over any China trade deal by Canada or Mexico.

Japanese shares ended lower as the weak yen trend paused on concerns over Italian finances and automakers skidded after posting weak US sales data. Hang Seng, Jakarta Composite, KLSE Composite, Nikkei 225 and Taiwan Wighted index dipped 0.66 per cent, while Straits Times gained 0.76 per cent."
15,2018-10-03,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Losses in shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) (down 3.86 per cent), Infosys (down 2.04 per cent), HCL Technologies (down 1.25 per cent) and Wipro (down 0.74 per cent) dragged Nifty IT index down in Wednesday's session. 

The IT heavyweights fell even as rupee touched its record low against the US dollar today. 

The Indian rupee Wednesday crashed below the 73-mark against the dollar for the first time ever on strong demand for the American currency from importers amid rising global oil prices and unabated capital outflows.

The Nifty IT index was trading 1.55 per cent down at 15,962 around 01:35 pm. 

However, shares of Infibeam Avenues (up 15.25 per cent) jumped over 15 per cent.

In a voluntary clarification to the BSE on Friday, lnfibeam Avenues said that all the material information ""that have a bearing on the operation/ performance of the company which include all price sensitive information have always been disclosed within the stipulated time"". 

At the annual general meeting on Saturday, Managing Director Vishal Mehta said the management and the entire team are working very hard towards the company's growth, according to PTI. 

NIIT Technologies (up 5.24 per cent), Tata Elxsi (up 3.77 per cent), MindTree (up 1.24 per cent), Oracle Financial Services Software (up 0.84 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (up 0.09 per cent) too were in the positive zone at that time. 

Sustained capital outflow, surging crude oil prices and rupee's poor health weighed on market sentiment.

Moreover, investors remained on the sidelines even as the RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) meet began to decide on key rates. 

Benchmark BSE Sensex was 203 points down at 36,323, while the NSE Nifty50 index was down 55 points at 10,953. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 22 were trading in the green, while 28 were in the red. 

YES Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bajaj Finance, Vedanta and HPCL were among top Nifty gainers.

Bharti Infratel, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Tata Consultancy Services and Grasim Industries were among the top losers in the Nifty index."
14,2018-10-03,Eicher,"The domestic equity markets witnessed an impulsive correction in September. As a result, nearly 60 per cent of the Nifty50 stocks breach their respective support at the 200-day moving average (DMA). 

As of September 28, 2018, blue chips such as Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Coal India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, YES Bank, UPL, Tata Steel, Eicher Motors, Grasim Industries, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment and Kotak Mahindra Bank were trading below their 200-DMAs.



When a stock falls below its 200-DMA, it generally means it is trading below its last one-year’s average price. The 200-DMA is most commonly used indicator among traders and investors as it typically represents one working year. 

The average is perceived to be the dividing line between a stock that is technically healthy and one that is not. Furthermore, the percentage of stocks above their 200-day moving averages helps determine the overall health of the market.

However, when a stock dips below its 200-DMA, it in a way gets oversold and shows signs of recovery and a possible technical pullback. It also offers good entry points to investors from a medium-term perspective.

“What we saw in the market in September was a sharp revision to the mean. Mean revision is a powerful concept wherein we see a market return to its average,” says Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“This usually occurs when the market runs up much ahead of its curve. With regard to largecaps that are trading on, near or below their 200-DMAs, many -- but not all -- have shown signs of bottoming out. In this kind of a market, investors should remain with largecaps and use these levels to make bargain purchases,” he said.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said historical behaviour of a particular indicator or technical tool should be given due importance while making buy and sell decisions in technical analysis and the 200-DMA is not an exception to that rule.

“Technically, we can conclude that stocks that breached 200-day moving averages are in a longer-term downtrend, which may not be practically true because often we find stocks or indices breaching 200-day moving averages for a brief period and then resuming their uptrend,” he said.

For instance, Maruti Suzuki breached its 200-day moving average in May and stayed below it for a couple of days and then resumed its uptrend from the low of Rs 8,255 to move all the way to Rs 9,929. A similar thing happened with HDFC Bank in December 2016. 

“Just a breach of 200-DMA is not an indication to stay away from a scrip, especially if it is from the largecap segment. Along with this average, it is important to consider the larger trend and direction of the market. Unless the entire market itself is reversing, we should not avoid such largecaps. They should be considered an opportunity to create fresh longs by looking at various other technical parameters,” Mohammad said.

However, Ruchit Jain, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking, said largecaps that have breached their 200 DMAs in this correction are likely to continue the underperformance in the near term.

“Traders should avoid bottom fishing in such stocks. A prudent strategy for traders should be to avoid bottom fishing at current juncture. In such times, weekly charts should be given more weightage and only when a reversal pattern is formed on the higher time frame charts, should traders look at opportunities for stock picking,” Jain said. 

He said this market could correct further in the near term and hence, traders should wait on the sidelines and be vigilant on market moves.

Other analysts also said while over half of the largecaps are trading below their 200-DMAs, only a few of them look attractive.

Mohammad said one can look at the HDFC twins and Kotak Mahindra Bank at present, as they appear to have formed a short-term base after breaching their 200 DMAs. Asian Paints also looks good as it is taking support on its 200 DMA.

“As Maruti Suzuki is trading far below its 200-day moving average, traders or investors should avoid this for the time being till the price stabilises at a particular point,” he said.

Vaishnav said stocks from pharma, infrastructure, IT, metals and energy sectors qualify for bargain hunting at this moment. “The main reason for selecting these sectors and leaving the rest out is that they have clearly outperformed the broader market on a relative basis and are improving on their relative momentum when benchmarked against the broader market,” he said.

IT stocks Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies are now trading above their 200 DMAs. Reliance Industries (RIL) and ICICI Bank were also trading above their 200 DMAs as of September 28, 2018."

6,2018-10-03,Eicher,"Institutional investors could reduce their portfolio weights on two-wheelers stocks — Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, and Eicher Motor — because of the rising cost of ownership, which could trim projected volume growth over the next two years.

The cost of ownership takes into account the annual expenses a biker makes on a vehicle. The components include costs related to fuel, insurance, financing and maintenance.

The weight of auto stocks in the portfolios of FPIs and domestic mutual funds stood at 8.9 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, at end of June 2018, compared with the weight of 9.2 per cent in the BSE 200 index. Moderation in volume growth could mean lower earnings growth, with PE premiums to long-term averages likely shrinking over time.

Projected volume growth for domestic two-wheeler companies in the current and next fiscal years could be 3-5 per cent because of the rising cost of ownership. Before August 2018, the Street was pencilling in volume growth of 9-10 per cent for domestic two-wheelers, which may come down 5-6 per cent.

The Supreme Court has mandated purchasing five-year third-party insurance and personal accident insurance for bikes, and that is the immediate trigger for higher ownership costs.

This has increased the prices of entry level bikes by Rs 3,000-4,000 per vehicle and premium bikes in the range of Rs 5,000-6,500. The increase in third-party insurance has a substantial impact on the cost of entry-level bikes, considered the most price-sensitive segment.

The M1 or entry-level segment accounts for nearly a quarter of the total bikes sold in FY18. Furthermore, petrol prices have also risen nearly 10 per cent in the past two months. Additionally, the IL&FS fiasco may leave NBFCs with less funds to finance bike purchases, particularly at the bottom end of the spectrum. About 35-40 per cent of twowheelers are financed, with NBFCs dominating this credit flow.

The cost of ownership is expected to remain elevated due to upcoming safety regulations and new emission norms to be implemented by 2020. The government has mandated providing anti-lock braking system (ABS) and combined braking system (CBS) in two wheelers from April 2019, which could raise prices by Rs 500-2,500. Similarly, vehicles must be compliant with BS-VI standards from April 2020. This could translate into another increase of at least Rs 5,000 per vehicle.

Due to these factors, the cost of ownership of two-wheelers is expected to rise 10-21 per cent between August 2018 and April 2020, compared with 2-4 per cent annually in the past ten years. This will likely have a big impact on the replacement purchase as consumers defer upgrades."

Mood was decidedly cautious ahead of the RBI policy meeting decision tomorrow.


What dampened market sentiment? Here are five factors.


Rupee at record low: A falling rupee weighed heavy on investor sentiment. The local currency plunged to its fresh record low of 73.77 against the dollar early Thursday. The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever. The dollar index stood tall against other currencies, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.

“Dollar dominated the last 24 hours as the rupee collapsed to a fresh all-time low on spot. Policymakers tried everything, monetary intervention, and verbal steroids and even tried to circulate rumours about an ""oil window"". Nothing worked. The RBI added fuel to fire by denying any attempts to introduce special dollar window for the oil marketing companies. Oil was on the boil, local equity and bond markets were under the hammer. If that was not enough, rising Italian credit spreads whacked the euro, further pressuring the rupee,” Kotak Securities said in a report.


Boiling oil: Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel in morning deals while WTI crude was above $76 per barrel. Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities, said, “Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.”


Rising bond yields: Hardening bond yields are creating waves of panic in the domestic equity market. India’s 10-year bond yield was hovering above 8.18 per cent on Thursday against previous close of 8.11 per cent. Bond yields have spiked 84 basis points on a year-to-date basis.


Foreign capital outflows: Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far. They sold shares worth Rs 1,488.96 crore in September. However, their net investment stood at Rs 262.72 crore in August, as per data available with depository NSDL. 

According to the data released by the NSE, FIIs were net sellers of Rs 2,056.87 crore in index futures and options segments, according to Wednesday’s data. FIIs were net sellers of index futures to the tune of Rs 699.54 crore and net sellers of index options worth Rs 1357.33 crore.

US Treasury yields reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note's yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs after economic data on Wednesday bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December and beyond.


Weak Asian cues: Subdued Asian markets spoiled market sentiment too. Japan's Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Thursday morning as investors took profit from its recent rally to a 27-year high while automakers and technology heavyweights took limelight on news of technology tie-ups for self-driving cars. Nikkei225 was trading 0.46 per cent down at 23,999 while Hang Seng came down over 1.50 per cent at 26,628.64."

33,2018-10-04,Eicher,"Possibility of a technical pullback was thrown in a disarray by o vernight global macroeconomic factors. Spurt in US 10-year bond yield and Dollar Index testing four-year high, resulted in further slide in the rupee. While brent crude price testing $86 a barrel and resultant weak Asian markets, all of acted against Indian equities.

The market saw a gap-down opening, as it started below 200-DMA level and continued to remain weak throughout the session. The NSE benchmark Nifty ended 259 points or 2.39 per cen down.

As we approach Friday’s trade, it would again be meaningless to analyse the market in a mechanical manner. Rather we need to look at macroeconomic factors that are giving tough time to the technical setup, and causing delay to an imminent and overdue pullback.

With the gap that got created on Thursday, the zone of 10,778, which is the 200-DMA and 10,860, the 90-point zone has become the turbulence area for the market in the near term. Any pullback will be met with some struggle in that area.

Having said this, it is important to note that Nifty has lost nearly 400 points on a closing basis in just two sessions. In the process, it has added over 25 lakh shares in open interest, which is a massive and significant figure. Just like on Wednesday, we also continue to see a bullish divergence on RSI, which now trades grossly oversold.

If we take a realistic view of the current structure of the market, there are a couple of factors that we need to consider. The oversold Nifty PCR -- oversold lead indicator with a bullish divergence -- massive addition of short positions and the index being deeply oversold on the short-term charts are few of the technical reasons that are highly favorable for a technical pullback.

Against this, the rising US bond yields, rising crude prices and strengthening dollar are the macroeconomic factors that are acting grossly against it.

Further, we are likely to see MPC raising domestic interest rates by 25 basis points. Certain quarters of the economy are also expecting a 50-bp rate hike.

Irrespective of this, it would be critically to see if the RBI flirts with the liquidity measures. So, discounting this event, if global macroeconomic factors cools down a bit, it is only a matter of time that the market will see an equally brutal short trap and a sharp technical pullback.

While maintaining a cautious outlook, fresh overexposure on either side should be avoided.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Stocks of Larsen and Toubro, NCC, Ashok Leyland, Tata Global, Eicher Motors, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Nalco, Maruti, Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, Axis Bank, and ITC may remain resilient in event of any weakness.

The Nifty50 index opened in the negative and drifted toward the 10,550 level in Thursday’s trade, as it broke its 50% retracement of 10,850 and 61.80% retracement of 10,650 of the entire upward swing from 9,952 to 11,760 levels.

The index also slipped below its rising trend line on the weekly scale by connecting the swing lows of 7,893, 9,952 and 10,850 levels. The index witnessed sustained selling pressure for the entire session and formed a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the daily scale.

It also breached its 200-day EMA. As long as it holds below 10,850, the index may continue its weakness towards 10,500 and then 10,350 levels, while on the upside, the immediate hurdle is seen at 10,750.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,700 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,200. There was significant Call writing at 11,000 followed by 10,900 while Put writing was seen at 10,500 and 10,600 levels. The option band signified a shift in the lower trading range with its immediate hurdle at 10,850.

India VIX moved up 4.39 per cent to 18.91. Volatility is not cooling down, which is not giving relief to the bulls and suggests a tighter bear grip in the market.

Bank Nifty opened in the negative, but managed to respect its intraday support at 24,500 and witnessed some recovery from the lower levels. The index formed a Hammer candle on the daily scale, but the major trend was negative on the weekly scale. It has been forming lower top and lower bottom from last five weeks and every bounce is being sold into.

Bank Nifty breached its crucial support trend line formed by connecting the swing lows of 21,386, 23,605 and 24,678 levels. It finally broke its consolidation range of past six trading sessions. As long as it remains below 25,250, overall weakness could drag Nifty towards 24,500 and then 24,250 levels, while a medium-term hurdle is seen in the 25,500-25,650 zone.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 2.70 per cent at 10,599. Longs were seen in ICICI Bank, L&T, Indigo and Bharti Infratel while shorts were seen in RIL, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp and TCS.

37,2018-10-07,Eicher,"Friday’s session was a terribly disappointing one for the market, as global macroeconomic factors forced a lower start to the day. In the end, the Nifty drifted even lower in view of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintaining a status quo on interest rates.

In a highly volatile trade, the NSE benchmark ended losing 282.80 points or 2.67 per cent.

The last two-three sessions have seen the market getting deeply oversold. As we approach the fresh week, we once again approach the market with extremely oversold technical indicators and with couple of factors remaining in favour of a pullback, which now is definitely delayed on many counts.
Despite this, this is still not the time when we can expect the market stabilising so easily.

We expect a shaky start to Monday’s trade, but with each further downside, it remains a fact that we are getting even more miserably oversold.


ETMarkets.com
If we take a broader view of the market, it certainly makes sense that there were more than one global macroeconomic factors that acted against us. The spike in US 10-year bond yield, crude oil prices rising past $86 level and strengthening of the US dollar, which resulted in unabated depreciation in the rupee; all of these acted against Indian equities.

As we approach Monday’s trade, the Friday’s low will be important to watch. We are approaching the session with massive number of shorts in the system.

There were over 42 lakh shares that Nifty added in open interest. The PCR has dropped in the deeply oversold territory. 

Brent crude has come off its highs and all possible indicators on the short-term charts are very deeply oversold. We are at the VIX levels that were seen only in early 2016.

Only thing that may cause some more delay in the pullback is the ongoing reaction to global macro developments and the US Yield not tapering off.

It will be technically impossible to determine the exact point at which the market will reverse. However, technical tools do show the extent of which the market is oversold, and it indicates that with each day of a delay in a technical pullback, we are facing the increased chances of a stronger pullback each day. 

We recommend staying away from creating fresh shorts and wait on the sidelines and make select purchases once the market show signs of pulling back. Very cautious approach to the trade is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH:We can expect resilience in event of a weak session from stocks of Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors, Tata Motors, Maruti, NCC, Larsen and Toubro, Tata Steel, Nalco, Bosch, Tata Elxsi, HCL Tech and Infosys.

40,2018-10-08,Eicher,"A market correction was only waiting for a trigger since the beginning of this financial year, and the IL&FS default just provided the spark.

After the sharp fall since August-end, the BSE Sensex is just 320 points away from giving up all the gains it had logged for this calendar. The 30-share index had advanced more than 7,500 points last year.

The Reserve Bank of India dampened market sentiment on October 5 after it refused to hike policy rate to help stem the slide in the rupee. The Sensex plunged 792 points on Friday after the money policy and settled the week with its biggest fall in two years.

So, has the bull tired out?

Centrum Wealth Research said in the worst case the current ‘aged bull’ won’t survive the current onslaught of macro meltdown, leading to the onset of a bear market.

But the good news, based on the experience of the previous cycles, is that any sluggish market triggered by a liquidity crisis won’t be a long-term phenomenon. Generally, such sluggishness wears off in 6-8 months. Bear markets are intense, disruptive, disorderly, erratic and unsettling, but generally are very shortlived in comparison to bull markets. Further, such bear markets provide the foundation for the next bull market.

Most of the stocks that witnessed a surge in market capitalisation last year have been struggling this calendar.

For instance, Bharti Airtel has lost Rs 93,000 crore from its market cap so far this year after adding Rs 89,561 crore last year. Maruti Suzuki, IndianOil, BPCL, Vedanta, Motherson Sumi, Eicher Motors, Punjab National Bank, Vodafone Idea and InterGlobe Aviation have also witnessed Rs 16,000 crore to Rs 85,000 crore erosion in market capitalisations.

As many as 1,805 companies on BSE witnessed a rise in market capitalisation last year. As many as 1,886 have seen m-cap erosion in 2018 till October 5.

However, two best performers of last year continue to reward investors this year also. HEG, which rallied 1,455 per cent in 2017, has risen another 38 per cent this year till date, whereas Indiabull Ventures has gained 65 per cent after surging nearly 1,200 per cent last year.

On the other hand, California Software, which jumped to Rs 92.30 in December 2017 from Rs 7.50 in December 2016, is now hovering at Rs 37.70. Vakrangee and PC Jewellers are down over 85 per cent each. Both of these stocks had rallied over 100 per cent last year.

A whirlpool of macro headwinds and company-specific issues have put pressurise on the domestic equity market. There is also a liquidity squeeze amid tightening by central banks globally, which has caused US bond yields to surpass the psychologically important 7-year high level of 3.2 per cent, while Indian bond yields have tightened to a four-year-high of 8.23 per cent. The rupee hit all-time low of 74 against the dollar on Friday. A relentless rise in crude oil prices and a drop in India’s forex reserve have only added to the worries.

“The macro set-up was precariously poised for a perfect storm. It just needed a trigger for the meltdown, and the IL&FS default provided that,” said Centrum Wealth.

Besides the macroeconomic headwinds, forthcoming state elections will keep the market volatile in the coming months. However, Centrum Wealth said irrespective of the poll outcome, there is a high probability that the long-term bullishness of the market would sustain through election season volatility.

“If you look at India’s valuation compared with the emerging markets basket, we are still trading at a fair bit of premium. These global headwinds also need to kind of ease a little bit -- global yields, oil prices. And now we have this gamut of whole domestic issues about fiscal deficit, lower GST collection and a question mark over the entire reform agenda turning towards populism. Given all those things, the outlook remains fairly hazy at least for the short term,” Inderjeet Singh Bhatia of Macquarie Capital told ET Now in an interaction on October 5.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees more pain ahead for the Indian market. Its year-end Sensex target of 32,000 implies another 7 per cent drop from Friday’s trade."
38,2018-10-08,Eicher,"The markets may not have much to cheer this Diwali. The rupee and stocks may fall further given that there’s no respite in sight from challenges confronting the markets, according to the majority of respondents in polls conducted by ET. The rupee could slide to 75 or further against the dollar by March and Indian bond yields look set to harden further as robust growth propels US interest rates to their highest in seven years and crude surges the most since 2014 ahead of Iran sanctions.

One poll of 22 market participants conducted after RBI unexpectedly kept rates unchanged showed that the rupee could fall by about 1.7 per cent from the Friday’s close of 73.77.

Some of the 22 respondents believe the rupee could slump to 77 and bond yields rise to even 8.5 per cent by FY19-end, due to global factors despite the economy being poised for 7 per cent-plus growth. The rupee closed at a record 73.77 to the dollar on Friday, having crossed a lifetime low of 74.22 during intraday trade. It’s depreciated more than 13 per cent this year.




State, Lok Sabha Elections Pose RisksA second ET poll of 27 money managers and heads of research showed that 55 per cent believe the stock market is likely to head south by another 5-6 per cent before Diwali in the first week of November. About 20 per cent believe the fall could be muted at 0-2 per cent. At the other end, 20 per cent believe the fall could be sharper at 8-10 per cent, effectively taking the market into bear territory. Stock recommendations amid this despondency include blue chips HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Infosys, while among midcaps, Avenue Supermart, Bata and Eicher Motors are favourites.

“With Iran sanctions supposedly beginning in November, the period in between will be crucial for the Indian financial markets,” said State Bank of India chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh. “The rupee’s value will be determined by the crude oil price movement and US treasury rates.”

Stock indices ended at a six-month low and the rupee at a record 73.77 to the dollar on Friday, having crossed 74 intraday. The Nifty ended 2.7 per cent lower at 10,316.45 points, wiping out all gains made this year, while the Sensex slumped 2.2 per cent to close at 34,376.99 points.

The tide isn’t likely to turn for stocks after Diwali either, with 35 per cent of those surveyed expecting the Nifty at 9,500-9,900 points by December 31, while 24 per cent see it at 10,000. However, some participants see the market recovering — 29 per cent see the Nifty at 11,000 by year-end. This effectively means record-setting sprees are unlikely to be back soon, especially given the sustained selling by overseas investors.

The market has plunged 12 per cent from its peak, triggered by the debt crisis at Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), oil prices and rupee.


RBI’S STATUS QUOCentral banks elsewhere have been seeking to lift rates to counteract increases by the US Federal Reserve to stem the investor exodus from emerging markets and shore up their currencies.

“When all the other emerging markets have been hiking rates to reduce the interest rate differential with the US economy, RBI chose to maintain status quo in policy repo rate as against the consensus expected hike of at least 25 bps (basis points),” said Ravi Muthukrishnan, head of institutional research at Elara Securities. “Besides crude prices and rupee depreciation, hike in interest rates… state elections in India pose downside risks to the market in the coming weeks and months.”

However, with RBI seeing the drop in the rupee as moderate compared with other emerging markets, equity markets will now focus on how much further the currency could drop.

New Delhi meets three-fourths of its oil needs through overseas shipments. With the rupee hitting record lows, there is an increasing likelihood that inflation will quicken. To be sure, if likely supply declines due to the curbs on Iran are offset by higher dispatches from other sources, crude oil prices may not climb significantly.

“If currency pressure is high now it is likely to get worse before it gets better. If nothing else, political uncertainty will inevitably rise as the general election (April or May) approaches,” said CLSA in a note.

Before that, state elections in five states will take centre-stage in the last two months of the year. The market also needs to closely track US economic data, said Manish Gunwani, CIO (equities) at Reliance Nippon AMC.

“Three big issues have affected Indian markets. Of this, worries around NBFCs (non-banking finance companies) seem manageable and will taper off soon (and) oil prices are close to peaking,” said Gunwani. “However, US economic data continues to be strong, which needs to be watched for the next two-three quarters.” That could increase the exit of overseas money."
39,2018-10-08,Eicher,"There may not be much reason for cheer this Diwali with stocks set to get hammered further as there’s no respite in sight from multiple challenges facing the market.

An ET poll of 27 money managers and heads of research showed that 55 per cent believe the market is likely to head south by another 5-6 per cent before Diwali in the first week of November. About 20 per cent believe the fall could be muted at 0-2 per cent. At the other extreme, another fifth of those surveyed believe the fall could be more precipitous at 8-10 per cent, which would effectively put the market in bear territory. Stock recommendations amid this despondency include blue chips HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Infosys, while among midcaps, Avenue Supermarts, Bata and Eicher Motors are favourites.

The market has plunged 12 per cent from its peak, triggered by the debt crisis at Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), surging oil prices and the rupee freefall. The currency’s travails intensified after the Reserve Bank of India on Friday chose to focus on inflation and keep monetary policy unchanged, instead of raising rates by 25 basis points — as had been widely expected — and provide support for the rupee, which has depreciated more than 13 per cent this year. Stock indices ended at a six-month low and the rupee at a record 73.77 to the dollar on Friday, having crossed 74 intraday. The Nifty ended 2.7 per cent lower at 10,316.45 points, wiping out all gains made this year, while the Sensex slumped 2.2 per cent to close at 34,376.99 points.

In contrast with the RBI, central banks elsewhere have been seeking to lift rates in step with the US Federal Reserve as they seek to stem investor flight and protect their currencies.

“When all the other emerging markets have been hiking rates to reduce the interest rate differential with the US economy, RBI chose to maintain status quo in policy repo rate as against the consensus expected hike of at least 25 bps (basis points),” said Ravi Muthukrishnan, head of institutional research at Elara Securities. “Besides crude prices and rupee depreciation, hike in interest rates… state elections in India pose downside risks to the market in the coming weeks and months.”

However, with RBI characterising the drop in the rupee as moderate compared with other emerging markets, equity markets will now focus on how much further the currency could plummet.

The central bank’s decision to hold back on rate hikes was seen as negative for the rupee by 95 per cent of those polled, while 75 per cent saw it as a negative for the equity markets as well.

“If currency pressure is high now it is likely to get worse before it gets better. If nothing else, political uncertainty will inevitably rise as the general election (April or May) approaches,” said CLSA in a note.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) stepped up the sale of Indian stocks, pulling out Rs 3,370 crore on Friday amid growing uncertainty about the rupee’s prospects.

They sold local stocks worth more than Rs 8,700 crore in October after dumping equities worth Rs 9,600 crore in September. FPIs have been net sellers in six out of the nine months this year. The persistent fall in the rupee has tarnished the shine for FPIs. Mutual fund flows slowed to a monthly average of Rs 6,500 crore between July and September from Rs 11,000 crore in the first six months of the year.

Some advise a wait-and-watch approach owing to the exchangerate uncertainty and other macro factors.

“In a market that is struggling for leadership, it is better to wait on the sidelines until strong price action in leading stocks returns,” said Vipin Khare, director of research, William O’Neil India. “While the next big trigger could come in the form of a solid earnings season, the ideal approach in the near term would be to wait and see which way the wind blows.”




SECTOR BETS
As the market heads into a prolonged period of uncertainty, the tide is clearly in favour of defensives. About 24 per cent see IT as a strong sector and 22 per cent said the same holds true for the pharmaceutical sector. Private banks and fast-moving consumer goods companies are also top favourites of money managers.

“Crude and currency are affecting sentiments. Markets are in fear psychosis and lot of overvaluation is behind us now, with good stocks at reasonable valuations. Retail banks, select NBFCs, IT and select pharma stocks are attractive now,” said Gautam Sinha Roy, senior fund manager at Motilal Oswal AMC.

Gunwani of Reliance Nippon AMC said: “Valuations are getting better and we like big corporate lending banks, pharma and asset manufacturing industries where price is close to book value.”"

43,2018-10-08,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The recent bloodbath in the domestic stocks has hurt small investors as hard as the country’s top billionaires.

The across-the-board selloff eroded market capitalisation of many bluechips, resulting in notional losses in the value of promoter stakes. 

Mukesh Ambani, who owns oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries, has $50.7 billion in wealth as of August 28, a day before the BSE Sensex hit an all-time high of 38,989.65 on August 29. He is now worth $39.5 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaire index shows.

The owner of the world’s largest oil refining hub at Jamnagar has lost all the gains he made so far this year on the surging shares of Reliance Industries, the second-most valued stock in India. RIL scrip has corrected 20 per cent (till Friday) from its all-time high of Rs 1,328.75 (hit on August 29). On Monday, RIL shares saw a 5 per cent rebound to trade at Rs 1,098 on BSE at 1300 hours.

Another group stock, Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, has lost 40 per cent of its market capitalisation (m-cap) so far this year. Year-to-date, Ambani's wealth has shrunken by $750-odd billions. 

Kumar Mangalam Birla, who owns the Aditya Birla group, saw eight group companies erode nearly Rs 60,000 crore in market value. Six of the eight listed stocks have declined up to 70 per cent this calendar, data available with Ace Equity suggests. Vodafone Idea (Rs 23,000 crore), Grasim Industries (Rs 16,000) and UltraTech Cement (Rs 14,000 crore) have been the biggest wealth destroyers. On Monday, Birla's wealth stood at $5.91 billion, against a high of $9.38 billion hit in January. Year-to-date, he has lost $3.16 billion. 

Gautam Adani, whose Adani Group has interests in ports, logistics, shipping and rail, coal mining and management and energy, with renewable and, thermal power generation and transmission and agro commodities, has taken a $3.8 billion hit year-to-date, data showed.

Adani was worth over $11 billion in earlier in January. On Monday, he was worth $6.57 billion.

Among five of the group’s listed stocks, four – namely Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Adani Power and Adani Transmission – have lost Rs 40,494 crore in combined market value this calendar.

47,2018-10-09,Eicher,"Siddhartha Lal is on a dream run in the two-wheeler business with Royal Enfield going from strength to strength and emerging as the strongest motorcycle brand in the premium category. But the one puzzle that remains to be solved in his automotive empire relates to the commercial vehicle operations.

While it has been a reasonably-respectable player in the light-and medium-duty segment, Lal has not been able to put up a good fight in the revenue-intensive heavy vehicles category against traditional heavyweights — Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. This is despite the fact that it has partnered Sweden’s Volvo group for a decade now. Lal, however, is unfazed, and rather sounds confident. The ‘older players’, he tells TOI, are “complacent” and are saddled with “poor service network” and aging products. 

Excerpts:


While motorcycles have been a strong pillar in your business, how are your commercial vehicles operations shaping up?

We have enjoyed a fantastic partnership with Volvo, and have been able to grow our market share in lightand medium-duty trucks from 23% to 32% over the past decade. In buses, we have grown from 6% to 17%. It’s only in heavy-duty trucks where we have managed to grow our share by only 2-3% and currently have 5%. But it has been a learning curve for us here, and we are now at the cusp of something big as BS6 comes in and vehicles get more sophisticated and technologydriven.


But Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are the leaders in heavy-vehicles category, with not much of a challenge because of their long-standing in the segment?

As we tackle this category, we are very much guided by the manner of our success in motorcycles. We have the right technology, competitive products, and we are in no rush. We also feel that due to duopoly in the heavy vehicles space, service levels are weak and there is huge complacency amongst the incumbents. Their customers are running after the dealers for service, and the customers feel trapped. Their customers want better options, and technologically-sophisticated products with far-more efficient services. There is surely space for innovations.


Do you think that while new players such as Volvo-Eicher and Daimler’s BharatBenz have been quick to modernise the heavy trucks space, the older players have been slow?

We have placed our bets in modernising the CV industry and are trying to move the market up in sophistication, technology and safety. But the incumbents are trying to keep the market down. For example, they want to continue the wooden cabins, which don’t meet crash norms. They are resisting efforts at rapid modernisation. They don’t want the market to move where we guys have an upper hand.


How do you see the Indian economy, and what are your views on the economic growth?

I am totally unfazed, and we feel that the Indian economy is only going to go up from here. There will surely be ups and downs, but in the long term, we are only going to see the Indian economy getting stronger."
46,2018-10-09,Eicher,"In uncertain times, it is a prudent move to invest in schemes that have weathered large number of market cycles. This is the best possible way to manage risk. Among the schemes that have been in existence for more than 10 years in the large cap category is Aditya Birla Frontline Equity.

Fund manager Mahesh Patil has been managing the scheme since the past 13 years. This long experience of managing the scheme has paid off. Patil has constructed a scheme which has stable and well-diversified companies. He stayed away from energy stocks which worked since oil marketing companies were hit by the government’s decision to cut excise duty on petrol.


In the past six months, the scheme has diversified its investments across financials, FMCG and IT sectors. This has capped the downside of the portfolio in falling markets. Given the macro challenges — both sectoral and economical — it is more relevant now to be invested with large, proven and established players.

Aditya Birla Frontline Equity is relatively safe bet given its performance and fund manager Mahesh Patil’s ability to identify stable stocks that boost returns of the portfolio.

In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 8.1% and 15.3 % returns while its benchmark index Nifty Total Return has given 9% and 13.1% returns in the same period respectively.

Rupesh Bhansali, head-mutual funds, GEPL Capital 
In falling markets, it makes sense to be with schemes whose portfolio is geared towards largecaps. Also, the size of a scheme is important in case an investor plans for redemption. In both cases, Aditya Birla Frontline Equity Fund fits well. To a large extent, it caps the downside. Investors can consider investing in this scheme with at least five years in mind to benefit completely from the stock selection of the scheme's fund manager."
44,2018-10-09,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV), an equal joint venture between Eicher Motors and the Volvo Group, will invest in a new plant in Bhopal at a time when European rivals Man Trucks and Scania have exited India’s competitive freight-carrier industry.

The company is building a new 40,000-unit truck capacity with an initial investment of Rs 400 crore. The plant is aimed at enhancing VECV’s market share in the heavy-duty truck segment. Speaking to ET after the board meeting held to commemorate 10 years of the joint venture, Martin Lundstedt, the global CEO of the Volvo Group said: “We have built a strong foundation in India and we want do things consistently instead of looking at quick fixes or running behind volumes.

India is among five major home markets for Volvo, which not only serves as a key market but a base for development and export of vehicles.” All its businesses in India are making money, the Volvo CEO said. Over the last 10 years, VECV has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 18% and the company has consistently remained profitable. VECV has so far invested about Rs 3,500 crore in the operations and at the end of the last financial year, it had generated a turnover of Rs 10,200 crore.

At 70,000 units per year, the Indian manufacturing base accounts for almost one-third of total global volumes of the Volvo Group that sold more than 2 lakh units in 2017. Siddhartha Lal, MD of Eicher Motors, said the company’s aim is to grow faster than the market and drive the country toward modern “value trucks” against the legacy trucks. “We are patient, we know our time will come. We are a company that likes to keep chipping away. Consistency is what we believe in,” said Lal.

VECV grew by 13% in FY18, with sales of 55,872 units and a market share of 6.52%. Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland account for more than 60% of the market. Its market share, however, is very small in the heavy commercial vehicle segment, which will be the thrust area for the future. India is among the top manufacturing bases for the Volvo Group globally, and a key export hub for medium-duty engines and light- and medium-duty trucks."

54,2018-10-09,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: A day after logging gains, the domestic equity market returned to the negative territory on Tuesday on losses in select auto, FMCG, bank and energy heavyweights amid a record-setting fall in the rupee and uninspiring global cues.

Cautious investors kept their bets restrained ahead of corporate earnings, while absence of any positive trigger kept sentiments subdued.

Analysts said the market may slide further due to concerns around rising crude oil prices after US sanctions on Iran comes into effect next month. 

Nomura (India) said a further 5-10 per cent downside in the Indian stock indices in the near term cannot be ruled out. 

International ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said the cut in excise duty on petroleum products will inflate fiscal deficit and reduce combined Ebitda margins of IOC, HPCL and BPCL by Rs 6,500 crore this financial year.

  stocks, Ajay Srivastava, MD, Dimensions Consulting, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


What are smart people in Gurgaon doing, are they buying or are they booking profits?
It is not about profit booking any more. By and large, profits are wiped out. It is all about managing your portfolio at this point of time and not panicking out of stocks that you really do not want to panic out. The mood is sombre and it is not because of oil prices. A lot of things which should not have been said is being said. I like what the SBI chairman said yesterday that it is a market opportunity. We like to go and shop Rs 45,000 crore that’s what we like to hear in a free enterprise, leading to market collapse. We do not need that. We are a large economy. The doomsday scenario should be kept away in communication. Most of the supportive mechanism will fall in place and we will do alright.


Emerging markets have corrected and the US markets have not corrected. What happens if the US markets start correcting?
Even if the US market corrects, they have a policy framework to support the economy and the market. The construct is very positive there. The mindset from the top leadership is to ensure that the capital market remains where it is and obviously they are winning the war against China on the trade side. They are doing a lot of correct things. They are bringing the jobs back to America. They are opening factories in America and these have happened in the last 12 months. 

Making a case of a large-scale fall in American markets looks difficult. Having said that, the question is will the growth in America percolate down to rest of the world? A lot of the growth actually is now moving away. China is a very clear example. Growth has moved out of China back into America. The question to ask is what are we doing? Two, each country has to account for the way they run their businesses and the way the stock market is respected. 

By and large, emerging markets including India treat stock markets like a mini casino. We do not understand stock prices. I saw a chairman of a large company saying very proudly that he does not look at his stock price. But, he should look at it. We put money in it, so you should look at it.

The mindset in the US is so different than what we see in emerging markets. Emerging markets are the socialist economies of the world, masquerading as capitalist economies. They all treat stock markets with disdain and that is very evident even in India at this point of time. 

Therefore, while US may go down, but they will come back and revive it. They respect the market. They respect the economy and they are doing the right things to get the economy going. We need to get out of our socialist mindset of loan waivers and MSPs and all the other stuff which goes around and does not give productive investment to the economy.

Look at what has happened to our capital growth formation, look what has happened in America. A large economy is growing faster on capital goods than we are growing! One has to see which of the emerging economies will put its house in order and benefit from the US-China trade war.


People are betting that with the sudden fall in currency, exports will revive. Do you agree?
It is not a misplaced idea but the amount of damage that has happened to the MSMEs in the last 24 months limits what we can exploit in the short term. We can take a lot more steps and take charge of the situation, but in the short term, can we become a major exporting economy? No, we cannot. Our GST mechanism has a crippling effect on working capital. We need to legislate out some of the stuff very quickly if we have to capitalise on it. 

Look at what has happened to leather industry by and large. Whether it is cotton textile, handloom, handicraft, garments or leather, all are struggling today, Can they benefit from a weak rupee? No and the reason I say so is, already a lot of US customers are saying you got a big bonanza on exchange rate, how about passing some back to us? So we have depreciated, other emerging economies have depreciated and the exchange difference benefit is not very significant.

Our infrastructure does not allow us to do significantly increase exports in basic industries.


Is the lifeline extended by SBI, RBI to resolve the liquidity crunch in NBFC industry enough?
It is a great reassuring step by SBI. I like what the SBI chairman said that there are good assets available at a good price in a fire sale and one should go grab it. SBI for the first time in years has come out with something which is so business like and correct for the economy. Having said that, it is not about liquidity. The policy stance was that too much of short term money was being deployed by NBFCs. That is not so true. 

I saw the disclosure of Edelweiss Capital. 40% in medium term, 40% in long term is not true. Some of the myths are hitting the market. The word is out that too much of short-term money is deployed. Yes some money is deployed which is always part of the treasury but not everything was short term.

The way we have priced our NBFCs, the only reason why we will not buy them today despite being available at only about 2 times book value, is the fear of regulatory action. I do not know if the action would be ad hoc and hurt the industry very badly, We carry a baggage. About 10 to 15 years back, NBFCs were a vibrant business. The regulatory scenario changed dramatically and NBFCs died completely. For the next 10 years, we never heard of NBFCs. 

In the last five-seven years, we again saw revival of NBFCs. Arbitrary regulatory action may put them in a slumber mode for some time to come. So, I would say valuation-wise, or business model wise, there is no problem with NBFCs. But the regulatory scenario puts up a question mark. So wait a while but you can start nibbling at NBFCs. I still believe that there is a need to have NBFCs in the country. We need to support it. 

If you look at the last 12 months, it is consumer credit that is keeping the economy going. It is the credit card, auto loan, personal loans that are keeping this economy ticking and not industrial growth or industrial expenditure. Let us not kill the golden goose that has delivered beautiful growth to this country. I am expecting a much more supportive framework of regulation and not some knee-jerk reaction to an IL&FS crisis. 

Let us not equate IL&FS with rest of NBFCs. It is so different and I would tend to believe that putting IL&FS in NBFC dialogue is going to get the truth. The truth is that there are very good quality NBFCs. They maybe overvalued but they are good. And then you have IL&FS. Both are not riding in the same boat.


Would you extend this argument to HFCs as well?
Even housing finance companies are consumer oriented. If you look at the portfolio books, almost 80-85% is consumer housing loans. With 15% to 20%, HDFC has the biggest share; 20-25% goes to the builders and companies. I would term them consumer loans. What is happening to the loan portfolios of HFCs of projects which are in the limbo? I would approach it with a little bit of caution for the next quarter or so because you might see lot of the NPAs of retail coming into the picture from unfinished projects. 

Barring that, they are good. They are governed by NHB, which has no issues with the portfolio. NHB is, in fact, sitting with surplus liquidity and no HFC is borrowing from it. Today, they have got Rs 30,000 crore. They said only Rs 8,000 crore have been borrowed. There is enough liquidity for HFCs. It is safe and sound, there is no liquidity issues, no portfolio issues with the housing finance companies.


Is there going to be a consumption led slowdown with people buying fewer cars and consumer goods? Would you buy any of the autos or consumer goods companies in this decline?
I do not think the fears are overdrawn. There is a serious problem in the market and the real growth rate is not going to be over 6%. If oil is going to take so much money out of your pocket, your income is not going to grow dramatically.You are not going to spend discretionary money when 30% of your budget has gone towards paying extra for the school bus for your child and for your own vehicle. Quite logically, the consumption will be squeezed at the end of the day.

With the NBFC squeeze, money available off the shelf might also be an issue at this point of time. So you must plan your portfolios based upon the fact that consumer buying is slowing down. The stock prices have corrected substantially. Look at Eicher, Maruti. I am not sure if the market is already factoring in slowing growth. 

My guess is that bottom will be reached only after we see the September results. I would say wait a while, it looks tempting, Maruti at Rs 6,700 and Eicher at 29,000-28,000 look very tempting, but wait a while. Consumer squeeze is happening right now. You need to exercise caution because problem is going to be in the system for a couple of more months as our growth is slowing and slowing fast.


I will throw some largecap names which have fallen 30-40% and which is the blue chip stock you would like to buy -- Tata Motors, HPCL or Maruti?
I would tend to buy Maruti for the simple reason that sooner or later it will turn around and it will give me some value for it. That is the only reason I would buy it. But having said that, if you look at some of the very cheap stocks, look at commodity stocks. Some of them are PSUs and they are priced at one time book value with zero debt. Now that is an incredible buy. You may not get a return next morning or in five days, but you will get a phenomenal return on a three-year basis. 

You will not get natural resource companies at one time book value with zero debt. They do not exist. Whichever government comes in, divestment will be part of the agenda for raising money. These companies will be the first to be bought by global majors, and companies like Vedanta. You would find that instead of buying the regular names, try to go for longer portfolio stocks, book values and then start to buy the stocks because earnings may not be very attractive for some time to come.

You need to buy fundamentally strong balance sheets at this point of time with natural advantage and wait with those portfolios. These will be less volatile given the fact that they are already one time book value with zero debt. You cannot go much worse than that. So base a good constructive portfolio, on book value rather than earning potential. 

So, Maruti would not qualify under this bracket. It is an expensive stock. But if I have to buy a Maruti, the second order would be obviously HPCL because that falls into this category of close to book value. But HPCL has gone under ONGC and so I do not know what is going to happen there. The problem of Tata Motors is so large that as an Indian investor, I am really buying JLR stock and I do not know enough about JLR to know that when it will turn around. So that is perhaps the rationale."

56,2018-10-10,Eicher,"Siddhartha Lal, managing director of Eicher Motors, says there are “small (dark) clouds” above the company’s 
  
  
  Royal Enfield motorcycles, but the challenges are not “insurmountable”. “We’re super strong,” Lal tells Ketan Thakkar and Satish John in an interview, where he takes questions on US President Donald Trump’s advocacy on lowering import tariffs on Harley-Davidson bikes, and emerging competition from heritage brands such as Ideal Jawa and Triumph. Edited excerpts:


Is the segment where Royal Enfield had a field run for a decade slowing down?
Yes. There is a lot on the plate. We saw a nearly flawless run for eight years and there’s bound to be some things that catch up. Some way I look at it is that we have some slight short-term clouds but really, absolutely nothing that fazes me in the medium and long term. We saw demand for certain products. In Kerala, where we enjoy a 33% market share, in the last few months, (Royal Enfield) has performed way below its potential. Whenever we had a problem in the past, other markets used to make up for it. It always evens itself out. We have faced these issues during the last eight years — when one market is down, then another market will perform. It would never show up in the monthly numbers because we always had more demand. Now it starts showing up a little bit because of certain issues or mismatches. It’s normal for a business to have some ups and downs. We always look at it from a long-term perspective. We keep making improvements. Of course, there are some, let’s say small clouds, which we are tackling. But, nothing that is insurmountable.US President Donald Trump has been championing the cause of Harley-Davidson and putting pressure on the Indian government to lower import tariffs. 

Harley is also planning to make smaller bikes, which will compete with Royal Enfield… Those are complex scenarios which are trade situations. I can’t even get to the head or tail of it. It’s never one product for the other product, it’s typically the whole WTO system, depending on the home markets and depending on other markets. It is difficult to comment but at Royal Enfield, we are extremely well prepared for any competition and for any eventuality from a tariff perspective. It doesn’t faze us at all.


Any regrets that you have not gone for brands such as the Yezdi, Jawa and Triumph which were up for grabs and now have new owners?
Absolutely not, because I think it’s a testament to how well we’re doing that people are now suddenly sort of trying to revive old heritage brands. All the best for whoever is doing all that. But for us, it’s not a lost opportunity. Because we are a focused company… Our ambition is not to make five brands to cover our flanks. Our plan is to make this one brand as a global brand and it’s not easy. This is the plan for the next decade to make a global brand. There is no global consumer brand out of India that I know of and this is the one that can be it.


How do you ensure that the domestic momentum continues even as you look at overseas markets?
We are very quick to react to the market. The India opportunity is still huge. The premium segment has been growing faster than the basic segment and it will grow faster. It will grow for a long time to come. You’ve seen that in the car segment, we’ve seen that in pretty much all consumer segments. So, we’re on top of that premiumisation trend. There are markets where we have a 33% market share, like Kerala, and there are markets where we have a 3-4% market share. In UP, you can see in bigger cities we have a 6-8% market share and that premiumisation does happen everywhere. I don’t know why everybody gets fazed about two months or three months here or there. So, our ambition is always to continue as we’ve done for the last eight years plus to continue to grow well ahead of the market. We are still around 6% of the motorcycle market. We’ve grown in the last eight years, we will continue to grow for at least another decade.


Will the workers’ strike at Royal Enfield plant in Tamil Nadu impact financials?
It has certainly impacted production. The strike is not fully sorted out, but the good news is that production has begun but it’s not at full tilt."

71,2018-10-13,Eicher,"Life has become a little easier for Mohammad Sawan. Nowadays, the Bangladeshi truck driver has to wait only for a few hours to get the documents processed at the Petrapole border check post. Earlier, he would have to wait for a couple of days before he can hand over the goods to an Indian agent for its onward journey to Kolkata, 80 km away.

The bottlenecks at the border check post were eased in 2016 when Petrapole was upgraded to an integrated check post (ICP), from a land customs station (LCS), as part of the government’s plan to improve trade with neighbours. Chances are that the Marks & Spencer shirt you recently purchased from an authorised store in eastern India was stitched by a Bangladeshi tailor and was transported by road, by drivers such as Sawan, into India through the Petrapole-Benapole (Bangladesh) border.

3.7%
Share of India’s export through land borders (India’s export in 2017-18 was $303 bn)

India’s trade through land borders was only $13 billion in 2017-18. Of this, exports constituted $11.3 billion, accounting for 3.7% of total exports in the period. To improve trade with neighbours, the government wants to develop the land-border infrastructure. This can also help land-locked countries such as Nepal and Bhutan get access to seaports. Giving such economic lifelines to these neighbours would also ensure that the relationships with them improve.




“Improving trade with neighbours is our top priority,” Minister of Commerce and Industry Suresh Prabhu tells ET Magazine. “The potential for India’s export to Saarc countries is $61 billion as against $14 billion now.” A healthy trade relationship with a neighbour often results in a healthier diplomatic tie, too, he adds.


 Seven of the 109 LCS have been upgraded as integrated check posts — where immigration and customs officials sit in adjacent buildings for faster clearance of goods and passengers. While LCS lack even basic facilities, ICPs like the one in Petrapole have parking bays, weighbridges, cargo terminals, warehouse facilities, public utility facilities, banks/ATMs, foreign exchange bureaus and cafeterias, among others. Now, the Cabinet Committee on Security is looking to approve a Rs 4,500-crore proposal to improve 13 more land borders, says Anil Bamba, chairman of the Land Ports Authority of India, which coordinates with state and central agencies over passage of passengers and cargo through land borders. The upgrade would cover the border posts in Jaigaon (India-Bhutan), Panitanki (India-Nepal) and Hili and Fulbari (India-Bangladesh).


 The decision to upgrade LCSs to ICPs is already bearing fruit. The Petrapole ICP, a crucial trade gateway on India’s 15,000 km land border, clocked a border trade of about Rs 19,000 crore in 2017-18, compared with about Rs 16,000 crore in 2015-16 (the Petrapole check post was upgraded to ICP in 2016).

The truck driver, Sawan, says, “I am carrying ready-made garments weighing 13 tonnes. All these packets are for big companies in India.” The Dhaka resident does not know what is in the packets but going by government data, it might well have been goods for MNCs in India.

Marks & Spencer and VIP Industries paid about Rs 11 crore each as import duty through this border ICP in 2017-18, according to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. The other major companies using Petrapole to import goods includes Reliance Retail, Raymond Apparel, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, and Puma Sports, says the data.

Among the exporters, Tata Motors topped the chart at Rs 1,456 crore last financial year. The other major exporters included Ahmedabad-headquartered textile manufacturer Arvind and the manufacturer of Volvo and Eicher trucks, VE Commercial Vehicles. Automobile companies such as Ashok Leyland, Hero Motorcorp and Mahindra and Mahindra also use this ICP to export goods.




Apart from Petrapole, ICPs are also operational in Attari (India-Pakistan border), Agartala (India-Bangladesh), Raxaul (India-Nepal) and Jogbani (India-Nepal). The Moreh ICP, bordering Myanmar, already has a new passenger terminal but the cargo terminal is being built. The seventh ICP, at Dwaki in Meghalaya bordering Bangladesh, is under construction. “About 95% of our border trade through land happens through these checkpoints. Once all the 20 ICPs (including the 13 proposed ones) are ready, trade bottlenecks would be eased a lot,” says Bamba, adding how the cabinet secretary-chaired National Committee on Trade Facilitation has been emphasising a lot on border trade.




New Delhi’s decision to fast-track trade facilitation infrastructure on its border has a dimension that goes beyond economics. China’s increasing presence in the neighbourhood, and cheaper imports from that country, is a cause of strategic concern for India. “Yes, it’s a reality that China is already present in some of our neighbouring countries. We will compete with China here, as we compete with it in Africa and elsewhere,” commerce minister Prabhu quips."
70,2018-10-13,Eicher,"In an interaction with ET NOW, Sanjiv Bhasin, IIFL, talks about the stocks and sectors that look poised to bounce back; offers his view on IT, pharma and FMCG and reveals where he is putting his money at going into 2019. Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Do you think that the worst of the fall is behind us or do you sense a further weakness dependent on how much the US equities fall?

Sanjiv Bhasin: The markets were underperforming of late more due to local issues like the IL&FS fiasco, oil rally and rupee weakness. The much needed Dow correction is now telling you that there is a lot of uncertainty and the oil bulls is where you are seeing a lot of weakness. For the Indian markets, it only means good news as the dollar is weakening. Now the emerging markets, particularly India, should see a lot of constructive buying and we are positive on this fall and have rather used this fall to buy. 

Another 500-600 points on the upside are definitely on the cards and if I can stick my neck out I would say Nifty could climb to even 10,800 to 11,000 by Diwali.


ET Now: Focussing on IT sector at large, how much of the optimism, do you think is already baked in into the prices? Should good number in earnings be used as opportunities to profit take?

Sanjiv Bhasin: Over the last two-three weeks we have been saying that use all rallies in IT to exit. TCS has come out with the excellent numbers but they also indicated that this weakness in rupee just aided margins of about 1% or so in this quarter where the rupee has fallen around 12 per cent. It tells us that it is a myth that weak rupee is going to give IT companies large income on the treasury side. 

I think most of the IT companies are well hedged and are fully priced. If we want to play the weak rupee, we would rather play it through pharma. But there are a plethora of stocks and sectors which are beaten down fairly. To name a few, we have are positive on - Maruti, Bajaj Finance, Eicher Motor, UltraTech - the real hardcore India where we think the pessimism was overdone. 

IT will rightly take a back seat, all rallies will be used to sell and if rupee strengthens more then the local cyclical should do relatively well for the remainder of this month and next.


ET Now: How are you reading into Hindustan Unilever’s performance and what indication does it give to you for FMCGs at large?

Sanjiv Bhasin: The numbers were highly impressive given they have been able to maintain margins at 21 per cent and overcome the double whammies of rising interest rates and oil. They have hedged themselves perfectly. These numbers tell you that the consumption part, particularly the one on personal care, is doing extremely strong. HUL has indicated strong numbers on the cream side and on the hair shampoo side and it will only start to get a bigger fillip given they have a better period coming ahead after the shraad. HUL’s numbers tell you that the correction in some of the FMCG stocks may have been overdone and this is a good time to buy some of these names. 


ET Now: What do you think should either be bought or avoided in near-term?

Sanjiv Bhasin: I would advise staying away from IT. You may see a decline in some IT stocks post the Q2 results as the best of IT has played out. Focus on sectors and stocks where pessimism has given an opportunity to buy and be with some of the bellwether stocks. Some of the names like I said earlier are - Reliance, UltraTech, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Maruti and Eicher. Some of these names are showing a lot of strength. They have been resilient in this fall but the other pedigree names on the consumption side are likely to bounce back very fast after this one-quarter hiatus. We are underweight on IT and overweight on pharma as a rupee proxy but cyclicals is where we are putting our money going into 2019."
69,2018-10-13,Eicher,"The domestic equity market had a roller-coaster ride during the week gone by, owing to both global as well as domestic worries. The equity indices finally managed to settle in the green, thanks to significant gains in the week’s final trading session on Friday. 

The rupee hit a fresh record low of 74.48 against the dollar during the week, but rebounded smartly to log biggest one-day gain in 29 months to rise 55 paise and close at 73.57 to the dollar.

Globally, stock markets witnessed severe selling pressure on the back of growth worries because of trade tensions and expectation of further liquidity tightness amid rate hike by global central banks. 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned last week that sustained trade tensions could slash Asia’s economic growth by up to 0.9 percentage point.

Amid these worries, Dalal Street scripted a smart bounce on Friday. The 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 356.59 points, or 1.04 per cent to 34,733 for the week, while the 50-share NSE Nifty gained 156 points, or 1.51 per cent to settle at 10,472.

Below are top sectors and stocks that hogged limelight through the week:


Nifty’s top gainers

With a rally of 32 per cent, oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) emerged as top gainer in the Nifty pack. It was followed by YES Bank (up 20 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 13 per cent), Indian Oil Corporation (up 13 per cent) and Bajaj Finance (up 12 per cent).


Nifty’s top losers
Tata Motors (down 15 per cent) stood as top loser of the week in the Nifty pack. The stock remained under pressure after Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) reported a 12.3 per cent drop in global sales at 57,114 units in September, hit by lower demand in China. The company’s China sales declined 46.2 per cent during September compared with that in the same month last year as ongoing market uncertainty over import levies and continued trade tensions held back consumer demand. JLR also announced a two-week shutdown of its West Midlands plant to cope with weakening global demand for its luxury vehicles. Among others, HCL Technologies dropped 9 per cent, Tata Consultancy Services 8.78 per cent, Vedanta 7.61 per cent and Infosys 5.93 per cent to emerge top index losers in last five sessions.


Q2 earnings: Nothing impressive
Zee Entertainment (ZEEL), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Hindustan Unilever and Karnataka Bank announced their financial results for the quarter ended September 2018. TCS reported a 22.6 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 7,901 crore, buoyed by strong demand for digital services. HUL and Karnataka Bank posted 19.51 per cent and 20 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit. ZEEL posted a 38.23 per cent drop in consolidated profit at Rs 386.10 crore.



New listing: Bad experience

Shares of Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers made a tepid debut on bourses on Wednesday, as it got listed at Rs 102.50 on NSE, a 13.14 per cent discount to the issue price of Rs 118. On BSE, the scrip got listed at Rs 104, down 11.86 per cent. The company's Rs 345 crore initial public offering was sold from September 24 to October 1, as the issue closure had to be extended because of poor demand. The scrip closed at Rs 102.05 on BSE and at Rs 100.80 on NSE on Friday.



Aviation stock fly high

Shares of airline majors including Jet Airways, SpiceJet and InterGlobe Aviation rallied up to 16 per cent for the week ended October 12 after the government cut excise duty on jet fuel to 11 per cent from 14 per cent to provide some relief to the aviation industry.



Stocks at 52-week low

As many as 216 stocks in the BSE500 index hit their fresh 52-week lows during the week. The list included Central Bank of India, Nilkamal, Dilip Buildcon, Tata Chemicals, Bharat Forge, Inox Leisure, SH Kelkar, TTK Prestige, Gujarat Pipavav, Kalpataru Power Transmission, DB Corp, The South Indian Bank and Birla Corporation.



Sectoral gainers & losers

Barring the BSE Metal (down 0.45 per cent), TECk (down 5.25 per cent) and IT (down 6.57 per cent), all other sectoral indices closed in the green for the week. The BSE Oil & Gas index rallied 9.33 per cent, followed by Bankex (up 4.42 per cent), Power (up 2.50 per cent), Auto (2.23 per cent) and Capital Goods (up 1.31 per cent). Besides a slight fall in crude oil prices, reports that the government may not push oil companies to share increased subsidy burden set the mood for the oil marketing companies.



Bandhan Bank sees respite

Shares of Bandhan Bank rallied nearly 3 per cent during the week gone by. The lender on Wednesday posted a 47.28 per cent increase in net profit to Rs 487.65 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. It had reported a net profit of Rs 331.09 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The private sector bank on Friday also said it got an exemption from market regulator Sebi on the one-year lock-in period for selling shares by promoters. 



Kiri Industries settles case

Chemicals firm Kiri Industries and its two promoters have settled a case related to alleged disclosure lapses with markets regulator Sebi after paying nearly Rs 11 lakh towards the settlement. Sebi had initiated adjudication proceedings against the three entities for allegedly violating disclosure norms under its regulations, including PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) and SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover). Shares of Kiri Industries jumped 5 per cent on Friday.



JSW Steel in mood to rally

Shares of JSW Steel rallied nearly 4 per cent during the past five sessions. The company on Thursday said its crude steel output grew 6 per cent to 4.18 million tonne (MT) during the quarter ended September 30, 2018. It had produced 3.94 MT crude steel in July-August 2017."

74,2018-10-16,Eicher,"It is better to be cautious on domestic focused stocks, the consumption oriented stocks or even the financials focused on retail 
  
  
  lending, Girish Pai, Head of Research, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What should we start with?
We should start talking about markets specifically. Markets are going to be under pressure for the intermediate term because what has happened is that the story thus far has seen the macros under pressure whereas the micros, the earnings picture has been looking fairly robust. 

In the last month, month-and-a-half, we have seen the macros deteriorating rapidly which is going to lead to a situation where earnings going into FY19 second half and probably into FY20 will have to be paid back.

I am talking about the domestic focused stocks, the consumption oriented stocks or even the financials focused on retail lending. This is an area where we would be kind of a little cautious. Valuations have become fairly rich and if that space is going to be under pressure, the market will be under bit of a pressure going forward.


What is your position on Infosys ahead of the numbers and what are you expecting from the earnings?Earnings show we are looking at something like 3% constant currency quarter-on-quarter growth and INR has a bit margin expansion of about 60-70 bps on a quarter-on-quarter basis. It is broadly expected by the market itself. I do not think there is any kind of great surprise. I am watching out for the deals the company clocks in Q2 because over the last six quarters, the large deal TCV has been going up on a consecutive quarter basis. In the last quarter, they delivered about $1.1 billion TCVs. My sense is probably they are going to clock a record breaking number in Q2 because they clocked a very large order of Verizon of about $700 million. You should add a typical run rate number of $800-900 million on the other non Verizon side. My sense is we are going to see a 1.5 billion large deal TCV number being clocked by Infosys which should probably be the largest number on a quarterly basis for many-many years. 

It would be a historical high. So that is a number that one needs to watch out for. The other is how much of the rupee depreciation benefits are going to be added to the bottom line and how much is going to be reinvested in the business. One of the things I am going to watch out for is whether the company is going to give out-of-turn increments and wage increases to people because last quarter there was a very sharp increase in high performer attrition.

I expect some kind of monetary intervention that is going to come about. That is on the quarter, from a sector perspective and vis-à-vis the market we are tactical bulls on the sector. We think the underlying growth from a constant currency or dollar perspective has kind of peaked. It has been a selective and a modest pickup in growth and it probably reflects in the kind of numbers that TCS has seen. 

The 2019 calendar is going to be a very different year. In 2018, the industry has benefited from a very high capex growth and S&P 500 companies. The capex growth is going to come off next year. The macro environment is going to change for the worse in 2019 in the developed markets. Broadly, that is the picture, but having said that, the domestic sectors like financials are going to face pressure and they are at fairly high valuations. So it is more a tactical trade as we speak right now. That is broadly my call on the Infosys stock and the sector.


What would you not buy in this fall?
That would probably be in the auto space. While we have an absolute upside for a Maruti, we believe that Maruti could potentially be an underperformer vis-à-vis some of the other largecap auto names because the market share gains it has had over the last many years has gone up from about 40-42% to about 51-52%, while the underlying passenger vehicle growth has not been too great. The company has been delivering high single digit to a very low teen kind of growth.

That growth picture is probably not going to improve any further from here on because I do not see any kind of great new products being introduced by the company going forward. Growth should disappoint from a Maruti standpoint and could potentially lead to some kind of PE multiple compressions. 

We have seen a fair bit of upside for the stock. It has corrected a bit but this is more like a two, three year call. Between Maruti and Eicher, we have been preferring Eicher because we think that Eicher is going to probably deliver you a better volume growth over a three to five year timeframe of about 13-14% whereas it is going to be a mid single digit growth for Maruti. 

That is the big variance in growth that we are going to see in the large cap auto space."

77,2018-10-20,Eicher,"Kunal Bothra, Independent Market Analyst, explains to ET Now why he is bullish on Jubilant Food, NIIT Tech and Hindustan 
  
  
  Unilever. Edited excerpts:  
We continue to see heightened volatility and on Friday we got very close to the 10,200 mark. Do you expect a breach of that?
We may not breach those levels but for the expiry next week, the 10,200 support should hold on. There are a couple of reasons for that. One, we see a clear outperformance of Bank Nifty compared to Nifty not just for the week but relatively in the last two weeks as well. Bank Nifty had made a low of 24,250 approximately on spot. It is trading above 25,000 and so there is a cushion of 750-800 points for Bank Nifty whereas for Nifty that cushion is only 60-70 points.

So relatively, Bank Nifty is still on a stronger footing and that is one of the core reasons why the benchmark Nifty has not given a breakdown and that support should hold on. In terms of sectors, there are lots of sectors which are showing signs of aggressive weakness but still there are stocks like Jubilant Food, HUL and most of these other stocks which are trying to make a good comeback. Net-net, next week you should see some stability coming back into the indices and the support of 10,200 should hold on to the index.


Would you buy Bajaj Finance and Piramal Enterprises now and how much more of a pain do you sense in the pipeline?
For Bajaj Finance, at current levels, there is enough strength visible on the charts and that strength itself could be decent enough for the stock to continue to outperform or even stay at current levels and not behave in a volatile fashion. 

Piramal Enterprise is at a very attractive level to consider buying this stock but the indicators on the timeframes, especially on the hourly charts, have not yet entered the extremely oversold territory. We would wait for a couple of days of bounce, then look out for credible supports getting built for Piramal Enterprise. Even if it is Rs 100 higher from current levels, that would not be a bad bet at those levels. But at current levels, I would watch Piramal Enterprise and wait for better levels to buy.


Any interesting trades for Monday?
Quite a few, really. I will list three of them. The first is a buy on Jubilant Food. The stock showed good resilience on Friday and managed to claw back above its 200 DMA. That is the first buy, targets of Rs 1320 and stop loss at Rs 1248. 

The second would be a buy on NIIT Tech. The midcap IT stock has shown four days of consecutive price upmove. It has bounced from its 200 DMA and the chart looks quite attractive on the short-term timeframe. NIIT Tech is a buy with targets of Rs 1295 and stop loss Rs 1220.

The third stock is also a buy. Hindustan Unilever is more of a defensive play. The stock has been holding on to its 200 DMA and I believe Hindustan Unilever could see some potential upside from current levels. That is a buy with targets of Rs 1620 and stop loss Rs 1546.


Do you believe that either a Maruti or an Eicher are now in the buy zone?
Absolutely. Maruti, Eicher Motors and even Bajaj Auto. To a large extent, even Hero MotoCorp, maybe not at the current price but another Rs 100-150 lower and it would also enter into those technical value territories. 

Most of these stocks have corrected significantly, not just in terms of price but in terms of indicators and that too on the monthly charts which makes them more attractive for a longer term investor to try and invest maybe some portion of their investments into these names, categorically Maruti, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto and also Hero MotoCorp."
78,2018-10-20,Eicher,"Market next will be defined by the three factors of oil price, domestic earnings and liquidity issue, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, 
  
  
  Group Chairman, Inditrade Capital, tells ET Now. We will have to see how the liquidity issue gets handled over the next 10-15 days, he says. Edited excerpts:


Blue chips have been falling quite hard. Piramal Enterprises falls 9% to 10% on a daily basis, Bajaj Finance is seeing selling as well. Do you buy this decline now or do you wait for the froth to settle down?
I would like to divide it into two buckets -- NBFCs with an exposure in infrastructure and real estate and the other NBFCs. If you talk about other NBFCs, the core business for the non-real estate, non-infrastructure exposure NBFCs is pretty sound. I do not see much of a problem there. Yes, there is a liquidity issue and that needs to be resolved and the regulator is working towards getting that resolved. If that happens, things will settle down in that part of the NBFC universe. 

On the other hand, we have this issue with the real estate and the infrastructure sector and NBFCs or other companies having significant exposure to companies in real estate and infrastructure are going to face liquidity issues as well as default in some cases like we have seen in case of Supertech.

So, one has to be extremely careful there and that is pretty much what the regulator is also trying to say when they introduced the new facilities. They specifically excluded the home finance companies as well as the infrastructure financing companies. We have to start demarcating and valuing and looking at exposures very carefully understanding the NBFC book and then trying to take exposure. 

On your specific question of companies like Bajaj Finance, fundamentally there is absolutely no problem with Bajaj Finance or Shriram Transport Finance, but we will have to be careful on companies with real estate exposures. Piramal is getting hit predominantly because of their real estate exposure.


What could be that one defining trend -- in earnings or events -- that is going to keep the market busy?
I will talk about three. One, all eyes will be on the oil price movement. The oil price has corrected and it is down almost 10% but the market has not reacted because of multiple negative factors today, but next week also we will have to keep watching the oil prices.

The second thing to do is watch domestic corporate results. A whole lot of interesting numbers are going to come out next week. I will be extremely focused on the banks and financial services and the automobile numbers. What is actually happening will be known once we see the numbers of banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank and also the numbers from Bajaj as well as Maruti. So, corporate results will be second area to look at. 

The third important area will be the liquidity and NBFC issues. It is getting out of hand. The RBI is trying to inject liquidity but confidence needs to be restored in the system to ensure that the system continues functioning. You cannot have a situation where a liquidity crisis leads to a solvency crisis. Till date, there is absolutely no solvency problem. 

Liquidity crunch allowed to continue unabated may lead to solvency issues and that will be disastrous. We will have to see how that gets handled over the next 10-15 days. 


Maruti has cooled off significantly from its peak. Eicher Motors is now at a 52-week low and continues to make fresh lows day in and day out. Hero MotoCorp did not exceed its guidance targets. Are the negatives already in the auto sector prices and are these right levels to start nibbling into any of the names?
Pretty much all the negatives are already factored in. I definitely am looking at Maruti for exposure. Maruti below Rs 7,000 is definitely a buy for a long-term investor who is building his portfolio. We were running after Maruti when it was Rs 9,000 plus and now it has corrected significantly because of the concerns which were expressed because of the genuine margin pressures which the manufacturer has been facing. So, it has corrected, it is below Rs 7,000 and at this level for a guy with one-year time horizon in mind definitely Maruti is a buy. 

As far as Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj is concerned, we had a quarter where the expectations were not really met or exceeded but I would not kind of go away from them or stop looking at them. I will continue to monitor them. I may not go and take exposure straight away because there are still a lot of headwinds in both domestic and international economies. I will keep watching them and think of taking exposure at an appropriate time, but not right now."
79,2018-10-22,Eicher,"ET Intelligence group: NBFCs are finding it tough to raise funds and automakers might well be the most affected by the broader liquidity squeeze, with financing options drying up across the transportation landscape.

Volume growth at major listed auto companies was expected to be in double digits in FY19, and the first half had maintained the projected trajectory. But two-wheelers companies are likely to the most vulnerable to NBFC stress as a large share of incremental volume growth witnessed in the past five years was primarily funded by these shadow banks.

Finance penetration also helped drive sales of passenger cars, tractors and commercial vehicles. Lesser participation by NBFCs during the festival season, which accounts for 10-15 per cent of annual offtake, could remain an overhang on auto stocks and PE multiples could further shrink. Auto stocks have corrected 12-56 per cent since the beginning of the year and barring TVS Motor, P/Es of all major companies have slipped below the long-term average.

Finance penetration for two-wheelers rose 50 per cent in FY18 compared with 30 per cent in FY14, according to Credit Suisse. On the other hand, finance penetration in passenger cars, tractors and commercial vehicles in the same period grew up to 5 per cent.



The prime driver has been the aggressive growth of NBFCs. The share of NBFCs (along with captive NBFC arms of twowheelers companies) rose to 60 per cent in the last fiscal year, a gain of nearly 8 per cent in five years. NBFCs increased their exposure in two-wheelers as ticket sizes were small and tenures less than 24 months.

To be sure, financing penetration in the passenger vehicle stood at 81 per cent. However, NBFCs have just a 17 per cent share in the car segment. In the tractor segment, NBFCs have high exposure, but such financing is considered priority lending. Therefore, these loans are easily sold to banks.

Two-wheeler volume growth would now depend upon the performance of the captive financing arms and whether they could quickly fill the space vacated by NBFCs. Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, and TVS Motor have captive finance arms. Among the two-wheelers, the most vulnerable could be Eicher Motors as it had high finance penetration, but no captive financing business.

Hero’s management, in the post-September quarter conference call, said that Hero Fincorp accounts for about 11 per cent of the total volumes and the company was on course to achieve 8-10 per cent volume growth in FY19. Hero is betting on the captive arm to support the volume guidance, but loans are no longer cheap. Hero Fincorp raised Rs 670 crore in April 2018 through a commercial paper at a yield to maturity of 6.91 per cent; but Rs 350 crore was raised in September at 9.25 per cent, according to Prime Database.

Similarly, TVS Credit Services—85 per cent owned by TVS Motor—raised YTM of 7.19 per cent in April 2018, while September 2018 YTM was 8.24 per cent, for Rs 100 crore.

Vehicle loans grew 11.3 per cent to Rs 1.89 lakh crore annually between FY13 and FY18, according to central bank data. The share of vehicle loans as a percentage of total bank credit rose to 2.47 per cent in FY18 from 1.92 per cent in FY13."

82,2018-10-23,Eicher,"Earnings growth though slightly lower, still looks fairly on track, Mahesh Patil, Co-CIO, Aditya Birla Sun Life 
   
   
   Mutual Fund, tells ET Now. Patil also says value is emerging in utilities, pharma and metal sectors. Some of the good quality NBFCs are also available cheap now. Edited excerpts: 


Good, bad or ugly, how is it looking?
It has been a kind of terrible period, especially in the broader market. We have again seen a fresh round of selling and it started off with all the financials. There are a lot of fears and all sorts of rumours are being spread. That has caused some kind of panic in the financial service space and that is spilling on to the broader markets.

To compound that, on the global front also, there is some kind of correction including in the US market. The US economy is, however, still doing very well. It is a combination of domestic factors as well as the global markets seeing some correction, has led to this fall.


As a local investor, how much credence would you give to global factors impacting our sentiment versus local factors pegging us back?
Global factors matter really because FIIs have been selling now for quite some time. In the last two quarters, FII flows have been negative and year till date, we are almost $5 billion negative which is one of the largest kind of numbers. Domestic flows, on the other hand, have been pretty steady at around Rs 9,000-10,000 crore, which have been balancing those things. 

I would say that the global factors are important but currently the correction in our markets is more to do with local factors really and the confidence seeking needs to be really bottomed into the financial services space to get back some kind of stability in our markets at this point in time.

Earnings are also coming in this quarter. We have seen some kind of earnings in the initial period and we are seeing some margin pressure. That was a concern this time around because commodity prices had gone up and the rupee depreciation led to a downgrade in earnings. But we have to wait and watch and see how these earnings goes by because that really gives support to the market at a time when other factors are looking a bit negative.


Since local factors are leading to correction in our market, what kind of approach for stock or sector selection would you adopt – top-down or bottom-up?
Lots of stocks and even the Nifty probably is down around 10% or so. Some of stocks are down 20-30-40%. It is the right time to really do bottom-up stock picking. A lot of sectoral rotation is also happening. Sectors which have done well, are correcting now. In this fall, IT and consumer staples did very well. Stock specific approach would be the right approach in this kind of market environment where clearly value is emerging in a lot of stocks across sectors. When there is a lot of fear and panic, stock prices slip below their intrinsic value. That is where you get good entry points.

But for somebody who is taking a slightly longer term view, it is a good stock pickers’ market and across sectors, it is the time to pick up better quality names to build a good long-term portfolio.


What is your approach towards managing midcaps and small caps in this market? You are putting about 20% of your overall corpus in midcap and small cap funds. What is driving your conviction there?
When there is fear in the market and the market is weak, we see midcap and smallcap stocks correct quite a bit. The smallcap index is down 40% from here its peak. So to a large extent, the stocks have corrected. They always overshot on the downside more than the largecaps when there is fear in the market. We had a largecap bias last year and beginning of the year. But with the correction in the midcap space, we are seeing stock-specific opportunity. 

In a way, we are largecap and midcap agonistic at this point in time. It clearly boils down to specific stocks. If we find good value in mid and smallcaps, we are happy to really look at those stocks in our portfolio. This is the time to dig down into your stocks, get better conviction because 20-30% fall in stock prices can actually shake your conviction. 


Would your conviction build more in a 40% fall in midcaps versus a 10-15% fall in largecaps?
As said. it does not matter. It could be the 40% fall…


Quality matters, you are getting quality 15% lower, you are getting higher risk… maybe risk your stocks 40% lower.
In the mid and small cap space some of the stocks which have fallen 40% they might still not be worthy of investing anyway at those levels but that is the differentiation you have to make. Quality matters. It could be a good quality company or it could be a poor quality company with governance issues. This market is not forgiving for these kind of stocks. We have seen that and they will not bounce back soon, because we are not seeing liquidity come back into the market.


As a fund manager, keeping the investors risk adjusted return profile in mind, how would you draw the balance? You are putting in 20% in mid and smallcaps, which means 80% goes into largecaps. Is that your bias?
Again, if you look at the broader market, if you do a composition of that market cap weighted, you would see that 20-25% would be largecap and balance would be midcap. What we are actually doing is we are not really differentiating between large and midcaps. So 25% would be the larger, broader allocation towards the midcap and the smallcap space in a multicap fund. Largecap stocks also because in the small and midcap space, the liquidity is not good. 

When things are bad, that is where you can build a portfolio. Otherwise, these stocks are much costlier in a bullish market. You have to build that portfolio now in the stocks which you have identified earlier and you are comfortable holding on to, from a slightly longer term perspective.


As the NBFC sector is facing challenges, is it possible that private sector banks which had lost market share to NBFCs, would again take that market share back. Would that compel some of the fund managers to allocate more weightage to private sector banks?
Normally when liquidity tightens, any financial institution with good liability franchise is obviously going to stand much better and that is where banks have an advantage with their retail deposit base and large CASA ratios. There is opportunity for them to really increase their market share, especially on the retail side. That is where the NBFCs were taking a lot of market share. 

But having said that, the opportunity is still very large in that space. It is not like one is taking market share because a lot of NBFCs are reaching out to a lot of retail buyers which banks are not catering to. In this kind of environment, you will see a slowdown in terms of growth for the NBFC sector and that is being reflected in terms of the derating in a lot of the names. 

Obviously, in the current scenario, where liquidity is very tight and there is lot of fear, we are seeing the valuations undershoot in some of these names but strong franchises on the NBFC side with good liability and pricing power, should help them survive this and bounce back.
At this point in time, the private banks are looking better placed and that is where there is more stability and visibility at this point in time.


Recently you added Eicher Motors. Given the kind of cool off that we have seen in the entire auto pack, is it purely a valuation game here? 
I would not be stock specific but generally in the auto space, especially the two-wheeler space, there has been some kind of a slowdown compared to expectations that we are building for the year. There are multiple factors. The overall festive season has not been that great. Also, there has been a hike in vehicle prices with insurance premium having gone up significantly. 

There is also a switch towards the higher emission norms which is increasing the cost of the vehicle and slamming the brakes in terms of new buyers coming into the market. It is basically the overall pruning down of the growth numbers, where we have seen the stock PE multiples are getting reduced a bit. We think it is a transient phase and the market will adjust to the new prices.

But in the near term, there has been a downgrade to our earnings and that is why we are slightly cautious on the space and the competitive intensity in the two-wheelers is also increasing with players wanting to get back market share.

We are seeing some margin pressure coming in that sector. But the stocks have now corrected back to fairly good levels. The PE multiples have got to attractive levels. These companies are good free cash flow generating companies and clearly value is emerging but in the near term, number downgrade is imminent in this sector.


Where else are you finding opportunity in the market right now?
Some of the defensive sectors like utilities look good. There are pockets of opportunity in the pharma space and metals. Metal prices have been fairly steady and China also has shut down capacities and the overall cash flow generation in that space seems to be fairly strong. We are seeing deleveraging happen in that sector. So metals look good. Obviously one needs to watch out what happens on China, but for the time being that sector looks good. 

In the banking and financial services space, some of the NBFCs have also got beaten down to levels where the valuations are looking very attractive. This is a time to differentiate between the NBFCs. 

NBFCs which have got a very strong parentage, good liability franchise and are strong on the asset side, should be able to bounce back once this does settle down on the liquidity front.


Would you say that there is still some attraction left when it comes to corporate banks or do you think much of the story is already behind us and in the price?
The corporate bank story is starting to play out now. We have seen the overall NPA cycle peak out. We are seeing some recoveries from the NCLT, which is also helping. Recently, the kind of value Essar Steel got means whatever provisions the banks had made, there will be some kind of a write back over there. So, the corporate bank story will play out over the next few years and as a result of that, the overall credit cost will come down and the ROAs will improve. 

Even the overall credit growth will improve in the corporate banks side. It is still a long way to really play for the corporate banks and you would see the overall growth as well as the return ratios improve, making them a good proposition from a next two to three-year perspective.


How are you mapping earnings from this quarter? So far, we have had a decent Q1. The Q2 earnings report so far has been luke warm-ish. Do you think we can be an aberration in this year’s earnings cycle versus what we did in FY18? Can FY19 hold the trajectory higher?
The expectations for FY19 if you look at consensus would be around 19-20%. Our expectation is around 16% growth. We think it is possible. Some downgrade could happen after this quarter because of the tightening of liquidity. We could see some slowdown in terms of the consumer sales especially consumer discretionary like autos and consumer durables and that is something which we will know only after this festive season goes by. 

But apart from that, the numbers should be fine. We are seeing strong growth coming in from the metal space, some of the pharma sector and selectively in the media space. There are a lot of sectors would actually report positive growth except for the telecom sector where you would see a sharp negative kind of a growth. 

I would say first quarter was fairly decent, second quarter should also be okay. The overall growth should be somewhere around 10% or so and if the trajectory continues in the second half and you do not see any meaningful slowdown in terms of growth, we should be well on track for around 15% earnings growth for FY19.


The three-year and five-year averages for equity are still favourable. But another 10% fall in largecap stocks and another 5% in smallcap stocks, could damage the returns. What happens to the investor sentiment in that case?
Yes, up till now, the domestic investors have behaved very rationally and have been very calm in the market fall and the steady inflow what we are seeing in the SIP is maintaining its level. However, the big money which came in at the time of demonetisation, has gone away. But one has to wait and see how the markets correct further and if the long-term returns start to look pretty and in low single digits, then what the investor reaction would be. My sense is that even if they shoot down another 5-10%, markets should not linger there. It should bounce back because the overall fundamentals are improving.
But if the long-term numbers start to look bit negative, one needs to watch out but the overall behaviour of investors has changed. The outlook is becoming much longer. Earlier, it used to be like one to two years, now it is three to five years timeframe. That gives us confidence that long-term money will stay in and the alternatives are not much. 

Agreed that the interest rates are going up and so some money would move into the debt side. But if you look at the other asset classes, neither real estate nor gold really offer any meaningful upside. I would say that you could see some slowdownm but the overall net positive flow that we are seeing should continue.


If you were to define your stance on the market would you say that you are cautiously optimistic or do you believe that there is reason to be optimistic because the only way from here is higher?
We have been cautious on the market for some time because a) the valuations were higher and the macros were kind of deteriorating. As every correction happens, there is a price for every stock in the market, While we are still cautious, this is the time when one should start to really deploy some of the cash that we have in our portfolio because we are seeing good value emerging and index at around 10,000 levels or below would be a good buying opportunity for a lot of investors who have been waiting on the sidelines and want to enter the market because the longer term picture still looks fairly intact. 

There is global growth also. While we are seeing a correction, the US is doing very well. And as I mentioned, earnings growth though slightly lower, still looks fairly on track."

84,2018-10-24,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: India cannot afford to fall back further even by a day in introducing the BS-VI emission norms as its pollution levels are ""alarming"" and it urgently needs to move to a cleaner fuel.

The top court, which said that no Bharat Stage-IV vehicle would be sold or registered in India from April 1, 2020, noted that Europe had introduced Euro-VI norms way back in 2015.

Bharat Stage standards are instituted by the government to regulate output of air pollutants from motor vehicles and BS-IV norms had been enforced across the country from April 2017.

""Europe introduced Euro IV fuel in the year 2009 and Euro VI standards in 2015. We are already many years behind them. We cannot afford to fall back further even by a single day,"" said a bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur, S Abdul Nazeer and Deepak Gupta.

The apex court's order came while deciding whether grace period should be given to the automobile manufacturers for the sale of BS-VI non-compliant vehicles after April 1, 2020.

Referring to the situation of pollution in the country, the bench said: ""The pollution in Gwalior, Raipur and Allahabad is worse than Delhi. The situation is alarming and critical. It brooks no delay.""

The bench termed as ""heartening"" that the Centre, being concerned with the health of citizens and also taking note of the urgent need for a clean environment, has taken steps to manufacture cleaner fuel.

In noted that the Centre has spent about Rs 30,000 crore to manufacture BS-IV compliant fuel and another Rs 30,000 crore have been expended to ensure that the fuel available in the country was BS-VI compliant.

The bench also dealt with the arguments advanced by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) which had contended that there were multiple sources of pollution and vehicles only contribute up to only 2 per cent of that.

""We are not in agreement with this submission because the report of the committee to which we have adverted hereinabove states that contribution of vehicles to ambient PM 2.5 concentration during winter season is 25 per cent and in the summer season it contributes 9 per cent,"" the bench noted.

It said: ""Even if we were to accept the figures submitted by SIAM, we are of the view that no step is too small when it comes to fighting pollution. Small steps to reduce pollution when taken together will lead to large scale reduction in pollution which will result in much cleaner air, which eventually will result in a cleaner and better environment, healthier citizens and most importantly a healthier generation to come.""

The bench also noted that though the SIAM was canvassing before it that shift to BS-VI compliant vehicles was a long drawn out process requiring huge changes in technology, the very same automobile manufacturers were selling and exporting BS-VI compliant vehicles to Europe and other countries.

Referring to media reports, the bench said it was apparent that Eicher was already manufacturing trucks and buses which are not only BS-VI compliant but BS-VI CNG compliant.

""Another manufacturer of heavy vehicles i.e Ashok Leyland had, in August, 2018 through its subsidiary Optare obtained an order to manufacture the world's first electric double decker buses. The technology needed to manufacture such electric buses is much more advanced and difficult as compared to the technological changes required to manufacture petrol and diesel vehicles which are BSVI compliant,"" it noted.

It also said that TVS Motors had in August issued a press note that it would be manufacturing BS-VI compliant vehicles much ahead of the deadline of 2020.

The bench said that BS-VI fuel has already been made available in the national capital territory (NCT) of Delhi from April 1, 2018 and barring a few places, it would be available in the entire national capital region from April 1 next year.

""It will probably be available in many parts of the country prior to April 1, 2020 and the entire country will shift to BS-VI fuel from April 1, 2020,"" it said.

""Obviously, the manufacture of clean fuel is being done in a phased manner because all the refineries cannot simultaneously start manufacturing clean fuel,"" it said, adding, ""It is not as if on April 1, 2020 just by waving a magic wand the entire country will change to BS-VI compliant norms""."

86,2018-10-29,Eicher,"This is the best buying opportunity in over two years and investors should come in and buy, Sandeep Bhatia, 
  
  
  Head of India Equities, Macquarie Capital Securities, tells ET Now. Bhatia expects earnings growth to come back in the banks first, followed by consumption and manufacturing especially auto ancillaries. These are expected to take the market forward from here.Edited excerpts: 

We have seen a raft-up outflow by foreign institutional investors, the highest in last 10 years. The outflow from Indian equities in October is north of $2.5 billion. What is causing this kind of panic because similar outflows happened in 2008 and this is certainly not 2008?
Of course, this is not 2008. This is nowhere close to the difficult times of 2008 but I would say that the US bond yields are the key focus for not only India but also for emerging markets across the globe. Therefore, we will continue to see outflows come through because US growth still continues to surprise on the upside. 

The US bond trajectory rates are still going up. We will see asset allocation move away from emerging markets and from India and outflows will continue for the next couple of months. We are getting into the election season and there is an element of political uncertainty that is adding to the pressures on FIIs flows. 


How should one look at it? Could this be the big turn in favour of emerging markets or do EMs have potential to fall further as the pain in developed market has just surfaced?
Emerging markets move on the back of strong global economic growth and specifically strong US growth. If the US growth continues to be broadly strong, that is a good earnings environment for all emerging markets and good GDP growth environment for the entire globe. This is the kind of environment that we are in. 

What is happening in the US is, in addition to good GDP growth, employment is also peaking. There is wage pressure coming through and therefore the Fed is moving towards raising interest rates and pushing down and controlling inflation that could be incipient in the economy. We are in that transition phase where this entire US rate curve, which has been very low for almost a decade after 2009 onwards, are now seeing the uptick come through. The impact will be felt by the entire global market. 

I would think this is a very healthy and required correction. I would expect the valuation correction to continue for some more time but earnings will hold up. We have to go through this phase in the next three to six months when the election season is ahead of us and then the market will be positioned for good buying opportunity from the first quarter of next year onwards.


How do you tie the earnings potential as the rates are edging higher? The government and RBI are at loggerheads on how to manage growth versus inflation. What are you factoring in your earnings assumption?
Earnings growth is coming from a variety of sectors and not only from the consumer discretionary space. We have seen earnings come through in commodity and IT companies and also banks. Banks are, in fact, the largest contributor to earnings. It is not that earnings pressure will come through just because there is some rate pressure coming in.

As far as the face-off between RBI and the government is concerned, I have seen that happen multiple times in the last 10-15-20 years across various governments. Clearly, there are pressures on the RBI. The RBI has actually done a fantastic job across-the-board, not only among emerging markets. I would not get too scared because by some of the headline that have come out over the weekend. I would think that earnings growth trajectory will come through from wider variety of sectors than what we have seen in the past three to four years. This is why earnings are not disappointing. 

When earnings are concentrated in one or two sectors, that’s when disappointments are likely to take place. The good thing about earnings story now is that it is going to come through from a wider variety of sectors and that is why we are more confident of earnings growth getting delivered despite some of the headwinds that you just referred to.


The shake-up in the market has really been about this big IL&FS fallout. Do you think NBFCs will continue to be affected over a longer period because of high cost of funding or is much of the pain already behind us?
There are various kinds of NBFCs. There are NBFCs which do a whole host of businesses and who have some aggressive lending practices and therefore those kinds of NBFCs are clearly feeling the brunt of the valuation correction and the money market drying up. 

There are some NBFCs which are much more focussed. They have higher quality books and a longer track record of doing business. Whether they are consumer focused or housing finance-focused, they have very good books and these NBFCs have reason to continue without making major changes to the balance sheet. 

But clearly, there is going to be a compression in the NBFC space. The growth in the bank lending which has not been there for the last four years, gave a very good environment combined with valuations of NBFCs which were going up. This created the hope that NBFCs can continue to grow at the rate at which it has grown. I would say that the 30% plus growth in NBFCs as a whole across the top tier or the bottom tier, that we have seen, is clearly not going to happen. There will be much more differentiated growth. 

Even in the banks’ side, it is not that every bank grows at the same rate or each bank is valued at very high multiples. More discrimination and differentiation will come through in the NBFCs going forward which is something that is required. Also some of the problems that you mentioned like IL&FS have come to the fore in the last three months, but these problems have been in the making for at least five to 10 years and therefore this is the last leg of the cleanup of the Indian financial system. 

The Indian financial system was clogged up with bad assets. The cleaning up happened both in the private sector as well as the public sector banks. We have seen management changes taking place in some large private sector banks. This is the last leg of the cleanup in the finance sector and that was very much required. 

The market will learn to differentiate and also learn a lesson that hopefully, it should not forget in the next upmove. This correction should continue for the next couple of months, maybe more than six months. We will then be positioned for a stronger, more secure and widespread sectoral growth of earnings coming through in the market.


Do you sense that there could be newer sectoral leadership that will take the markets forward from here?
The first place where earnings growth will come through is in the banking sector. The financials are the largest contributors to earnings. They will see earnings growth. If the trajectory of oil prices moderate even a bit, growth will come through even for the oil refining sectors. More importantly, we definitely see earnings growth coming through in the consumption space. We have seen ITC, Nestle and Unilever come out with good numbers. 

Broad consumption remains on track. Even in the manufacturing sector, large companies will see earnings growth coming through. We like Crompton Greaves, Maruti. In the recent correction, some of these companies have come through. Auto ancillaries have seen a correction. So. Motherson Sumi looks interesting at these levels. Across the board, we will see contribution coming through from various sectors of the economy but it will be led by the banks.


You have given an overarching view on the banks as well as NBFCs. ICICI Bank is your top pick among corporate lenders. Why?
ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank are the two large banking franchises in the private sector that we have. ICICI Bank trades at a significant discount with all the bad news which has come through in the last 12 to 36 months on the balance sheet, on the management changes and so on.

If you look at the various subsidiaries of ICICI Bank, we forget that it has market leading positions not only in the banking sector but its’ AMC business, insurance business are very large and profitable businesses on their own. 

Clearly, ICICI Bank is a strong franchise and from current levels, it is a fantastic two to three-year growth story which is coming through. The new management is focussed on delivering that. So, ICICI Bank remains our top pick.


What is your take on the so-called crowded auto names? Maruti, Eicher stocks are typically owned by institutional investors. But of late, there has been a serious price erosion. Maruti has come down from Rs 10,000 to Rs 6500, Eicher has come down from Rs 33,000 to Rs 24,000-25,000.
We have not made any major change in the earnings projections. At the margin, the overvaluation which has happened in certain concentrated names, has got corrected. We have seen price corrections happening in all the consumer discretionary and even consumption staple plays. 

That kind of price correction was necessary because there was clearly just one or two sectors which were doing well and now we are seeing a wider spread of sectors come through as these names have corrected. At the current levels, both Maruti and Eicher are very interesting. Both will offer you at least 18-20% earnings growth, both have interesting positions. 

Maruti is the default car purchase for most newcomers to the car fold and even existing users. Eicher is a proposition on the expansion of the two-wheeler market and the upgradation which is happening. So, both these businesses from current levels are definitely good two to three-year stories.


As a house, Macquarie champions tracking commodities globally. Indian commodity companies have got a huge blessing in disguise because of a weak dollar. Their earnings are likely to go higher because it is dollar denominated. How come markets are not taking notice of that?
Markets will take notice of things, it is not that they will notice something right at the moment that one wants it to. That is why there is a buying opportunity or a selling opportunity. Market notices there was a big pain in the financial sector and the banks were getting hit. At that point in time, market was ignoring the problems which were building in the NBFC sector and in the last two months, we have seen that come under intense focus. 

So the market moves from one story to the other and it sometimes gets into a phase where the positives are marked up significantly more than they should be and negatives are marked down more than they should be. We are in a phase where these corrections have happened and to that extent, what we are seeing in India is good valuations coming through, wider sectors coming through and earnings coming through across a whole range of sectors. 

If we look at it in the next six months, it is probably the best buying opportunity you will have over two years and investors should come in and buy at this moment."

89,2018-10-30,Eicher,"ICICI Bank may outperform in short to medium term, but longer term, other private sector banks like HDFC Bank, 
  
  
  RBL, Kotak Mahindra and IndusInd Bank will come out tops, Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Capital, tells ET Now. Mehta also stays focused on private banks, NBFCs, consumption-oriented stories and select pharma and IT companies.Edited excerpts:


Tech Mahindra is holding out. We have seen a slow build-up in appetite for technology stocks ever since the biggies reported their numbers. Has this earnings’ quarter rerated tech more than what we witnessed three months back?
Not really. Tech stocks have moved up and we have seen a follow-through in terms of quarterly numbers for several tech companies. There have been a few misses like Mindtree, and some of the other midcap tech companies but by and large, tech companies have delivered on what investors have been expecting. 

Going forward, it may get challenging for them. No doubt. the rupee benefit may come through for a quarter or two but thereafter sustaining the kind of growth rates which they have displayed in the first two quarters of this year may get difficult. The end point is that we are dealing with single digit or mildly double digit or just about 10-12% type of growth rates and that has been priced into the PE multiples.

I do not expect tech stocks to outperform going forward. There may be a few exceptions depending upon the business models and the likes of say Tata Elxsi or LTTS or for that matter, some of the product companies like Intellect or Nucleus Software which have a differentiated business model. But larger IT companies like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and Mindtree may continue to be market performers or slight underperformers as the cycle will also slow down depending upon how the US economy shapes up. 

So, while tech stocks have moved up, I do not expect that they will follow through and outperform over the next six to 12 months the way they have over the past 12 months.


It is almost that ICICI Bank has gotten rerated after its earnings under the new leadership. After the sharp rebound from the lows of Rs 340-350, is the stock a buy?
It is a nice trading buy and you could expect this bounce to continue for a few more weeks, maybe even a quarter. A lot of expectation will build up for the December quarter for ICICI Bank in the hope that they will deliver another decent quarter. Base effect also benefits ICICI Bank and on the whole, some of the uncertainty surrounding the top management has been resolved. 

You could see a trading bounce, may be 10-15% upmove from these levels, but beyond that, we still prefer the retail-focused private banks likes of HDFC Bank, Kotak or IndusInd Bank, maybe even RBL which have consistently delivered at the time when ICICI and Axis Bank have underperformed. 

While we may see a technical bounce in ICICI Bank over a period of two-three years, our money still remains with the compounders. 

The compounding stories are the likes of HDFC, Kotak Mahindra or some of the other banks which I named. These are now available at attractive valuations whereas ICICI valuation ratios have moved up and even after having such a spectacular quarter, if you compare the net interest income and the core profit growth of ICICI Bank versus some of its peer group, the peer group still fares far better. 

In the short to medium term, ICICI Bank may remain in focus and outperform but clearly, with a two, three year or even a five-year type of a view, the other private sector banks like HDFC Bank, RBL, Kotak Mahindra and IndusInd Bank may outperform ICICI and Axis Bank.


What are your top two or three high conviction ideas in the broader markets and among the midcaps?
We remain quite committed to NBFCs like Bajaj Finance or L&T Finance. Also, we are quite positive on some of the consumption oriented stocks, especially media stocks. The Zee Group companies have come out with a good set of numbers, Zee Entertainment, Zee media and Zee Learn as well. 

At the same time, private sector banks like RBL or even IndusInd Bank which has corrected considerably from its highs because of the amount lent to IL&FS can be considered at this point of time. We remain focussed on private sector banks, NBFCs, consumption-oriented stories and select pharma companies, especially those engaged in contract manufacturing like Jubilant Life Sciences or Suven Life Sciences. We have seen excellent numbers coming from Divy’s Lab as well. These also could be considered by investors. 

Broadly the strategy is to go for banks, NBFCs, consumption oriented and within pharma and IT, companies which have a differentiated business model. In case of IT, companies that are focussed on products or technology or design and in case of pharma, those which are focussed on contract manufacturing have a very high backward integration into APIs and strong position in select molecules. 

That broadly explains our strategy and the stock picking process.


Why not auto and specifically Maruti, after a 33-34% correction from higher levels? From short-term perspective, which are the concerns that are keeping investors away?
Passenger cars grew in a cycle and we have seen a fantastic upcycle over the past few quarters, notwithstanding GST and demonetisation. Passenger vehicles have done very well over the past two-three years. Same is the case with two-wheelers but that’s the base effect and some of the headwinds related to higher interest rates, higher insurance costs and factors like higher petrol costs are acting as headwinds for the sector.

In may be one or two quarters, soft sales will come through from the entire industry whether it is Maruti in four-wheelers or Eicher or even TVS Motors in the two-wheeler space. That is the reason why despite the market picking up, investors just want to wait and watch. In next five-six months, the monthly sales figures also may be disappointing. The automobiles companies, especially Maruti and the others, tend to move up and react to monthly auto figures. 

The Street is pricing in slower growth as far as monthly sales figures are concerned and lets this base effect get normalised. We have some clarity on petrol and diesel prices as well as insurance norms. These need to be absorbed by the marketplace and thereafter once we return to double- digit volume growth, we may see the auto and the auto ancillary stocks coming back into reckoning. 

Till then, it is better that investors who are already there, remain invested in these blue chip companies as they will turn out to be great wealth creators over the next three to five years or so. Fresh investors would find that there is value and growth in sectors other than auto at this point of time.


How are you looking at the consumption play ahead of the festive season? Which pocket are you betting on most?
It is going to be a mixed festive season. You may see soft sales coming through from the auto companies but FMCG companies, food companies and to an extent appliance companies may do well. The company to watch out for would be Havells India. They have come out with a good set of numbers for the September quarter and the management is also quite positive on the prospects going forward. 

They have integrated the new acquisition -- Lloyds -- pretty well and once the factory starts producing, you may see expansion of profit margins over there as well. This is one company we are quite positive on going forward. It is a company in which we and our clients are invested in.


Do you believe that there is a trading opportunity in OMCs or should one stay away totally?
You can trade in them from time to time but they are not investment grade companies because of the kind of position that they are in. 

Looking at the price to book or dividend yield, you could consider buying into the oil marketing companies but once the oil prices start moving up, then there are certainly challenges and it is difficult to call even as far as their performance is concerned. There is a high degree of volatility in their earnings even when oil prices are stable. I find it difficult to get a handle on OMCs. There are better sectors from a long-term investment perspective for investors to focus on.


What about aviation? We are now stepping into what is called traditionally the strongest of the quarters, the holiday season, the year end winter months?
We have been positive on aviation companies but they have disappointed big time -- all the three companies. Although we may remain invested for some more time, we are looking for exit opportunities and as and when we see the prices of oil declining and some amount of semblance of stability and lower competitive intensity coming in the aviation stocks, you may seen an upswing but those are all levels to selloff. 

This is not a great industry for investors to be in over a longer period of time. The competitive intensity will remain strong even going forward. It is somewhat similar to the telecom sector where there is no pricing discipline within the existing players and while we may see good volumes they do not really get captured into the top line and bottom line value creation from a business or a stock market perspective. It is best to avoid aviation stocks, at least the new investment. Existing investors should remain invested and if they see 30-40% rise from these prices and that certainly is likely after one or two good quarters and some amount of positive developments on the industry front. 

On the pricing side, we could see the stocks rallying but those are all levels to exit. Again, like oil marketing companies and telecom, aviation will become a sector you can trade in but not a nice long-term secular growth oriented sector you can invest for three to five years or so."
0,2018-11-18,Eicher,"A very interesting opportunity may be that the whole EM trade will reverse and that can lead to disproportionate flows to India. That is where the benefit lies, says Atul Suri, CEO & CIO, Marathon Trend – PMS. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW.

Markets have not changed at all, the look is still the same, 15-20 stocks and that is about it.No harm, really there is no harm. I know there is a lot of angst that the market is very narrow but let us take a bigger view of the markets. I look at the MSCI All-World index. It is like the mother index of the word. It has 49 countries in it. I know we have a lot of negative news. Whatsapp is full of end of the world scenario, but markets are doing their own thing. They are saying a different story. The MSCI All-World index has broken out into life-time high a few weeks ago! Now you may say that it is a function of the US. So let us go and see the US. It is true that the Dow, S&P, the Dow Transportation has started coming up. Utilities are coming down. So this is inverse. Risk-on trade is on in the US. When I look at the charts and I look at a lot of triggers in the US in the year -- elections, trade wars, corporate earnings and most important bond yields -- I personally see a 20% upside in the US markets from here.


20% upside in the US market after 11-year bull run in the market that has been called as the longest economic expansion?Right.


That means Dow could go to 35,000.I think so and what I feel is that this is not just going to be the US. Let us go a step further. We looked at the All-World Index, we took out its biggest component Dow, which is 50%. 


All-World Index is what?So the All-World Index is a composite index of 49 different markets of the world and out of that, they pick out various components. It is the most broad-based equity index in the world and it is the ETF available. You can actually trade it. If I say, I am bullish on global markets, I can actually buy the world indexes in one ETF. Then I go to the next level. I look at this All-World Index Ex-US. So I take out US. I think that okay US is the only propulsion point, rest is gloom and doom. The other big component is the European markets which have been dead and nobody talks about but even there you will start seeing that the Dax or the CAC of Germany and France, UK market with its own problems, all nudging 52-week highs! Nobody talks about them. They are not headline news. 

Let us go to the next level. Let us look at Japan Nikkei, again a forgotten market. Even that is pushing at 52-week highs. So what you really see is a very broad-based global equity bull market, very contrary to the kind of Whatsapp and tweets that we get.


Dow has been making a new high for almost three years in a row now. Indian markets also have managed to outperform. At least the Nifty has managed to outperform and it is making a new high on a consistent basis. So what is the new trend Atul Suri is talking about?What actually happens is that equity markets have been very good in 2019 but 2018 was a very difficult year. I 2018 December, we were in debt and the biggest trigger for that was US bond yields. Exactly a year ago, if we were sitting here, the talk was that the bond yields which have been declining for 20-30 years has turned and as bond yields go up, money will move away from equity to debt. Just a year later, people are talking of negative interest rates. That shows our ability to predict and the ways and means of markets to surprise us. 

I think the biggest elephant in the room is bond yields. They drive all other asset classes. Last year, we thought a 30-year-old trend had changed and this year we are talking about negative yields!


We got a headline 10 days ago that there has been a big spike in the US 10 year rate.There has been.


That tells you that the inverted yield curve which took the markets higher is equalising. If your bullishness is based around US 10-year paper, guess that is reversing?What will happen is that not just the pop-up is going to reverse. Even if it remains within a range, even two negative inverted yield curves, etc, is not good for the market. But most important thing about currencies and bond yields is their range boundness. The good part is that the collapse has stopped but I feel that we will go into a period of range boundness. This is again coming back to our earlier reading that the big trigger for global markets will be a muted or a range-bound US bond market. If that remains, what will happen is that there is a very big TINA (there is no alternative) factor which is also happening out in India. 

Going ahead in 2020, we will have a good market thanks to the global bull run in spite of all negative headline news. But for us to turn from good to great is going to be a function of what happens in Indian markets and 2020 is going to be very exciting.-Atul Suri

I feel that money will move to equities and let me take that whole deduction thing ahead. I had mentioned about Japan being another great bull market. The next step I would look at is the EM space and the only place of big concern or underperformance big time is the emerging market index and guess what? We are a subset of it.


 It is also believed and documented that emerging markets will do well when developed markets are not doing that well.Right.


They both are a mirror image of each other. There is an inverse correlation. If one goes down, the other goes higher. What you are saying is forget the blackboard theories. What have worked in the past will not work in the future. We are in a rising tide phenomenon where everything will go up in a synchronised manner. Why is that?
As I said, the EMs index is not looking that pretty! When you speak to investors, they say that why should we come in? In 2018 the EM index was down 25% and in 2019 when there is a big bull market, at best we have done 10%. We are nowhere near lifetime highs where the EM basket is good. So, the compulsion to be in EMs is not there yet. Yes, the potential is that this trade could reverse and disproportionately benefit India because whatever the FIIs are buying, how come they are buying in tw-three days. 

The direct correlation is that there is a very large passive ETF, EMs trade that goes out and India gets its share of allocation. We tend to over emphasise the local factors but the big EM money that comes is more a function of this trade. Let me shock you with the number. Last year, the total FII negative flows are around Rs 53,000 crore or thereabouts. In 2019, we may sound passive but we are already positive Rs 58,000 crore. The buying this year has been more than the selling last year, though that was headline news. The thing is EMs which fell very sharply in 2018 at 25%, have consolidated in 2019 and are 10% higher. But they are nowhere near what the developed markets are doing. 

For me, a very interesting opportunity may be this whole EM trade reverses and that can lead to disproportionate flows to India. I feel that is where the benefit lies and for India also, you have to accept the headline news is not good.


 It is like a situation where markets will climb the wall of worry. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala says that markets always climb the wall of worry and come down the ray of hope. Right now, there is no hope but there is a wall of worry which markets have managed to climb.Right. So, we have a very good global scenario now and we will get our share. We got it last year without doing anything spectacular. In 2019, there has been no great news. In 2020, starting from the budget, can we do something great -- may be divestments, direct taxes or just general economic improvement -- all related to government policies. In case that happens, India can get a bigger share than what is due to it and that for me can be the big space. 

Going ahead in 2020, we will have a good market thanks to the global bull run in spite of all negative headline news. But for us to go out and turn from good to great is going to be a function of what happens in Indian markets and 2020 is going to be very exciting.


 Let’s talk about long-term trends. If markets continue to extend themselves, will the horses also be the same or do you need to jump off the horses? Jumping of the horses is intellectually a great concept but I am a trend investor and investing styles are not an intellectual function. It is a function of risk return profile. As a trend investor, I do not believe in being the first to buy a stock or buying a stock at the bottom. I feel that money is made in trends. If a stock goes from 100 to 1000, it is not that I have to buy it at 100. I can buy it at 200 and 300, The more important part is my ability to ride the trend. So yes I know there is this talk that there is a bubble in some space and some spaces are cheap, but the fact is when the market or earnings change, I may be not being buying at the bottom. I may buy it a little late but it is okay because that suits my risk return profile. As an investor you have to allow your thought process to evolve.


Are you an investor or a trader?I am an investor.


I thought you were a trader.What are investors? What are traders? What is midcap, what is largecap, what is quality, what is not quality, these are all related manmade terms. The fact is that ultimately each investor style has to gel with his personality. That makes your style of investing and this has to sync with your investor expectations. That is the crucial part about my evolution as a trend investor. 

Coming to your question, are all these stocks a top made or is it a bubble? I do not think so. Nothing in the market tells me that there is a bubble, Yes the other story can also play out but the fact is that if you let the earnings come and let them play out, we may not buy a 100 to 1000 journey at 100, we may buy it at 200-300, I want to buy it at a point where the risk is low. I am not one of those kinds who will buy a stock at 100 wait for two years and at 50 get disappointed. I would rather buy it at 200 and 300 and see it go to 400-500. That story is panning out in this space. That is where the trends are and being a trend investor I am quite happy to be there.


If I look at the five or seven-year chart, Eicher has still given a phenomenal return but if I just squeeze in the last two years, Eicher performance has been a nightmare for a trader. It has seen a 40% decline from the top and a 40% recovery from the lows. In the last three years, it is flat. Let us look at three-month or four-month chart for Eicher and it is like one of the scary, volatile charts. 
How do you deal with this kind of volatility in a zero-debt company, which is also a classic compounder. This is the beauty of numbers and statistics based on what view you wantm you can splice data. That is how reports are made. The thing is your projection and all these things are academic discussion. The important part is what is your style and what fits? I really do not need to look at Eicher at three months, one year, two years etc. The important part is, as a trend investor, I am trying to look to invest for three, five years. 

If I am playing that kind of a strategy, then I have to give that stock that kind of leeway. Let us not speak about Eicher specifically. The fact is what data you splice, you can make it a bull and bear case based on data.


 All I am saying is that a classic compounder like Eicher also has given you these nervous moments. It has given these bouts of gut wrenching volatility. An auto company which has no debt in it falling 40% will shake you up. It cannot be compared to a power company or a PSU bank. Yet the stock has fallen?The smoothest stock in Indian markets today, and widely owned, is HDFC Bank. This stock also showed 20-30% volatility. A bank that is growing at 20-25% year-on-year with no blemishes, how can the stock fall 20-30%? But in markets, that is the function of multiple variants. As I said, the important thing is as a trend investor, my objective is about having portfolios with low draw-downs. I would like a portfolio that doubles, goes up 100% every year but the fact is if I look for a stock or a portfolio that goes up 100% every year, can I withstand a 50% drawdown because risk and reward go hand in hand? As an investor, it is important for you to be able to define what is your area which fits into your psyche.


How does stop loss come in now? You said stop loss is sacrosanct?Stop loss is sacrosanct because what happens is that when trends change, you will see that same price trend change. I will give you this case of Eicher so it may just be a bit of a story telling; I rode this stock for a long, long phase.


Not the bike, the stock?I do not know how to ride a bike.


That is a good disclosure.It is beautiful. Actually that is where the story goes to. I love the stock and Eicher -- Royal Enfield had opened these stores and there was one that opened in Bandra where I live. I went there and I said this stock has been kind to me, let me go and see what the hell the bike is all about. It is was a very fancy store with leather jackets and things like that. So I went in and I saw some and I said since I cannot buy the bike, maybe I can buy a t-shirt or something. So, I went and saw a keychain and thought I would buy it but I stopped myself. I did not buy the keychain because that is where emotion comes in and I checked myself from making that emotional decision. 

Again, when stocks do well or when trends happen, we fall in love with them. And the exit decision what we spoke about stop losses is not an intellectual decision, it is emotion. Selling is the most difficult thing to do in the market because that is where emotion comes in. 

If you sell in profit, you are definitely in love with the stock because you have made money; selling at loss is where your ego comes in. The decision what to buy or where is the trend is not difficult. Sitting on the trend is more difficult and the most difficult part is exiting the trend. The reason that happens is not because we have failed intellectually, it is an emotional issue."

8,2018-11-22,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Automobile companies may report moderation in volumes in the remaining two months of the calendar year after a busy festive season. But that may not affect their stock performance going by the historical trend. The Nifty Auto index has outperformed the benchmark Nifty 50 in November and December in eight out of the past 10 years, according to data compiled by IDFC. Considering the combined performance in these two months, the Auto index has outperformed the broader index by an average 2 per cent return in the past 10 years.

This suggests the cyclicality factor gains higher prominence in the last two months despite lean volume. Neeraj Agarwal, vice president for alternative research, IDFC Securities, believes that due to positive cyclicality effect any decline in the Auto index should be used as an opportunity to take long positions for a target of 9050-9100 levels.


“We expect renewed buying interest to prevail in HeroMotocorp, TVS Motors, Eicher Motors and Maruti,” said Agarwal. The Nifty Auto index closed at 8004 on Thursday.

Over the past decade, the maximum return in the last two months of the year was 17.4 per cent in 2009 and minimum was -14 per cent in 2011.

The Auto index has outperformed the Nifty 50 by 4 per cent and closed in the positive territory for the past three months in a row. The monthly returns of the Nifty Auto index since 2011 shows only once the consecutive gain for three months was followed by profit booking. Profit booking was usually observed after either four months or eight months of consecutive gains."

11,2018-11-22,Eicher,"The ability to generate alpha in times of distress shows the capability of fund managers. And market veteran Sunil Singhania (50) is obsessed with it.

Singhania floated his portfolio management service firm, Abakkus Asset Management, in August 2018. And the first midcap-focused fund he launched delivered around 7-8 per cent return to investors till October 2019. That stood out because midcaps were down in the dumps through this period, with the BSE Midcap Index declining 7 per cent.

Singhania’s firm manages close to Rs 2,000 crore now.

Before floating Abakkus, Singhania also proved his mettle earlier as CIO of Reliance Mutual Fund. Under Singhania, Reliance Growth Fund delivered a 21 per cent return CAGR from 2004 through 2017, outperforming the S&P BSE100’s 14 per cent CAGR returns. Ambit Capital named him in its report on ‘Mastery in Indian Equities’.


Investment strategy
A humble Singhania says he has no fixed formula to discover a stock. “It is not mathematics. It is the combination of a lot of things,” says he.

But Singhania does follow a framework, he calls MEETS, an acronym for management, earnings, events, timing and structure. “That’s our core philosophy in stock selection,” he said.

The Mumbai-based investor said his team does also go through past history of a company and runs various models for stock selection. “We continuously meet companies. And then also, we do secondary research. So it is a combination of a lot of these things put together,” he said.

That approach helped Singhania spot big opportunities Bajaj Finance and Eicher Motors early.


When to sell a stock?
The market veteran asks investors not to sell a stock as long as the company continues to grow and add value. “You should not sell a stock just because the stock price has moved up. I do not think that is the right way of managing a portfolio,” he said.

At the same time, he says when one goes wrong with an investment decision, one should not make any delay in selling a stock. “Investors should also offload a stock if it have moved up too much beyond fair value. Lastly, one can also exit a stock if there is better opportunity elsewhere,” he said.

The right stock price, Singhania says, is a reflection of a lot of different things. “Remember, buying a stock is like becoming a partner in a company,” he insists.

“One should buy a stock if the value of the business is justified at that point of time. It is a must to check management track record and growth prospects before taking any position,” he said.


Tips to investors
According to him an equity investor should invest in stocks only when she is positive on the economy. “In the near term, she might end up making a lot of mistakes and find that the market is rewarding her sufficiently. But ultimately, investing in equity is like investing in a growing asset. In a growing economy, a growing asset class will always give you more returns than any other,” he said.


Why equity market as career?
Singhania says he has always been a voracious reader and did not hide his love for reading balance sheets in his early days. A chartered accountant by profession, he later did CFA.

“I used to practice, but my heart was always in the balance sheet. So, the interest grew and from there on in the mid-90s when the economy started to open up, I got the opportunity to move full time into the equity market,” he said.

Views on the current market
The market veteran finds the current market very challenging, considering the bleak picture of the economy. “Too much money is flowing into so-called quality names and they are trading at 70-75 price-to-earnings and whereas others are trading at significantly lower valuations,” he pointed out. 

“With the Sebi reclassification of stock categories for mutual funds and a general apathy towards midcaps and smallcaps, no one wants to buy smaller companies and, therefore, their valuations are now at significant discount to their largecap peers,” said Singhania.

The value investor said he is currently looking for opportunities in companies that are below Rs 7,000 crore in market capitalisation. “Valuations are in our favour from a longer-term perspective. We are not looking at a particular sector, but the aim is more towards trying to see if we can invest in companies where valuations are in our favour just because technically no one is looking at them,” he said."

NSE Nifty opened on a flat note on Friday, but soon reversed course and extended losses, as the session progressed. The index fell sharply in the first half of the day, but due to some pullback in the later half, it managed to close a tad above the 11,900 level.

The headline index made a lower high and lower Low and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. For the second straight week, Nifty has traded in a narrow range of 171 points, which is the narrowest weekly range in the last six months. It formed a Doji candle on the weekly scale for the third week in a row, which clearly shows lack of momentum in either direction.

Now, the index has to hold above 11,850 levels to witness an upmove towards 12,000-12,103, while on the downside, major support remains at 11,850 and then 11,780 levels.

On the monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest was at 11,900 followed by 11,800 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,100 strike. We have seen meaningful Call writing at 12,000 and then 11,950 strike while minor Put writing was at 11,850 and 11,800 strike. Option data suggests a trading range between 11,800 and 12,100 levels.

India VIX fell 0.72 per cent to 14.87. VIX needs to continue to hold below 15 to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty corrected by 0.76 per cent and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. The index, which concluded the week with a marginal gain of 0.33 per cent, formed a Doji candle on the weekly scale. It continued to make higher highs and higher lows for the sixth consecutive week, and thus the overall trend remains positive. Till the time, it sustains above 30,800, we maintain positive stance for an upside momentum towards 31,500–31,800, while next support is below 30,800 is placed at 30,350.

Nifty futures fell 0.51 per cent to 11,913 level. Builtup of long positions were seen in Zee Entertainment, Equitas, Eicher Motors, Bosch and HDFC, while shorts were seen in Infosys, Hexaware, Wipro, Ambuja Cement and TCS.

13,2018-11-23,Eicher,"I would avoid RBL from the current prices but IndusInd could be a good trading bet to go long from the current levels., says Rahul Shah, VP, Group Leader-Equity Advisory Group, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 


ET Now: What do you make of the markets in the last few weeks?
Rahul Shah: The markets have been obviously in the grip of bulls and we have seen that participation coming across-the-board rather than being skewed towards one or two sectors. Earlier, only financials used to be performers but now, there is a broader participation. It looks like whenever we see a broader base participation, the rally lasts for some more time. 

We saw pharma, autos, NBFCs and a few select pockets bouncing back. Auto and financials also outperformed. The broad-based rally is likely to continue for a while.


ET Now: What do you make of the Zee news?
Rahul Shah: The hangover about promoters defaults go on. This saga has been going on for quite some time. Obviously post this, we saw a good bounceback in the stock. Now, the biggest challenge for the company is corporate governance and how they are going to manage going forward. But in the near term, the stock has rallied as far as it could. I would not buy it at this point of time. In case I have it, I would just ride it .


ET Now: What is your view on the way the telecom names have turned around? Do you think telecom as a pack including Reliance would be a part of your core holding?

Rahul Shah: If you look at the entire play, there is value at some price. That is what we saw in the entire telecom pack last week, post momentum building up in a lot of stocks. Obviously, the top of the mind is Bharti. It looks quite convincing. If I need to play telecom business, then I would definitely bet on Bharti from current levels vis-à-vis others. Reliance also looks good but my sense is that Bharti would be outperformer, if I have to play pure telecom.

ET Now: What do you make of the comeback in names like RBL? Could you include IndusInd Bank in that? Some of the banking and NBFC names that had people worried are slowly and steadily, seeing some interest in the market?
Rahul Shah: Last one year has been very eventful and especially in NBFCs and a few private banking stocks. IndusInd Bank looks quite interesting in terms of valuations and way they have performed in the last two quarters. IndusInd can see some more of upside from current levels. Obviously, the stock has underperformed big time vis-à-vis other private sector banks. 

Again in case of RBL, I feel the way the stock has performed, the upside is quite limited. So, I would avoid RBL from the current prices but IndusInd could be a good bet to go long from the current levels.


ET Now: Any ideas that you would like to share?

Rahul Shah: The financials and a few corporate banks look interesting. Among PSU banks, the State Bank of India looks very attractive at current levels. 

Secondly, insurance as a theme has played very well and there could be some more upsides in select insurance players like SBI Life from the current levels. The stock has corrected from recent highs. We have been liking SBI Life and in auto pack, Eicher could be a good bet from the current levels. We have been recommending these two-three names to our clients."

The 30-share BSE Sensex added just 2.71 points to end at 40,359 for the week ended November 22. The 50-share Nifty gained 19 points to 11,914.

Here are the top stocks and sectors that created all the buzz during the week gone by.

Gayatri Projects lost 36 per cent, followed by Reliance Capital (23 per cent), Reliance Infra (22 per cent), Indiabulls Integrated Services (18 per cent) and Time Technoplast (15 per cent). Caplin Point, Reliance Power and Jain Irrigation were among other stocks that fell over 10 per cent.


IPO update: CSB Bank sails on Day 1
Kerala-based CSB Bank’s IPO got fully subscribed on the first day of bidding on Friday. The initial public offering (IPO) received bids for 1,20,87,450 shares against the total issue size of 1,15,54,987 shares, reflecting 1.05 times subscription, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange. The quota reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed 10 per cent, while that for retail investors was subscribed 5.60 times.
In another development from the IPO-mart, realty firm Puranik Builders has filed fresh papers with markets regulator Sebi to raise an estimated Rs 1,000 crore through its initial share-sale.


Telecom stocks ring louder
With a 7.85 per cent rally, the BSE Telecom index emerged the biggest gainer on the exchange. It was followed by Healthcare (up 3.06 per cent), Power (up 0.97 per cent), Metal (up 0.82 per cent) and Bankex (up 0.16 per cent). On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”


Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.
Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team. However, on the other side it added that net cash in the balance sheet fell to Rs 1,480 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 3,240 crore in Q4FY18.


Other Nifty’s top gainers/ losers

Bharti Airtel (up 7 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 6.82 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 6 per cent) were among other major gainers in the 50-share pack. On the other hand, Mahindra & Mahindra, YES Bank, Britannia Industries, TCS, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp declined between 4-6 per cent during the week.

RIL nears Rs 10 lakh cr valuation
The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark helped by the continuous rise in its share price. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike. With a market value of Rs 9.80 lakh crore, share of the company signed off the week with gains of over 5 per cent at Rs 1,546."

Major trend of the Nifty is positive as declines are being bought into, but Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035, and then a lifetime high of 12103, according to technical analysts. They are bullish on HDFC, RBL Bank, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE, Maruti Suzuki and L&T.


Where are we: Nifty has been consolidating in a range of 250 points in between 11800 and 12038 zones from last 16 trading sessions. It witnessed some profit booking from higher levels in last two sessions but forming Doji candles for third consecutive week, indicating a tug of war between Bulls and Bears. However major trend of the index is positive as declines are being bought into but requires a decisive range breakout with follow up action to commence the next leg of rally.


What is in store: Now Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035 then life time high of 12103 while on the downside major support exists at 11800-11780 zones. Bank Nifty is outperforming from last couple of weeks and till the time it sustains above 30800 mark, we maintain our positive stance for an upside momentum towards 31500 then 31783 zones while next support below 30800 is placed at 30500-30300 zones.

What traders can do: Nifty has got stuck in a range where declines are bought but follow up is missing so better to use Bull Call Spread or Call Ladder Spread with the view that positive to range bound bias could continue. Aggressive option traders can do the short strangle or Call writing to get the benefit of time decay. On stocks, we have a positive view on HDFC, Bosch, Eicher Motors, RBL Bank, Exide Industries, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE while weakness is likely in Infosys, TCS, Petronet and Havells."

17,2018-11-26,Eicher,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Tuesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 19 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.


• HSBC has maintained buy rating on 
Reliance Industries and raised target price to Rs 1700 from Rs 1565. The brokerage has rraised target price to factor in expectations of higher earnings for both Jio and Retail business. The stock is trading at an FY22 estmated EV/EBITDA of 8 times, similar to its 10-year historical average, said HSBC. Steady earnings momentum with emerging signs of a strong outlook for both the telecom and retail businesses and an inexpensive valuation drive the buy rating, said HSBC. The stock ended up 0.9 per cent at Rs 1560.70 on Monday.

• Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on 
Dilip Buildcon and lowered target price to Rs 504 from Rs 772. Interest remains low in road EPC stocks as NHAI ordering has been slow, but risk reward is attractive, said Morgan Stanley. Dilip Buildcon is focussed on improving execution in the second half and reducing debt, said Morgan Stanley. Given its diversified and large order book, Dilip Buildcon has reasonable earnings visibility, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.3 per cent at Rs 410.95 on Monday.


• Kotak Securities has retained add rating on 
Greenply Industries and lowered target price to Rs 172 from Rs 187. Greenply reported healthy earnings growth on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter led by expansion in operating margins and benefit of low tax rate, said Kotak Securities. Plywood volume growth in the quarter was low at 2 per cent, said Kotak Securities. Management expects revenue in 2HFY20 to grow by 8-10 per cent YoY, translating into FY20 revenue growth of 7-8 per cent, the brokerage said. The stock ended down 0.5 per cent at Rs 160.30 on Monday.

• CLSA has maintained outperform rating on 
Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 24000. Meeting the BS6 emission norms remains a key nearterm product focus, but Royal Enfield intends to intensify launches subsequently, said CLSA. A big network expansion is underway in India, and Royal Enfield is looking to build on the recent traction in exports, it said. The stock ended up 2.1 per cent at Rs 23267.60 on Monday.

• Credit Suisse has maintained neutral rating on 
Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of Rs 500. Unit IV will likely require a re-inspection to resolve Form 483 observations and, therefore, approvals from Unit IV may be stuck for at least one year, said Credit Suisse. Unit IV accounts for 30 per cent of the pending ANDAs, which typically have higher margins, it said. Almost half of pending ANDAs could now be stuck with a warning letter on Unit XI and Form 483 on Units VII and IV. Next key catalyst is completion of the Sandoz deal, it said. The stock ended up 2.7 per cent at Rs 440.45 on Monday."
18,2018-11-26,Eicher,"CLSA has maintained outperform rating on Eicher Motors in the long term with a target price of Rs 24,000. The stock ended up 2.1% at Rs 23267.60 on Monday while the BSE Sensex closed 529.82 points up at 40,889.23.


Company Financials

 For the quarter ended 30-09-2019, the company has reported consolidated sales of Rs 2171.54 crore, down -8.03% from last quarter sales of Rs 2361.24 crore and down -9.34% from last year same quarter sales of Rs 2395.22 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 564.39 crore in the latest quarter.

21,2018-11-27,Eicher,"This time, sectors which were underperforming have also given good gains like metals from recent lows of 20% or auto ancillaries, select NBFC names as well as telecom. Among auto, two-wheelers are more promising and Eicher and Bajaj Auto are the two picks, says Rahul Shah, VP, Broking & Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 


Nifty at an all-time high, economic indicators are at an all-time low. What are you telling your clients – focus on the economy and book profits or focus on the market and start buying more because momentum is strong? Momentum versus economy or momentum versus data points, which data points are you focussing on?
As you said, economic data have been disappointing but that was forecast a quarter ago. We had anticipated a slowdown and there could be more pain in the economy. Post that, the government has made announcements for the economy. We believe the downturn is going to be behind us in the next couple of months or so.

We would continue going with the markets and this time, the participation has been broad-based and it is not just about sticking to a few select names which we have seen earlier. The sectors which were underperforming have also given good gains like metals from recent lows of 20% or auto ancillaries, select NBFC names as well as telecom. All these sectors have made good gains from lower levels. 

It is a broad-based market and it is going to continue and quality which is performing will still keep on performing. There could be some more upside on the markets from the current levels.


From market standpoint, now Zee problem is solved and Yes Bank, hopefully. will be able to raise capital. These are the hanging swords. Do you think these issues have been sorted out? What does it mean for the rest of the sector?Definitely, it looks like things have been sorted out. We saw Zee do it. Most probably, even YES Bank will be able to do it and because of that, we have seen the upside also. The stock has rallied also from the lower levels. I do not see much major upside in the stock.

Secondly, a very important aspect is corporate governance for these companies. I still do not have any better view on the entire pack. There could be a bounce back in the stock. But I would really exit the stock in this kind of rally. 


What is your call on auto? Would it still be a little cautious or would you be looking at value buys?We would definitely be looking at a value buy. We saw the first round of runup as most auto stocks ran up 15% to 20% from their recent lows. Now, only the stocks which have value and have good fundamentals in terms of valuation, would go up. Two-wheelers look more promising in that space. Eicher is the one what we have been liking. Second is Bajaj Auto. In terms of the valuation, these look very attractive. These two stocks could see some more upside from the current level.


As a firm, you track RBL very closely. If one works with the assumption that they will be able to raise capital, what happens next?If I look at the valuations, then it is all done at this point of time. If they are able to, then we will see some kind of runup in the stock. There could be a good run up for another 10-15% or so. But that is it. I do not think so major upside is coming in RBL Bank from the current level. I would avoid building any positions in RBL from current prices."
22,2018-11-28,Eicher,"We are allocating 30-40% in trend/momentum/higher valuation stocks; 20-25% odd on contra bets and about 25-30% in historically good performing stocks facing growth pressures, says Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The massive move in ICICI Bank following the increase in MSCI weightage is now finally over, but the stock is up 40% this year. How much further can it go up in the near term?One way is to look at some other stocks from some other sectors. FMCG is the top of the mind. If we look at the performance of the stocks from those sectors, beginning 2019, there were lots of discussion on how the FMCG sector has had 3-4 years of outperformance and that 2019 will probably not be the year for FMCG. But today, at the end of the year, we see 2019 again was the year of FMCGs along with some others. 

About 12-14 months ago, ICICI Bank was at a stage wherein all the negative news had been built into its price and valuations, its financial performance. The stock price by then underperformed for almost two and a half years, based on various developments. It has come out from there, so that is one part. 

The other part is, today we are in a market where over the last one-and-a-half-year, corporate governance issues have been coming more and more in focus. As a result, for any investor -- be it global or domestic -- who is cautious about these issues, the investible universe is continuing to shrink.


Your life should be easy if the universe of investing is reducing! All you need to do is bother about 15 stocks. It has never been great for fund managers this year. Where would you go if you want to get out of those 15 stocks?Let me also now throw in my spanner. Over the last two months, Nifty rose 10% but none of the traditionally performing stocks have contributed to business.


Reliance has added.Reliance is an exception.


HDFC Bank has added. ICICI Bank has added.Let me give you some numbers.Some of the stock names that I am taking are with the disclosure and are not investment recommendations. Sun Pharma and Cipla have roughly moved 20% in the last two months. Reliance has been one outperformer. Auto stocks rose 30%. Tata Motors is one of the underdogs. Within banking, we have completely different set of stocks. YES Bank, ICICI and SBI are historical laggards. So, life is not that easy. Last two months have been difficult but over the medium term, it could probably come back to being easy.


What do you do at Rs 500 plus levels on ICICI Bank?I am still positive. We have not bought recently but we have been holding it in some of our clients portfolios.


You are not taking profits anywhere?Not right now.


It does not matter whether it is momentum or liquidity, if prices are going higher, NAVs will go higher. How do you invest in this market when growth is bad and the economy is not recovering, flows are strong and markets are at an all-time high? If you take a view on the economy, you cannot be bullish but if you take a view on the flows, you cannot be bearish!That is a very big dilemma that we face as money managers. I am sure everybody else faces it including retail investors. Sometimes you have to take the trend as an indicator. The market is telling that at the end of the day, there is one way of looking at the market and that price is God. If you take that as a hypothesis and try to analyse the July, August, September data (I have not got October data), the government expenditure has gone up. July was roughly 25% up over last year July; August was 30% up and September 35% -- both capex and opex. That probably is indicating something. 


On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence. It is difficult to justify. That makes it difficult to make money in the market.-Kunj Bansal
If the government has continued a similar expenditure in October and November, it is a matter of time that the secondary effect -- the cyclical effect of that money flow will come into the economy and things will start easing out. So that is one way to look at it. 

The second way is smart money is always ahead. The market moves at least six months ahead of what developments we are able to see as analysts or fund managers or when actual numbers come. As an investment strategy, what I am doing or what we are doing is nothing particular; but very broadly speaking, 30-40% are plays in trend/momentum/higher valuations; 20-25% odd are contra bets, say into auto and auto ancillaries. About 25-30% we are trying to play in historically good performing stocks which have faced growth pressures in the last five-six quarters because of the environment but as a result valuations are relatively cheaper. On an absolute basis you have to take a medium to long-term call.


TVS and Hero MotoCorp and Eicher in last two years would have given terrible returns. It is 36% lower for TVS Motor and 24% lower for Eicher.Let me throw in some additional numbers. Coincidentally, it was not in auto but related to it -- auto ancillaries, more specifically tyres. A similar divergence has been there if we look at five-year numbers. On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence to add to your OEM manufacturers numbers. It is difficult to justify. That makes investing very difficult and makes it difficult to make money in the market. 

Having said that, obviously some of the factors which have worked and what works for Bajaj Auto is export. Also the fact that management was very clear that at the expense of margin, at the expense of doing some discounting sales, they would focus on top line, on volumes. I do not know about the exact market share they have gained but very clearly, it worked in their favour.


Should one subscribe to the SBI Card IPO?I have not looked at the numbers in detail. Let us look at the two other IPOs. CSB Bank IPO closed recently and it was 87 times subscribed.


For a Rs 400-crore, they got Rs 4,000 crore.Where is the risk averse mindset and where is the lack of liquidity? We are going to have the Ujjivan Small Finance IPO. I am not sure if that will attract a similar kind of subscription, interest or over subscription. The reason being that today anybody -- whether a consumer who is buying goods or services in the market or an investor -- is telling me give me a good deal and my money is here. Quality should be there and value should be there. Price offering, valuations should be there. Now, that was not exactly the case with CSB Bank whose financials are not as great, but the brand name of the promoters, partly the valuation got it that kind of subscription. 

Coming to the SBI Card IPO, I still have to look at the numbers in detail but if the financial numbers are reasonably good and valuation offered is cheaper, the market is desperate for opportunities to invest. So, we should see that kind of investment.


What do you do with YES Bank? They are all set for a mega fund raising of about $1.2 billion.Something should come out now. It is high time. Because we have had the names of the sundry Tom, Dick and Harry but nothing has come till now, which is unfortunate. It should not become a story of crying wolf too many times because then the market will really be disappointed. Market has given YES Bank a benefit of doubt and has brought the share up from Rs 25-30 to almost Rs 70 today. Without any concrete development, the stock will be brought down equally fast. So let us see. 

But if we have some concrete names, some actual action on money coming in, around the current levels, YES Bank will have its floor price. From here to go up, we will continue to need developments and announcements in terms of the next one, two, three, four quarters’ financial numbers, some improvement in business, some reduction in divergence with RBI’s audit, NPA control and all those things. But the basic requirement is that capital should come in."
23,2018-11-29,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Boards of Indian companies are slightly bigger and more independent than they were five years ago. However, they lag the global trend on independence.

The median number of directors on boards of 87 of the BSE 100 Index companies stood at 11, with 53.3% members being independent, data from Bloomberg show.

Five years ago, the median number of directors stood at ten, with 50% members being independent. Ten was found to be the most common board size for India Inc, with 50% being the most common proportion of independent directors on board.

India Inc is in line with America Inc on the board size but not on independence. As per the Spencer Stuart 2018 S&P 500 Board Index, the average S&P 500 board had 10.8 directors, with 85% of the boards being independent. The range of board size is wider in India — from four to 22 — whereas S&P 500 boards range in size from five to 18 members. In 2018-19, L&T had the biggest board with 22 members, half of whom are independent. The company had a 14-member board in 2014-15.



Incidentally, five of the top ten companies having the biggest boards are public sector undertakings (PSUs), with power generation company NTPC having the biggest board with 18 members.

Most PSUs have seen a significant increase in the board size, but not necessarily accompanied with a corresponding increase in their independence. While the Companies Act 2013 provides for a maximum limit of 15 directors on board of a company, a company may appoint a higher number by passing a special resolution.

Incidentally, for majority of the companies the size of the board doesn’t have much relation to its independence. While L&T, with its biggest board, has half of its members as independent directors, Eicher Motors, with the smallest board size of four directors in FY19 had three-fourths of its board independent.

The Companies Act mandates one-third of the board to be independent. Both Dr Reddy’s Labs and Maruti Suzuki have 12 members each on their respective boards, but the former has the most independent board with 83% of its directors being independent and the latter (along with Petronet LNG) has the least independent board with one-third (the mandatory limit) of its members being independent.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries figures among the list of BSE100 companies with the smallest boards, with eight directors, as well as being among the least independent one, with 37.5% independent directors.

Analysts are divided on whether the board size and independence influence a company’s performance. While the agency theory (directors as agents of shareholders on the board) and the resource dependency theory (directors providing direct or indirect access to resources) suggest a positive relation between board size and firm’s performance, the stewardship theory (directors act as stewards maximising shareholder interest) hints at a negative relation between the two and favours a smaller board. The optimum size of a board has been pegged at 8-10 directors."

0,2018-12-01,Eicher,"Bullish on ITC among largecaps, Tata Elxsi in midcap IT and Eicher Motors in auto, Rahul Shah, Motilal Oswal Financial 
   
   
   Services, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


What changed in November that made Nifty rally 800-900 points?
We have seen the dollar. We have seen oil. We have seen bond yields. So all three things put together pushed up the market. It should continue till the time all the macros have been taken care of. 

I do not see any reason for the market to correct near term. For more than a month and a half we have not heard anything negative. We have seen the RBI operations -- OMOs as well as policy matters being taken up. So they have been in sync with market requirement. 

Now the only thing people are questioning is the result of the assembly elections. That is a week ahead. If macros are placed well, I do not think any other things are going to bother the markets much in the near term.


What is the sense that you get in terms of flows? Do you think that FII flows are turning positive? 
As I said, if the macros improve, flows can improve. FIIs have been sellers since last six-eight months and we have seen a huge outflow but things have started improving. Obviously, there is some kind of money to be invested at this point of time and a lot of opportunities. In terms of valuations, a lot of stocks look attractive. 

We have seen flows coming in. FMCG and tech which are doing well are where they are focusing. There is no reason for FIIs not to put in money as of now.


The IT sector did particularly well this week. TCS was up almost 8-9%. What is your call on that sector?
We have seen a fantastic runup in last one year and all IT stocks have done quite well and obviously they are backed by good numbers that should continue. This quarter, the results are also good for IT. By and large, the management commentary is in line with what they predict. In my view, the IT results were good. 

Going forward, I do not think there should be any problem. There will be more conviction in sectors with earnings visibility. The IT pack is least affected by any other noise that we hear other than the marco and political factor. IT will continue to do well. Largecap IT remains a sweet spot still. My view is TCS, Infy amd HCL Tech should all do well, going forward from here also.


Week after week, Airtel or Idea have been coming in the top losers’ list. This week is not different despite markets doing pretty well. What is your view on the telecom pack? Could you even include Reliance in that list?
I would stay away from this underperforming sector. These two stocks have been underperforming for the last two years. I would avoid Bharti and Idea. Reliance looks interesting and should be give another 15% to 20% return for positional traders.


How important will this RBI meet be?
Whenever RBI comes, there are a lot of questions in people’s mind about what is going to happen next, whether a rate cut can be expected. Inflations are under control, bond yields have cooled off and some action in terms of rate cut can be expected. 

The markets have been rallying and in case of a rate cut, we can expect the markets to rally more. It is important for investors and as well as traders to understand what RBI has to say.


What will be your call on the real estate pack? Should one start to look at real estate names selectively?
I would still avoid. There is enough opportunity in the markets in the other sectors rather than playing in sectors which have underperformed for quite some time. In the bull market also, real estate stocks did not perform. I am not so keen on them and I do not recommend any of the real estate stocks to add at this current level.


Any picks for our viewers?
In largecap space, in the FMCG pack, ITC looks very convincing in terms of valuations. A 10% move from here could be a positional trade. 

One should look at tech stocks also. Midcap IT has underperformed for quite some time now. Tata Elxsi from that pack looks convincing. In auto space, Eicher Motors is one which has also underperformed. So these are the few ideas which I feel could be good bets at current market levels."

Eicher Motors: Royal Enfield, the two-wheeler division of Eicher Motors, Monday reported a six per cent drop in sales to 65,744 units in November.The automaker sold 70,126 bikes in November 2017, the company said in a statement."
1,2018-12-04,Eicher,"The Royal Enfield motorcycle has always had an impactful presence on the Indian roads. And the equity shares of Eicher Motors, which makes the iconic machines, have dominated the automotive space in the past decade, outrunning massmarket bike-makers Bajaj Auto or Hero MotoCorp in wealth creation.

That lead, measured by way of conventional valuation premium, is narrowing fast and has slipped below long-term averages. Eicher’s valuation premium over mass-market bike-makers stood at 35.7 per cent, compared with the five-year average of 75 per cent, data compiled from Bloomberg showed. In the past three years, the valuation premium has been consistently falling, in line with Eicher’s moderating profit expectations. Eicher trades at 23.4 times based on the next 12-month earnings, while the average PE for mass bike-makers is 17.23.

To be sure, the market capitalisation of Eicher Motors is $9.2 billion: It is 33 per cent higher than that for Harley Davidson.

Royal Enfield volumes climbed 9 per cent between April and November, a period in which the bike-maker had to weather the floods in Kerala and industrial action at one of its factories. Kerala makes up about 11 per cent of RE’s total volumes, while it lost around 28,000 units due to the strike. The company later cut its production guidance to 925,000 units for FY19, compared with 950,000 earlier.


The revised guidance suggests Eicher expects a 13 per cent YoY volume growth in the second half, while the consensus estimates point to 9-10 per cent growth. So, FY19 EPS estimates for Eicher have been reduced 7 per cent since the beginning of April 2018, while the projected earnings for mass-market bikemakers remain largely unchanged."
3,2018-12-05,Eicher,"At the first sign of upturn, the IPO guys would be coming in, the PE guys would want an exit and that is the time where you 
  
  
  can get some good companies, Basant Maheshwari, Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Is this a good market where you should get greedy or should one not get greedy and accept that volatility is back?
The market right now is one where you have to protect your skin. We have seen a lot of issues over the last 45- 60 days and people who have survived that should actually be not on the back foot in that sense. But you cannot be adventurous in this kind of a market, especially with six months to go for the election. I am not saying that we are going back to October like situation and the worst is behind us but don’t expect the market to do any heroics or give us anything on a platter for the next four, five six months till the elections are there.


You believe the best and the worst of the market is behind us. I understand that the worst is behind given how crude markets have behaved but why the best, do you not believe that we are likely to see those previous highs again or for that matter even build on them further?
I think two things; first the best is contingent on who comes to power in May next year. I think the present government would be voted back but before that I do not see any magic happening. Globally our problem is when US does very well, nobody wants to invest in India and when US does not do well, we say oh, there is a global slowdown. So we have to actually pray to God that the US does only so well and not very well or not very badly. It is quite a complicated thing. 



On the side note, you should invite Donald Trump to one of your show. He is the best guy to tell you about the best and the worst. He handles the entire global market capitalisation through the Twitter account. It has become so difficult for anybody to take a guess as to what is going to happen. But on a serious note, good companies, the fundamentally strong ones growing at 25-30% will do well but there is only a handful of them. There are just 15-30 such companies in India and they are not cheap. Except for that, it is going to be tough.


With the risk of elections coming in 2019, how should one prepare their portfolio for the volatility that may come by? 
The market is already preparing for that. A stock like Hindustan Unilever goes and hits an all time high, consumer names are doing well; FMCG standard names are doing well; the private banks are again back in the vogue. 

The market is telling you that people want to invest but they want to be invested in areas where there is lesser risk of capital erosion. And because 80% of the money always remains in the stock market, it is the incremental 20% that creates a bull phase and a bear phase. It is that 80% which is now deciding to switch into stronger and more stable names. They are not the fancy ones where you can say this one is going to do well or grow at 40% or it looks cheap on a DCF basis but that’s about it. 

The writing on the wall right now looks to be consumer, FMCG, high pedigree expensive stocks, areas where you can after six months say okay I had put in 100 and at least I am still left with 95-97. That is the trend and the trend to create real magic is not now, not especially in the last year of the elections. There are so many things moving; the Fed suddenly says we will pause the rate hikes. RBI can provide one trigger if it cuts the CRR today. The crude is down, we are okay on dollar, the Fed has indicated that it might not be so aggressive in raising rates. So what stops the RBI from cutting down rates? The inflation is falling and we need not be so textbook oriented all the time! There is a time to think out of the box and that time is now.


You have a strong association with NBFCs. What are the NBFCs you still own and which are the ones you do not own? Historically you have owned HFCs and retail dominated NBFCs.
We own the top-notch NBFC in India and we have owned it for a long time now. That is still above the January level. Above the March level, that is down 15% from the top. We bought lots of it when the markets were cracking. Actually we own just two NBFCs and one of them is Bajaj Finance. It is not a recommendation but we own it till our neck and we think this is going to capture market share in the next three-four years. So, you can be bullish on NBFCs, you can be bullish on private banks but you do not have to own all the NBFCs. 

When a situation like this comes up, the leader gains market share because the raw material for the second line and the third line players would not be coming and the raw material for these guys is the cash that they borrow. Even if the raw material comes, the yield on that raw material would be 10%, 9.8%, 10.2%. Obviously, the economics would not work in their favour. We are fine with what we own in the NBFC space.


We are still debating about the real estate recovery. HFCs are clearly not finding favour. Anything that has to do with housing is going through a slump.
We still own PNB Housing.. We have not quite added on to it but we still own it. We have owned it right from the IPO time. It went up and came down like stone but we still have it. It t is going to get sold and that is the bigger overhang. The overhang is about the HFC space being muddled in all that but the bigger overhang is about the stake sale. 

I hope it happens sooner rather than later. Once that happens, things should be fine. That is the hope at least.


The HUL deal has really got you. You believe that real benefits will come over the next two to three years. You are very bullish on HUL at Rs 1,700.
No. I am bullish on HUL as a company. It should do well as a stock if you want to take a punt. It has just hit an all-time high. You could make some money if you are a trader out there but if you are an investor, you better buy a company that sells the products of an HUL, which is a retailing groceries chain. That’s how we play it. 


You have bought quality between 2010 and 2018. It has seen an extraordinary run up. Do you think some of the expensive, good quality companies could enter into a long process of time-wise correction in the next two-three years and companies like D-Mart, Page, Asian Paints or Bajaj Finance just remain flat? 
Yes, they would but for that the growth has to really plummet. If a 30% growth company goes at 25%, the stock price does not come down because at the same time, the 15% guy is now growing at 10%. It is always a relative game. If you think that these companies would grow at a lower pace and these are the only companies that are going to be impacted by growth, then obviously the stock price will go into a sideways mode depending on whether the company is cash flow positive or cash flow negative. 

Everybody gives the grand example of Hindustan Lever not doing anything for 10 years from 2001 to 2011-12. During that period, the stock price held itself because the company used to deploy its free cash flow, it dividend payment and the dividend actually held the stock. But then we also have to understand that during those 10 years, Hindustan Lever found it very difficult to even grow at 10% CAGR. So obviously when the growth comes down, we will be the first one to jump off the ship. But then you own a stock only for what it does to you. Of course, the stock does not know that you own it but yes if it does not do well, you want to jump off the ship and move on somewhere else.


That growth is getting recalibrated. Look at Page Industries, Eicher Motors. Growth seems to be contracting and the stocks plummeting, In a matter of six-seven months stock ki hawa nikal gai?
That is true but who tells anybody to go and buy Page at Rs 36,000? There was a lot of time to buy Page. We bought Page in 2009. We sold out in 2015. I made 40x there. We bought it for Rs 350 and sold it at Rs 14,000. From 14,000, it went to 36,000 and now it is back to 25,000. I would not buy it even at Rs 20,000 or Rs 18,000 or Rs 40,000. It does not fit my criteria of buying a company which is growing at least 20%. Page initially was growing at 35%. Then it came down to 30%, then to 25,000, 22,000 and now it has come down to 12,000.

Look at HDFC Bank. Initially it was growing at 35%. From 35% it came to 30%, 30% came to 25-26%, 25-26% came to 22% and now it is at 18%. No recommendations. So growth for these kind of companies do not collapse from 40% to 10%. That happens within infra stocks because you do not get an order, because the Bharatmala is under threat, because something else has happened. 

In a capex driven company, growth can suddenly plummet from 40% to 10% or even minus 5%. It can also happen to a pharma company which is dependent on certain generics or certain molecules or whatever. But in a stable business, growth normally slips, it never plummets. 

As long as growth slips, you will have enough time to come out. I am not saying that most of the companies that we own are going to grow at this rate for the next five years, but the moment we see that the growth has started to slip, we will come out of it and buy something better maybe.


I know given how uncertain the next six months are going to be most of the primary market issuances have been delayed. But anything from the upcoming primary market issuances that you are particularly looking out for?
No, nothing right now. But Apollo Pharmacy should be looked at. It is a stable business, selling medicines and I think they are going to hive it off and come with an IPO. You want companies like that which are scalable. It is in extension of the retailing play, but it all depends on the price at which it comes out, the kind of growth they do.

When the markets are down, nobody comes with an IPO. But the real money is made buying IPOs if you can get a good one. So at the first sign of upturn, the IPO guys would be coming in, the PE guys would want an exit and that is the time where you can get some good companies. We will see when it comes."

7,2018-12-07,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The liquidity tightening that followed a crisis at Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services hit sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles sharply in November after recovering strongly over the past year from the twin impact of demonetisation and GST implementation. 

According to industry estimates, sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles dropped more than 20% last month, the sharpest decline since May 2017, when volumes fell by 33% to 16,716 units vehicles. Share prices of many commercial vehicle makers are now close to their 52 week lows. 

“There is a lot of control over banks and mutual funds lending to NBFCs after the IL&FS crisis. This has reduced loan availability to truck operators, limiting their ability to purchase vehicles,” said Vinod Aggarwal, managing director, VE Commercial Vehicles, a venture between Volvo and Eicher Motors.

VE Commercial sold 3,935 units last month, a 7% decline from a year earlier. Sales at market leader Tata Motors dropped 24% to 9,793 units last month, while Ashok Leyland’s sales dipped 18% to 8,718.




“November was challenging due to low consumer sentiments as a result of liquidity tightening in the market, higher interest rates and rising fuel costs,” said Girish Wagh, president (commercial vehicle business) at Tata Motors.

Additionally, a change in norms that allows commercial vehicles to carry more has affected sales.

“Sale of 100 trucks adds as much carrying capacity as earlier sale of 115-120 trucks. However, increase in freight demand is dependent on GDP growth, which has largely remained unchanged,” said Rajan Wadhera, president (automotive), Mahindra & Mahindra. “With freight capacity increasing at a faster pace than freight demand, there is downward pressure on freight rates and slowdown in truck sales.”

Mahindra’s medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales slid 20% to 637 units in November.

Industry executives said they expect demand to remain weak in the near term and improve somewhat in the last quarter. “We expect to see a rebound in the coming months as liquidity has started to ease and fuel prices have moderated due to reduction in global crude prices,” said Wagh.

“A lot of investments are being made in infrastructure projects, expected to fuel demand for construction trucks,” said Aggarwal.

“Q4 F19 may witness some revival due to the usual year-end increase in buying and thrust to government-led infrastructure projects and other spending,” concurred Wadhera. Mahindra expects demand to improve in FY20, ahead of stricter emission norms that come into effect in April 2020."
6,2018-12-07,Eicher,"The markets are going to be fairly volatile with a downward bias over the next year or two and investors should focus on value and capital protection, Girish Pai, Head of Research, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, tells ET Now. Within the midcap space, consumer durable stories like Whirlpool and IFB Industries and consumer discretionary stocks like PVR, Inox are good plays. In financial space, one should be very selective and City Union Bank can be considered.
Edited excerpts: 


Do you think the deal for select IBM products would add much excitement to HCL Tech stock price today?
Yes, it does. In terms of value accretion, I am not too sure in the immediate term because the IP story of HCL Tech has been playing out over the last three years or so, when they started acquiring assets from IBM in 2016. This is basically Mr Shiv Nadar, the risk-taker, coming into play. Ten years ago, precisely in December 2008, he bought Axon in a bidding war with Infosys. That was to add enterprise application solutions business. 

HCL Tech was largely an engineering and R&D services play and more an infrastructure services player. They added Axon and HCL Tech an outlier in the sense of investing such a lot of money in IP. With the latest acquisition, it would have probably invested close to $3 billion. But if I look at the return ratios that could potentially come through from these acquisitions, they are not too very high. 

My sense is probably it is a single digit to very low teen kind of a number versus the services business where the pre-tax ROIC is closer to 30-40-50%. To that extent, this is a business which is in its nascency. It is margin accretive but return dilutive. We need to see how this plays out. We still do not have clarity on some of these acquisitions that have been done in the past or whether they are actually adding value at this point in time. The growth has been fairly decent. Last quarter, the IP part -- mode 3 - grew about 10% quarter on quarter. Margins are a little better at 24-25% versus 19.5% for the company. It is a little early to say whether it is adding value. But yes, there is going to be a lot of excitement today on the stock. 


What is making the broader markets so nervous?
The markets are nervous largely because of global factors. Domestic factors have actually turned positive. Crude has come down from $75 level to sub-$60. The rupee has started to behave well. We have had 10-year yields come off from something like 8.2% to sub-7.5% . Domestic factors have been playing out fairly well in the last 10 days or so. 

The issue is to do with global situation. Global growth is a big factor. Over last 10 years, we have had very strong monetary stimulus from the US Fed, ECB and the Bank of Japan. As it has gone on for very long period of time, you just do not know where the bubbles have got built up and which will probably burst somewhere down the road. It typically does. You really do not know which asset class it is going to hit. You only know in hindsight.

The market is a little worried about what is going to be the collateral damage of those bubbles right now bursting on Indian markets -- be it from FII pulling back money from India, or earnings cuts that may probably come through for some of these companies going forward. 


As a house, what are the top two-three names from midcaps that you are recommending to your clients?
The markets are going to be fairly volatile with a downward bias over the next year or two largely due to global factors and not so much due to domestic factors. The key thought investors should have is value protection and protection of capital in one sense. 

We are leaning more towards consumer oriented companies. Within the midcap space, we like certain consumer durable stories like Whirlpool and IFB Industries. These are consumer electrical/consumer durable stocks. We like consumer discretionary plays like PVR, Inox. From a consumer discretionary standpoint, I would probably think these are slightly cheaper. 

Within the financial space, one should be very selective in picking up banks which have seen multiple cycles. So a City Union Bank,which is probably a 100-year-old bank, which has delivered you 1.5% plus ROA over multiple cycles, is a decent bet to take right now. 

Then one can look at autos selectively., I would not call Eicher a midcap company. We have to look at companies where we will not see a great deal of earnings crunch over this two- to three-year timeframe. While there could potentially be a PE multiple contraction, after this turbulent phase, the same PE multiples will probably come back up. 

Good play could be a consumer staple play where you could potentially see a big crunching of PE multiples in the next two- to three-year timeframe but the same multiples can come back up after this turbulence. So that is the kind of set of companies that we would want to invest in.


Is Eicher your big hope trade right now? What makes you so confident that growth will come back for Royal Enfield?
Growth has come down pretty substantially. The market has repriced its expectations on growth for Royal Enfield over the last many quarters and months now and that is reflected in the PE multiples that it is trading at. We believe that Royal Enfield can potentially deliver low teens kind of volume growth over the next two- to three-year timeframe because it has got the ingredients to do that. 

The installed base of two-wheelers in India is probably 80 to 100 million and there is an aspirational element to that. People want to move to the cruiser bike category. We think that that is a fairly small market share within the overall two-wheeler space and the other thing we believe is as Indians become slightly richer, they will move towards a cruiser bike situation. 

If you look at states like Punjab, Kerala or Goa, which are slightly more prosperous, one in three bikes sold are Royal Enfield bike. So as incomes go up, there is going to be a migration there. We believe that there is going to be the aspirational element to this 100 odd million bike install base so to speak right now who will potentially move up. So broadly these are the elements which make us believe that you will probably see a low teen kind of volume growth which should be among the best in the industry in our opinion.


Among the banking names, is your pecking order still the same? Should one stick to safer bets and not venture out?

Yes, being with the retail private financial banks would probably be the best strategy to go by right now. HDFC Bank, IndusInd should be our top picks out there. A lot of poison has been taken out of the system as far as the private corporate banks are concerned be it ICICI Bank or Axis Bank. I would think those are fairly good bets in the next one to two years. We have not actually seen any kind of meaningful corporate lending being done. 

Even if we go into a economic slowdown driven by global macro factors in the next couple of years, I do not think these companies are going to be impacted meaningfully. I would think that private corporate and retail banks represent fairly good bets. I would think there is more value in corporate banks right now. I am talking about ICICI Bank specifically."
8,2018-12-10,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Equity indices Sensex and Nifty took big blows on Monday on the eve of Assembly poll outcome on the assessment that the road for the ruling BJP in 2019 will be bumpy.

The results of elections of five Indian states are due on Tuesday. Exit poll results have already painted a picture of tough numbers for the BJP. 

A selloff in global stocks on growth worries and a flare-up of tension between the US and China made investors jittery. 

An upswing in crude oil prices after Opec and its allies agreed to cut production dragged the rupee lower, making the situation even worse. 

The Sensex crashed 714 points, or 2 per cent, to end at 34,959.72, with only Coal India (0.76 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki (0.49 per cent) holding up.

The NSE benchmark Nifty plunged 205 points, or 1.92 per cent, to close the day at 10,488.45, with five stocks - Indian Oil Corporation, BPCL, Coal India, HPCL and Maruti - going up. A total of 44 slid as Eicher Motors settled unchanged. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed 1.84 per cent down each, whereas the volatility index, India VIX, jumped 10.85 per cent. 

Let's take a look at highlights of Monday's session.



Rs 2.50 lakh crore knocked off!
Over Rs 2.50 lakh crore worth of wealth was gone on Monday's selloff as the cumulative market capitalisation of BSE listed firms plunged to Rs 1,37,92,970.08 crore from Rs 1,40,43,253.64 crore on Friday. 


Top drags on Sensex
Reliance Industries accounted for much of the Sensex weakness, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Infosys and Larsen & Toubro.

Nifty outlook
""The daily chart showed that the Inside bar pattern that was formed on Friday broke out on the downside today. Nifty has started forming lower top lower bottom on the daily chart, which confirms the downtrend. The weekly chart shows that the index is tumbling down as a follow through of a Dark cloud cover formation in the last week. All these observations suggest that the bears are having an upper hand on the index. In terms of the Fibonacci retracement, the Nifty has so far retraced 50 per cent of the November bounce. Subsequent level on the downside will be the 61.8 per cent retracement mark i.e. 10,362. The larger picture shows that the Nifty is poised to test the recent low of 10,005,"" said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, senior technical analyst of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas."

  Power and Ashok Leyland are doing well, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Can the momentum continue for the markets?
In a lighter note, let’s say 
Balle-Balle and let us hope 
Balle-Balle become triple. It has left all the bears on the side. There was a double whammy of state elections loss for the ruling BJP-led NDA government and a change of guard at the RBI. But there appears to be a Santa rally as we come closer to Christmas! 

Most of the event calendar appears to be over except for a Fed rate hike. But even the Fed sounds dovish. I would expect the global rally going into the new year and as I said, this time the Santa rally is coming closer to Christmas. 

The other notable change is the change of guard at the RBI with the new Governor sounding extremely positive on infusing cash. The IPP numbers, the bond yields, in the inflation data, all tell us that the market performer for this month should be midcaps -- particularly some of the NBFCs, banks and interest rate sensitives. 


Where are the opportunities where one could still invest and make money in this market?
There are two points. One, do not try and time the market. We are in a huge bull market, particularly in the Indian context. Retail flows have been the backbone of this market and they continue to be outperformers. Retail investor is not showing his back to the door. He is more positive on declines which is evident from the data on SIPs on a monthly basis. 

Secondly, do not look for the next three months because there will be an election in the next four months which may add to the volatility. Look at the next three years -- base effect of earnings, macros on the positive in the shape of oil, bond yields and a very positive momentum from the incoming government. 

Thirdly, India’s price-earning multiple will remain elevated because of the local flows which have been the biggest change of guard in the last two years of financialization of saving. 

Four-five good names in the largecap space would include a) L&T, which we think can be an outperformer on the back expansion in capital goods sector; b) Eicher Motor, where again the brand value and the resumption of positive data on interest rates easing for autos would be a big point; c) Axis Bank, where banking structure is leading from the front; and d) a metal play like Hindalco. The risk reward is extremely favourable in Hindalco. Globally, Novelis is outperforming and metal prices both copper and alumina are headed higher.

Coming to midcaps, Indiabull Housing is a beta play, given that most of the weakness on the recent change of events and the NBFC lending is over. We would look at CG Power which is very positive as they are divesting some of their Belgian and European assets. 

We would again be very positive on Dabur given that we think in the FMCG basket. Resumption of consumption spending would be very positive and among gas utilities, MGL has underperformed but is set now to outperform, at least in the near three months. 


Which is at the top of your list of midcaps this morning?
Indiabull Housing, MGL, CG Power and Ashok Leyland. The risk reward is extremely favourable and you have seen a quarter of hiatus because of the slowdown in NBFCs and the cost of funding. That is going to ease now. The businesses are doing well one should not look at the next three months. If one can look slightly longer term, then India becomes one of the best emerging market destinations.

The other double positive would be that a Santa rally is coming now much closer to Christmas. I am definitely seeing midcap outperformance and these stocks would be outperformers. As a disclosure we have had a buy on these stocks so you could take it that with a pinch of salt. 


How would you look at Reliance Industries in the wake of the Jio story and what they are doing with regards to restructuring some of the telecom related assets into separate companies? 
Not only eliance, I think pricing is coming back and Jio would definitely benefit. A disclosure. we have a buy on Bharti under Rs 285-290. We think the present trend of politics or the elections will unleash the largest consumption of data on social media and that means all the incumbents should be laughing their way to the bank given that pricing is back. Pricing is going to come back in this quarter and the volumes will both benefit. So for Jio and Bharti that would be win-win. 

For Reliance itself, given that some of the other businesses particularly are looking to divest shale gas which is getting a higher multiple, they are stabilising on their petchem and their GRMs which should be regular run businesses. Reliance will continue to be an outperformer in the large energy pack and all declines should be used to buy."

11,2018-12-13,Eicher,"The central government is expected to become more populist in the run-up to the 2019 general elections, as the ruling BJP will try to turn the tide in its favour after having losing three states in the Hindi heartland, analysts said.

They have started recommending investors to buy consumption stocks — specifically from FMCG, white goods, electrical & electronics and agro-chemicals sectors, and select financials — which typically benefit from populist government schemes.

“Our portfolio construction is biased toward large caps and also names with strong earnings visibility, resilience to macro risks and reasonable valuations — like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI, Maruti, HUL, Titan, Infosys, L&T and RBL Bank,” said Gautam Duggad, head of research at Motilal Oswal Securities.



Historical data suggest that both central and state governments boost spending in the run-up to general elections, but it fades post elections as the new government restrains spending.

“Given the adverse outcomes in the three key states, we believe that the BJP government at the Centre is likely to turn incrementally more populist ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,” said Duggad.

Ritika Mankar, analyst at Ambit Capital, said: “We find that top-line growth of four sectors, namely FMCG, media, agricultural inputs and auto, responds to this flow and ebb whereby revenue growth of these sectors tends to rise in the run-up to a general election and then slows.” Mankar advised investors to sell overvalued stocks in these sectors closer to the elections, as an expected uplift in revenue growth in these sectors in the second half of this fiscal year “is likely to be ephemeral”.

Markets historically have observed heightened volatility in months immediately preceding general elections. Adding to that are the existing global macro headwinds like trade war escalation, slowing global growth, US recession concerns, as well as worries over the central bank’s autonomy.

However, the government is expected to spend aggressively, pump-priming the rural economy as well as stimulating the SME sector and some of the beneficiaries of these spending are set to gain, according to analysts.

“Thematically, we believe the consumption space will outperform others, specifically FMCG, white goods, electrical & electronics, agro-chemicals and select financials,” said Dharmesh Kant, head of retail, IndiaNivesh Securities. Referring to local and global political and macroeconomic issues facing the markets, he said: “We think every scenario throws up opportunity for quality stock investment ideas.”

Infrastructure, which attracts large government investment, isn’t a favoured sector in the election season.

Implementation of poll promises would reduce the government’s fund availability for infrastructure, even as the private sector is yet to step up investment in the sector, CLSA said in a note.

“Consumption plays, particularly rural ones such as M&M, Colgate, Crompton Consumer, ITC, TTK Prestige, Zee, Eicher and Maruti should benefit from such handouts,” it said."

The Nifty is likely to encounter a key overhead resistance at 10,900-11,100 levels in the next couple of weeks, where one may expect emergence of selling from the highs, according to technical analysts. Among stocks, ABB, Godrej Consumer, Avenue Supermarts and Eicher Motors are likely to remain strong. Sectorally, IT and FMCG are looking strong, they said.

Where we are: The Nifty witnessed a small range candle in past two sessions of the week accompanied by small gains indicating minor consolidation just above the support of 10,750 levels. At the same time, the index is finding key resistance around 10,850 levels (previous down-gap of October 4 and swing lows of September). Previously, a lack of buying above this hurdle had led to a sharp weakness from the highs in early December.


What is in store: A long bull candle has been formed last week with a long lower shadow. Technically, this pattern is signaling a smart comeback of bulls from the lows. The Nifty is currently nearing an important overhead resistance at 10,915 levels (as per the concept of change in polarity). Another key hurdle is placed at 11,090 levels, which is 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of falling leg (taken from the top of 11,760-Aug18 to the bottom of 10,004-Oct 18).


What could investors do: The study of overall chart pattern as per daily and weekly timeframe is indicating limited upside from here. The Nifty is likely to encounter a key overhead resistance around 10,900-11,100 levels in the next couple of weeks, where one may expect emergence of selling from the highs. Hence, continuing long trading positions with strict stoploss or taking small profits on long trading positions is advisable. Beginning of weakness from the above said hurdles could result in Nifty falling all the way down to the 10,000 mark again, and this could possibly happen in the next 3-5 weeks. Sectorally, IT, FMCG are looking relatively strong and metal, realty, pharma and automobile are expected to face resistance at the highs. Therefore, they could be sold on every rise.

Where we are: The Nifty started the previous week in the red, but it managed to close 472 off the low. The Nifty witnessed a rising wedge breakdown and completed the retesting of the breakdown. The recovery during the last week has helped Nifty recoup about 50% of the loss of previous weeks. On a higher degree view on the weekly chart, the index has moved back into the rising channel after falling below it on intra-week basis. The weekly momentum indictor, RSI (14) is in bullish crossover and rising with a current reading of 50.80. On the daily frame, the Nifty in its recent action has reclaimed above 200 EMA. In addition, the index has floated back above 38.20% Fibonacci Retracement level of the previous fall from 11,760 to 10,000.


What is in store: The upward consolidation on the weekly chart, which started a few weeks back seems to be in force. However, the range has shifted from the 10,000-10,700 band to the 10,300-11,000 band. The larger trend may not be decisive as long as the consolidation continues.

However, usually an upward consolidation after sharp correction ends in breakdown of the lower bands. Going into the next week, 10400-11100 may act as trading range. Larger correction may take place in the market upon a closing below 10,400 in the next week. On the other hand, weekly closing above 11,100 may induce strong up move in the Nifty.


What could investors do: The Nifty may face selling pressure at 10,900–11,100 zone, these are the levels where some profit booking can be done. However, longs can be reinitiated upon a decisive breakout above 11,100, which eventually is 61.80% Fibonacci Retracement level of the fall from 11,760 to 10,000. Above 11,100, the Nifty may move towards 11,400-11,550. Among stocks, ABB, Godjret Consumer, DMart and Eicher Motor are likely to remain in the strength.

15,2018-12-17,Eicher,"Our understanding is autos are going to lead from the front. The metals pack is also showing a lot of promise, Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities, told ETNow.

Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Are you advocating buy through the close out of 2018?

Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been bullish on the market and proved correct and we are now closer to 11,000 rather than 10,000. All that pessimism is over. For the Indian market, the lesson of 2018 is buy the fear and sell the greed. There is still a lot of fear around and people are waiting for corrections. They have been caught napping if they have been tracking the other asset classes or the other indices where China is in a bear market and the US is having problem of its own. 

India becomes a sweet spot on the back that oil is in a bear market. We have got bond yields, rupee and most of the uncertainties on governance on the RBI over with. The next 3-4 months can be pleasantly surprising because we think earnings are going to be a catalyst, along with flows because we have again seen foreigners turn to buy. Locally, we have had the backbone of this market being the retail investor and the SIP. Put your money where your mouth is. I still think midcaps can outperform in the next few months and that is what we are advocating to buy, select midcaps in most sectors where outperformance is on the cards. 


ET Now: When it comes to Tata Motors, has the view now changed, with recent news coming in that they are looking at downsizing in order to turn profitable and getting in some serious cost control measures. Do you sense that Street would give this stock perhaps a rechance?


Sanjiv Bhasin: Like you said, most of the pessimism of autos may be in the price and if you are looking for elections and beyond, then relatively Tata Motors can outperform. The other caveat being if the pound in which they have an unhedged position starts to stabilise, you could see some mark to market return. But we still think autos are going to lead from the front. If I could select three names, it would be Bajaj Auto, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland is my dark horse because we think this month onwards before the budget they will see much of their inventory getting cleared and we think that the 15-year norm will change which will help them gain market share in MCV and LCV segments.


ET Now: Suppose from 10,000, there are a few sectors which have really done well and there are a few sectors which have not yet performed. Any churning you would recommend to portfolio holders or mutual fund managers where you feel that this sector has run up substantially, you do not see further upside from current levels which does not mean that you are negative on that space but there is more attractive sector now which has not done so far so good.


Sanjiv Bhasin: IT should be given an avoid unless you want to be in fully priced stocks where we do not think earnings will be a catalyst. But yes, if I could stick my neck out, I am very bullish on the metals pack. We think the pessimism is overdone, protectionism in US will see again 2019 being a very good year for results. Locally we have seen steel prices harden. The basket of JSW, Tata Steel, Vedanta and Hindalco is looking excellent. 

PSU banks are going to report very good numbers starting from State Bank, Can Bank, Indian Bank. Corporate banks are already leading from the front like Axis and ICICI and a Federal Bank if you can put the midcap basket. Autos I just suggested four names. I am very bullish on the gas utilities. MGL, IGL, GAIL all are looking excellent on the charts and so a whole host of stocks. As for power stocks, the CERC new guideline will be very very positive for some of the PSUs. I would be sticking my money on CG Power to be dark horse for 2019.


ET Now: Are you more bullish on the power space?


Sanjiv Bhasin: We have had our top picks and we have made money in that. If you recall, we were very bullish on the power financiers before the merger talk came. PFC and REC gave almost a 30 per cent return. We still think that today’s review petition is very very positive for the likes of NTPC and Power Grid. The only caveat here is that there is a government to manage its own balance sheet is seeing merger of some stocks to raise necessary cash.

In this power space, you can pick up some of the power producers or you can see some of the utilities. So Calcutta Electric looks very good to us. Reliance Infra has sold its arm to Adani Power so that could be another good play to be with, but our outperformer here would be a small company called CG Power which we think is selling some of the over leveraged assets in Europe and where return on equity could sharply improve in 2019."

18,2018-12-20,Eicher,"After the lowest quarterly sales growth in six years, Siddhartha Lal, alpha male boss of Eicher Motors, flew to Chennai, home of Royal Enfield (RE) Motorcycles, last November for a critical strategy meet.

With special guests from Google, Redbull, Maruti Suzuki and McKinsey, among others, the idea was to refresh and map the future. Over three days, Royal Enfield’s management discussed future mega trends with the help of McKinsey and a digital landscape through the eyes of Google. Vikaas Saxena and Avik Chattopadhyay, former marketing directors of Redbull and Maruti Suzuki, both did a walk-through on revitalising brand equity.

The preceding months had been high on testosterone. The company got rave reviews for its most ambitious global bet — the twin cylinder motorcycles to take on Harley and Triumph globally. Simultaneously, back home, it was grappling with slowing growth, changing regulations, irate customers and labour woes. 

Floods in Kerala also dented sales. While the core of management discussion was a longer-term blueprint, there were immediate issues such as a torpid topline and falling demand from wellpenetrated clusters to deal with. This — along with rising brand fatigue, lack of credible successes beyond the Classic range, concerns over cost of ownership, a steady price increase and, more importantly, customer acquisition challenges — was fast becoming a Molotov cocktail.





DELTA-V
The rise and resurrection of Royal Enfield from a fading icon to a global pin-up has been an amazing triumph of entrepreneurial chutzpah, ingenious strategy and an undying passion by the iconoclastic Lal, who breathes, lives and swears by the brand. In just a decade, under Eicher’s management, RE swung from a loss-making unit to the most profitable — based on operating profit margin — two-wheeler maker and a stock market darling. Even today, Eicher’s market capitalisation is 33% higher than Harley’s, at $9.2 billion.

However, over the last 18 months, even as new capacities were coming onstream, booking growth was slowing. The growing base was catching up. RE’s rise had woken bigger rivals Harley Davidson and Triumph. A couple of dozen new options have emerged in 150-500 cc space in Royal Enfield’s sweet spot, that is, Rs 1-3 lakh. The widening price gap between Enfield and its rivals is also affecting sales. While the likes of Hero and Bajaj employ an aggressive pricing strategy, new safety regulations that call for mandatory ABS have hiked prices at RE — almost `25,000 since May — making upgrading to Enfield a step too steep for many. Falling volumes in some states is a cause for concern, though RE continues to enjoy over 90% market share in the super-250cc segment.




Key states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra, which account for a third of RE’s sales, have seen a double-digit decline for several quarters now and may cause single-digit company growth for the first time in a decade. Walk-ins and enquiries are declining and conversion is stretched out, indicating systemic stress, a channel check by ET indicates. July-September same store growth was negative and new stores in towns and smaller cities — a largely commuter-dominated market — are barely making up for numbers. Same store growth was 15% and 10% in FY17 and FY18.

Moderation of outperformance has also diluted investor faith. Institutional investors such Capital Group and Teacher Insurance and Annuity Association of America have pruned exposure. Over the past year, share price too has slipped 25%, eroding market cap by a significant Rs 18,000 crore. To put it in perspective, this is equal to 70% of TVS Motor Company’s total market cap.

Mahantesh Sabarad, head, retail research, SBI Cap Securities, says RE hasn’t been able to keep up the excitement around its new products as a resistance to aggressive competition and category saturation, even though it is still in a position to take advantage of premiumisation. Stock has corrected but valuation derating is yet to happen, he cautioned. Eicher’s valuation premium over mass bike makers has come down to 35.7%, versus 75% of the last five-year average, and trades at 23.4x based on the next 12-month earnings while the average PE for mass bike-makers is 17.23.

Since the beginning of the second quarter of FY19, the industry has been hit by West Bengal Regional Transport Office rule change, floods in Kerala and Uttarakhand and insurance hikes running into the festivities, pulling down sales. It’s clear RE is no more a niche player and any kind of macroeconomic headwinds will have an impact, something dealers too can sense. A leading western India dealer says RE was insulated from big shocks such as demonetisation and BSIV, but not anymore. 

Earlier, it was a waitlist of months. Today, many dealers are sitting on 2-3 weeks of inventory. Clearly, operations need to change. “We can’t sit in the showrooms and wait for customers to come. It is an effort now. We have to engage in activities and advertise to draw new buyers,” says the dealer, requesting anonymity.




A strike at one plant led to production loss of 28,000 units in FY19. Yet, there was no major change in the order book, which highlights weak underlying demand. Lal, though, remains unperturbed as he terms slowing sales “short-term clouds” and assures that his view on medium- and long-term has not changed. “It’s normal for a business to have some ups and downs. We view business from a long-term perspective and keep improving. Of course, there are small clouds, which we are tackling. But, nothing that is insurmountable,” he says.


REBOOT & RIP IT UP
Lal, to be fair, is keen to hammer down and fire up the imagination and the road once again with new twin technical centres in the UK and Chennai, modern manufacturing facilities, fresh talent and field experts to guide them. “We are learning and improving every day,” he says.

The company that has been accused of lacking new model interventions will unleash at least a dozen motorbikes in next three to five years, which would mark “the new phase.” Lal is even ready to accede a gap in technology; hence, next generation models need to become the basis for future. While Twins was the first step to ensure Royal Enfield is seen as a serious player globally, he wants to equally focus on getting the J platform — a replacement of his bread and butter Classics – spot on.

But the company has not yet been able to fix the perception on quality and cost of service, feel experts, despite a cult following. The high-profile Himalayan launch was derailed by poor quality — oil leakage, gear shifts and steering issues — that stunted growth in the initial launch phase, leading to temporary shutdown of production. Some niggles were addressed with the BS IV variant, which has improved demand for the model, though nowhere close to target.

Lal, who spends 85% of his time at RE, has hired Japanese experts to address quality issues, which are getting fixed right at the design, development and manufacturing level. A rigorous 1,000-point checklist is now followed to ensure very high quality, say people in the know.

The company also brought McKinsey on board for richer forecasting and strategy and PwC for digital infrastructure and planning process while Accenture is already on board for a retail upgrade programme, ReCode. There is, however, a feeling that silos are being created and it is a challenge working with an MD who literally lives out of his suitcase. Company watchers claim phone calls and video conferencing is inadequate for a company of this scale. RE is moving its corporate headquarters to Chennai in the first half of 2019 for more cohesion between CXOs in management, manufacturing and engineering.

The game plan is to shift to a single integrated office before rollout the new generation J architecture, which will become the backbone o f its 350-400cc bikes in BS VI avatar. It is speculated that Lal himself may move back to India ahead of this. The shift has caused anxiety at various management levels, with at least a dozen experienced resumes already circulating in the market. With sales head Shaji Koshy likely to retire soon, RE roped in Vimal Sumbly, former head, Triumph India, who, many believe, is being groomed to take charge of Indian operations. Pankaj Sharma, formerly of Volkswagen, is set to take charge of international operations. Lal remains ostensibly unfazed by the chatter. “For us it is about nurturing products and brands,” he says.

Royal Enfield does not have the privilege of a global partner. It is a true homegrown company and it is facing a huge challenge in rollout of the BS VI version. The project is running late and may have an impact on volumes. Plans for global M&As also did not materialise after its 2017 pursuit of Ducati. But with a new management at its VW parent reviving plans of a portfolio pruning, many speculate the prospect could resurface sooner than expected. In the last five financial years, premium motorcycle segment 150-250 cc almost doubled in India. However, the 350-500cc segment was single-handedly driven by Royal Enfield, which grew more than 10 times to 8.33 lakh units. Now, close to a dozen new models are likely to hit the market from the likes of Harley, Triumph, Jawa and others.

While competition is intensifying, the trend of people moving up the price point and comfort actually puts Royal Enfield in a sweet spot. A senior executive associated with the company says the attempts to copy Royal Enfield will only help the brand. “Many players have attempted to challenge Activa or Splendor time and again, but both these brands have only grown and continue to rule their segments. I see the same thing with Classic,” says the executive on condition of anonymity.

Of the 20 lakh two-wheelers sold, just 4-5 models occupy 75% of the market while 40 other brands fight for the balance 25%. Thus, a single brand driving the show at a two-wheeler company is not peculiar. In note released in November, Brokerage Credit Suisse’s Jatin Chawla said, “We remain cautious about Eicher — as it is likely to be the worst impacted by regulatory cost increases — and cut volume estimates to factor in weak volume trends resulting in an 8-10% cut to our estimates.”

Kapil Singh of Nomura in a note post September quarter results said the key risk for Eicher is that competition in the 350cc segment is likely to increase sharply from FY21F, which could affect Royal Enfield. For instance, M&M plans to launch its cruiser motorcycle Jawa at year-end. Also, Harley Davidson has aggressive plans to launch 250-500cc motorcycles in India from 2020 and has already tied up with a key manufacturer in Asia. Additionally, Bajaj Auto will be launching the Triumph brand in this segment.


PASTA ROCKET VS GROCERY GETTER
With supply exceeding demand after a long time, new ways of reaching and getting customers is the key and the company needs to identify market growth enablers and bring in genuine product innovation to grow from here, feel experts. Back home, from being a weekend ride, the Enfield is now used for daily commutes. Even user age has come down to 25-35 over the last few years. With volumes approaching one million annually, Royal Enfield is entering a very sticky phase.

The dilemma is how to retain premium and yet maintain scale. “One thing is clear — RE will not run behind volumes,” says an old-time company associate. “It will aim to grow faster than the mainstream motorcycle market but not at any cost. Focus should be on building the category, the DNA, the engine and architecture without getting tempted into offering something others offer. We should wait for people to buy us, instead of going out and shouting, ‘Buy me buy me.’” “RE may well draw inspiration from luxury car companies that have a wide portfolio, yet form and character is very similar,” argues Alpana Parida, managing director, DY Works, a brand consulting firm.

Lal is clear he wants to be a creator. He reckons that to challenge someone in their stronghold is “very bloody” exercise the moment you ask about his plans to enter the high volumes 150-250 cc space. “Why should we go where other people are when we can grow the mid-size motorcycle market, which is at around 1.5 million? We help it grow to 10-15 million; that is where we want to be. Then what’s the way ahead? The twin cylinders bring Royal Enfield into a serious reckoning globally, but Lal knows it is long, hard, organic game that needs to be viewed with a 10-15 year horizon.

It is hoping the brand can evolve into Indonesia, Thailand and emerging Latin American market just like it did in India. Twins are likely to be an ideal upgrade option to over 2.5 million RE bikes sold over the last five years locally. Lal is hoping that what Classic did in 2008-09 for RE, Twins can do in the coming years. Two-wheeler expert Rishad Cooper is confident about Royal Enfield’s future. He reckons Twins are by far the best motorcycles made by RE yet. He says RE is on a good footing and the managing director himself has the right approach — willing to listen, learn and adapt.

Lal says RE is just getting started. In India, it has just 5-6% share and in the global markets, it is a minion, so the potential is huge. “We have capital, capability and brand knowledge. I don’t think anybody has the type of combination we have to what we want to accomplish. We would be fools to divert the attention,” he says. Not a detour perhaps, but Lal sure has plans for a wheelie."

The Nifty50 index failed to hold above its previous day’s high on Friday and witnessed sustained selling pressure throughout the session. It formed a Big Bearish Candle on the daily scale and an Inverted Hammer on weekly scale, which suggest the bulls are loosening their grip on the market.

The index lost the momentum of last six sessions and slipped towards the 10,750 mark. Now, if it sustains below 10,850 level, then the short-term trend could turn negative for a decline towards 10,650 level, while on the upside, a hurdle is seen at 10,850 and then 10,929 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put OI was at 10,000 followed by 10,700 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900. Meaningful Call writing was seen at 11,000 followed by 10,900 levels, which may restrict Nifty’s upside while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. The option band signified a trading range between 10,650 and 10,929 levels.

India VIX moved up sharply by 11.58 per cent to 15.99 mark. A rebound in volatility from lower levels is now restricting the market’s upside. VIX has to hold below 16 to get a bullish momentum, else it will be tough fight for the market.

Bank Nifty failed to hold above 27,350 and slipped towards 26,850 level. It corrected more than 400 points and formed a Bearish Candle on the daily scale and a Shooting Star on weekly scale. Now, it has to cross and hold above 27,000 mark to get some short-term stability and move towards the 27,250-27,350 zone, while on the downside support is seen at 26,666 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,769 with a loss of 1.91 per cent. Long buildup was seen in CG Power, Tata Global, HPCL, IRB and BPCL while shorts were seen in ITC, ZEEL, Eicher Motor, HDFC, Infosys and Shriram Transport."
21,2018-12-24,Eicher,"MUMBAI: The leading quartet of Indian auto — Maruti Suzuki, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter, Royal Enfield maker Eicher and Tata Motors unit JLR — were consistent outperformers in a crowded market in the past five years. But 2018 appears to have caught the big four in a slowdrive mode, prompting analysts to revise downward the prospects of these companies that are otherwise local benchmark-setters in their respective segments.

For the record, Maruti Suzuki, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India and Royal Enfield set targets of double-digit growth at the start of the year, and achieving those run rates then had seemed pretty certain. As the year progressed, rising fuel prices, insurance costs, and interest rates have combined to hold back growth to low single digits.

Jaguar Land Rover, or JLR, is facing challenges of a different kind, with slowing consumption from Beijing to Birmingham pulling down sales and margins.

JLR is likely to miss its 4-7 per cent EBIT margin (operating profit margin) target in FY-19, with a sustained fall in sales across key markets hitting both the topline and the bottom line. Given headwinds in the developed markets and in China, the company has reset its operating profit guidance to just breakeven level for the current year, while maintaining the 4-7 per cent EBIT margin over FY20-21.

In addition, the JLR management has initiated a one billion pound cost-reduction plan, which will be implemented over the next 18 months.

The Street is factoring in volume decline of 6-9 per cent in the current fiscal year, followed by increases of 4 per cent and 10 per cent in FY20 and FY21, respectively. So, the operating margins are estimated to be at the lower end of the company’s guidance of 4-7 per cent.

In the eight months of FY19, Maruti Suzuki has increased sales by 8.7 per cent to 1.20 million units. It needs to show average volume run-rate of 1.7 lakh units a month in the remaining four to achieve double-digit growth.

Royal Enfield expanded 9 per cent to 5.71 lakh units whereas Honda Motorcycle and Scooter grew by 4 per cent to 4.18 million units.

Maruti Suzuki has already revised its annual target to 8 per cent, although it pointed to a likely revival in demand in the coming four months. Maruti posted five consecutive months of flat or negative sales growth.

R C Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, said recently that the sales growth this year had also been affected due to the absence of a new model in the volume segment.

“With a new vehicle lined up for launch at the start of 2019, Maruti expects to capitalise on the potential demand and grow wholesale volume by 5 per cent in the fourth quarter, and close the year at 8 per cent, as against its initial target of double-digit growth,” Bhargava had said.

An email sent to Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India did not elicit any response.

The rising cost of ownership, supply disruptions, and liquidity constraints at non-finance companies have restrained auto volume growth for the greater part of the financial year.



Consequently, the volume growth forecast for the personal mobility segment is witnessing a 4-6 per cent cut compared with the estimates at the beginning of the year. The tapering of demand implies that margins will be under pressure, given higher discounts and elevated raw material prices.

Many vehicle makers announced customary price increases effective the next calendar year about 10-15 days before the year-end to push sales.

Growth in the passenger vehicle industry has not been very encouraging, especially based on August and October volumes, months where sales dropped 2 per cent. Growth year to date is around 6 per cent.

Analysts believe that Maruti Suzuki has been too conservative in increasing prices over the last one year despite very high capacity utilisation levels.

This indicates underlying demand was shaky. Given further moderation in the demand, it would be difficult for car companies to increase prices.

Kotak Institutional Equities has estimated that Maruti will increase prices nearly 1 per cent in the second half, thus leading to 70-80 bps cut in its EBITDA margin assumptions.

Two-wheelers companies, particularly those making higher-displacement vehicles, are likely to be the most susceptible to NBFC stress as a large share of incremental volume growth witnessed in the past five years was primarily funded by para banks.

NBFC financing in the past five years had boosted funding penetration, helping drive the sales of passenger cars, tractors, and commercial vehicles as well.

Royal Enfield has cut its production guidance to 925,000 units for FY19 after the September quarter results, compared with 950,000 earlier.

Analysts have already revised down the Royal Enfield volume growth to single digits from 15 per cent estimated at the beginning of FY-19.

The revised guidance suggests Eicher expects a 13 per cent YoY volume growth in the second half, while the consensus estimates point to 9-10 per cent growth. So, FY19 EPS estimates for Eicher have been reduced 7 per cent since the beginning of April 2018, while the projected earnings for massmarket bike-makers remain largely unchanged."

23,2018-12-26,Eicher,"From the launch of two motorcycle models and charting the way into new territories to a labour strike at the manufacturing facility — 2018 has been a mixed year for Royal Enfield. The man behind the brand, Siddhartha Lal, CEO, Eicher Motors, speaks to Nehal Chaliawala about the market reception of the new motorcycles and the Eicher Motors-owned company’s preparations to meet BS-VI emission rules when they kick in a little over a year from now. Edited excerpts:


How has the response been to your new twin-cylinder motorcycles?It has been absolutely exceptional. Better than what we hoped for, but not what we expected — let’s put it that way. From global media, Indian media, consumers, very few people don’t have amazing things to say, even if they are not into this style of motorcycles. They appreciate what we are doing, and they appreciate the finesse. Because, perhaps for all people, the term finesse is not what they use very closely with Royal Enfield. Fair enough. We are a bit old school. But, yes, this is the new Royal Enfield. We have been working hard to do things differently. In the future, it is going to only get better because we are going to keep learning and improving.


You have had similar big-ticket launches earlier. How would you compare this one with those?Our biggest commercial success till now has been the Classic. Back then, we didn’t have this kind of response even though the market was much less evolved at that time. In my 20-odd years at the company, this is the best response we’ve ever had. People have appreciated it from all walks of motorcycling and different parts of the world. It’s not just that the product is nice, but it also fills a gap that honestly no one knew existed. But when people see this motorcycle, they understand that the gap existed in the market. In India, people get that if we can sell a motorcycle of this quality and calibre at the price that we’re selling it at, we can create a market like we did with the Classic when there was no market for above 250cc motorcycles in India. People can see now that it can create a market for bigger bikes in India.


So, will you be pushing it further and coming up with even bigger motorcycles?It took us a decade from 350-500cc to do this. Going bigger is certainly not ruled out, but we have no plans right now because we think that this (the two new motorcycles) has a lot of leg for us in the 650cc segment in India and markets around the world. We’d rather do less things and do them really well, like the Classic. Some other manufacturers have different strategies, but we don’t need a wide range of products to fulfil our ambitions. We need a couple of really nice products, like what the Classic was and what hopefully the Interceptor will be. That’s enough. Sure, there is a lot of pipeline, there are interesting things coming out. The concept KX which we showcased at EICMA (motorcycle show in Milan) is still a concept. We are gauging customer reaction and if we decide to put it in the market, it will be a bigger motorcycle than this, but we haven’t decided that as yet.


Is Royal Enfield ready for BS-VI?We are fully prepared. Our new product introduction takes three-and-a-half to four years. We have been working on all our BS-VI products. And we think we have an amazing generation of new products that’s going to come out for BS-VI. In all of our testing, we’re already way below the BS-VI emission requirements. So, from a pure technical perspective, we are meeting all the emission requirements. But now, as always, it’s about testing, validation, supply chain. In this case, supply chain, because it’s not easy to convert our production of 70,000-80,000 motorcycles (a month) from BS-IV to BS-VI. It’s a huge supply chain. So that’s the work that’s going on now. And it’s not just the supply chain, it’s also distribution, our service network — everything needs to change, parts, all of that. But we’ll be absolutely ready before the March 2020 deadline.


Has production been restored at your Chennai plant after the workers’ strike ended last month?We had a strike from a section of employees and therefore there was a slowdown in production during those nearly two months. But yes, it’s all sorted. We’ve been able to get them back. Production takes some time to ramp-up. You don’t just press a button and it gets back to normal. But now it’s absolutely back on track."

Edited excerpts:


ET Now: It seems that we are back in shipshape, good support from global cues and you in any case have been calling that the market is in a positive shape and just falling prey to every day global cues and today that should not be a problem.
Sanjiv Bhasin: We are hopefully ending the year on a very-very sombre note given that Donald Trump tweets have gone all over the place, but I took his last tweet as the best precursor that US stocks are looking extremely cheap and very-very good for 2019.

So I am in the camp, which says that 2019 will be a brilliant year for equities and Indian equities outperforming, which is why we are pinching ourselves each time we go higher and the rest of the world is underperforming.

So I think before the general elections, new highs are on the card, maybe in the second week of April and for that reason buy the fear and sell the greed is the adage, which is more suitable for Indian markets going forward.


ET Now: Important news this morning and a meeting that transpired just last evening when Prime Minister met and promised to build confidence in the credit market after a meeting with the representatives from NBFC and HFC sector. The delegation has pitched for a special window in the wake of a liquidity squeeze, that along with the RBI governor who is looking to meet PSU lenders and private bankers as well today. Do you think something critical is going to come out of these two meetings?

Sanjiv Bhasin: We will wait for the outcome, but it sends a very-very positive note that the government is there and it is putting its back behind you and it is telling that with the bond yields at a one-year low, oil deficit under control, the government is ready to put its money where its mouth is.

So I would take that very-very positively. I think credit is going to expand and for us the macros are extremely positive with the government now being more proactive and that is the reason why RBI governor stands out because he has his feet and ears on the road and he knows what is going on, what is the necessary steps and how he can instil confidence.

If you got back to the old days, it was not that the RBI came and took measures immediately. They talked up the rupee or they talked up the bond yields and so on. We previously had RBI governors who were silent and missing from conspicuous from the absence in the real scene. So I would take that very-very positively.


ET Now: What will be your pecking order within insurance and also if you are talking about the theme of financial inclusion, some of the mutual fund businesses, I do not know whether you have the mandate to speak about MF businesses but is there an opportunity set there?

Sanjiv Bhasin: Both those spaces are extremely good long term views given that SIP and the retail investor have been the backbone behind this market and we see no let up for the next three, five, 10 years. And like you mentioned the other guest that insurance is a very underpenetrated market and we think that the yields are giving us very good opportunity of the ULIPs going forward.

So it would be ICICI Pru, SBI Life, HDFC Standard which we are very-very bullish. On the mutual funds, I would reserve my comments on anything but like I said we think the longer run these two industries are going to be huge wealth creators and huge, the subscription levels, volume levels will be very-very high going into the next few years.


ET Now: What are some of your high conviction 2019 ideas that you are advocating to clients?
Sanjiv Bhasin: So in the largecaps, we are suggesting five stocks -- ITC, L&T, Axis, Eicher Motors and Hindalco. We think they are proxy plays in all their five sectors and they will ape the market or beat the index.

In midcaps we are very bullish on CG power, Ashok Leyland, MGL and Indiabull Housing. Our dark horse plays are the construction companies where we think that there will be huge amount of volume growth and execution so NBCC would stand out, on January 21 the court is going to vacate the stay order which it has imposed on certain places in Kidwai Nagar and the other dark horse would be Shankara Building Products.

The stock came out with an IPO, saw an exponential rise till 2000, now is available at 525 and the business continues to be very-very robust. It has formed a very good franchise. It is therefore I think almost 18 years and we think the risk reward at 18 times one year forward is extremely good at this 520. I can stick my neck out that NBCC and this could be actually relative doublers in the next year given that before the elections and after you will see a huge pent up in construction activity in and around the country."

Fag-end buying in select telecom and financial stocks supported the benchmark NSE Nifty to extend its rally into the fifth day.

While M&HCV and I&LCV segments are witnessing a drop, the passenger vehicle business has bounced back, the Tata firm said in a release.


Nifty charts show bullish candleNifty formed a small bullish candle on the daily charts with a long lower shadow. The index had opened on a shaky note and witnessed weakness in morning trade before recovering sharply in the afternoon session. “Technically, with Nifty surging higher, the bulls remain in control.

Nifty formed bearish candleThe index formed a small bearish candle on the daily chart and made lower low formation for the second session. It eventually closed a tad above its 200-day moving average around 10,790 level. The daily strength indicator RSI has turned bearish along with a negative crossover, which supports bearish sentiment. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said that the index, which had been moving in a rising channel, was finding multiple hurdles near 10,950-10,985 zone from last couple of sessions."

The Nifty50 index failed to hold above 10,900 and drifted sharply towards the 10,735 mark on Wednesday. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and negated the formation of higher highs of last four sessions. It remained highly volatile during the day and again moved closer to its 50-day EMA.

Nifty has been moving in a rising channel and finding multiple hurdles near the 10,950-10,985 zone from last couple of session. Now, it has to hold above 10,777 to witness an upward move towards the 10,850-10,888 zone, while on downside, support exists at 10,650-10,600 zone.

On the options front, maximum Put OI was at 10,500 followed by 10,000 level while maximum Call OI was at 11,200 followed by 11,000 level. There was Call writing at 11,000 followed by 11,200 levels, while Put writing was seen at 10,500 followed by 10,600 level.

The option band signifies a broader trading range between 10,650 and 11,000 levels. India VIX moved up 6.97 per cent to 16.39. VIX has again spiked, which is not giving any comfort to the bulls.

Bank Nifty failed to surpass its previous day’s high and witnessed selling pressure at higher levels. It formed an Inside Bar on the daily scale and managed to close above the 27,000 mark. Now, it has to hold above 27,000 to witness an upward move towards 27,350 and then 27,500 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 26,850 and then 26,666 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 1.23 per cent at 10,825. Long buildup was seen in BEML, Federal Bank, Asian Paints, IGL, BEL and Sun Pharma while shorts were seen in Eicher Motor, TVS Motor, Hindalco, Jet Airways, Tata Steel, Ashok Leyland and M&M.

9,2019-01-02,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Adding to their morning gloom, the domestic benchmark indices extended their fall in late afternoon trade and fell over one percent, hit by concerns over slowing growth in China, fresh fall in the rupee and India’s weak macro data.

At around 3:30 pm, the BSE sensex was 363 points or 35,892, down 1 per cent.. While, NSE counterpart Nifty too faced a similar fate and shed 118 points or 1.08 per cent to settle at 10,793.

Here are top factors that pulled down the market on Wednesday.

Bearish global cues
Stocks fell across Europe and Asia as well US futures turned lower after evidence of slowing Chinese growth dashed investor hopes for an upbeat start to 2019, Bloomberg reported.

China's factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years in December.


Fresh fall in rupeeDepreciation in Indian rupee hit market mood. The rupee was trading 61 paise down at 70.04 against the greenback in later afternoon session.


Weak macro data
Market sentiment also took a hit after India’s manufacturing sector slowed down December. The growth was hit because of competitive pressures, labour affairs and challenging public policies. As per the survey, the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) eased to 53.2 in December from 54 in the month of November.


Fall in GST mop-upGST collection dropped to Rs 94,726 crore in December 2018, lower than Rs 97,637 crore collected in the previous month.

The finance ministry in a statement said of the Rs 94,726 crore collected, Central GST (CGST) collection was Rs 16,442 crore, State GST (SGST) was Rs 22,459 crore, Integrated GST (IGST) was Rs 47,936 crore and Cess was Rs 7,888 crore.


Motown enters slow laneAuto stocks plummeted after major companies, including Eicher Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki India, reported lower-than-expected sales numbers for December.

Royal Enfield on Tuesday reported a 13 per cent decline in total sales to 58,278 units in December. On the other hand Tata Motors reported an 8 per cent decline in domestic sales to 50,440 units in December as compared with 54,627 units in the same month last year."

  small cap companies with good franchises, Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

It has not been a bad year for India 2018 even though the midcaps gave us a rude surprise on the downside. Can 2019 be rewarding despite the elections?
As I have been saying for the last 12 months, the Indian market still remains overvalued in totality. 9,500 is roughly where the Nifty should be. Whether it will get to fair value or not is a different matter. If you ask me, this is again going to be a year for stock picking. It is difficult to see why there will be a broad-based rally in the market. I know everybody will obsess endlessly about elections but as I have said before, I am not so sure politics really has that much of a bearing on our stock market as people think it has. 

So, it will be year of stock picking and specific segments which I think looks very interesting for making money continue to be exporters who benefit from a weaker currency, private sector banks who benefit from the slide in the NBFC fortunes and more generally, the consumption story especially small ticket consumption where you do not have to borrow money to buy the products. There will be pockets to make money but I am not so sure that the Nifty as a whole will bring you that much joy in the next 12 months.


You are bullish on exporters because of weak currency. But don’t you think the currency arbitrage which worked very well for IT and pharma companies, may not be a trigger for 2019?
There are two parts to it – one is that we know on a factual basis that a year ago we were at say 63-64 on the dollar. We are now around 70. Most of the IT services companies fully hedge their currency exposure. So the last 12 months they have not really seen the benefits because they have hedged their exposure out. The benefits of the weaker rupee only now will start fructifying for the IT services firm. 

My reckoning is even without any further depreciation, even if the rupee stays at 70 to the dollar, you will start seeing the benefits of the weaker rupee flow through now. 

Second, it is relatively clear looking at the gyration in the rupee that for exporters to be competitive, you need around 75 to the dollar and that obviously suggests that there is further tailwinds for IT companies, the pharma companies, the export pack as a whole. 

It is very difficult to see how our current account deficit will go back to semblance of normality without rupee reaching 75 to the dollar and the fact that the FPI inflows (bond and the equity inflows) are moderating as the cost of capital rises in America. This make it even more imperative that the CAD goes back towards say 1-1.5% of GDP level rather than the current levels closer to 2.5%. So 75 to the dollar feels like equilibrium, which suggests that there is further juice in playing the export story around IT and pharma.


The slowdown in the lending has taken its toll on auto sales as well. This played out in December sales figures. Would you say that the worst is already priced in and is it time to start buying on dips, or maybe keep it to names like Bajaj Auto?
It is not just the slowdown in lending, It is specifically the challenges facing the NBFC sector which have hit auto very hard. Because of the nature of their business model, the NBFCs are far more enthusiastic financiers of trucks, cars and bikes than the typical high street banks are. My reckoning is that NBFCs stay under the pump through this year. 

Whilst the worst of the IL&FS scare is behind us, there are reasons to believe that money will stay dear, cost of capital will stay high for the NBFCs and market share will shift to the banks. So, while the auto slowdown will abate as the year progresses, seeing 15%, 20% growth in truck volumes and 20% growth in car volumes is not something we should expect to see in 2019. 

That was a specific feature of the early part of 2018. It will probably go back to high single digits growth on cars and trucks but the high teens, early 20s numbers that we were seeing in car and truck volume growth will be a long time coming. This is year of a high single digit growth in auto volumes rather than double digit growth.


You have been making a point, stick to the compounders’ list. In 2019, has there been any additions to your classic compounders list?
Abbott Labs is a company we have been looking at quite carefully for a while. It seems to have all the classic characteristics of a great compounder, strong proprietary technology, proprietary IP, superb cash flows. It is a company we are looking at quite carefully, perhaps we will add it to our portfolio at some stage this year. 

The other element to think about is the fact that what you are seeing in largecap consistent compounders, firms like say HDFC Bank or Asian Paints and so on. There is a reasonable chance you can see the same phenomenon on getting repeated lower down the market caps spectrum. 

I think there is a good chance that well-run smallcaps can have a very good year. Raw material price pressure, raw material cost pressures have abated and that typically is a great time for smallcap stocks to see improvement in operating margins. So well-run smallcap companies will find 2019 to be a fertile year and we are spending a fair bit of time looking for consistent compounders down the market cap spectrum, well-run small cap companies with good franchises.


We may hope to catch the next smallcap but in reality it is very difficult, isn’t it?
There is a very peculiar feature in the Indian markets. The Sensex churns by around 25 to 30% over a 10-year period. But the BSE 500 churns by almost twice as much over a 10-year period. What that suggests is it is relatively easy for a well run smallcap company to enter the BSE 500, have a good four-five-year run where growth is say 20-25%. The companies enter the BSE 500 and then they struggle big time to get anywhere close to the Nifty. 

So our stock market is a play of two halves, on the one hand you have giants like Asian Paints and HDFC Bank with formidable competitive advantages cranking out huge shareholder returns over long periods of time and then you have well run small cap companies who are able to grow rapidly to a point but not beyond that. And in between these two extremities there is a sort of whole load of mediocrity which is basically the bulk of the BSE 500. 

My job in a way is to think one of the HDFC Bank and Asian Paints consistent compounders, great companies which can crank out superb returns over long periods of time but on the other hand, look out for promising small companies who can have a four-five-six-year run and end up dominating the small niche in the Indian economy. 

So I was referring to the smaller strategy of looking for companies which can dominate small niche in the Indian economy. They might never be an HDFC Bank or an Asian Paints but they will have a four-five-year good run and that is what I am trying to also discover, This is a good year for that because raw material prices have abated and that is typically a good climate for smaller companies to have a decent run.


Where else within smallcaps do you find value? 
The other area to look at quite carefully is playing a capex recovery but rather than trying to do it through say an L&T type of construct or buying Axis Bank shares, one can look for B2B companies which will benefit from a revival in the capex construct in our country. To give an example, take a company like GMM Pfaudler, which makes glass line vessels. Their vessels are used by the chemical industry, the pharma industry and therefore if we have an economic revival and chemical demand spurts upm then GMM Pfaudler with experience should experience a revival in top line growth.

Similarly, if you look at a company like Alkyl Amines which makes aliphatic amines, again if you have an industrial revival in our country a dominant supplier of a niche chemical could see a good run. So try to look for well run small cap companies which dominate a niche in our B2B economy and our industrial economy might be a more interesting way to play a potential capex recovery on the other side of the election rather than trying to buy the sort of the no-brainer type of stocks which is what the typical investor will run out to do.


How would you be looking at the exporters this year? They were a big play into 2018 especially the IT stocks. How would they fare in 2019?
IT remains a prominent part of my portfolio. I had turned bullish around 17-18 months ago and as you were just discussing in the early part of this interview, if the currency remains at 70 and perhaps goes towards 75 to a dollar, there is good reason to believe IT exporters will continue having a decent run in. I would add pharma to that list. A stock price recovery in pharma is long overdue. Domestic demand has been very robust for the last four, five years. The worst of the FDA action is behind us and if the currency stays at 70 or indeed moves towards 75, there is a long overdue recovery in Indian pharma stocks as well.


We have seen a massive outperformance in the Nifty because of TCS and to a large extent Reliance. They have done well and there was a macro scare. This kind of factor played out in 2013 when rupee went down, crude was volatile, interest rates went higher. We saw a very strong rally in midcap and smallcap stocks. But now mid and smallcap valuations are not cheap. So will only experts like you be able to get few midcaps right? But but that is only 15% of the market?
I am glad you brought this point out. I think there is two different ways in which you can think of a small and midcap rally; the first way the classic small and midcap rally in any market is typically when money becomes really cheap, cost of capital drops, everybody gets really excited, the animal spirits come out and people start looking for exciting small and midcap companies even though the fundamentals of these stocks might not be the greatest. 

I do not think 2019 is going to be a year for that sort of a rally. The cost of capital keeps going up in our country and maybe we will get the odd RBI rate hike before the election but by and large, the cost of capital globally will carry on grinding up and we too will be part of that journey and hence it would be difficult to see a small and midcap rally driven by risk appetite. 

The other reason that small and midcap companies can more selectively have a good run is their fundamentals improve either raw material prices abate or demand picks up a little bit and they see operating margin expansion. On the back of operating margin expansion you see selective small and midcaps rallying. 

I think this is more the latter sort of year, not the former sort of year. I find it difficult to believe that suddenly we will see cheap money sloshing around India and everybody will start having a punt at small and midcaps. It feels more like the latter sort of year where well run small and midcap companies have a good run on the back of better profitability, better profit margins in 2019.


Will you buy two-wheelers if there is right now only gloom and doom in a Hero MotorCorp or Eicher Motors? If interest rates which is a raw material for consumer to buy cars and two-wheelers remains low, will auto demand come back?
Let me answer the easier question first. FMCG is set for another good year, partly the demand base for FMCG is in good shape, election oriented spending and so on. But also raw material prices abating is good news for FMCG stocks. I know valuations are elevated there, but I do not think FMCG stocks will suffer on account of rich valuations. 

If I had to buy a two-wheeler stock, if someone held a gun to my head and said you have to have a two-wheeler stock, I would go for Bajaj because the export-oriented element of the Bajaj franchise puts it on a better wicket than Hero or indeed Eicher.

If I had to buy a two-wheeler stock I would look at Bajaj. For a long time now, TVS Motors continues to be a company which has gone from strength to strength, their BMW bike is shaping up pretty well and I think TVS will continue to be an interesting stock to have. 

But amongst the frontline two-wheelers, if someone held a gun to my head, I will look at Bajaj Auto. The export franchise could be the main thing which draws investors towards them. The domestic piece on two-wheeler consumption will remain challenged as cost of money stays high in our country."

10,2019-01-02,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Across the board selling led by auto and bank stocks, pushed the 30-share Sensex lower by 363 points in Wednesday's trade. The index settled the day at 35,892, down 1 per cent.

Weakness in the markets world over, along with a sharp drop in the domestic currency dented the investor sentiment back home. 

World shares started 2019 on a downbeat note, oil prices and bond yields slid, and the Japanese yen strengthened on Wednesday as data from China to France confirmed the picture of a global economic slowdown, Reuters reported.

The domestic currency dropped 70 paise against the US dollar in today's session to hit an intraday low of 70.10 on account of FII outflows.

A slowdown in the manufacturing activity for the month of December along with poor GST numbers didn't bode well for the markets either. Indian manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in December as growth in new orders and output waned, despite factories cutting their prices, a private survey showed on Wednesday, according to a Reuters report.

NSE counterpart Nifty too faced a similar fate and shed 118 points or 1.08 per cent to settle at 10,793.

Among Sensex stocks, only six managed to end higher in today's session, with Sun Pharma gaining the most by 1.66 per cent. Meanwhile, Vedanta, Tata Steel, M&M, Tata Motors and Maruti were among the top losers, shedding up to 4 per cent.

Midcap and smallcap indices on BSE too fell in line with Sensex, ending the session 1.26 per cent and 0.74 per cent lower, respectively.

Among BSE sectoral indices, metal index cracked the most and ended the day 3.45 per cent lower on weak Chinese data. Data released earlier in the day showed that China’s official manufacturing indicator -- Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – contracted to 49.7 in December. This was the first contraction in manufacturing activity for the index since May 2017. 

Global brokerage CLSA slashed targets and downgraded five metals and mining companies, citing weak Chinese demand. 

Auto was another sector that witnessed a weak session and plunged 3 per cent on account of weak auto sale numbers for the month of December. Eicher Motors plunged the most by 8.71 per cent. 

Barring teck and informational technology, all sectors ended in the red.


Expert take
Domestic market consolidated in expectation of weak Q3FY19 results while weak GST collection and lower auto numbers supported the fear. Globally, weak China factory data and risk of further slowdown in world economy impacted global market which was weak. Consolidation was broad in Indian market but Metals & Auto index were the worst performers.- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services


Post a decent upmove in the last few trading sessions, the equity benchmark indices declined led by negative global cues and profit taking at higher levels. Amongst the global markets, Asian markets ended on a negative note and European indices were trading lower.There has been some encouraging developments on the global front with Trump signalling meaningful progress on trade talks with China, thereby easing tensions between the two nations. However, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic on the Indian markets as global headwinds in the form of economic slowdown would keep the markets in check. Additionally, due to lack of any domestic triggers, the markets would take cues from US Fed Chairman’s media interaction scheduled this week.- Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking"

16,2019-01-03,Eicher,"Realty stocks have a bad track record for creating investor wealth and they could do well for a few months or so but these are certainly not long-term stocks where one can invest in three to five years or so, Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities Pvt Ltd, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

Will you buy more in the first month of 2019 or you are fully invested?
More or less we are fully invested. Most investors also are more or less fully invested and maybe incremental savings could get diverted into the stock market as and when opportunities present themselves. In any case, before an earning season it is best to stay away and be in cash because when the numbers come, there are always positive and negative surprises.

There is a high degree of volatility when companies announce their quarterly numbers and that provides an opportunity for entry or exit but there is no doubt that some amount of reshuffling is definitely taking place where churn is happening. Investors are getting away from the underperforming sectors, which could be commodities, pharmaceuticals, maybe even software into some of these sectors which are expected to do very well, especially the consumption oriented stocks and private sector banks and corporate banks. 

So, some amount of churn is happening and there is divergence of growth and investors are taking advantage of sectors which are going to grow higher than the GDP growth rates and trying to be underweight on sectors which are facing some issue as far as demand or cost increases are concerned.


On Corporate banks
Yes that is true, The corporate banks have done well over the past few months or so and there is no doubt that going forward just because of lower provisioning, you will see a spurt in their profits and as and when they start getting their revenues growth growing, especially net interest as well as fee-based income going up, you will see a decent growth in their earnings more than at least some of the peer group banks like say HDFC or IndusInd Bank or RBL for that matter. 

Some amount of money is definitely going over there. But I would say these stocks have maxed out though there is still scope for these stocks to outperform going forward. I would remain invested but may not make fresh investments.


On real estate
I do not think real estate will be an underperformer. They have gone through a lot of stress over the past two-three years. Lots of balance sheets, even of the likes of DLF are in the process of getting cleaned up. Debt levels for the listed players are certainly lower and many of the real estate companies are trading at decent discount to their net asset values.

The main concern is that there is just far too much inventory. Any bit of positive news coming from the sector in terms of greater sales or lower inventories would act as trigger for the sector as a whole. Valuations are reasonable and many investors are still underweight as far as real estate stocks are concerned. 

This sector can certainly be a market performer or even an outperformer but the strategy over here has to be to go for the companies which have got rental income as well. These will be the likes of Oberoi Realty or DLF because that would give a certain amount of stability to the earnings in a sector where earnings can be quite volatile depending upon the actual sales taking place which are certainly not linear. I would not be too negative on real estate per se. 

It has gone through pains and now the time is ripe for them to gradually start outperforming but keep in mind that these are cyclical industries. They have a bad track record for creating investor wealth and they could do well for a few months or so but these are certainly not long-term stocks where one can invest in three to five years or so. The ROIs, ROEs remain quite unattractive. It is just that there is a nice trading opportunity in these stocks for the next few months or so. 


On aviation

Definitely the best bet in the aviation industry is IndiGo and the woes of the competitor Jet and Air India certainly play into the hands of IndiGo. Scare about flight cancellation is ensuing that IndiGo gets benefits from that as more and more passengers are choosing a stronger airline. Their balance sheet is in a great shape and lower intensity on comparative pricing will benefit IndiGo and the sector as a whole and with fuel prices also coming down, I think we are going to see excellent numbers coming in from IndiGo over the next two-three quarters or so. 

So further trading bounce in IndiGo cannot be ruled out but there are certain structural issues with the industry. The comparative pressure tends to go up as and when the oil prices go down and then more players also start to build capacity over there. It is not like a nice secular structural growth story as far as the earnings are concerned but yes, it is on a cyclical upswing and the present scenario is such that the market leader IndiGo and to an extent SpiceJet will benefit tremendously and that will be reflected in their numbers as well. 

Investors who bought these stocks should remain invested. They have already moved up a lot so would not like to put fresh money at least over there. But for existing investors, it is a great hold and they could see at least 15-20% type of returns over the next few months from these two companies. 


On buy-on-dips opportunity in auto
The pain in the auto sector may last for some more time and there are two major reasons for this. One is the base effect and second, the absence of new models across the board. Whether it is Maruti or Eicher or TVS, new models definitely drive auto sales and they have been generally not been launched at least in the past few months or so. That is affecting auto volumes per se, not to mention that there were higher cost of acquisition especially insurance cost and petrol prices were higher right up till at least about November, December or so and that certainly play on the minds of the consumer. 

It is a mildly cyclical industry and it is best to stay away from it for some time. We have the advantage of monthly sales numbers. As and when we see monthly sales numbers getting into double digit, one could look at buying into these companies. Fortunately, some of the cost pressures has certainly reduced and that would provide some flexibility as far as pricing or discounting is concerned and some amount of at least protection of the margins. 

I would say wait and watch. When the numbers start to improve, then that is the time to take up a plunge into these stocks. There is no doubt that there is considerable headroom for growth in a market like India for all segments in auto industry -- be it two-wheelers, four-wheelers or even commercial vehicles. The auto industry should always be on your radar. It is just that next few months could again show disappointing sales numbers and that would pin these stocks down."
20,2019-01-03,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks suffered losses for the second successive session on Thursday, mirroring the nervousness in global markets after a revenue warning from tech-giant Apple stoked fears of slowing global growth. 

Most global markets took a beating, as investors rushed to safe haven assets after the iPhone maker said weak sales in China was to hit company's quarterly numbers. 

Europe's major indices, including UK's FTSE100, Germany's DAX and French CAC40, declined about 1 per cent each, while their Asian peers Nikkei 225, Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng all ended in the red. 

Back home, investors sold across sectors in the absence of any positive trigger. December earnings season kicks off next week and analysts believe healthy prints from blue chip companies can change the bearish trend.

Sensex took a 378-point, or 1.05 per cent, hit to shut shop at 35,513, with only five stocks – HCL Tech, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever and Bharti Airtel – ending in the green. The Nifty50 closed at 10,672 with a loss of 120 points, or 1.11 per cent. Among the 50 Nifty stocks, 42 slipped into the red.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed 1.03 per cent and 0.58 per cent lower, respectively.

Let's take a look at the key highlights of Thursday's session:


128 stocks signal further fallAs many as 128 stocks, including SBI, Dena Bank, Jet Airways, Tata Steel, M&M, Tata Chemicals, Tech Mahindra, M&M Financial Services, IRB Infrastructure and Exide Industries showed bearish crossovers on the momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, charts on BSE, signalling that these stocks may slide further in the coming sessions. Meanwhile, 56 BSE stocks including Balrampur Chini, Welspun India, Fortis Healthcare, Aditya Vision and Country Club Hospitality & Holidays showed bullish crossovers on MACD charts.


Rs 1.27 lakh crore gone in a dayThursday's rout caused BSE-listed firms lose over Rs 1.27 lakh crore cumulatively from total market capitalisation, which fell to Rs 1,42,14,112 crore from Rs 1,43,41,828 crore at Wednesday’s close. BSE-listed firms have lost over Rs 2.66 lakh crore in the two-day selling spree. 


Eicher Motors plumbs 52-week lowShares of Eicher Motors plunged 4.65 per cent to touch its 52-week low of Rs 20,180 on BSE, before settling 4.30 per cent lower at Rs 20,253. The stock continued to weaken after Eicher’s two-wheeler brand Royal Enfield reported a 13 per cent drop in December sales at 58,278 units against 66,968 units in the year-ago month.


ONGC slips 3% on OVL listing planShares of ONGC fell 2.98 per cent to Rs 143.20 after the company said the government has not yet asked it to reconsider listing its overseas arm ONGC Videsh (OVL) on bourses. Earlier, the company’s board had deliberated on the demand from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) for listing of OVL, but felt market conditions are not right for an oil & gas exploration and production company to list, adding that there were several complexities involved in getting the firm listed. 


NMDC falls on price cutsShares of mining firm NMDC cracked 3 per cent to settle at Rs 94 on BSE after reports that the company had undertaken price cuts in key products. ETNow reported that the company had cut prices of iron ore fines by Rs 300 per tonne and that of lumps by Rs 350 per tonne. NMDC product prices are at a nine-month low now. The move has come in the wake of Odisha miners ramping up production significantly, utilising their environment clearance capacity for the year.


Dena, Vijaya Bank plunge; BoB flatShares of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank plunged 19.78 per cent and 6.76 per cent, respectively, while those of Bank of Baroda (BoB) ended flat on BSE, as investors judged the swap ratios for the merger between the three banks to be favourable for the latter. The Union Cabinet approved the merger on Wednesday. The three boards approved swap ratios at 110 BoB shares for every 1,000 Dena shares and 402 BoB shares for every 1,000 Vijaya Bank shares.


Nestle India pares gainsShares of Nestle India came off day's high of Rs 11,499 to settle at Rs 11,191, up 1.36 per cent, after the Supreme Court revived a class action suit filed by the Central Government against the company’s Maggi noodles, while setting aside an NCDRC order. The company had moved the apex court against the tests ordered by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). 


Wipro planning share buyback?Market is abuzz with speculation that IT major Wipro may announce another share buyback this quarter. However, this will be subject to regulatory approvals and an NCLT decision on the merger of four of its businesses with the tech major, a TOI report suggested. The company’s last buyback was for shares worth Rs 11,000 crore. The stock closed 0.09 per cent higher at Rs 325.40 on BSE.


M&M Financial to raise fundsMahindra & Mahindra Financial Services plans to raise up to Rs 3,500 crore through a public issue of NCDs, PTI reported. One NCD issue for Rs 500 crore (base issue size) opens on January 04 and will close on January 25. The stock failed to benefit from the news and settled 1.52 per cent down at Rs 458 on BSE.


Dena Bank, Exide below 200-DMAsDena Bank, Adani Enterprises, GAIL, M&M Financial Services, Exide Industries, HEG, JSW Energy, ACC and Biocon featured among stocks that witnessed negative breakouts and traded below their 200-DMAs. 


Who dragged my SensexHDFC, Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), HDFC Bank and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) emerged top drags on Sensex pack. M&M, with a loss of 3.04 per cent, led Sensex losers in terms of percentage points. ONGC, Vedanta, Tata Steel, L&T, HDFC and NTPC lost over 2 per cent each.


Metal pack top sectoral loserThe BSE Metal index, with a loss of 2.35 per cent, finished as top loser among the sectoral indices. All 10 index components settled in the red, with Jindal Steel, SAIL, NMDC, Vedanta and Tata Steel ending the session as top losers in that order, falling between 2.59 per cent to 7.05 per cent."
13,2019-01-03,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: In the world’s fastest-expanding auto market, speed bumps appear to be mushrooming just about everywhere.

Product launches seem to have become less frequent, the fattest bike segment lacks the zing to add zip to sales charts, and lenders don’t appear too keen to fund a new set of wheels any more – particularly for the largely unbanked.

The result? A protracted slide in automobile stocks.

In the festive season, the BSE Auto index trailed the BSE Sensex by 7 per cent. Eicher Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti, and Ashok Leyland have fallen 3-17 per cent in the past three months.

Moderation in sales means only 5-8 per cent growth in the projected earnings of the listed automakers for the current fiscal year. Hence, their valuation premium compared with the longterm averages could further narrow. The price-earnings multiple of the BSE Auto index, based on the next twelve months’ earnings, dropped 9 per cent to 17.4 in the past three months.



Valuation declines could be steeper at Eicher Motor and Maruti Suzuki. Earlier, the Street had considered the moderation in demand for the Royal Enfield as one-off, but declines in the past two months point to a likely stagnation in underlying demand. Eicher Motors fell 9 per cent on Wednesday after it reported lower than expected volumes — for the second consecutive month.

Eicher Motors has trimmed its production guidance to 9.25 lakh units for FY19 from 9.5 million announced earlier. Average monthly sales of Royal Enfield have been 70,000 in the past nine months of the current fiscal year. Given soft underlying demand due to higher cost of ownership and competition from the recently launched Jawa, Royal Enfield might face challenges in raising sales to 90,000-plus units in the next three months. Analysts are pencilling in volume of 8.6-8.9 lakh units for the current fiscal year, a growth of 3-8 per cent YoY. A singledigit volume growth could be the first since 2010 at Royal Enfield. The cut in volume growth to 3-8 per cent in FY19 from 15 per cent at the beginning of the year has resulted in projected EPS reduction to Rs 852 from Rs 960, a drop of 10 per cent.

Volume growth at the largest twowheeler maker Hero MotoCorp has also not been very encouraging. Volumes fell 4 per cent in December. The challenges can be gauged from the fact that Hero MotoCorp’s Chairman Pawan Munjal urged the government to bring down the GST on two-wheelers to 18 per cent from 28 per cent to revive consumer demand.

Separately, car sales growth has decelerated in the past four months. India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki saw its volumes increase 6.5 per cent in the first nine months of FY19, and growth since July has been either negative or in low single digits.

Given the weakness in the underlying trend, Maruti’s management lowered its growth guidance to 8 per cent from double-digits at the beginning of the year. Maruti’s consensus EPS has been cut by 12 per cent to Rs 286 per share from Rs 327 in the past three months."

The Nifty50 index remained under pressure on Thursday and witnessed sustained selling throughout the session. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and slipped towards the 10,650 mark. It has been making lower highs and lower lows since last two sessions, as it failed to surpass the crucial hurdle in the 10,925-10,985 zone.

As long as it holds below 10,777 level, Nifty can remain under pressure with downside support at 10,600 and then the recent swing low of 10,535, while on the upside, the hurdle is seen in the 10,777-10,820 zone.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,000 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,500. There was Call writing at 11,000 followed by 10,900 levels, while Put unwinding was seen at most of the immediate strike prices. The option band signified a broader trading range between 10,500 and 10,900 levels.

India VIX moved up 2.44 per cent to 16.79 level. It saw a spike, which is not giving comfort to the bulls and is creating selling pressure at every bounceback.

Bank Nifty has been forming lower highs since last two sessions and selling pressure was seen near the 27,200-27,350 zone. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale. If it holds below 27,000 level, then the index may drift towards 26,850 and then 26,666 levels, while on the upside, a hurdle is seen in the 27,250-27,350 zone.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,715 level with a loss of 1.06 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Torrent Pharma, Marico and Bank of India while shorts were seen in Eicher Motor, ONGC, M&M and Jindal Steel.

18,2019-01-03,Eicher,"Somany Ceramics has corrected about 60% odd and whatever could go wrong has gone wrong for the company, 
Pankaj Pandey, HoR, ICICIdirect.com, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


Do you expect continued pressure on Jet? With comparatively lower crude prices, would one find favour in SpiceJet and Interglobe?
Previously, we had Jet under coverage, but now we had dropped it. The challenge with Jet has been that irrespective of cycles, we have never seen the overall debt coming down which was slightly surprising and structurally we are not positive on the entire aviation space. 

The primary reason is that the tier I airports are choked for capacity. Going forward, there is a good chance that somewhere down the line, auctioning of slots could happen and that might put further pressure on aviation companies. Considering Jet has already defaulted, for equity investors, there is nothing much to look at except for the fact that if they get a new owner and probably the company gets a lease of life. Then only, there is a case for but that will take some bit of time. Till that time, I do not think one should really be chasing it even from a trading perspective.


What has gone wrong with Eicher? Exactly a year ago, which is Jan 2018, it was hard to find a single bear on Eicher Motors?
You are right. Even we had an expectation that the company would deliver overall volumes of about 9.5 lakh for this year but what is coming out is that even 8 lakh would be a difficult number to achieve. Last month’s number is a bit surprising given the fact that ideally this was a normal sort of month. In the earlier months, we had seen some bit of impact of strike and other challenges. But this was expected in a month where the sales should have shown a decent growth. But the company has disappointed on that front and the challenge for Eicher is that Eicher has always been liked for the kind of growth which they have delivered over a period of time. If that growth is faltering, then valuations will have to take a knock because compared to other two-wheeler manufacturers there was always valuation premium for Eicher for its growth. 

Now if that growth is not coming, then the multiples will have to take a knock and my sense is that if the numbers do not really improve, you will see further downsides from current levels. 


What makes you upbeat on the hospitality sector? 
What we have seen is specifically in case of hotels as a segment, demand has been growing in the range to 6-7 per cent odd whereas the supply has been sort of growing only at about 4% odd. So, structurally things have turned very positive for the sector in terms of higher occupancy rates which we are already witnessing and in the next cycle, we would expect a decent growth in the ARRs. We would also expect occupancy levels to inch up from the overall 65% to 75% odd. 

The next six months for the sector are quite good. So 60% of the revenues come in these two quarters. For a lot of these companies, the cost is fixed in nature. If my ARRs improve, the delta on the bottom line is quite high. We like the entire hospitality space, whether it is Indian Hotels, Taj GVK, EIH. All these players should do well going forward. These are our top picks in the sector. 


Would you be gung-ho on the prospects of BoB after the merger and how skewed is it in favour of BoB shareholders? Or would you restrict yourself to private corporate banks?
Following the three-way merger between Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank, the overall book value of the combined entity will increase. On BoB, we had an earlier target price of Rs 135 and typically most of these PSU banks trade around one time book value. From that perspective, Rs 7-8 kind of an upside could be possible but structurally, the merger hangover is what we had witnessed in the case of SBI.

That had impacted the price performance because SBI did literally nothing in the past two or three years. Something similar could pan out for BoB also wherein higher employee cost and higher provisioning because of the NPAs overall probably may not really drive a structural outperformance in the stock. Within PSUs, SBI is one of the best placed because it is already behind all these challenges. 


Which is that one stock where right now the news is bad, the selling is large and you are reasonably confident of an uptick? 
Within our yearly picks, Somany Ceramics has corrected about 60% odd and whatever could go wrong has gone wrong for the company; one, gas prices had gone up to about Rs 40 per scm and there were challenges because of Kerala floods because that contributes about 12-13% of their overall sales. 

Then there were gas infrastructure challenges as a result of which, there was a production loss of over 8% odd. As a result of all these, their margins had actually come down from 13.5% to about 6.7% odd. We sense that overall things will improve from here-on and margins should ideally improve to about 10% odd in the next two years. And with the kind of beating the stock has taken, we would expect it to recover some of the lost ground. We have a target price of Rs 410 on the stock and we like the stock within the stocks that have corrected substantially last year."

23,2019-01-04,Eicher,"It makes sense to bet on midcap ideas in paper, power and city gas distribution space, Vivek Mavani, independent investment adviser, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

Three months ago the general view was buy autos with both your hands because interest rates will remain low and economic recovery will come. Now the same folks are telling me to sell autos and get out before everybody else quits.
As regards autos, the volume numbers have been disappointing over the last couple of months but from a valuation perspective, Hero MotoCorp or Bajaj Auto are at not just multi-year lows, they are close to where they were in 2008-2009! So, at least the valuations give support as far as Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp is concerned. There was Eicher, which seemed like a high flying stock where 30% volume growth would continue to perpetuity. Then reality hit them hard and now growth is difficult to come by,

Cost of ownership issues, the aura and the cult status Royal Enfield had, which drove Eicher Motors for the last five-seven years to stratospheric highs, a lot of that is gone. What we now have is a company that would perhaps deliver 8%, 10%, 12% volume growth perhaps on a sustainable basis. Let us not look at what happened in November-December when the volume numbers actually declined but on a nine-month basis, they still have a respectable 12% volume growth. 

If that were to sustain at about 18-19 times EV/EBITDA and the PE ratio is probably still running upwards of 25 or 30 on a forward basis, it still looks expensive. So, what we have seen in this market is high valuations are sustained only where companies deliver on earnings quarter after quarter and year after year. The moment there is a roadblock or speed breaker on earnings, valuations collapse, the latest one being Eicher. Eicher is even now in a no-go area till volumes return but from a valuation point of view, taking a two- to three-year view, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp seem quite okay.


Would you say that in this volatile market, stay with the defensives, the true blue consumption stories?
Absolutely. Amidst global volatility, the consumption space seems to be relatively insulated. I could extend the consumption space to include paint companies and the likes of Havells and Titan also. None of them seem to be giving any outlook of slowdown in their earnings. Most of them are well on track to achieve their growth targets and growth guidance. Coming back to HUL, valuations certainly are rich but premiumisation, much more aggressive product launches, distribution expansion and increasing use of technology to be more agile in the market place and gaining market share across categories makes a meaningful difference.

The latest acquisition last month of GSK Consumer makes it a very meaningful player in the food space as well, whereas that seems to be a weak point for HUL. So long as the high teens or mid-teens growth in HUL sustains, the high valuations will also sustain. Amidst volatility, the downside is limited and to that extent, these are low beta stocks and they are unlikely to collapse 20-25-30% in a month or two.


You have been bullish on TCS, but is it time now to get out of TCS and buy something else?
Largecap IT is another area besides consumer that remains a place to hide amidst volatility in global and domestic markets. This space has been delivering consistently on earnings, high teens kind of growth. TCS, of course, has been an outlier to deliver 20 plus percent growth in the last few quarters and the trend is likely to sustain. 

Another aspect which provides support to the IT companies is that all of them have huge pile of surplus cash balances on their balance sheet which they are looking to return back to the investors by way of generous dividends and buybacks. TCS in last two years, has done two buybacks; Infosys did one last year and probably there are talks of one more this year. Wipro is also likely to do that. So buybacks plus dividends are also going to provide support to some of these companies besides their consistent growth quarter after quarter.

Notwithstanding that, this is seasonally a weak quarter but that happens every year. So the market is not really going to give weightage to a seasonally weak quarter but look at what lies ahead for 2019. 


What are some of the strategies that you are recommending from the broader markets? Also some of your midcap ideas.
Given that we are going to see a period of volatility driven by both domestic and global factors, whether it directly impacts earnings of Indian companies or not, the broader theme is to focus on companies where growth is unlikely to get hit from growth being consistently delivered quarter after quarter, year after year and also to look at cyclical upturns.

 Of course, in a global slowdown or a panic like situation, cyclical stocks probably are the first to sell off or get seriously hit, but paper is one sector where I am positive about a cyclical upturn. JK Paper and International Paper seem best placed to ride higher prices driven by higher pulp prices. Since they are fully backward integrated, they have their captive pulp manufacturing.

In case of JK Paper, higher volumes are coming from Sirpur Paper which was acquired last year. Almost 100,000 tonnes which is more than 20% in terms of volume growth likely in the next 12 to 15 months in case of JK Paper. Valuation is very reasonable and can be looked at on declines. 

The other area that I am looking at is within the power space. I am looking more on the transmission distribution side because as much of power that will be generated, that also needs to be delivered to the end consumer and I am fairly positive on cable companies like KEI, transformer companies like Voltamp because they have been delivering growth order. Their order books are quite healthy with very deleveraged balance sheets.

In fact, Voltamp is a debt-free company, plus, they have about Rs 350 crore of surplus cash on the balance sheet, rising return on equity as well as expanding margins. They have everything going for them and valuations are not yet demanding. They are very reasonable simply for the fact that the sector has been almost untouchable over the last five to six years. But I do see an opportunity at these levels or even on declines during panic situations. 

So, these are the two themes I am focussing on besides a more sustainable secular theme in city gas distribution companies where I am positive on Mahanagar Gas and Indraprastha Gas. Adani gas which just got listed about couple of months ago is also worth having a look since they have bagged more than 30 new licenses. That of course will call for lot of investments and the earnings from the new licenses will not come before 18 to 24 months. But it is worth keeping a watch on this sector."

25,2019-01-05,Eicher,"Nifty50 continued its downward spell in tandem with global markets during the week gone by but showed good resilience too.

Gloomy forecasts are running high on the Streets as trade war tensions and geopolitical posturing seems to have become overriding concerns for the world. In India too, micro concerns are emerging’ NBFCs and HFCs are expected to report a steep 50 per cent drop in the top line (interest income) as there were serious liquidity issues post the infamous IL&FS saga.

Quarterly results for Q3, which will start coming out from the next week, are likely to be moderate. Nifty50 companies are expected to report a growth of mere 6-7 per cent compared with 13 per cent last year. Companies in the auto, cement, oil & gas, pharma and telecom sectors are expected to post disappointing numbers whereas private banks, IT, insurance and FMCG firms are expected to maintain their growth trajectories.

A look at the global news suggests everything seems to be going wrong with the US markets, be it US Fed tussle with President Donald Trump or the slowdown in the economy at ground level.

Moody’s has forecast a flat growth for US of just 1.5 per cent in 2020 against 2.5 per cent in 2019, which indicates that a significant slowdown in the economy is around the corner, which will further impact the global market growth. It is like the US sneezes and the world catches a cold. But, hopefully, India is expected to remain strong given the young demography and resilient economy; yet, the stock market may remain subdued till the general elections.


Events of the week
The government has at last moved ahead with the merger of Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, and the combined entity will be the third largest bank in the country.

However, it would be unwise to arrive at an investment decision until a clear picture about the merged entity becomes available.

Investors would fare better in the private sector banks rather than betting on the dark horse. Auto sales numbers were out this week with majority of the manufacturers reporting flat growth or de-growth, which was somewhat in line with market expectations except for Eicher Motors, which posted a 13 per cent de-growth YoY.

Most of the weakness was discounted already; the Nifty Auto index fell a massive 3.05 per cent on January 2 followed by a 1.52 per cent fall on the next day, with Eicher Motors being the top loser, down around 13 per cent in two days.


Technical outlook
 

The market is expected to oscillate in a range with 10,950 on the upper side and 10,500 on the lower side and further downside support for Nifty50 at 10,300. Nifty movement is expected to be rangebound, which will prove to be a nightmare for traders. Stock-specific moves will be the highlights of the coming weeks, but Nifty50 is expected to remain rangebound.

Traders can take contra bets on stocks that rise significantly due to quarterly numbers and at the same time buy stocks that have been beaten down due disappointing numbers.


Expectations for the coming week
The market will shift its focus to corporate numbers, which will keep off the global gloom for the time being. Since Q3 numbers are widely predictable and very few surprises are to be expected, the market is unlikely to overreact. However, stock-specific action may be seen on some counters. IT stocks are expected to drift lower, as the trigger for rupee devaluation is already over, and there is every possibility that rupee will appreciate from here on given the high real interest rates prevailing in the economy, which will attract dollar inflows from FPIs.

One should book profits on the IT counter on every rise and not make any fresh investment at current levels. No sharp correction is expected due to the results season, except due to the impact of global events. Investors are advised to stay away currently and begin buying selectively after the earnings season.

Midcaps and smallcaps underperformed Sensex as the indices representing these segments inched up 0.03 per cent and 0.06 per cent, respectively. 


Let's take a look at the key highlights of Monday's session:

Titan climbs 2%Shares of Titan climbed 1.61 per cent to Rs 943.50 after the company said it saw good growth momentum across its businesses in a seasonally strong third quarter. It expects the full-year growth in jewellery business to be around 22 per cent. Global brokerage Macquarie maintained an ‘outperform’ rating on Titan with a target price of Rs 1,186. 


Sobha rises 3% on Q3 numbersShares of Sobha settled 2.65 per cent up after the company said it had achieved a sales volume of 9,08,824 square feet valued at Rs 698.80 crore with an average realisation of Rs 7,669 per square feet during third quarter. Sales volume rose 11 per cent YoY for the first nine months. 


Bandhan Bank, Gruh Finance plungeShares of Bandhan Bank cracked 5.21 per cent to Rs 501 and those of Gruh Finance fell 3.86 per cent to 306 Rs after speculation about their possible merger. Bandhan Bank's talks with HDFC to either buy into or merge with Gruh Finance, a mortgage lender for the less affluent, have reached an advanced stage. Although the regulatory response to the proposal would decide the fate of the transaction. “Bandhan Bank has a problem of getting its shareholding pattern in order but Gruh Finance is a key NBFC to acquire. So, it will turn out to be a very good marriage and it may have very good repercussions in the long run,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, to ET Now. 


IL&FS Transportation defaults on dividend payment IL&FS Transportation Networks today said it had defaulted on dividend payment of Rs 7.12 crore due on redemption of cumulative non-convertible redeemable preference shares. The dividend of Rs 7.12 crore was due for the period between April 1, 2017, to December 23, 2018, and was not paid due to insufficient funds, the company said in a filing to the exchanges. Shares of the company closed 3.10 per cent down at Rs 12.21 on BSE.


Bharat Forge declines 2%Shares of Bharat Forge finished 1.63 per cent down at Rs 480.15 after global brokerage CLSA downgraded the stock to sell from outperform and cut its price target to Rs 420 from Rs 680 earlier. The stock has taken a hit after the US December truck sales fell 42 per cent annually to the lowest in two years. This happened despite December being the strongest month in a year. 


Eicher Motors plumbs 52-week lowShares of Eicher Motors settled below the Rs 20,000-mark after touching a 52-week low at Rs 19,751 on BSE. Falling for the fourth successive session after it posted disappointing December sales data last week, the scrip settled 1.52 per cent lower at 19,822.65. Royal Enfield, the two-wheeler division of Eicher Motors, had reported a 13 per cent drop in total sales at 58,278 units in December compared with 66,968 units in the same month last year.


YES Bank loses shineAfter climbing over 2 per cent in intraday trade on reports of shortlisting two names for MD & CEO position, the scrip slipped in late afternoon deals and settled 1.35 per cent down at Rs 186. Quoting sources, ET reported that Rajesh Sud, former MD and CEO of Max Life Insurance, and current Yes Bank Executive Director Rajat Monga are in race to head the private lender after incumbent CEO Rana Kapoor steps down on January 31 following a central bank advisory.

29,2019-01-07,Eicher,"Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman of Inditrade Capital, flags inventory losses in oil and gas. Additionally, he says cost issues need to be very carefully monitored. He spoke to ETNow. Edited excerpts:



From where this optimism is coming because two wheeler numbers are not coming that great. If you look at four wheeler stocks also, the numbers and stock prices are showing one direction, which is down. Even bellwethers like Maruti is also not posting decent numbers. M&M has its own set of problems. From where everybody in market is getting that optimism to recommend auto stocks because that is one of the most recommended space at this point of time?

I think these kinds of things keep happening. Once in a while, you will see the market coming under pressure because of multiple reasons and we know the reasons why the auto sales numbers have not been growing. There has been an insurance impact. There has been an impact of multiple other cost escalation and these things have pushed down the numbers. 

Having said that if you take a slightly longer term view, remember we are in an election year and you mentioned Maruti. Maruti plays at the lower end of the market. They are not at the expensive end and they have 50 per cent plus market share overall in their four wheeler segment. Yes, people were running to buy Maruti when it was 9,000 kind of plus levels and today, it has come down significantly corrected.

At these levels for an investor who has one year plus time horizon on mind, definitely Maruti is a good buy. 

If you talk about some of the two wheelers, we just did talk about Eicher Motors. I would like to talk about Bajaj as well. They have done a fabulous job. Global markets have performed very well. They had some issues in Nigeria and other markets, which have kind of got resolved. Domestic markets were not gaining market share. They have taken a price bet and started gaining market share. 

Well, it may not be long-term sustainable gains, but they are making good inroads and considering again this is an election year, a lot of money is going into the rural economy. Bajaj again has a bright future if you are going to buy it and hold it for about a year. 

As far as Eicher Motors is concerned, I talked about their global plans and if you really look at South-East Asian and South American markets where they have started making inroads, I think the scope is humongous. The company is just scratching the surface. 

This is apart from the fact that they have a significantly growing domestic market. Numbers in a month or in a few quarters may not be that good when there is a new launch from a rival because of the novelty factor or things like that, but overall if you take a one year plus time horizon, these kinds of valuation and stocks definitely look good.


Many are saying this is going to be the first sign of a revival in earnings, although there is the niggling fear with respect to raw material pressures once again coming back because all the low-cost inventory is going to get stocked out. All in all, what are you watching out for when it comes to Q3? Is your focus going to be on the top line, is it going to be on how companies are able to manage their costs and subsequently profitability?

We will have to definitely monitor the profitability and you are absolutely right the cost issues need to be very, very carefully monitored. We are extremely worried about the inventory losses in certain sectors like oil and gas. We have to very carefully watch what is happening on the inventory front and are sceptical about that sector. 

If you ask me about the entire NBFC space, we will be extremely cautious on the back of the fact that costs have gone up. The credit squeeze which happened earlier in the third quarter had definitely an impact on disbursements and probably we will see majority of NBFCs depicting a margin squeeze and probably their profits will be under pressure as far as Q3 is concerned. 

By and large, FMCG are expected to do well, top line should grow and bottom line should not get impacted by cost pressure. There are so many items of cost where they have kind of significantly reduced cost pressures and will perform better. Cement is one sector where volumes have been growing up in a very funny manner, but the scope for them to increase margin has not really come. We have been witnessing margin under pressure there in spite of volume growth. 

We will have to watch what happens in Q3, but by and large, we are positive as far as Q3 numbers are concerned, barring a few sectors."
27,2019-01-07,Eicher,"Share price of Eicher Motors fell below the Rs 20,000 mark on Monday as the shares closed over 1 per cent down at Rs 19,840. The shares hit a 52-week low of Rs 19751.10 during the session. 

The stock continued to drag after it posted disappointing December sales data last week. Royal Enfield, the two-wheeler division of Eicher Motors had reported a 13 per cent decline in total sales to 58,278 units in December compared with 66,968 units in the same month last year.

The stock had hit a 52-week high of Rs 32,209.50 on April 27, 2018 while it had previously hit a 52-week low of Rs 20,030.15 on January 04, 2019."
30,2019-01-08,Eicher,"Indian auto industry is likely to face testing times in 2019 and the next year due to subdued demand environment and large regulatory cost push ahead, said foreign brokerage CLSA, downgrading Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto and Bharat Forge.

“Competition should remain benign in PV (passenger vehicles), but high in 2Ws (twowheelers) and trucks. Input costs have started to ease, but regulatory changes pose margin headwinds, said CLSA.

The brokerage has cut FY20-FY21 earnings estimates for Eicher Motors by 12-13 per cent, for Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland by 6-13 per cent, and Bharat Forge by 16-24 per cent. It has cut earnings estimates for Bajaj Auto as well as Mahindra & Mahindra by 4-8 per cent.

CLSA has downgraded Eicher Motors to ‘outperform’ from 'buy' and cut target price to Rs 22,300 from Rs 30,000, stating that recent volume trends have clouded visibility in the near term, though its faith in the product franchise and long-term potential remains. CLSA has trimmed rating on Bajaj Auto and Bharat Forge to 'sell' from 'outperform'.



While cutting target price on Bajaj Auto to Rs 2,450 from Rs 2,850, CLSA said it has downgraded the auto maker because of moderating growth outlook for three-wheelers and exports and pressures in the domestic two-wheeler business.

The brokerage cited weakening outlook for exports and Indian truck industry as the reason for downgrading Bharat Forge and cutting target price to Rs 420 from Rs 680.

The Nifty Auto index underperformed the benchmark in 2018, ending the year down 23 per cent. The Nifty gained 3 per cent during the year.

CLSA favours Maruti Suzuki India in the auto space. With a 'buy' rating, Maruti is CLSA's top pick for 2019 given the strong franchise, long term growth outlook and lower competition intensity in the passenger vehicles segment.

The brokerage also favours Mahindra & Mahindra due to high likelihood of a rural stimulus, expectation of continued growth in the tractor segment, attractive valuations and product trigger in sports utility vehicles."

34,2019-01-08,Eicher,"Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC, is fairly positive about 2019. And he has solid reasons to back up. Macroeconomic scenario is looking better, he says. Shah also told ETNow that valuations are near their fair value. 

Edited excerpts:


Are we in for a good year, poor year or just a very decent year where we should not expect anything extraordinary?

There are many events this year which will determine the outcome. But at least at the beginning of 2019, we are looking at markets with much more hope than in 2018. Oil prices have corrected from $85 to $55-60 range, 10-year yield has moved down from 8.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent, the rupee has moved back from 74 to 69-70, banking liquidity from Rs 1,50,000 crore negative is now roughly about Rs 45,000-50,000 crore negative. FIIs who were sellers in September and October have turned out to be buyers in November and December. 

Inflation has been consistently below RBI’s forecast level. IIP numbers have started recovering. Overall, we are looking at 2019 on a macro basis with much more optimism than 2018. And more importantly, from the market point of view, in 2018 beginning, markets were trading at a premium to historical average, small caps were at 33 per cent premium, large caps were at 10 per cent premium, midcaps were at about 25 per cent premium. 

When I last looked at the number a few weeks ago, small caps were at 5 per cent discount, large caps were at 2 per cent premium and midcaps were at about 10 per cent premium. Effectively, valuations are near their fair value. Macroeconomic scenario is looking better and hence, we are looking at 2019 with more optimism than 2018.



What to your mind could be that big turning point for this year? Will it be earnings recovery or election verdict?

Definitely, market is actually looking at earnings recovery, but somewhere election verdict also plays a role in such recovery. Market is not discounting just this quarter’s or next quarter’s earnings. It is trying to discount earnings over next decade or 20 years. 

When the election verdict comes, obviously on the day of election results, it creates far more volatility. But later on, what policies are followed by the incoming government determines the trajectory of earnings. So, market will be looking at earnings recovery and post election what economic policies are followed by the government will have material impact on the trajectory of earnings recovery.


Do you believe that there could be a case where there is perhaps better alpha generation when it comes to small and midcaps. You were just talking about the fact that if you look at the large cap universe, that is still quoting at 2 per cent premium whereas small and midcaps are at a 5 per cent discount. So, could we see this realignment or readjustment in which small and midcaps give better value and returns this year?

Undoubtedly, we believe small and midcaps today from a valuation point of view is just a little below their historical average. But more importantly, from the regulation point of view today, the top 100 companies are largecaps, next 150 companies are midcaps and beyond 250 companies are all smallcaps. The sheer range of a number of stocks available in small caps are far more and hence, the fund manager who can pick those small cap stocks will be able to generate better alpha compared to slightly restrictive environment within large and midcaps. 


In that sort of environment, what are your top conviction plays for 2019? Against the backdrop of an impending election result, how would you spread out risks versus rewards?

There is one sector which we have started accumulating and we believe post election there could be a fair amount of outperformance over there. This sector is related to capital goods and infrastructure. 

Over the last four years, private capex has remained subdued for a variety of reasons. But now, capacity utilisation has started improving. From bottoming out at around 70 per cent, capacity utilisation across many industries is averaging 72-76 per cent. As this capacity utilisation starts improving, real interest rate starts coming down, credit becomes available and banking liquidity improves, we believe that private capex will revive. 

Along with government infrastructure development spending, we will see good days for capital goods. More importantly, over the last decade or so, many weaker capital goods players that had flourished during 2008 boom have started disappearing. Effectively, there are a few quality players left in capital goods and infrastructure segments. Their order book will become reasonably solid and they will be able to dictate their margin and pricing. 

Because of all this, we believe capital goods and infrastructure sector could be an outperformer in 2019 subject to the election scenario. The other segment which we are right now focussing on is related to rural consumption. The election-bound government will pump money into rural economy. Many state governments have announced farm loan waiver packages that will raise spending power of the rural economy. So, the rural consumption theme can be looked at the current level.



Real estate is considered to be the ugly duckling sector. But if I look at the headlines, RERA has come into place, disclosure norms are better, consolidation is the need of the hour. It is a sector which is not going to die down completely and it is a sector where GST rates are coming down. Right now, nobody wants to buy real estate stocks but after years and years of underperformance and with so many reforms which have taken place, is it time to be a buyer in if not all maybe 2-3 top names?

One limitation in the real estate sector is many of the leading developers of India are unlisted. For example, if we look at Mumbai, some of the top notch developers are Raheja, Rizvi, Lokhandwala, Hiranandani and so on and so forth. But unfortunately, none of them are listed on the stock market. 

If we look at some of the large industrial houses -- for example, Tatas -- which are foraying into real estate and will benefit from all the things you mentioned, again that is unlisted. When we are looking at the real estate sector, we do agree that this is one sector which can bottom out and there could be opportunity for investors. Unfortunately, when we look at the listed segment, the opportunities are very, very limited. 

We intend to play this cycle through other ancillary sectors such as cement, pipes, fittings, tiles and building materials companies. Even housing finance companies will be a better bet to play on the real estate sector and wait for listing of leaders that will give you a reasonable opportunity if they are priced correctly.


How do you think this long corporate bank trade will pan out for 2019 because that is the consensus trade? The view on Street is buy ICICI Bank, buy SBI and buy Axis Bank, some fund managers have told me that they own all three.

We believe this private and public sector corporate focussed banks will be a longer term trade. Of course, today it is becoming a consensus trade and to that extent there could be a risk, but if you look from a fundamental point of view, RBI in its report has mentioned that they expect NPAs to decline from 10.9 per cent to 10.4 per cent. 

This probably indicates that NPA cycle is now bottoming out, incremental lending has been relatively towards better credit. All those banks which had to provide for NPAs by virtue of their corporate lending should be coming out of that cycle and their retail franchise has been fantastic. 

All the three banks which you mentioned have fantastic retail franchise, their retail asset book is also doing well, the only thing which was kind of restricting their share price growth was the NPA cycle and if they come out of this NPA cycle, then to that extent those stocks could be outperformers in the market. Yes, it is a consensus trade, but many a time, consensus can prove correct also.


Is it time to diversify and extend your portfolio, have a little bit exposure to gold because gold prices have been holding steady ever since there was that whiff that the Fed rate pause is going to come in and that bet has weighed on the dollar. Typically as well, you have seen safer haven rush coming into gold, gold prices have recovered from the August lows. Is it time then to take that small maybe, 5-10 per cent kind of exposure into gold?

Undoubtedly, as of today, gold looks attractive. Normally, when Fed rate fund is rising, gold prices underperform. As Fed is indicating that they will not be increasing rates as quickly as market was factoring in a few months back, certainly this provides some sort of support to the gold prices. 

Second, from a currency point of view, if there is uncertainty related to election and that causes high volatility in the Indian rupee, then gold being dollar denominated could provide an alternative option. So at this point of time, I do recommend investors to consider gold as a part of portfolio. My only request will be please remember how much gold you own, you should not be too much overweight into gold.


While you outlined some of the sectors you like, I would want your overview on how you would be placing your bets on essentially the exporters or the rupee related themes because we have seen IT and pharma being top plays because of what the currency did in 2018. Do you think in a meaningful manner one should look at the export theme in the market, not just IT, pharma but largely extending out to businesses which draw a chunk of their revenue through overseas?

Undoubtedly, that is one theme which is a multi-year theme. Of course, IT and pharma are pretty well known export themes. However, there is an opportunity which is emerging for India and we have captured that in chemical industry due to US imposition of tariff on Chinese exports. Many of the manufacturers from China are moving out into various other countries. 

Some of the buyers of Chinese goods in the US are also looking to buy or diversify their sourcing base and that creates opportunity for Indian exporters. In the chemical industry over the last 4-5 years, Indian companies have grown at a rapid pace to fill the little bit of vacuum created by China. 

We believe that in quarters to come, China will keep on creating more and more space for Indian companies and it will be for Indian exporters, Indian companies to capture that opportunity. What we have done in the chemical industry will be replicated in textiles, garments into shoes and leather accessories. It could be into food processing and clothing.

There are many opportunities which are available because China will be moving out of export market and their American buyers will be looking to source those goods from other countries, including India. This we believe is Y2K equivalent opportunity of Indian IT sector for Indian manufacturing companies. 

All we have to look at is entrepreneurs like Narayana Murthy, Azim Premji, Shiv Nadar so that we can ride this trend for multi years. 


Where do you think some of these so-called hallowed stocks are headed -- Eicher, Page, Britannia I mean these were the stocks which have done wonderfully well in the last couple of years. PE expansion has been humongous, growth has been steady, the market concentration has been huge and a majority of the funds now either own Eicher or a Page, some own both. There are a very few funds which do not own none of these so-called four and five digit hallowed stocks?

From here onwards, to expect more expensive valuation stocks to get rerated further will be very difficult. It will be purely their earnings growth which will determine how these valuations can be sustained. 

And we believe from here onwards, at least in the expensive stocks, it is all about stock specific. If you believe these companies will be able to generate higher earnings growth, there will not be material return from these stocks over the next 12-18 months. 

This is not to deny that these companies are excellent companies, they have excellent business models, it is just that their prices seems to have run up a little bit ahead of what kind of earnings growth these companies are going to deliver. So we are pretty cautious in the more expensive bucket of stocks. 

We are taking all those companies on a case by case basis and where we believe that in our opinion, earnings growth will be higher than what is priced by the market. We do not mind holding on to those companies."
35,2019-01-08,Eicher,"Being beneficiaries of bond yield corrections, we are expecting 25% growth in private banks and also see PSU
  
  
  banks moving from loss to profit, Gautam Duggad, HoR, Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Securities, tells ET Now. Technology and consumer are the other two sectors showing growth, says Duggad. Edited excerpts:


What are you expecting in terms of overall growth, especially ex energy where one is expecting a bit of a setback because of oil prices? Where do you see growth coming in from?
Growth is coming largely from banking. Both private corporate banks as well as PSU banks are expected to have a strong quarter and 2019 will be about banking because credit growth is picking up. The pricing power has come back given the issues in NBFCs and asset quality trades have been improving for the last two quarters. We are expecting moderation in slippages and therefore moderation in credit cost. 

All of this put together coupled with the fact that we are looking at a very low base in terms of comparison on a year-on-year basis, basically means that the reported year-on-year earnings growth for banking will be very strong. We are expecting 25% growth in private banks and expect PSU banks to move from loss to profit because they will be a beneficiary of the bond yield correction. 

That is one sector which is standing out apart from technology and consumer. So, in technology also, we are expecting a very strong growth and as also in the consumer sector. But if you keep aside these two, three sectors, then rest of the 12-13 sectors that we track they are not showing any meaningful improvement.


What about commentary on margins and pricing or realisation? They will be more in focus as most commodity prices have started to fall again?
One will have to look at realisation for several sectors. Autos, consumer, cement, durables sectors are B2C linked and the companies have the confidence to pass on the prices which will be a function of how strong the volume growth scenario is in those sectors. 

If volume confidence is there, the companies will pass on prices irrespective of where the commodity prices settle. One of the examples that I can give you is Marico. 

Marico over the last 10-15 years have always passed on price hikes and price declines to consumers without any impact on volumes. That is an example of pricing power. We will have to see examples like this in different sectors and see how corporates are behaving. For example, the biggest worry today is the auto sector because if the volumes do not pick up, then even the small minimum prices hikes that are required may not be taken.


Talk about Reliance Industries. This has really been one of the biggest growth drivers for the Nifty EPS. With GRMs falling now, do you expect Reliance to have an impact on the Nifty EPS growth in Q3?
Yes, we are expecting a very flat profit for Reliance in this quarter. Our estimate is somewhere around Rs 9,500 crore which on a year-on-year basis is virtually the same. So, Reliance will have a moderation. Also in Reliance, we have to figure out what is happening in telecom sector because just refining and petrochemicals no longer drive the Reliance stock price.


What about the most beaten down space? It has really been the autos. On one end, sales have disappointed and raw material costs are also going up. Do you see continued pressure in the third quarter earnings as well?
No, auto has already undergone a significant price correction. In the last one year, one of the data points that I was tracking at the end of the year was the market cap correction in different sectors. Auto as a whole has seen 24-25% market cap correction in the last seven days of 2019. That correction has continued and probably that would have gone up to 26-27% because Eicher has corrected significantly. 

A lot of the price reaction has already happened. You will have to start looking at buying opportunities in that sector now because in the next three, four months, volume growth will bottom out and then one has to start looking at bottom-up opportunities, be it midcap or largecaps in auto space. Our preference is more towards four-wheelers. On the question of margins, we are expecting around 100 bps year-on-year decline ex of JLR for our auto universe. Barring M&M, we are expecting margins to decline across the board be it two-wheeler or four-wheelers.

This quarter will obviously be quite ugly as has been the case with the last two quarters. This will be the third consecutive quarter of year-on-year profit decline for automobiles but prices are now reaching interesting levels and someone with a longer term view must hunt for ideas in automobile sector now."
37,2019-01-08,Eicher,"Siddhartha Lal, CEO & MD, Eicher Motors, talks to Ajaya Sharma of ET Now, on market concerns about 
  
  
  slowdown, competition from Jawa etc. With Eicher Motors stock going below Rs 20,000 yesterday, Lal speaks about shareholder expectations also. Edited excerpts: 


You have had an extraordinary growth run of high double digit last few years. But over last few months, the growth in volumes have been sharply lower. Are the market concerns on growth justified? The stock has seen erosion last few months on the back of that. What would you like to tell your shareholders?

The stock market has been extremely kind to us or supported us a lot over the last decade and this is what happens. When there is one negative, then you extrapolate 10 years to the negative. When there were a few positive signals, then you extrapolated 10 years to the positive. That is generally the trend. But I take all of this with a pinch of salt. We keep things very real. It would have been very easy. Everyone is reacting terribly to our December numbers where we are down 13%. Fair enough! I can understand why but it would have gone totally unnoticed if we just pushed 5,000-6,000 more motorcycles into the market.

I think that is what all other companies do but we do not do that. That is not what we want to do. We want to keep it real. We want to make sure that inventories are right. They are not there to satisfy a couple of investors or media. But that is not how we operate because we are looking at this from extremely long-term perspective and a few blips here and there will only weed out people who are not perhaps very long-term investors. That is okay with me.

I am a long-term investor and I hope all the others there are similar and they believe our story and our story is still intact. We are on the premiumisation trend. We are doing gorgeous things in India and in the world market. We have 850 plus stores. There is nothing like this in India. 


Let us analyse the factors which have come together and been responsible for this -- the tech upgrades, the ABS related issues, the Chennai plant strike, the insurance cost which has ownership pattern and of course maturing of some of the markets along with the Kerala floods. How have all these factors impacted? Clubbed together, they appear big.
It is not in our nature to justify and make excuses because that is not the point of all of this. Sure there have been lot of individual things but they have always been there. Earlier, what happened was that we had a huge order book which could buffer any individual problem. 

Five years ago, there was a problem like Kerala floods. But, then we had an order book in other markets which could take care of that. Sure there have been individual areas like certain markets have matured. But honestly, for me the real thing which has happened has taken some time and it will some more time for the market to react to the new normal which includes increased price of motorcycles, increased costs because of insurance and other factors like the anti-lock breaking system (ABS) etc.

What has happened is that normally 3% to 5% cost increase every year can be easily passed on. Customers really do not mind. It is part of inflation which happens with everything. But it is tough to pass on 15% increase. We have also learnt from that process that maybe we should have broken it up in more steps, but now we are here. So really it was a bit of that which is a bit more abnormal because otherwise individual market issues will always happen. 

In UP something happens, here something happens, election plus/minus who knows! But those are things that normally we just weather. But it is only the price issue that has affected us a bit. But now we are getting back on track. In December, we had flushed as many 2018 bikes as possible. Of course, there are a few left in the market but the idea was to lower inventory so that we could flush out bikes and people wanted 2019 motorcycles.


There was talk of inventory build up at select dealerships which has never been the case before. Folklore has it that Enfield always have had 8-9 months of waiting period. But that seem to have come down.
Of course 8-9 months is gone long ago and it has come down to 3-4 months now. In some models, the waiting period is 15-20 days. Some models are available off the shelf. Inventory is at extremely normal levels and in fact much less than any other two-wheelers. But we do have inventory now. So there is no pile-up of inventory. But we have some inventory which is also good. Earlier, everyone used to shout and scream shadi season is coming! People want bikes immediately. We used to miss out on those opportunities. Now we should be able to catch some of those but there are other issues which come under focus.


Kerala is a highly penetrated market. How are trends over there? Even Maharashtra and Karnataka were highly penetrated. But you are still scratching the surface in large markets like UP. How are you analysing your big, maturing markets? Which are the ones showing opportunity in terms of breakthrough?
Mature markets are exemplified by Kerala where we are the biggest motorcycle brand -- ahead of all the Indo-Japanese style motorcycles -- with around 30 plus percent share. There, every third motorcycle which is sold is a Royal Enfield. It is like your Apple phone. People aspire to it. People are able to access it. The income levels are higher there. The distribution is cracking there. The residual value, the resale price of a Royal Enfield is extremely good. So, it is a very liquid asset when you are buying Royal Enfield in Kerala. It is a positive sign. 

In a market like Kerala, it is not about brand recognition. When I say Kerala, I mean I am now extrapolating about south or maybe the more of developed markets including even Punjab and a few other southern markets and a few cities like Delhi, Bombay etc, all of which are very mature markets for us. 

In these markets what is very important now is the work that we are doing on the development front of rides and community. That that is what people are really interested in and engaging in and the other is new products. A classic 350 has now nearly become the new normal.


Your Classic 350 still gets more than 50% of your overall volumes. You seem to have rejigged that?
In markets like Kerala, the Interceptor, the GT and the Himalayan play a much larger role than they maybe in UP. For example, we have a huge population of people over the last eight, 10 years. We have got 3.5 million people riding Royal Enfield motorcycles in India and if you take Kerala, that has got a disproportionate share. 

These guys who have been riding Royal Enfield for so long, have been asking us for more. They want to upgrade. So the same way that we were able to tap the 100-150-200cc market over the last decade, we are now going to tap our guys who want an upgrade and there is a lot of them out there in Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. There are a lot these guys who have been riding Royal Enfield.


Talk to us about how GT and Interceptor potentially could be international offerings for you. Outside India, people are used to bigger bikes. Biking means big bikes and do you think some of the international markets which you have already stepped into you, can do a India over the next five, eight years and give you the next leg of growth?
That is absolutely the plan. We have been scouring the markets. We have been participating in international markets for a long time now, a bit more under the radar. I would break the global markets into two parts, just for our convenience; one is developed countries US, UK, Europe, Japan, Australia where there is culture of big motorcycles. But the market is small. The overall motorcycle market is not in millions per year, it is in the tens and hundreds or thousands per year

 And that is where we already have a decent distribution, a brand recall and all that. What is happening is that these motorcycles fit in perfectly. The reviews in markets around the world in developed countries have been absolutely fantastic because we have just hit the spot in the right manner at the right time with these modern Classic motorcycles. 

We expect really good growth there but developed countries are not going to be the next India. I do not mind if they are but I do not think they will be the next India. The next India is going to come from markets like Southeast Asia, Latin America, and we have put up a store in some of these markets with the product available at the right price, the price which would be there if it were selling it at CKD. In southeast Asia, we have now zeroed in on Thailand as our nodal market because that is where we expect that the upgraders will come from because there also the middle, big bike market is vastly underserved.


One of the cousins of Royal Enfield of last few decades has come back in the form of Jawa Motorcycles but I have seen some of the international companies put their products near Himalayan also. How are you analysing the competitive landscape in particular with these two?
We take competition very seriously. We study, understand, ride, I have ridden pretty much every motorcycle out there, not in the very big motorcycle category but basically everything which is either a source of growth for us, which are smaller motorcycles or direct competitors.

We understand the motorcycle, we understand the product, we understand the idea, their distribution, the business model, all of that. So we put a lot of attention there but our strategy is not determined by other people. Over the last 10 years, we have had an outstanding growth. We are the most profitable from a percentage perspective motorcycle, perhaps even automobile brand in the world. There will be competition and there will be guys saying I want a piece of that pie."
36,2019-01-08,Eicher,"Given the way the midcaps have behaved in the last four to six weeks, we get a lot of indication that most of the 
  selling in the midcap space has been absorbed and they are waiting for Nifty to give them the green signal to rally, Gautam Shah, Sr VP & Technical Analyst, JM Financial, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

Is it really going to be a happier year or will the Nifty continue to be weighed down with all the trigger points that the markets are going to focus on within the next six months and at best be range-bound?
Given the kind of year we have had in 2018, wherein the best quality names in the market lost 40-50% in value, I do not think 2019 can be as bad as 2018. In fact, 2017 was all about managing greed and 2018 was all about managing fear. If you really learnt lessons from the last two years, 2019 should be a cake walk. 

I do believe that you are at a point wherein India can actually outperform for weeks and months to come. For now, we are pretty much in a range. It is a very complex set up at the marketplace. One can see very random moves on a day to day basis. There is no trend. There is no direction. But I do believe that the market is laying foundation to a major 500-600 point move on the Nifty and the range that we are working with is 10,650 to 10,950. In the last six weeks, the Indian markets have simply bought time. While we digested a lot of negative local news flow in December, global markets have fallen apart. 

Most of the asset classes have not done too well. In this terrible environment for India to stay at 10,700 level itself is quite commendable. This looks like it is buying time and it is just readying itself for a breakout on the upside. If and when a move beyond 10,950 happens, that will open up a 500-600 point recovery. But the problem is with the global markets still in a bear grip, whether it is the US or European markets, and if they were to see one more leg on the downside, then there is a possibility that we might even revisit the November-December lows before we can start to do well once again. 

But having said all of that, 2019 is likely to be a year where India is going to outperform. But that does not necessarily mean that it will rally substantially. It means that we will definitely see a lot less damage in comparison to other markets and that broad-based recovery is on the way. 

Given the way the midcaps have behaved in the last four to six weeks, we get a lot of indication that most of the selling in the midcap space has been absorbed and they are waiting for the Nifty to give them the green signal to rally and many midcap stocks in 2019 are likely to give you multibagger returns.


If that is the case, then where within banks do you see the outperformance?
The banking space definitely looks very interesting. It has been a pillar of strength. It is the sector that has held up the market so well in the last four to five weeks. As we speak, you are seeing the Bank Nifty at a multi-week high. This is something which other sectors are not doing and not just the private banks, even some of the PSU banking stocks have made a nice comeback in the last one, one-and-a-half weeks and also you might have noticed that in that difficult period in December, probably for the first time in 15 months, the PSU banking stocks did not see much weakness. 

The fact that a State Bank of India is trading at around Rs 300, is enough justification that the PSU banking underperformance is clearly behind us. As a whole, we are very positive on the banking space and we feel that when the upside breakout happens for the Nifty, it will be led by the banking space. While I am still more convinced to buy and hold the private banking stocks and I think the top three or four names pretty much qualify there, the PSU banking names will give a trading opportunity in the next two, two-and-a-half months wherein many of the popular names could rally 20-25% very quickly.


Where are you biggest shorts though?
I keep saying that India is probably the HDFC Bank in the global basket. If you want to buy this market, you want to buy India on dips. I think there has not really been any significant indication to go short but we have been quite bearish on the IT space. The IT space enjoyed a great run for almost two-and-a-half years, 2016 till late 2018, and that index seems to have topped out for good. We are probably looking at a 10% to 15% drop for the IT stocks from current levels. That would probably be my shorts in this market, if at all, I want to look at shorting this market at some point of time.

If we were to see a breakdown sometime in the next couple of weeks, apart from this, healthcare and autos are two other spaces in the market which have a slightly negative setup at this point. If we were to weaken further, these two sectors will take the market down. But having said that, just three or four spaces are looking slightly weak but if you look at the broader markets, I spoke about the midcaps, the banking space, the oil and gas sector, the capital goods space as well as the consumption theme. All of these themes are likely to do very well in the coming months.


Which segment within oil and gas, do you think can outperform?On the whole actually because there was a time when the oil marketing companies (OMCs) were not doing too well but given what Nymex crude has done in the last couple of months and the fact that many of these oil marketing companies have come back from their recent lows very well. This is the most sustainable rally which is happening in the oil marketing companies and therefore another 10-15% upside looks quite possible. 

Even the other segment in the oil and gas space also looks quite interesting. Stocks like Reliance have really led this market recovery from lower levels and I do not see any reason why this segment of the sector cannot do very well. This market is now seeing new leadership. So, what was with IT space in 2017 and first half of 2018, is probably now with some of the banks, some of the oil and gas stocks and some of the capital goods stocks.


Want to discuss autos in particular. There has been significant pressure within autos. Eicher broke Rs 20,000 yesterday. We all know Tata Motors has been the most disappointing story on D-Street for the last almost a decade now. You are seeing Maruti as well fall quite significantly from its all time peak. Within autos, would you bottom-fish right now? Where do you think the opportunity lies across the segment -- two-wheelers, three-wheelers or passenger vehicles?
We are more keen on looking at the two-wheelers, I think that is one space which have a very interesting setup and the two-wheeler in the auto space has actually seen some outperformance in the last four to six weeks. If you look at the BSE auto index, 19,000 is a very important support for that inde. 

It is the level from where the recent recovery happened and I believe that many stocks in the auto space are now attempting to bottom out. So this might be too late to short. The damage is already done. Many of the popular auto stocks are down 20-25-30% from the highs besides Tata Motors which is a different story altogether. 

But at this juncture, I would be neutral and wait for some more confirmation because I believe there is a basing formatting which is happening in many of the auto names and if that does get completed in the next couple of weeks, you could actually get a great buying opportunity from a risk reward perspective. So no immediate triggers but it is just too late to sell?


Have you taken a look at the crude charts as well as the rupee charts because they have a major weightage in term of influencing the market trend?
India is at 10,700 today while most global markets are trading at 52-week lows. At least, they were trading at 52-week lows a couple of weeks back, many were trading at two-year lows. In this backdrop, it is just crude and currency which has helped our market outperform by such a large margin.

This is great news getting into 2019 because Nymex crude seems to have stabilised in the $42-50 band. In fact, $42 was the level from where the entire rise started a couple of years back and that entire downcycle seems to have got completed at those levels and now the upside is going to be very limited. So, crude is likely to remain in this band in the near term. 

Even in case of currency, there is a possibility that the dollar against the rupee could have seen a major top at levels of 74 so you are likely to see stability within the band of 69 and 72. These two factors are going to play a major role and might not allow the Indian markets to move in tandem with the global markets in the days and weeks ahead."

40,2019-01-09,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Headline equity indices Sensex and Nifty remained on the upward trajectory for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday.

The surge in stocks was fuelled by bank, financials, auto and FMCG heavyweights, whereas gains in global stocks on hope of a US-China trade deal kept the momentum upbeat.

The market witnessed a sharp plunge for a brief period on bouts of profit booking on select blue chip counters led by banks. However, the selling spree proved shortlived and the market rebounded from the day’s low to settle in the positive territory. Sensex finished the day 232 points higher while Nifty gained 53 points.


Let's take you through the key highlights of the session:


Print media stocks dazzle
Shares of HT Media (up 20 per cent), DB Corp (up 7.37 per cent) and Jagran Prakashan (up 2.89 per cent) logged strong gains after the government revised advertisement rates for print media by 25 per cent. The decision is likely to benefit newspapers, especially medium and small ones, including regional and vernacular publications. 


IndusInd rises on 5% growth in Q3 profit
IndusInd Bank reported 5.21 per cent YoY rise in December quarter profit at Rs 985.03 crore. The number came in higher than Rs 922 crore profit forecast by analysts in an ETNow poll.

JLR sales drive Tata Motors higher
Shares of Tata Motors closed 2.09 per cent up at Rs 183.10, extending the winning spell into the fourth straight session, buoyed by upbeat JLR numbers for US and Indian markets. JLR’s US sales jumped nearly 24 per cent to 14,079 units in for December 2018 from 11,394 in December 2017. JLR India on Tuesday announced 16 per cent sales growth in calendar 2018.


Airtel gains after CLSA raises price target
Global brokerage CLSA raised its target price on Bharti Airtel stock to Rs 425 from Rs 415 and retained a buy rating. The brokerage said Bharti Airtel is its top pick in the sector, which has consolidated into a three-player oligopoly. The global brokerage said Airtel maintained its market share at 31 per cent in 2018 despite Jio gaining 10 percentage points market share and a 23 per cent growth in data subscribers. Adoption of bundled plans and minimum recharge plans will also help improve Arpu. The stock settled 1.92 per cent higher at Rs 335.


Eicher Motors climbs
Positive comments from top management helped Eicher Motors extend its rally into the second straight session. The stock settled 1.19 per cent higher at Rs 20,277 on Wednesday after the management reassured that the slowdown in sales was a temporary issue. Talking to ETNow on Tuesday, CEO & MD Siddhartha Lal said the company had registered an outstanding growth over the last 10 years.


YES Bank falls 3%
Shares of YES Bank declined following block deals ahead of its board meeting later Wednesday. A Bloomberg report said about 25 lakh shares changed hands in two block deals. ET had earlier reported that some large investors were said to have accumulated shares of YES Bank in the runup to it board meeting when the name of the new MD and CEO is expected. The stock settled 3.07 per cent lower at Rs 186. 


Tata Steel touches 52-week low
Shares of Tata Steel touched 52-week low of Rs 475.50, before settling at Rs 479.35, down 2.44 per cent after the steelmaker said the lower production in Europe would impact its financial results for third quarter. In a BSE filing, the company said production from its European plants fell 12.7 per cent to 2.33 million tonnes in October-December period. 


Dilip Buildcon plunges 5%
Shares of Dilip Buildcon closed the day 4.90 per cent down at Rs 391.30 after Crisil downgraded its rating on the company's long-term bank facilities and NCD to A/Stable from A+/Stable. “The downgrade factors in the company’s stretched liquidity position as reflected by the nearly full utilisation of bank limits,” Crisil said.


Midcaps, smallcaps lag Sensex
BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices lagged Sensex, closing lower by 0.04 per cent and 0.17 per cent, respectively. Gruh Finance, Jindal Steel, SAIL and L&T Finance Holdings were the top drag on the midcap index, while City Union Bank, Apollo Tyres, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Trent, Can Fin Homes and IDFC were top laggards in the smallcap pack. 


Oil & gas, metals lose shine
Among the sectoral indices, oil & gas, metal, power, utilities and energy fell. With a loss of 1.74 per cent, BSE Oil & Gas index emerged top sectoral loser, followed by BSE Metal (down 1.21 per cent) index. Shares of most oil marketing companies declined amid a 2 per cent rise in crude oil prices.

  20% upside by this Diwali, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:



Why have Reliance and TCS suddenly started outperforming? 
No, not only Reliance and TCS. There were Asian Paints, ITC and L&T also outperforming. It is telling you that smart money is buying industrials and select IT stocks. Of course, TCS has been a prime portfolio pick, but capital goods stocks, industrials are going to be the outperformers and that is where real money will be made. 

So, whether it is power capex or construction, that is where you will see a lot of delta being created on the long side. And it has been the old folly, buy the fear sell the greed and that is evident when you hit that 10,500-10,600 mark when fear is there but it is also the best time to stick our neck out. This time greed is going to expand. 11,200 in second half of January is well on its way because you have a global tailwind now in the shape of equities raring to go and feeling missed out. We are seeing huge inflows into equity. 


Yes Bank has sent two names to RBI. ET Now has learned that there are two internal candidates. If eventually, Rana Kapoor is replaced by an internal candidate, what do you think will happen to the stock? Also if the successor of Rana Kapoor is an external candidate, what do you think will happen to the stock?
In the short run, Yes Bank has become a trading stock at 160-200. If you do get a positive which the market likes -- an internal candidate -- maybe you get 220 on the upside. But we will wait for the results, the divergence patterns and so on. 

On the down side, it seems to have a lot of buying around that 170 levels. On a fundamental count, it is a good brand and it is a good portfolio stock but you need to weather the storm because it has been in the eye of the storm given that over ownership from foreign institutions at Rs 400 has seen it hit Rs 170. 

I would say status quo and not so much change. The positivity has to come from the divergences and the management guidance on the way forward. 


What is your expectation from TCS given the strong 40% plus up move that we have already seen in the stock all of last year? In the last six months, TCS has been more sedate. Would you say that if the numbers are weak along expected lines and if the stock does correct, it is an opportunity to buy assuming that 2019 has the same kind of momentum as in 2018?
Well that is a good point. It has been the darling of the markets for the last one year but this year it has only flattered to deceive. I think it is richly valued, you have got the bonus, you have got the buyback all in the price. Firstly, I do not see IT being an outperformer. 

Secondly, the rupee as a headwind is now a tailwind or maybe there is status quo and thirdly you have got guidances from Apple and Samsung all over the place for a huge disappointment. As a fallout of that, TCS will definitely be impacted marginally on some businesses. 

At the end, I want to chase industrials where I can get that extra delta. So, we are looking at a whole gamut of stocks including corporate banks like ICICI, Axis, SBI, L&T and Asian Paints. We are also looking at power, PFC, REC, NBCC, NCC. That is where real money is going to be made. TCS is going to be a prime space as a portfolio pick but do not expect market-oriented or below market oriented returns for TCS in this year. 


Do you believe sub 20,000, Eicher is getting to a value zone? Would you buy it right away or would you wait for some more correction in the stocks?
Yesterday, the standout part about IndusInd Bank’s numbers was that credit growth has expanded and their CASA ratio plus the net interest income were very strong. They have given you a very strong pipeline. IndusInd is the largest player in the commercial vehicle segment and that also along with Mr Vinod Dasari’s observations on Ashok Leyland at Rs 94, Eicher at Rs 20,000 and Mahindra & Mahindra at Rs 715 are all three value buys for a 20% upside by this Diwali."

47,2019-01-10,Eicher,"Look for good quality businesses which may not be extremely cheap because good quality businesses do not come 
  
  
  cheap. Rather, they may be reasonably priced, even expensive looking, Vishal Khandelwal, Founder, SafalNiveshak.com, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


We are talking about outlook 2019 but a good investor, before analysing the way forward, always analyse the way back and then reflect back and assess their mistakes. What has been your basic understanding for 2018 because that was a gut-wrenching year for all asset managers. From gold to oil, from timber to coffee, every asset prices has come down.
We met at the start of 2018 and at that time, nobody saw any risk on the horizon and that actually came to play in 2018 when people were not really looking at risks and instead only focussing on returns.

People were buying anything and everything under the sun. That was a huge mistake and it played out in 2018 very well. We suffered from the “recency bias”. It is something that has happened recently and we tried to play it out. We tried to create pattern from that into future. In 2018, we were suffering from what happened in 2017. After what we have seen in 2018, with so many mid and smallcap stocks ravaged and bad businesses actually being thrown off guard, investors have lost a lot of money. That has become the base now and so people are looking very cautiously. Our brains are not wired to emerge as rational investors. We are behaving the same way ever since. I do not see any changes as far as behaviour is concerned and as far as the way markets move in 2019 as well. A lot of mistakes were made in 2018. It will be better for investors as all of us reflect on the mistakes, try not to make the same mistakes and learn from other people’s mistake. 


We are starting the year with some known risks, ie. election, Fed and recognition is also coming that valuations are stretched. The sensible guy would say that this is not the time to buy gold at the price of silver. I am getting good businesses where I am buying gold at the price of diamond. There is a bit of caution this year and that is a differentiating factor.
 Look at this. It takes around 365 days for the earth to orbit around the sun once and it has no relation to the financial markets. But after every orbit, we sit down and talk about what is going to happen till the time the next orbit happens. So, risks are definitely on the horizon. Volatility is a very normal thing for stock markets and despite the fact that volatility is normal and we are going to see more volatility this year, I think it is a normal part of being a stock market investor. 

But the problem is you always get surprised by such volatility. The valuations are still not really in line with what you expect even as a long-term investor. I remember Charlie Munger who says that if you invest in a business with 6% to 8% return on capital and you pay a very cheap price for it and you hold it for 40 years, you are not going to make more than 6% to 8% rate of return annually. But if you buy a business with around 18% to 20% return on capital and you pay an expensive looking price for it and you hold out for 40 years, you are going to make a lot of money out of that. 

The idea for investors for all years and especially for this year is to just keep looking for those good quality businesses which may not be really extremely cheap because good quality businesses do not come cheap. Rather, if they are reasonably priced, even expensive looking, you just buy them and hold them for long term.


That would be consumption right now?
Consumption obviously comes to mind. Then there are businesses where the leverage on the balance sheet may be coming down. They are improving their business per se. Overall for India Inc, the growth has not really happened but there are pockets of small and mid-sized companies which are doing better than what they were doing 10 years back. Look at those opportunities.


When you say reasonably priced, is there a benchmark to qualify reasonable? Eicher Motors came down 15-20%. Maruti came down 10-15%. If any good quality stock comes down 10% and on a long-term chart you will be able to map the kind of cracks that it has seen over a period of time. Is that a good benchmark to go by?
Rather than looking at the return, what is the amount of fall that the stock has seen? I would rather look at it in simple terms and simple parlance. I would rather look at the price to earning ratio for a stock, because a stock which falls from say Rs 100 to Rs 50, may still be expensively priced. 

If I were to just give a simple number, PE is not the right number always for stock valuations. If I have to look at PE numbers, I would look at something priced at 30-35 times as expensive looking in this country assuming that the business is very high quality. But a stock, which even after a fall, is priced at 70-80-100 times price to earnings, I am not going to look at it even if the stock has fallen by 70-80%.


One of the greatest companies on earth, Apple, which has a monopoly, cash, no debt and which is obsessed with getting the consumer right, is trading at 12 time. It makes you wonder what is the benchmark for valuations.
No, things are different outside. Even Apple has been in less than 20 price to earnings for a long period of time. Given the fact that we do not have a lot of options to invest in India in terms of quality businesses, Indian companies have been priced extremely high, especially high quality businesses. There is a huge difference between the US markets and the Indian market.


In India you can buy feeder funds now. That means, an Indian retail investor can buy into four, five, ten good companies companies via a good mutual fund portfolio. If you have a basket of five big Indian companies and five big US companies, which way would you do your capital allocation for next five years? 
Assuming the valuations are right, I would pick probably two Indian companies and three international companies out there in a five-stock portfolio.


You can look at ten…
So make it four and six.


Four Indian?Yes, we can always move the number around. Probably, 5 each would be good.


One more followup on that valuation point is HDFC Bank is trading at 4-4.5 times price to book because everywhere the benchmark is not price to earnings. If it comes down to 3-3.5 times, there is also concern on growth slowdown. How do you draw that balance because then you are paying a cheaper price for slower growth?
You are saying the valuations came down because growth is also coming down. In the long term, a stock’s valuation tracks the growth rate. If I am looking at a business where the growth has come down, I am still looking at the point whether the company is recuperating the growth over a longer period of time. 

I am not looking at a quarterly or an annual decline in growth rate. I am looking at where this company is going to stand maybe 10 years down the line. I am going to buy the stock if I believe that the company is going to be materially better 10 years down the line.


You will buy at 3.5 times?
Yes, for HDFC Bank, I am not so sure but yes it is a good number.


We will have a big unknown in 2019 and that would be the election outcome. What is that one event according to you which could derail the DII inflow that until now has kept the market intact?
Election is the biggest thing that is going to happen this year and that will drive the domestic institutional money into the stock markets. We saw in 2018 that despite the fact that a lot of FIIs pulled money out from India, a lot of DIIs invested and ended with a 0% rate of return for the Sensex. 

DII money in 2019 would be largely dependent on what happens in the elections. Apart from that, nothing is really looking up at this point of time.


HDFC Bank was always expensive and for the quality of management it may remain expensive for a long time. But it has given perhaps the most satisfactory returns on a five, 10 and a 15 year period. On the other side you have got a company like D-Mart, which is expensive and is still giving returns. How does one judge what is right and what is wrong? Some of these are great businesses but price sometimes stops you from buying it. Is that a mistake?
It is a mistake in some sense but we are suffering from hindsight bias here because we are looking at returns from HDFC Bank and D-Mart in hindsight. I would like to bring in Nassim Taleb here who gives an example of a game called the Russian Roulette and he says that this game involves you putting a gun to your head with five empty chambers and only one bullet. Your rate of survival is 5/6 which is 83% on the first shot. The probability of you surviving is huge but what is consequence of you not surviving that shot? You become a statistics, you are dead. 

In the same way, when you are trying to have a foresight on stocks, it is not only important to look at the probability of Asian Paints or HDFC Bank being successful in the future because they have been successful in the past, it is also important to look at the consequences of what happens when there is a one year decline in HDFC Bank or D-Mart’s growth rate, or some new competition comes in. 

So hindsight is good but having a foresight and looking at probability and consequences is a much more important way of looking at and buying such businesses.


What has worked in the past may not work in the future and the classic example here is that after World War I, dividend investment made a comeback. Buffet brought in this entire concept of moat investing. We had the TMT investing which made a comeback. Ten years ago, which was when China was expanding, companies with high debt and growing order book were doing very well. What could be the outsize theme for the next five, 10 years?
I would stick with businesses that have survived over the past 20-30 years. I am not the kind of investor who is looking at fashionable or new era stocks. Of course, there are a lot of opportunities over there.


What about disruption then?
In which sense?


For example, if some of the great brands just cease to exist?
Yes, definitely. I am looking at businesses which are simple. I remember drawing a household picture for my daughter when I was trying to explain her stocks and we outlined around 50 stocks which we interacted with on a daily basis in our households. 

A lot of them were technology in that sense but most of them were not technology. I would still go with businesses which are not prone to disruption. Nobody has any call on what happens in the future. There are so many simple industries that are getting disrupted. But if you stick with businesses which may not be prone to disruption in the future, your risks are taken care of and probably your returns are also going to be taken care of if you buy then at the right valuations.


So not Apple but an HUL?
I would rather put my money on an Apple than on HUL, assuming Apple is a consumer business and not a technology business.


What are you seeing in terms of debt levels and management of debt within the financial sector and some of the utility space? How is the health looking there and are you spotting opportunities?
I do not really understand financials. I stay away from utilities which are regulated by the government. I would not be able to comment on that.


Give me a parting thought, a thought that you have discovered in 2018 as an individual or as an investor and something you want to apply this year?
I turned 40 in 2018 and I realised that after at a certain age in your life, you need to subtract things from your life rather than add things. So 2018 and 2019 is where I want to focus on subtracting more things and this is something which I learned in 2018 when I was turning 40. So focusing more on things which I have already learned, focusing on fewer things and I think trying to do them well is what I would do.."
44,2019-01-10,Eicher,"ETF money has provided a silver lining for Indian markets in 2019. We have to see how it takes us forward, 
Gautam Shroff, Senior V-P and head, sales trading, Edelweiss Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Is the market giving you confidence that in 2019 you will be able to sail through?
2019 began on a good note. Given that the volatility of 2018 is over and ETF money has proved to be a silver lining. India has got the lion’s share of the ETF money that has come in the last one month. While $6.5 billion ETF money has come to emerging markets, India has got about $2.23 billion in the last 30 days. That augurs very well for us and we have to watch how ETF money takes us forward. 


What is this excitement about buying wholesale banks? 
I agree that this has now become a consensus view for some time and we want to wait out for the numbers. The price action has happened and now the results have to be displayed. We will wait and watch. There is deep value in corporate banks but this is not a play for this year. This is a play for the next two, three years given that in the last 7-8 years, these banks went nowhere and are really garnering market share. The change in management has been welcomed by the street.


Do you have a view on Praj Industries? The stock has already scaled up to its 10-year high, but considering it has just been a sleepy ride up until last three months, can one still buy into this stock?
Probably the change in management with a very credible management coming on board gives us a lot of comfort but I would not buy in this euphoria when the stock has already moved 15%. Maybe I would wait for some corrections and add. This is not a small play and it has to be slightly more structural for probably three to six years.


If I say Eicher and just pause, how will you react?
We are finding some value and of late in the last few days we have seen some buyers there. I do not want to say the worst is over but yes, it is an institution that has been built and will come back. They are very competitive in nature so at some point in time it should bottom out somewhere near here. 


Post the merger deal, why has Bandhan come down and Gruh come crashing down?
Gruh was always richly valued and people and especially institutions were always sceptical of the rich valuations that Gruh traded at but once the event has played out, usually they correct a little bit. I would not read too much into Gruh falling because I think the delivery mark there on those names has not been much. It is slightly more speculative in nature and basically sell on news of what happened with Gruh. 


Everyone is bullish on wholesale banks. It is a consensus view, but what about retail banks? Between HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, which one would you buy for the next two years?
For some time, we saw a trade going on in richly priced banks. Price to books were being trimmed and these corporate banks were being bought into. All the fresh money that we saw coming into the market was going towards corporate banks. I would not rule out that people have trimmed a little bit of the richly priced banks, but that is not over and out. 

They will still grow 25-30% easily. Suppose I want to deploy money for about a year, I would stick to an HDFC Bank because I think it will continue to grow and if I have to deploy that money for about two to three years, then I would go with ICICI Bank. 


Are markets likely to get nervous before there’s change of guard at HDFC Bank? By October 2019, the new successor would be announced. Is that the biggest risk?
It will be a question on many people’s mind but it does not worry us at all. HDFC Bank is what it is today because of the processes that they have created. Given that the structure, the presence and the way the leaders have created the bank, I would not worry too much on that count."
49,2019-01-11,Eicher,"The IT sector momentum is likely to continue at 2.5 to 5.5% constant currency growth, Yogesh Mehta, V-P,  
   
   
   Motilal Oswal Financial Services, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 

What did you make of the TCS commentary?
TCS numbers are good and digital revenue has grown wonderfully well. Even retail media and BFSI are improving and rest of the part is also improving. Overall, if we compare with year-on-year growth rate, those are decent enough and if we compare sequentially also, the growth rate is very good. 

Other income is one part which needs to be watched out for it has substantially increased. That is why the PAT margins are on the higher side vis-à-vis EBITDA margins which is a bit disappointing, maybe a 5% declines in our estimates. It seems that higher ROA, ROCE and the capital redeployment is the one key criteria and the visibility on growth for the next two years on the US, Latin America and UK, which has surprisingly moved up by 20-22.5% in this quarter. 

We believe that 9%-10% growth trajectory for the next two financial years is very much achievable and hence we believe that on the PE multiple side 19 times FY20 and 21 times FY21 is very much justified. We do not foresee any significant disappointment or immediate reaction on the stock. 


But do you think that what TCS says and does would have a meaningful impact on the rest of the sector? What is your pecking order within IT?
TCS is a benchmark leader and have largest top line PAT numbers and revenue numbers. For Infosys, we need to watch out for BFSI and retail segment and the guidance could increase from 6% to 7%. That needs to be watched. 

Overall, in IT sector, it seems that Infosys will also be in line with the expectation of 1.5-1.7% sequential constant currency growth. The numbers are already estimated at this range and will deliver that much. Ongoing US and China trade war stance needs to be watched out for FY19 and FY20 numbers for this. If currency movement -- which has seen 8.5% overall fall for the last quarter -- sustains at this level, then it is a different thing but otherwise further depreciation or appreciation in currency will marginally impact the estimates for all IT companies including TCS. But we believe that the IT sector momentum will continue at 2.5 to 5.5% constant currency growth rate. 


What is the call on Eicher Motors at 20,000 currently?
Since last time also, we had a conversation that Rs 70,000 was the plateau for seven to nine months continuously on the running of the money sales number. It tapered to Rs 58,000 in December and the waiting period is also now cutting down and the production is also slowing down due to demand. That way, at around Rs 20,000 level, we may see some increase in demand after two, three quarters. Till then, the flattish number and the 20-25% growth rate will sustain for at least FY19 next quarter. 

For FY20 we need to really see that when the new launches come and how the response turns out to be. We believe that it would be a wait and watch kind of approach at current level. A technical bounce back could be possible on the fundamental approach. It will be a stagnant kind of a situation and one would not be really keen to invest into Eicher Motor at this point in time."
50,2019-01-11,Eicher,"Reliance is going to lead the markets in the next two years. There is phenomenal unlocking potential there, 
Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Will 2019 be a happy year in terms of returns?
Absolutely, I have no doubts about that. I have complete conviction that this year is going to be a good year for most of the emerging markets and India is going to stand out in the emerging market universe. My hypothesis is not based on domestic events or domestic fundamentals. A lot of other things are going to be positive tailwinds there also but it is more an emerging market trade that is going to be functioning right across this year. 

We are going to see developed markets correcting, plateauing and a good amount of money starting to move towards the emerging markets. What convinces me more is what we heard from the US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell yesterday. He is not that hawkish in the sense that he has sent a clear message to the markets that there may not be any rate hikes this year. That is going to be a positive event for liquidity and valuations across markets, particularly India, are now much more reasonable compared to what they were in 2018.


Most people are also saying that 2019 is going to be a market of two halves; first six months may be impacted by election dynamics and in the second half of 2019, it is going to be a completely different equity landscape altogether. Do you not believe that the first half is going to be a very trying time?
Yes, of course, volatility is something we will have to live with but that is more of a friend of an investor and an opportunist rather than being something to worry about. 

If you have got your conviction ideas in place and you have your disciplined levels of entering positions in place particularly investment positions, volatility normally turns out to be your friend. In case of extreme volatility, you get extreme levels which are always good to both enter and exit. 

So there will be volatility in the first half particularly because of the general elections. But at the same time, we have a floor on prices and because of that valuations are reasonable. 

If they fall anymore, quite a few stocks will get compelling. Leave aside the Nifty because it is skewed towards many stocks, across-the-board, you will find lots of attractive stocks to buy, if they fall another 10-20% because of some other events.


Per se, an election year has not been bad for the markets historically. Is it going to be a similar case that despite volatility in the first half, you could see a catch up led by global cues and local factors into the second half of the year? Also, what would be the returns?
On an absolute basis, one can expect 15% return on Nifty you from the current levels. But if you start looking at individual opportunities in both large caps and a good number of midcaps and smallcaps, if you have got your conviction buys and have done your homework, you can target 30-40% in many stocks.

I have been repeatedly saying that after this aggressive correction, beginning September mid to about mid December, when things have stabilised a bit, we will have a large number of good quality stocks correcting 30-50% in the midcap and smallcap universe. 

For them to bounce back and give an absolute return of 30-40% from the current levels is quite possible. Yes, you will have volatility, you may have them going down occasionally 10% more because of some other events that are not relevant to the companies in particular. But yes, to cut a long story short, on an index basis, 15% can be expected and on specific portfolios and specific stocks, 30-40% can easily be made in this market this calendar year.


In order to befriend this volatility, what should be the right tactical approach for one’s portfolio?
It is going to be a mix. Look at some contrarian plays, ones that have not performed in the last two years but are starting to sort out their problems.

Good quality, top three, four PSU banks have more or less provided for all their NPAs and are catering to corporate borrowers. SBI, BoB and Canara Bank look good to me. These are some contrarian plays to look at. Within consumption, there are companies like Dabur, Marico which would give returns. It is a kind of a mixed basket that one would have to look at. 

Obviously it goes without saying that in most of these companies, I have a vested interest. I would be invested in it or would have recommended to my clients. Some specific theme is unlikely to play out big time in 2019. There will be pockets of huge opportunity because of this volatility and you just need to identify your stocks and buy them at right levels.

I do not get scared if they fall 10-15% because in markets like ours as well as in western markets, stocks can correct 30-40% and then again bounce back and give you that expected return over three, five years is quite normal now. 


It is interesting that you are talking about PSBs at a time when everyone seems to be rushing to buy ICICI and Axis Bank. But within PSBs, would you stick to the SBIs of the world or is it a more bottom up approach within PSBs that you are adopting?
It includes SBI and the rest would be bottom up. I mentioned a few names which are well positioned now. In particular, I have three names which I am sure will do well this year since they are good banks with a very large, good customer base, have cleaned up pretty well and have compelling valuations. These would be BoB, Canara and PNB. All three have the potential of giving good returns from current levels in this year. 


TCS results are out. What did you pick out of those earnings and how do you see the earnings trajectory move from here? Do you get a sense that FY19 would pave the way for stronger earnings profile which would give 15% return on the index?
I am glad you raised up the issue because even there I have got that wrong for the last few quarters because I was expecting an uptick much earlier than what we are now projecting. But I think that the first half of FY20 would actually show us very robust earnings. Earnings this December as well as March quarters maybe patchy in some pockets here and there.

But June onwards, things will start looking much better because a lot of political uncertainty is out of the way and more than that, some of the work that the government has fanned out over the last year and year and a half in a lot of sectors, is actually going to start showing up in company bottom lines towards FY20. 

The earning uptick in FY20 is surely going to be there. My estimate and my projection is that as early as first half of FY20, we will see a very good earnings uptick and robust numbers coming in. Analysts will start reworking their projections. 

Another important thing that I am basing my hypothesis on is because since real interest rates in India are very high at this point of time, with the change in RBI leadership, a new look would be taken to interest rates, liquidity, etc, of which you are already seeing the first signs in liquidity.

I expect this year to see much better, more dovish monetary policy and much more dovish stand both in terms of liquidity as well as interest rates from the Reserve Bank of India.

Capital formation, capital investment in the private sector will start looking up and that is going to happen in the second half of the financial year.


Would you believe that the best is behind us in the IT sector? The A listers have already made you 35 -40 odd per cent per piece?
Calendar year 19 is not going to be the year for technology outperformance, but you cannot ignore the sector. You would want to have it on your portfolio. In my personal portfolio level, I would be underweight IT for the next 12 to 18 months. It has played out as a pretty good defensive and another reason to base my hypothesis on is I do not think they will have the currency tailwinds anymore because I see a weaker dollar going ahead.

If we see a weaker dollar, it obviously means that the benefit of the estimates of 74-75 really would not fall in place this time for INR-dollar. If that is the case, the IT tailwinds, because the currency will not be there over the next year and a half or so.


Month after month, you are seeing auto sales numbers decline. Eicher is available at sub-20,000 now. Maruti has fallen off significantly from its peak and the same can be said across two-wheelers and commercial vehicles too. Is this an opportunity to buy into any of these names or would you wait for the first signs of a revival first?
I would wait it out because products, sectors, companies all run through a real lifecycle, a curve which takes us back and forth, up and down. In the automobile sector, we are now at some kind of real radical change that is going to pan out. It is that change which the sector both in terms of the producers and consumers are adjusting to, whether it is talk on electrical vehicles or move to other technologies. 

We are seeing adjustments on those levels and we cannot expect auto numbers to improve continuously. For the last probably 10-20 quarters, the numbers have improved. At some level, sectors and industries slow down. That is the phase that we are going through over the last few quarters and particularly last two quarters. 

This is going to play out over the next few more quarters in my opinion. I may be wrong but my assessment is that there is not too much of an upside left in any of the larger auto companies right now to really to take aggressive bets on your portfolio. You may have an allocation to it but at the same time I do not think I would be overweight or have substantial positions in some of the auto companies both because of product cycle dynamics that I spoke about and also because today we are running into major technology changes and industry and consumers are adjusting to new trends. This phase has to play out and before any clarity emerges.


Reliance is not so much a refinery now but retail as well as Rel Jio and everybody is pegging their hopes on the value unlocking story in Reliance. Is that what you are seeing as RIL story from here?
Absolutely. Reliance is going to lead the markets in the next two years. There is phenomenal unlocking potential there. The businesses there have now started to mature particularly in the Jio telecom business, have started to stabilise. We are seeing numbers kicking in. There are questions on revenue and profitability but the size and the whole industry dynamics have to be considered as well.

It is a matter of time when there will be huge unlocking opportunities in Reliance, in both retail and Jio. It is a matter of time whether it happens within this calendar year or this financial year or the next one. 

I have been very optimistic about Reliance for the last year, year and a half and I am glad I have got it right. Even now if someone invests in it and stays invested for two-three years, he can actually beat the market returns by a huge margin. Reliance is going to take leadership in the Indian equity markets at least."

  to do it over the next five-seven years, Siddhartha Lal, CEO & MD, Eicher Motors, tells Ajaya Sharma of ET Now. Edited excerpts:


We have seen a period of extraordinary growth for Eicher Motors and over two decades, from one big bulky looking bike, Royal Enfield has transformed into sophisticated machines with tech upgrades and sleek designs. But the company seems to have hit rough weather now and the market is concerned whether this period of extraordinary growth is coming to an end. How would you like to explain to your shareholders about the growth trajectory and the recent bit of slowdown in numbers?
We have had a tremendous run, something which one could not have imagined 10 years ago. Compounded over the last eight-nine years, we have had 40% growth and that creates a strain as well. That is not easy to manage. It is very nice problem to have but it is still a problem to manage.


It is like riding a tiger…
It is, but it has been exceptional for us. At different points of time, we had to focus on different aspects of the business. The first part came in 2010, when we had done a lot of ground work on the product and distribution because that got us here. 

From 2010 onwards, when real growth started, we had to focus on our manufacturing and supplier base and by 2015 that was totally transformed. It was at a totally different level. In that time, we put up a very strong distribution base and a very strong foundation for Royal Enfield and made the jump from 50,000 to 800,000 plus. In every journey like this, there are always a few ups and downs. 

After eight years of stupendous and nearly exponential growth, sure we have had a bit of let us say clouds and hiccups, but that is normal. A month here, three months there. Now we are becoming a normal company again. Earlier, we used to be quite abnormal in the sense the market was up, market was down, it did not affect us, we kept going up. So, really this is a point where perhaps you could say when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. 

We are also rolling up our sleeves and we have been preparing for let us say war in the time of peace in the sense. So we have been doing our homework. We are an exceedingly focussed company. We do not do anything else. We do a few old school modern classic gorgeous motorcycles, that is what we do and it is a motorcycling culture that we are creating. So nothing changes. It is just that we do need to reorient a few things here and there which is part of life and we are getting external signals. 

But we like to keep it raw as well, so external signals come to us. There are shareholders that you talked about. There is media and that is great that they are reacting. They are telling us what they think. It does not mean we are going to react immediately...


You are right. And sometimes I would say that the stock market becomes a little harsh towards a company. The question is whether you are still on a growth trajectory with a growing base or not. How would you like to say that the trajectory is intact?
The stock markets have been extremely kind to us or supported us a lot over the last decade and this is what happens. When there is one negative, then you extrapolate 10 years to the negative. When there were a few positive signals, then you extrapolated 10 years to the positive. That is generally the trend. But I take all of this with a pinch of salt. We keep things very real. It would have been very easy. Everyone is reacting terribly to our December numbers where we are down 13%. Fair enough! I can understand why but it would have gone totally unnoticed if we just pushed 5,000-6,000 more motorcycles into the market.

I think that is what all other companies do but we do not do that. That is not what we want to do. We want to keep it real. We want to make sure that inventories are right. They are not there to satisfy a couple of investors or media. But that is not how we operate because we are looking at this from extremely long-term perspective and a few blips here and there will only weed out people who are not perhaps very long-term investors. That is okay with me.

I am a long-term investor and I hope all the others there are similar and they believe our story and our story is still intact. We are on the premiumisation trend. We are doing gorgeous things in India and in the world market. We have 850 plus stores. There is nothing like this in India. 


Let us analyse the factors which have come together and been responsible for this -- the tech upgrades, the ABS related issues, the Chennai plant strike, the insurance cost which has ownership pattern and of course maturing of some of the markets along with the Kerala floods. How have all these factors impacted? Clubbed together, they appear big.
It is not in our nature to justify and make excuses because that is not the point of all of this. Sure there have been lot of individual things but they have always been there. Earlier, what happened was that we had a huge order book which could buffer any individual problem. 

Five years ago, there was a problem like Kerala floods. But, then we had an order book in other markets which could take care of that. Sure there have been individual areas like certain markets have matured. But honestly, for me the real thing which has happened has taken some time and it will some more time for the market to react to the new normal which includes increased price of motorcycles, increased costs because of insurance and other factors like the anti-lock breaking system (ABS) etc.

What has happened is that normally 3% to 5% cost increase every year can be easily passed on. Customers really do not mind. It is part of inflation which happens with everything. But it is tough to pass on 15% increase. We have also learnt from that process that maybe we should have broken it up in more steps, but now we are here. So really it was a bit of that which is a bit more abnormal because otherwise individual market issues will always happen. 

In UP something happens, here something happens, election plus/minus who knows! But those are things that normally we just weather. But it is only the price issue that has affected us a bit. But now we are getting back on track. In December, we had flushed as many 2018 bikes as possible. Of course, there are a few left in the market but the idea was to lower inventory so that we could flush out bikes and people wanted 2019 motorcycles.


There was talk of inventory build up at select dealerships which has never been the case before. Folklore has it that Enfield always have had 8-9 months of waiting period. But that seem to have come down.
Of course 8-9 months is gone long ago and it has come down to 3-4 months now. In some models, the waiting period is 15-20 days. Some models are available off the shelf. Inventory is at extremely normal levels and in fact much less than any other two-wheelers. But we do have inventory now. So there is no pile-up of inventory. But we have some inventory which is also good. Earlier, everyone used to shout and scream shadi season is coming! People want bikes immediately. We used to miss out on those opportunities. Now we should be able to catch some of those but there are other issues which come under focus.


Let us talk about breakdown of India market. Kerala is a highly penetrated market. How are trends over there? Even Maharashtra and Karnataka were highly penetrated. But you are still scratching the surface in large markets like UP. How are you analysing your big, maturing markets? Which are the ones showing opportunity in terms of breakthrough?
Mature markets are exemplified by Kerala where we are the biggest motorcycle brand -- ahead of all the Indo-Japanese style motorcycles -- with around 30 plus percent share. There, every third motorcycle which is sold is a Royal Enfield. It is like your Apple phone. People aspire to it. People are able to access it. The income levels are higher there. The distribution is cracking there. The residual value, the resale price of a Royal Enfield is extremely good. So, it is a very liquid asset when you are buying Royal Enfield in Kerala. It is a positive sign. 

In a market like Kerala, it is not about brand recognition. When I say Kerala, I mean I am now extrapolating about south or maybe the more of developed markets including even Punjab and a few other southern markets and a few cities like Delhi, Bombay etc, all of which are very mature markets for us. 

In these markets what is very important now is the work that we are doing on the development front of rides and community. That that is what people are really interested in and engaging in and the other is new products. A classic 350 has now nearly become the new normal.


Your Classic 350 still gets more than 50% of your overall volumes. You seem to have rejigged that?
In markets like Kerala, the Interceptor, the GT and the Himalayan play a much larger role than they maybe in UP. For example, we have a huge population of people over the last eight, 10 years. We have got 3.5 million people riding Royal Enfield motorcycles in India and if you take Kerala, that has got a disproportionate share. 

These guys who have been riding Royal Enfield for so long, have been asking us for more. They want to upgrade. So the same way that we were able to tap the 100-150-200cc market over the last decade, we are now going to tap our guys who want an upgrade and there is a lot of them out there in Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. There are a lot these guys who have been riding Royal Enfield.


Talk to us about how GT and Interceptor potentially could be international offerings for you. Outside India, people are used to bigger bikes. Biking means big bikes and do you think some of the international markets which you have already stepped into you, can do a India over the next five, eight years and give you the next leg of growth?
That is absolutely the plan. We have been scouring the markets. We have been participating in international markets for a long time now, a bit more under the radar. I would break the global markets into two parts, just for our convenience; one is developed countries US, UK, Europe, Japan, Australia where there is culture of big motorcycles. But the market is small. The overall motorcycle market is not in millions per year, it is in the tens and hundreds or thousands per year

 And that is where we already have a decent distribution, a brand recall and all that. What is happening is that these motorcycles fit in perfectly. The reviews in markets around the world in developed countries have been absolutely fantastic because we have just hit the spot in the right manner at the right time with these modern Classic motorcycles. 

We expect really good growth there but developed countries are not going to be the next India. I do not mind if they are but I do not think they will be the next India. The next India is going to come from markets like Southeast Asia, Latin America, and we have put up a store in some of these markets with the product available at the right price, the price which would be there if it were selling it at CKD. In southeast Asia, we have now zeroed in on Thailand as our nodal market because that is where we expect that the upgraders will come from because there also the middle, big bike market is vastly underserved.


Let us talk about the competitive landscape then because there is a company which has come up with another vintage kind of an offering. One of the cousins of Royal Enfield of last few decades has come back in the form of Jawa Motorcycles but I have seen some of the international companies put their products near Himalayan also. How are you analysing the competitive landscape in particular with these two?
We take competition very seriously. We study, understand, ride, I have ridden pretty much every motorcycle out there, not in the very big motorcycle category but basically everything which is either a source of growth for us, which are smaller motorcycles or direct competitors.

We understand the motorcycle, we understand the product, we understand the idea, their distribution, the business model, all of that. So we put a lot of attention there but our strategy is not determined by other people. Over the last 10 years, we have had an outstanding growth. We are the most profitable from a percentage perspective motorcycle, perhaps even automobile brand in the world. There will be competition and there will be guys saying I want a piece of that pie and that is what is happening and we have had competitors come in from all sides. 

We have competitors coming from the Indians, the Japanese, the Indo-Japanese, the Americans, Europeans, all of that. So there is competitors all over and we are competing with some of the biggest companies in the world. And, of course, everyone comes in with a different angle. So there are some who try and copy you or ape you...more copycat type of chaps. 

Then there are some who try and take the market to a different space. That is what competition tries to do. As far as we are concerned, we have some strengths which are on a totally different level. Our distribution, our brand, our residual value, our understanding of consumer, our community all of those things are at a totally different level. Our aftermarket, all of that.


It will take decades for them to build all of that.
So one is that. The other point is people just expect to come in and do something interesting but it takes perseverance and that is what we are there for. We have a single-minded focus. Other companies that you talk about always hedge their bets. They have 10 different things that they try and do. Hopefully, one will stick. But that is not our approach. Our approach is we do one thing. We do it superbly and we move people in and that has also been a testament to what the new generation of products of Royal Enfield are about. It is about things like the Interceptor and that is a totally different generation of product.


What is your broad vision for the next five-seven years? What is on the anvil? The UCE platform? What kind of upgrades or big message would you like to give to the shareholder community? 
Of course. On the one hand, from that perspective, the first thing which comes to everyone’s mind because we are a motorcycle company is motorcycles. I will answer that first. But we are not only about motorcycles. Royal Enfield extends way, way beyond just the sum of the motorcycles that we have. But from a motorcycling perspective let us just play it out. One is that we have these new platforms the Twins and in the Twins, we have the Interceptor, we have the GT. We will certainly have variance of these. We will certainly have other motorcycles on these platforms over the years like we do in our singles. This is just the start of them. 

Interceptor is a Roadster style motorcycle. This is one that is going to sell the most and this is going to sell in volumes. When you sit on it, you have the right stance, all of that. So this is the main offering from the Twins right now. It will evolve over the next many years. This will get into a BS-VI format. This is really a global motorcycle. We expect it to do excellently around the world but also do the extreme heavy lifting in India for upgraders, especially in more matured markets and that is the role for the Twins. 

After a rocky start, the BS-IV Himalayan is doing really well. You read the reviews. We had a review from one of the top magazines just a few days ago. The Himalayan was compared to a German one and a Japanese one. Himalayan comes out on top in a shootout of adventure tourers.


And that is why perhaps BMW is trying to bring…
But we come out on top. We come out on top of them. We come out on top of everybody from a context of lower mid-sized adventure tourers because the Himalayan has really hit the spot. And now we are seeing traction again. Again Himalayan was a shot in the dark for us in terms of the fact that there was no market for adventure tourers when we come in. But now, we are seeing a good traction for Himalayan.


You had done about 40% plus in last 10 years. Now the base is bigger and a strategy is also evolving with new products. Last decade, you were only a domestic company. Now you are evolving into an international company. Do you think the runway of growth is open or would there be a meaningful downgrade before the next big leg of growth comes in?
Honestly, if you were having this discussion in 2010 and you asked me about my future prospects, I am 100% sure I would not have said that over the next 10 years we will grow at 40% compounded. That was absolutely not expected. It is impossible for me or anyone to predict what will happen. I can only tell you what we are working up towards and these are the areas which will give us that delta.

As far as we look at it, we have had this outstanding period of growth of 40% over the last eight-ten years and that certainly has started slowing down over the last few years because of various factors including maturity of markets.

But still, the Royal Enfield is on the right end of the curve. We are on the premiumisation trend in India which is not going to abate. People who are riding cheap-end commuter motorcycles will want to go up to bigger and better motorcycles and that market is bound to grow. 

We believe that if we can pull off our story of the premiumisation trend through products, distribution, community and all the work that we are doing, we should certainly be growing at and targeting double the rate of growth of the Indian motorcycle industry. 

Now that may not happen every single year and that might be a bit more patchy or choppy than earlier, but if the industry is growing at 7%, we should grow at 14%. Because we are driving premiumisation, that is the kind of thing we would like to do over the next five-seven years. Growing at double the industry over a sustained period is no mean feat and the compounding rate will be absolutely fantastic because our base is very large now.

The delta on top of that will be our international business which is still at early stages but we are seeing signs now because we have started working on distribution.


If you hit a jackpot in some of the developed markets which may turn half of what India has turned for you, that will be the big delta perhaps.
Yes absolutely and I have been running this company for 18 years and now I finally feel like I totally get it because it takes time to get things and now I really feel that you are able to see when you are in the flow, when things are going on, how to manage certain things.


Now you can take more shots…
Yes, on one hand, and on the other hand we keep bringing in ideas and thoughts from outside to just to revitalise this because maybe some of what I am doing or what we are doing in our company is very strong and maybe it is a bit staid, a bit old fashioned. So, we bring in a lot of new energy but yes I are at that point where Royal Enfield has had its big growth phase. We have put in all the pieces and we had the luxury of time in the first round. We had 10 years where we were under the radar, no one cared about Royal Enfield from 2000 to 2010 and then we started growing. 

What I want to do is make sure that we do not get too taken in by our daily pressures and Royal Enfield continues as an efficiency machinery for value creation. But that will mean new product, new markets, new ideas, new ways of working with consumers and new way of forming the communities. We put in a lot of energy into those and that is how we want to take things further."
52,2019-01-14,Eicher,"Volume growth, slightly better margin profile augurs well for FMCG sector, Gurmeet Chadha, co-founder, 
Complete Circle Consultants, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


How do you read into IT majors -- TCS and Infosys -- in terms of the kind of results that they have delivered? What is the pecking order now?
Interesting set of numbers and it was broadly the same. We saw TCS posting a little less than 2% revenue growth in constant currency terms. Infy was a tad higher and we saw the margin compression with TCS coming in at around 25% and Infy at 22.6%. 

What was heartening to me was three things. The traditional verticals for both -- BFSI -- saw a third of the revenue grow. It grew higher for Infosys vis-à-vis TCS. The utilities did well. The digital business obviously again did well. TCS was a little better off. More importantly, the deal momentum was good. Both the IT majors had a good deal momentum and announcing some more client wins. Infosys in particular gave a revenue guidance which could slightly bridge the valuation gap it had with TCS. It was almost at a 20% discount. 

Now with TCS correcting and Infy in all likelihood doing a little better, that gap should over a period of time shrink. I am not too bearish on IT. One has to watch out if the midcap IT names are under pressure because we have seen the margin pressure largely on account of two reasons --supply crunch and increase in both onsite and offsite cost. One has to be careful in picking midcap IT names.


What do you do with D-Mart now? The numbers have not been impressive. Could we see further derating in the stock? It is already down 10.5%, sub-1400.
Yes that is possible. We have seen that if you do not buy growth at a reasonable price, some of the fancied names come under pressure. We saw that with Page Industries, Eicher and now this is the second quarter where D-Mart saw a margin compression. In fact, if you do the breakup, it was largely on account of two factors. One was obviously the price reduction because the management wants to give the maximum value for money to the retail customers. Second was also the higher interest cost because of the NCDs and all which they have been issuing. 

I do not see the trend reversing immediately. For a long-term investor, it might be a sensible strategy to wait it out. Let it find a good level. It is good if you have to play the Indian retail story. It is one of the top picks there but it is still pricey. One has to wait for it to consolidate a bit and then may be use the dips to accumulate.


What is your expectation from FMCG largely and staples in particular? 
I am positive on FMCG despite valuations being stretched primarily because of three factors. A) As we get into the election year, you will see heightened spending especially rural focussed spending. There are already talks of farm income going up and some universal basic income coming through. 

Every election in India is like a mini QE. We see a lot of liquidity getting created and typically it is pretty positive. Also we are seeing volume growth. If Dabur numbers are seen as bit of a laggard, we saw 8% volume growth for Dabur as well. Lever obviously had double digit growth. Also, the FMCG entry barriers are very high in India. Just to give you an example, a Lever which does not really talk about the distribution strength has about 10 million outlets. That is a staggering distribution reach for anybody else to imitate and get into. 

We saw Patanjali initially posing a threat but now even those numbers seems to be coming off and the one who makes the first mover advantage in spaces like FMCG in India tends to stay. If you see China, Unilever has not been able to beat P&G despite all its effort. In India, because they came early, they are doing much better. 

Second, the commodity prices, both food and non-food, will remain soft. The WPI numbers are clearly showing the trend which could aid margins. So, volume growth, slightly better margin profile augurs well for FMCG.


What are you hoping to hear from Reliance?
I think it is in price. You may not see a lot of incremental positive news flows as far Reliance is concerned. We want to see the gross refining margins. With the kind of fluctuation you have seen in crude, chances of inventory losses are higher but all depends on how adapt they are in handling that.

For Reliance, traditionally the gross refining margins are 400 to 500 bps higher than the Singapore benchmark. Also I would interested in seeing the Jio numbers. There were news of it crossing 400 million subscribers. It would be interesting to see the ARPU if there is any improvement there and I personally think that Reliance is a good play on data and content. 

In India, we have a very limited play on content. We saw Netflix releasing a series called Birdbox last week and it had 45 million views which probably were more than the live sales of the Harry Potter series. We genuinely have no proper content play in India as far as listed space is concerned. Reliance possibly could fit that bill but it is a more long-term call not immediately from the result perspective.


What is your outlook on the metal space as a whole? Would it be a complete avoid on the back of concerns with respect to pricing and the overall global headwinds?
Largely avoid, as it is very cyclical. The Fed is tightening almost $200 billion every four months. That tantamounts to a rate hike every quarter even if they do not do a rate hike. We saw China export numbers for December being abysmally low. 

In auto for example, China for the first time degrew. So there is slowdown in global growth as well as China slowing down. China accounts for 50% commodities It does not look to be a very happy space to be in. 

Also some of the Indian names, where they have taken debt at the very wrong stage of the cycle, and have not done enough deleveraging for me to give comfort on a long term basis on earnings would be an avoid. There could be some select plays you can do which are high dividend yielding like a Coal India, Hindustan Zinc. So some tactical plays are possible but you cannot take a fundamental call. It is best to avoid especially if the macros are looking weak.


There is visible growth in certain pockets. One of the pocket which you mentioned is FMCG. Which are the other pockets where you are seeing growth taking place irrespective of the global backdrop?
Just to name a few, there is the niche financial space. For example, the life insurance vertical. Our top pick is HDFC Life and SBI Life. HDFC Life in particular. The new business premium is growing at 22% which is the highest in the industry. Their ROEV (Return on Enterprise Value) is again at about 22% which is top notch. 

The second pick in the space is asset management business. It looks very good. Mutual funds are again growing 20% year on year. Every three-four years, AUMs are doubling with the financialisation of savings playing on. So niche financials is one. 

I also like some plays where we have seen a good price correction and where softer commodity prices can translate into and with better pricing can translate into material gains. I like Page Industries at these levels. One can possibly try and accumulate and this is a space where the market will see a secular growth. It is a $5 billion industry right now the inner wear where men inner wear is about 1.5 billion and women inner wear is 3.5 billion. The industry is growing very fast. 

Apart from Jockey, Page has done tie-ups with Speedo which is into swimwears. There is a lot of focus on kids innerwear and terry towels which is again a niche place to be in. We can see good volume growth along with very high margin because this is a premiumisation story. These are the two picks from my end."

54,2019-01-15,Eicher,"In 2019, hopefully we will go through with some air pockets, some speed bumps but nothing close to a disaster, 
Ashwini Agarwal, Portfolio Manager, Ashmore Investment Management, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


It looks like all the concerns in the world for US markets are over and Indian markets are chugging along. It is good to see that flows have stabilised. But is this as good as it gets because in terms of news, in terms of bond yields, in terms of rupee stability, in terms of liquidity we have got everything on our side?
You are absolutely right. A lot of things have fallen into place and that is why the market seems to have done very well in December and the early part of January. But the one big concern which is looming globally and in India as well is sustenance of growth. 

The growth rates are under pressure globally as well as in India. In India, we have two additional headwinds in the sense that fiscal deficit for the government has been running higher than expected. There is a limited amount of headroom for the government to spend more money and on the demand side, we are seeing a significant slowdown in demand arising out of lower agricultural incomes, thanks to poor food crop prices as well as the NBFCs being unable to lend and finance a lot of consumer products like automobiles for instance or even new homes in some instances. 

The slowdown is something that we need to keep a watch on but yes I agree that on the positive side, the risks of an unruly selloff seem to be more contained now as compared to how we were looking at things in October or November.


What is the way forward now? 2018 frankly was not a stock picker’s year. It was a year where if you bought largecap stocks like TCS, Reliance and HUL, you hit a homerun.
I believe in India, it is always a stock picker’s year. Even last year it was a stock picker’s year. Midcap IT did phenomenally well. There were certain other areas where the market gave a nice opportunity to make some money. Of course, the broad selloff in the small and midcap stocks did hurt the traditional stock picking and here there will be a lot more opportunities this year because in the mid and smallcap space, valuations are beginning to look very interesting. Earnings growth and margin improvement appears to be on the cards. 

You will see a lot of stock picking opportunities in the mid and smallcap space. Even in the largecap space, there will be some amount of rotation because if you look at companies and valuations, you will see extremes both on high valuations as well as on low valuations. There is a set of companies that nobody wants to invest in and there is a set of companies everybody is deeply invested into, where valuations are very high. So, the valuations disparity appears to me as a place for stock picking. So, 2019 will offer more choice by way of stock picking than 2018 did. 


There is all talk and hype around the big Brexit vote tonight. There is a lot of talk as to whether or not there is a going to be a hard Brexit, soft Brexit. Nobody knows which way this deal is going to really go. Do you think this could spell chaos in global markets and thereby rub off on us also?
I do not think so because the Brexit part is being very closely watched. Let us see what happens today. But our sense is that that the event is very significantly priced in. Number two, on the global side policy makers across the board have started to take notice of softer growth and that is starting to get priced into the market place via lower interest rate and that is something that people are starting to work towards. 

Both those things tell me that a big selloff globally is probably not something that I should worry about at this point in time. We also think that the weaker dollar which should be the story for 2019 is overall a positive for the emerging market story. We see fairly good traction in China in terms of policymakers’ desire to boost the local demand and economy. I hope that we will see more constructive data flow out of China as the year progresses. 

The numbers have not been anything to write home about till now but hopefully as the year progresses things will improve. We hope these kind of slower growth and pressures will help rapprochement between the US and China. Overall, we feel 2019 should be a year which is not a very big accident but hopefully we will go through with some air pockets, some speed bumps but nothing close to a disaster. Let us see how it goes but it is all open out there.


Last evening, we got the retail inflation data. It has cooled to an 18-month low. On Friday, the IIP cooled off to a 17-month low. Is the premise getting stronger for a February rate cut by the RBI?
Yes, we think that there is enough room for a monetary stimulus to be introduced. We do not think there is any room for the government to provide more fiscal stimulus to the economy. But in terms of real interest rates being high, that is a valid concern and we hope to see a rate cut in February. 

Having said this, the read through on inflation is also quite mixed because while the headline CPI and WPI numbers are coming in lower than expected, the core inflation continues to be reasonably stable. As the low food prices get built into the base effect, inflation later in the year will start to look up. While we expect maybe one or two rate cuts in the first half of this year, the room for very aggressive monetary easing is also fairly limited from a medium-term perspective.


One of the points to highlight in terms of an investment philosophy is that NBFC rebound will drive auto sales. Do you think that valuation adjustment that we are seeing in autos is now a compelling buy with liquidity crunch getting resolved?
I sincerely hope so because the liquidity concerns around NBFCs have largely dissipated. The growth will remain softer for the next couple of months but after that, hopefully the liquidity in the system will allow the NBFCs to start growing again and if that happens, we should see knock on effect on auto demand. 

Structurally, I do not see any reason why we should be significantly bearish on auto demand in the long run in India. Transportation is a key personal need. We do have some improvement in public transport infrastructure happening in some of the large cities but by and large it is woefully inadequate in all parts of India. 

Personal transportation will continue to drive demand for two wheelers and demand for cars. In trucks as well, we see a reasonably stronger 2019 especially ahead of the April 1, 2020 deadline for the new emission norms. So I think there will be some build up in demand later this year. 

Normalisation of NBFC finances will be a driver for auto demand in our view and as you mentioned, stocks have corrected in certain areas. They do look quite attractive to us.


It could be the reverse also on the auto demand front. As new emission norms kick in, for the first six months, more than demand you could see discounts because they will have to get their inventory out. So, next six months auto companies will not make money because they would be throwing bikes and cars at a price which is much below the average margins?
It is possible. I have not looked much more deeply into this situation as to when does the new products start rolling out and whether there would be hefty discounts offered to clear inventory?

However, I do not believe that the inventory is so deep and so large in the system that heavy discounting will take place. Also, my case for a recovery is a little back ended towards the end of 2019 rather than in the first half. The next few months could continue to be soft for autos because NBFCs have not started to grow yet. The auto trade in my view is a 2019 trade but with a back-ended view. It is probably not going to play out in the first quarter and maybe not even the first six months. But honestly we do not know whether there will be this aggressive discounting.


Another point that you have highlighted is cherry picking in pharma as outlook is improving. In what ways are you seeing signs of change in the sector? 
There are two parts to pharma; one is that the pricing environment in the US has been so severe in the last two years that unless the pricing environment improves, you will start to see product shortages emerge. 

We are hearing this from a multiple number of CEOs of pharma companies both in India and overseas. This was mentioned by two CEOs during the earnings conference calls for the September quarter in India and of late, you have seen similar noise bites coming out of the US. To me, that provides some hope that at least on the US pricing side you will start to see some improvement. 

Second, you will start to see some follow through of the weaker rupee starting to seep through to earnings. Last year, that pickup was relatively small because a lot of the revenues were hedged and last year you also saw a significant amount of cost pressure on account of higher raw materials that is also starting to normalise.

The third facet is that regulatory issues are going to be an ongoing challenge. The USFDA is very clear that they want a certain level of compliance with anybody that is addressing the US markets. The Indian companies have sort of upped their game to a point that these regulatory headwinds will become less sporadic rather than widespread. That is at least my hope because we see a lot of companies telling us that the goalpost had changed at some point in time and we took time to catch up but everybody is very serious about making sure that they do not fall foul of what the regulations expect of them. To that degree, we will see fewer accidents in the future than we have seen in the past. That’s what I hope.


Where in this market do you think there is still a situation of a great business going through temporary distress? 
There are several areas in the small and midcap space where you have very good companies where stocks have sold off 40-50-60% over the last year, where balance sheets are improving, earnings trajectory is improving, valuations are at minus one standard deviation of a past five-year historical trend and therefore we see significant amount of value. 

In the frontline space, there are select areas where valuations are quite attractive. The outlook is unclear though. Take the PSU banks for example. You could argue that these are not the best-run businesses in the country but the valuations are absolutely undemanding and if the credit cost normalisation follows through, then you could see a significant amount of improvement in stock prices as the year rolls along. 

Obviously there is a worry here that MSME loans could turn out to be the new problem that the public sector banks have to deal with. Let us see how that goes along. But that is yet another example of where something is definitely changing for the positive which has not been recognised by the market as of now.

 Unfortunately, we are also dealing with delays in the NCLT resolution of bad assets, we were hoping that we would see a lot more progress on that by now which has held back some of the write-backs, if we see that in the first quarter of this calendar year we could see some positive surprises here. That is another area in the large cap space where you could see some improvement. 

Another area could be metals. We do not track metals very closely, I found it very difficult to predict what happens to metal prices but I think fundamentally from a book value perspective a lot of stocks are beginning to look very cheap so there may be some opportunities out there. 

Last but not the least, oil market companies are now trading at valuations they were trading at prior to this whole deregulation unfolding three years ago. So we are back to a point where deregulation has been given up for dead and you do not have a lot of downside here. Let us see how the market treats them as we go ahead.


What about the reverse part? What would you not buy in this fall? Eicher has corrected, Page has corrected, Asian Paints has corrected. Would you be tempted to go back to the classic compounders?
Well there will be some opportunities in deep corrections, there is no denying that but given our value framework, we find it very difficult to buy these really expensive stocks. But one of the reasons why these growth stocks have done spectacularly well over the last five years is because growth was very hard to come by. 

Wherever you saw some degree of assured growth valuations did not almost matter and in my opening comments I did mention that growth is coming through as the overarching concern all across the world. So, if we again get into a growth funk in 2019, then you may see the names that you mentioned come back very strongly because of the assured growth that is coming through. 

From our portfolio and our value investment style perspective we do not like very expensive valuations whether it is in the consumer staples space, whether it is some of the names that you mentioned or some of the really toppy valuations for assured growth that the market has been very happy to pay for the last several year. It does not work for us in terms of how we think about stocks and opportunities."
55,2019-01-15,Eicher,"Navin Fluorine, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Hikal, Jubilant Life Sciences and even Aarti Industries could give 
  
  reasonable returns over the next two-three years or so despite global slowdown, Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities Private Ltd, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


There is a mixed bag of opinion on Reliance. Some say that the oil and gas business is not doing all that well and it is going to be a muted quarter but then all eyes are on what do they plan to do with Reliance Retail. That is where the next leg of value unlocking is going to come in from.
What we saw in the previous quarter may get repeated. In the previous quarter, petrochemicals and retail did exceedingly well whereas refining was a drag and Reliance Jio is still far too small to make an impact on the earnings per share of the company. The same trend would continue into this quarter’s results as well and you may see more contribution coming in from petrochemicals, retail and little bit more coming in from Jio considering that Singapore GRMs are at multi-month low and that certainly would impact the refining margins. 

But I do not think that there is much expectation built into the stock price as far as the numbers are concerned. If the numbers are in line with expectation, it should not impact the stock price in a major manner unless there is some negative or positive surprise. 


Budget is just couple of weeks away, what is your anticipation in terms of what could be doled out? Do you think not many positive surprises will be there or are you expecting a rabbit to be pulled out of the hat when it comes to announcements on Feb 1st ?
No, I do not think so. These days, the RBI policy has become more important than the budget and since the GST committee meets every few months and decide on the indirect tax rate, the budget really is only linked to what the corporate and the personal taxation is. 

In last four-five years, there has been some minor tinkering and not any major reform or major cut in tax rates. From market perspective, the earning season is extremely important, as it always is. You will see individual stocks moving up or down and more volatility. The RBI policy in February will be most important depending upon what the stance of the new RBI governor and whether they are going back to neutral in terms of their opinion or view as far as interest rates are concerned.

Then economists will try and factor in as to when a rate cut would come in. I would say 2019 would see a reversal of the entire RBI policy from steady to rising rates to actually steady to declining rates in 2019 and that is a very positive development for the equity markets.


What is the outlook on the kind of numbers that Avenue Supermart delivered? There have been a lot of concerns with respect to the competitive intensity, the kind of high cost that the company is battling with. Will these remain concerns when it comes to D-Mart earnings?
Absolutely. Through CY19, the company’s performance may remain under stress. Managements like Avenue Supermarket really think long term in terms of several years and not in terms of quarters and if they feel that they need to take price cuts and go slightly slower in terms of expansion of stores, then that is their long-term strategy and they do it to ensure that they create long-term value. 

But in the short term, maybe next three-four quarters or so, there is going to be the pain as far as shareholders are concerned because first of all, you are dealing with a very high base. 

At the same time, there is stress on operating profit margin because of increased competitive intensity and it does appear over the last two-three quarters, the management is getting extremely selective when it comes to adding new stores. It is going to be just the same-store sales which will be driving the growth and whatever discounting policy that the company follows and discounting policy will have an impact on the operating profit margins. 

You are in a bit of a sticky wicket as far as Avenue Supermarket is concerned. Also, the high price to earnings multiples keep on playing on the minds of the investors. I would say that unless the company shows a significant improvement in its quarterly profits, it seems unlikely over the next two-three quarters or so. This stock could be a bit of an underperformer going forward for many months and the kind of high valuation which we have seen since its listing, that PE multiple ratio should get re-rated downwards over the next few months or so.


But at what level would you be comfortable buying D-Mart?
I do not think that it is on the reckoning at this point of time. Retail itself appears to be under a bit of a stress and I would be a bit cautious in the entire space. If you still want to get into retail, then our pick in the sector is Future Retail which may outperform going forward but we need to look at the numbers for this quarter. 

The last couple of quarters have been a bit of disappointing. So investors need to get a bit cautious on retail. It has done exceedingly well over the past few years or so. Valuations are on the high side not just for Avenue but even companies like Trent and Shoppers Stop, which are trading at very rich multiples.

No doubt, there is great scope for these companies to grow their businesses but disruption is also coming into play over there and it is a bit of a murky picture at this point of time. So our advice to investors would be to actually try and get underweight in the retail sector. 

Even if you are invested, it is better to have a look at the investments again and if you are sitting on profits, then definitely one should consider booking profit over there. It would be purely on account of the fact that PE multiple of the entire sector may get rerated downwards and growth is not certainly at the level that we have seen over the past three-four years or so. You are going to see a slowdown on account of competitive intensity and the base effect as well.


If you had to pick one amongst the two which one would be your favourite --ICICI Bank or Axis Bank?
More or less, they are in the same kind of a benchmark and they would give similar sort of returns. The underlying investment theme also remains the same with lower credit cost going forward and higher growth rates, credit growth or net interest income of fee based income in both companies. But ICICI Bank being of a larger size and there being value in the subsidiaries may see slightly higher interest from investors.

But broadly, both companies should have similar type of returns going forward and really looking forward to numbers, especially the provisioning numbers for these companies and how the NPAs have moved in this particular quarter because both managements have been saying that the worst is over as far as NPA recognition and provisioning is concerned. 

We are looking forward to better earnings, better reporting on the NPA front from these two companies and that should drive the stock price going forward. 


You would not touch Yes Bank, would you?
Well. The real issue with Yes Bank is what the RBI report has to say on NPA divergences. I know that the Street is focussing on the new CEO and that outcome will be known pretty much soon, latest by end of this month and whoever the new CEO is, the market will receive it pretty well. But going forward, one has to look at whether there are any major issues as far as their lending practices are concerned and if those were to come to live, then that could certainly act as a dampener on the stock price.

If the RBI divergence report is generally in order and there are no major variances, then the stock price could go up even more because what we are seeing is not just short covering over here but a gradual rerating of the price to earning multiple moving up. 

I am not too concerned about the growth rates for Yes Bank, post Rana Kapoor’s resignation. It will more or less slightly slower, maybe not the same growth rates that we have seen over the past decade or so, but still respectable and quite acceptable. The real issue in Yes Bank where the confidence of the investor will be made or broken is on whether there are any NPAs which need to be recognised which have not been recognised so far.


How do you identify which stock is good and which space within chemical space has better opportunity taking into consideration what is happening in China?
Chemical companies largely had a great run over the last couple of years because of disruption in China and a lot of environmental issues over there led to higher cost and cut down of capacity. Globally also growth and demand was pretty strong. But now global growth and demand seem to be flagging. So you need to be a bit cautious over there. 

I would say that you could not see even more divergences as far as the performance of chemical companies are concerned and clearly if you are looking at buying into chemical companies, the preference has to be for companies which have got extremely high manufacturing capabilities and have got reasonably stable cash flows, say maybe they are engage in contract manufacturing for agrochemicals or for pharmaceuticals. 

Those companies should be preferred and the few which come to my with usual disclosures are companies like Navin Fluorine or Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Hikal or even Jubilant Life Sciences. These are companies which have got extremely fantastic manufacturing capabilities.

Another couple of companies like Aarti Industries also comes to mind. The underlying threat in these companies is that they have got excellent strengths as far as manufacturing is concerned and they have got diversified revenues from diversified products. That is an advantage and steady cash flows from customers with whom they have got long-term contracts for supply and they are able to pass on cost increases. 

I would say at correction, these four-five companies I mentioned could give reasonable returns over the next two-three years or so despite global slowdown and in spite of what may be happening in China.


Do you buy Eicher just yet or do you wait for any positive signs of a meaningful revival in their sales and growth numbers?
I would say wait for meaningful revival in their sales numbers. No doubt the stock could have rallied by another 10-15% or so by then but the risk reward ratio would favour if you are certain that the company is back on its growth trajectory and no doubt long-term prospects are great.

Clearly they will benefit from the premiumisation trend which is going on. New models also have been well received. So there are many positive variables working in favour of the company but we would like to see them play out in the sales and production numbers before taking a plunge into the stock. 

It is also a company which is slightly over owned. That exhibits a risk advantage and so I would say just wait and watch. This quarter numbers may not be that enthusiastic or that exciting and even next quarter could be a bit challenging but then management commentary will be extremely important what they say for December and March quarter."
56,2019-01-16,Eicher,"There is a whole lot of passive-isation happening in the largecap space, Manish Sonthalia, Chief Investment 
  
  
  Officer and the Director of the India Zen Fund, Motilal Oswal AM-PMS, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

How are you dealing with the market volatility? On one side, there is the promise that good companies will make a comeback but on the other side, there is serious price erosion in Eicher, Page Industries or Asian Paints. You focus on quality at reasonable price, but that theme is getting challenged.
There are no shortcuts and you do not change your strategies when the mood of the market changes. It is as simple as that. The long-term trajectory on earnings on these companies remain perfectly intact if you are not seeing a major sector rotation like the capex cycle picking up. The valuations are not going to fall because there is simply too much of capital to be deployed.

When stocks are cheap, they are cheap for a reason and we have seen many of these names lose 70%, 80%, 90% of the market cap on the garb of them being cheap. It is better to buy quality provided you understand the business and the free cash flow generation ability on these businesses for long periods of time. One will have to live through the volatility and I do not think changing strategies really work. 


There was a disruptive change in a company like Eicher a year and a half ago and business slowed down. If a quality company which has got excellent cash flow also corrects by 30-35%, it just makes you wonder!
The whole point is that if the stock has gone up from say Rs 300-400 to Rs 32,000 and it has come down to Rs 20,000, now the valuations are 20 times one year forward numbers. All these years, the valuations were 40 times, 50 times one year forward numbers. The move from Rs 500 to Rs 20,000 has got established and of course it went to Rs 32,000 and has come down to Rs 20,000, but is it cast in stone that the volumes are never going to cross 60,000? I would not believe so. 9,25,000 guidance obviously is due to reasons like insurance hikes, ABS and BS transition and these would have an impact on the cost price and that is having an impact on their demand. 



Of course, these would be temporary. You have a very strong marriage season this year and UP is one of the very big new markets for Eicher which is coming in. I would tend to believe that even if you see a de-growth for Eicher this year, if we look at FY21, a 15% type volume growth is very much doable, without taking into perspective anything on the export front.

Nothing really is happening on the export front and so valuations have come down. The stock has now moved from Rs 500 to Rs 20,000. At 20 times one year forward numbers, you cannot really argue that the valuations are expensive. During the journey from Rs 500 to Rs 20,000, it appeared the valuations were very expensive. It went to Rs 32,000 and that is why it has seen a correction of 35%.

But from here on, if the 15% growth comes through, then you will see a slow and steady upmove in Eicher. You would require six months of timeframe to gauge whether a product has really succeeded or failed. The initial euphoria is always there when a new product is launched. 


For shorter-term investors, it is really a game of patience. Why would you put your money into Eicher? What is the timeframe when you see that a meaningful growth visibility would come back for Eicher because right now clearly that is a miss?
There is nothing called short-term investing. It is always short-term trading. Let us assume that somebody is looking at the next one and a half to two years. Even buying at these prices should make you money in these levels but if anything very significantly different can happen between now and the next six months, a lot of it will be dependent on how this whole money into the rural parts of the economy flows through because we are looking at an election year. All these things are ifs and buts for the short term. 

But definitely once all these transition measures are taken, it is not that the journey for motorcycles in terms of volume growth is over. Of course 11-12% volume growth over the last decade will weigh down to something like 7% odd and within that, the 350 CC plus segment definitely has some room. 

Of course, there is going to be increased competition but it is an evolving story. I would not believe that Eicher is done with. It is just a stop in a long journey ahead for us but there are no shortcuts for the next six, nine months. If one wants to fillip through for the next six-nine months, he or she may be free to do so. You can get out but nobody is going to tell you when to get in and you will only realise that in hindsight that the price would have moved up and you would have exited at a lower price.


Are you saying that there will be no margin hit on fuel sales for oil marketing companies. What is your view largely on the oil and gas sector?
They are making some very decent margins on the marketing side now. But this Re 1 cess absorption or Re 1 duty absorption has taken the faith away from all oil marketing companies. In terms of PE re-rating, the amount of market capitalisation loss that one has seen in the oil and gas sector is not funny. It is just Re 1 and that too for a few days and that has eroded close to Rs 2 lakh crore worth of market from the state owned oil marketing companies. 

Of course coming to fundamentals, there is deep value. There is no doubt about it. You are trading at valuations of one time price to book and maybe three, four, five, at best six times price to earnings depending on how much of inventory losses come through on account of the crude correction as well as the forex impact. 

I would tend to believe that companies like HPCL, etc, would make something between 5500 odd crores, everything said and done for the next three years at least and then you are looking at a capex for all the oil marketing companies. Net-net. I would want to believe that there is some very deep value in oil marketing companies but sentiments have got soured purely on account of PE de-rating and it would take some time for the PE to re-rate.

Also there has to be an assurance coming from the government side on this front because investors do not want to believe this whole confusion about decontrol and control, just because of that Re 1 duty absorption that was forced on OMCs for a couple of days. Then oil really tanked and they are now making some supernormal margins on the marketing side but the damage has been done. Fundamentals are perfectly intact.


What about financials? The general consensus is that you should now buy corporate banks as they have CASA, money to lend. Retail banks are expensive, consumer is slowing down and NPA delinquency will start. Would you buy corporate banks?
I believe this and in fact we have bought ICICI Bank. We have taken money off Bajaj Finance. This is an environment where banks will be at an advantage over non-banking finance companies and you are right when you are saying the retail focussed banks have really done very well over the last few years. They may go through time correction. There is nothing wrong with that but even for the corporate banks that we talk about --Axis and ICICI Bank -- 40-50% of their book is still retail. 

I firmly believe that the corporate NPA cycle has peaked and valuations are 1.5 times price to book for ICICI Bank. Remember. they have some invaluable subsidiaries with them; the life insurance business of ICICI or the general insurance business of ICICI Bank. Insurance is an infinite ROA business. You require capital for a period of 10 years and after that it is free cash flow machine forever. 

If core banking book starts to revive, and you are getting at 1.5 times price to book, it is certainly better than a Bajaj Finance at six times price to book where 40% growth will not come. Bajaj Finance management are guiding 20-25% growth rate and for that to pay a six times price to book and a 40 PE seems slightly out of sync. So, there is definitely a case for corporate banks. We have incorporated one of them in our portfolio.


There was a bit of a macro risk in 2018. Only select largecaps managed to outperform. Now that macro fears have receded, how do you think the general mood will change?
2019 is going to be an year of the emerging markets. Everybody is fixated on a growth in a trade war environment between US and China. The US Fed is now starting to sound very dovish and no balance sheet shrinkage seems to be coming in from the European Union. 

With WPI and CPI numbers well below the RBI trajectory, we are looking at a rate cut situation rather than a rate rise situation. The interest rates cycle for the moment may look slightly toppish and in that sort of an environment, money flows from developed markets to emerging markets. Emerging markets are to be bought when there is chaos all around and there is chaos around all emerging markets in 2018. One would have to figure out who has fallen more. 

In this sort of an environment when so much of domestic capital has flown into the largecap space and so much of domestic capital has been taken out of the mid and smallcap space, if one is talking about a revival in corporate profits -- 50% of corporate profits is represented through Nifty50 stocks but the balance 50% is represented through the broader markets and they have seen a massive correction. 

The small cap index itself is down some 30% for 2018. That sort of cut with the earnings cycle reviving would want me to believe that there is more money on the table in the case of mid and smallcaps as opposed to the largecaps because the latter will give 9-10-11-12% type of returns and everything has been priced in for the next one or two years.

There is nothing called cheap in the markets in the largecap space -- be it consumer, private banks, or metals space. But there is value across the table in the mid and the smallcap space. One only needs courage to put money out here but there is greater comfort in mind when it comes to largecap investing and not so much so in case of mid and small cap investing. There is a whole lot of passive-isation that is happening in the largecap space. If that be the case, then how is one supposed to generate an alpha? It will come in the mid and the smallcap space so that is the area to focus on in 2019."
58,2019-01-16,Eicher,"We always give tactical buy calls on the likes of Crompton Consumer, Voltas or a Blue Star, Mahantesh Sabarad, 
  
  Head, Retail Research, SBI Cap Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What are you expecting Reliance to deliver? There is much heightened anticipation, though not as much from the oil and gas business. All eyes are on Reliance retail and also the pricing strategy for Jio going forward.
First a disclaimer. I owned Reliance stock but answering your question on the expectation for Q3, the focus will be on what is likely to happen in the retail and telecom business more than on the oil and gas business. The key deliverables in the results will be not just the profit growth but how the cash flow generation is happening. A huge amount of capex has already taken place in telecom business and there is ongoing sort of discounting war. ARPUs are falling. So that will be the monitorable. From Reliance point of view, if the cash flow generation is reasonable enough for the overall debt levels to remain either steady or trend towards coming down, it will be a stock to watch out for. 


What is the outlook on consumption space? What are you expecting from the likes of HUL as well as ITC in the quarterly numbers?
For the consumption companies, the volume growth has been quite strong. In the past, most of the companies have been able to deliver either double digit or close to double digit volume growth. The first of the block in terms of its Q3 results was Bajaj Corp or what is called as Bajaj Consumers now. They have an overall volume growth of about 7%. Bajaj Corp has shown the way in the sense that consumption stocks will continue to deliver strong volumes growth and we should see profits growing faster. We see the consumption story remaining quite strong. 


What is your view on auto ancillary space and tyre space?
Tyre companies have a significant presence in the replacement markets. Replacement market is the one that drives the profitability for these companies and therefore the stock prices. OE is just a small portion of their business. Very often, that is not meaningful enough to push the needle and therefore replacement demand is what we have to always watch out for. The replacement demand continues to remain strong. 

A corollary of that is if you look at the toll roads and the toll collections that are happening and the passenger traffic growth that we are seeing on major roads tell us that it is rising quite steadily, in turn inducing replacement demand for tyres. 

The only problem could arise from Chinese tyres but fortunately there are certain measures being adopted in terms of anti-dumping duties which favour the domestic tyre manufacturers. Also with crude remaining at a softened level, it helps the companies to better their margin. Margin prospects are going to be good, volume prospects are good and tyre companies should be able to deliver good profits going ahead. 


Any other pocket or segment within the mid and small caps where you think there is growth visibility and attractive pricing to be a buy right now?
We have been selectively looking at certain companies. For example, we had recently initiated a coverage into liquor companies. Som Distilleries is one of them. We think that will potentially do well. Certain auto ancillaries can actually deliver better results as we go forward partly due to their own expansion plans. You have to look at auto ancillaries which are able to better the share of business through wider product offerings and more capacities coming in. So there are a few opportunities in the ancillary space. 

There are also food companies also can potentially do well. DFM is something that we have been looking at. These are some of the smallcap companies we are looking at. In the largecap or the midcap space, we should focus on the consumption story, not just FMCG companies but consumer durables as well. So the likes of Crompton Consumer, Voltas or a Blue Star are something that we always give tactical buy calls on.


What about Page Industries and some of these other so-called five digit expensively valued stocks? Do you see some sort of potential here?
Page Industries has not featured on our radar over last one year or so. Yes they are expensive. We tend to ignore some of these stocks given the expensive valuations and sometimes even the price per share becomes a hindrance when it comes retail investors’ buying psychology. That said, there are high priced stocks that we do recommend periodically. 

One such stock would be an Eicher Motors. We have had a sell call which has been quite successful in the past but then the stock has dipped far below its fair value right now and it can potentially start bouncing back as the sales momentum recover from a low base. 

From an expensive stock perspective, you can even look at such names in the consumer space such as a Lever. They are expensive in terms of their PE valuation. That is a call that we have been giving and should potentially do. If there is M&A activity, consumption story continues to remain strong and cash generation is quite robust. Some of these companies. we would certainly look at but we want to see that the expensive valuation is because of a good corporate governance standards and strong promoters and not merely because there is a potential growth ahead which is overestimated."
57,2019-01-16,Eicher,"Consumer spending is holding up in a big way. Even the hotel segment is looking rosy, says Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment. He spoke to ETNow. Edited excerpts:


How are you looking at the market positioning?

There is a shift in the way managers are looking at it. Clearly, large cap stocks are the focus of the market not just because money has come into it but also because managers are largely shifting towards some of these large cap names. That is a trend we expect will continue at least for some time. Just take some defensive positioning or get into the most steady names. 

At a more sectoral level, we have seen some breakout from the previous years where we saw why financials got some money, but it was not as broad based as it has been before. Select banks continue to get money, some with turnaround sort of stories like your ICICI, Axis. The trend has changed.



Do they continue to see buying though ICICI Bank?

Absolutely. We still see. Even in December, we have seen a fair bit of buying. Axis continues to see buying. These are definitely somewhere managers have added on positions.



What about IT because you saw 2018 was great and 2019 is not going to be the same and look how TCS or even Infosys for that matter has completely negated that opinion. They are confidently saying we are here and we are here to stay and we continue to see the kind of growth. And look at the move on Infosys?

Yes, absolutely. Again, IT is kind of a tiered approach. If we clearly look at TCS and Infy -- the two favourites -- TCS actually added a lot of positions by managers simply because it has been so underowned as a stock. Infy continues to add positions, but beyond that we do not really see too much traction from managers. 

There has been selling in Wipro and Tech M. Maybe, we have some buying in a couple of IT names, but otherwise it is largely the two largest companies that are there in terms of additions on the portfolio.


Any midcap IT names which have seen buying or some acute selling?

Some sporadic buying in the likes of MindTree, probably Hexaware, but not something that will really trigger off their chance.

Yes Bank was very institutionally held. I do not know what you have picked up on Yes Bank. I do not see that as part of your list anywhere.

Yes Bank has been largely a play reasonably underowned. I do not think that is really changing. We have not seen people pulling out too much from a domestic mutual fund perspective or coming back into that stock really.

You are saying this even prior to the last six months when that whole issue started?

That is right.


So, it was never really heavy...

Not one of the heavily owned. I would not even say it is in the top five banking stocks that were being held.


I want to talk about HDFC Bank because just this morning one of our chartists said that in the long term chart pattern, HDFC has really come to the divergence point, it is going to be a big move either this way or that and HDFC Bank would shake off the market. Are holdings still intact for HDFC Bank?

Absolutely. We are going to only see incremental additions. I would not say it is a very aggressive addition. Everyone has kind of topped up on that, but everyone is holding steady on their positions. I mean it is about Rs 60,000 crore odd of exposure from domestic mutual funds managers to HDFC Bank. That is a pretty sizeable chunk. It is the largest holding by a long shot.


Auto has continued to suffer, be it an Eicher or even Maruti. Are there significant exits out of auto or even for a Maruti?
That is one trend we have actually witnessed over the last six months. Clearly there is a selloff in auto. Maruti is a classic case in point. We have seen selling in Hero MotoCorp, in some of the other names. Auto's and auto component’s exposure is coming down in terms of an overall exposure, for sure.


Do you see more build-up in Reliance Industries? Is it one of your top MF buys?

Yes, that actually continues and they have really built steam in the second half. It was largely ignored in the first half and when the price action started happening, a lot of the managers were trying to probably catch up. If I just look at aggregate 2018 numbers, Reliance Industries was the largest quantum of purchase by managers.


What about pharma because you are seeing some traction there as well and I am surprised to see how Sun Pharma is among your top MF buys, given all the overhangs?

Yes, Sun Pharma has been in and out to be honest, but among pharma names, that is probably one of the names that has still kind of held steady. After the dip with all the overhangs, managers still thought that valuations are probably better than what they would want them to be. That is where we have seen some buying in December and we have had some positive flow of news come in regarding a patent infringement case and some approvals coming through FDA. They are looking at valuations and some positive news flow.


What else have been your observations, anything peculiar which stood out in midcap or small cap positioning?

The way the market is structured, we have seen very-very limited buying in midcaps in 2018. I would say about 85-90 per cent of the money of the aggregate buying has gone towards large caps and the remaining towards mid and smallcaps. But the one trend we have seen is the consumer spending play which still looks strong. We have seen buying in the hotels segment though not very large. That is one play really playing out strongly for managers.


Do you expect more volatility? I mean there is a broader question because of the election risk. What is your sense on flows into the first half of the year?

So yes, there is. Even December was a classic case where we have seen a little bit of slowdown of flows on the domestic front. We speak about the steady state of the SIP book that continues to grow albeit at a slower pace, but the lump sum money is actually coming off. In fact it has gone into the negative zone now. 

We are at about Rs 6,000 crore versus a usual run rate of about Rs 8,000-9,000 crore in the market. We suspect that is going to be a little bit here and there depending on the way the markets go for the next six, nine months. That will be something of an overhang for sure."

  agrochemicals over other inputs, Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest, tells Nikunj Dalmia of ET Now in an exclusive interview. There are good set of companies where significant returns can be made over the next two-three year period, says Dharamshi. Edited excerpts:


Well begun is half done or is this just beginners’ luck in 2019?
No. First of all, our tribute to John Bogle. There is a lot of contribution to the fund management industry and one has to recognise that. Coming back to 2019, we really went through a rough period in 2018, especially if you are somebody managing a midcap concentrated strategy focussed on Indian midcaps and smallcaps. 

Valuations are now in our favour and some of the things that were really bothering like crude or the interest rates going higher, have now fallen in place. We can be a little more sanguine about the prospects of interest rate hardening as well as the crude going up. That bodes well for the Indian midcaps and they are relatively more reasonably valued today. So 2019 will definitely augur well, much better than 2018. 


We had a global scare in the last leg of 2018. There was a scary selloff in Dow, a huge meltdown in the hallowed FAANG stocks. So far, we have managed to survive the first storm. But if this is a recurring or long unwinding, emerging markets like India will also get hit hard.
It is surprising definitely but I would say 2019 is going to be more a year of mean reversion than anything else. Since the 2009 bottom, American markets have had a huge outperformance to the world market. The global market cap moved from $25 trillion to $85 trillion over a span of a decade and the biggest contributor to that was from the US market.

Relatively speaking, emerging markets have underperformed significantly and this gap between developed market and emerging markets had reached a high point sometime last year and that I think is reversing. So that is one of the reason why we did not see a selloff even though nearly a trillion dollars were wiped off just from the FAANG stocks in the US. Since FIIs have been sellers in our market over last two years, it is not a phenomenon of last three or six months.

We are constantly being going down in weightage. Our market cap probably peaked at around 2.5 trillion and came down to 1.8 trillion. We have also seen quite a bit of wealth erosion and that is why today I am much less worried about global crisis setting off or some kind of contagion which can make our markets collapse. I do not think we are facing that kind of scenario today.


In markets we have to look forward but I will look back for last two years. 2017 was the big year for fund managers and smallcap investors. 80% of the market went higher. In 2018, 18% of the market either went lower or remains stable. What is in store for 2019?
You are right. One of our studies showed that in 2018, more than 50% of the stocks fell more than 50%. In that kind of a scenario, your portfolio cannot be too much different. But enter 2019 and there are many opportunities to invest and those risks where there are unreasonable valuations or unreasonable expectations those have been taken out of the market. Now there are good set of companies where significant returns can be made over the next two-three year period. It might not be immediately in 2019 because some of the concerns are real. The stocks have not come off without a reason. There are good reasons. But that is where the opportunity lies. But opportunity is dressed in overalls and looks like hard work. 


Are you able to find enough businesses which can give a potential earnings growth of 20% to 25% for next two or three years? Are those businesses available at reasonable levels now?
There is an opportunity in the market today in the kind of buckets that we have. What we look for is good business, reasonable valuation and a business tailwind. Now it is very difficult to find a combination of all these three things. So it is definitely very miniscule. But at the same time, if you were to take in a little bit of a cyclical headwind in the business or there are some with structural headwind, then there is a bucket of and a pool of companies available where you can make good money if you stretch your horizon into three and five years of investment. But you will have to live through next 12 months when the problems will still be in the transition phase of turning around. 

For example, PSU banks or real estate developers are going through some real tough times. Those are structural issues. But valuations are not an issue over there. It is only an issue of whether and if the sentiment will revive. If the sentiment revives, the business tailwinds will come back. There is a going to be a big supply crunch for sure. The number of players are going to be whittled down dramatically in real estate. So that is a positive.


Do you own a real estate stock?
No, I do not own any and only thing I am saying is that that is a bucket which requires more than five years’ horizon. If you look at something that has more cyclical business headwinds, then over there, your horizon can be three to five years and you can still make good money. Managing public funds, sometimes we face challenges of having a 10-year horizon. So, we have to look at three to five years. I would be more willing to buy a company which has some cyclical headwind going on and which can be corrected by say the raw material prices coming down or some amount of stimulus being given to the economy. Those kind of situations provide more clear and present opportunity for us today.



So if we talk about your portfolio positioning in Jan 2018 versus January 2019, how many stocks have vanished, how many stocks have entered and in terms of an aggregate approach is there anything new and different or is it an extension of the same?
The last time we spoke, there were stocks priced to perfection and especially some of them were on the consumption side. Now, we are out of stocks that are priced to perfection with a business tailwind. Everything is going in favour but there is no room for error. High quality, high performance, highly valued. The money has been chasing very few ideas in this market and those few ideas have become really outpriced now. As long as the business tailwind continues, the valuations can sustain but I think there is a real risk of a significant underperformance with a three-year point of view.


We have seen that in Eicher, we have started seeing that in a Page. , I think you are referring to the same obvious stocks?
Yes that is the pool of companies that I am referring to, no one particular name but that is the kind of thing. Whether it is Page or Eicher or even Britannia or VIP.


Raamdeo Agrawal told me one thing which is that mehanga roye ek baar sasta roye bar-bar, we are always trying to find something very cheap but it does not work?
No, no, we are not going down the junk road but at the same time Infosys can have 10 years of underperformance, Hindustan Unilever can have 10 years of underperformance. So, you better be clear about what you are buying and I think the risks are real in terms of underperformance over the next three to five years. Any long-term investors’ horizon is also a risk.


You have been bullish on private sector banks, select chemical names and select retail/fashion names. Have those themes extended themselves for 2019?
 In private sector banks, definitely the theme continues but probably now some of the larger or the retail banks are not the ones to be focussed on. Corporate banks are better placed and that is where a surprise possibility is there in terms or earnings as well as a comfort in valuation. 

Larger private corporate banks or even smaller private regional banks provide a very good risk to reward with a five-year point of view if the capex cycle was to revive and that should revive sometimes within next six and 18 months. That is a fertile area to look at.


You do not think corporate banks are becoming a consensus trade? 
Consensus or not, you have to look at how much of the ownership is with the institutions and if you believe that price performance has been fantastic, then the performance has not even started ye. Honestly speaking, they are still available. These banks are doing sub 1% ROA. Over the next three to four years, the ROAs will move from 0.7-0.8 to 1.2-1.3 and with some bit of leverage, the ROEs can move beyond 15%. 

In that kind of a scenario where all these banks that are quoting between 1 and 2 can quote anywhere between 2 and 3. We are at the beginning of the story, we should not be worried about consensus at this point of time. It is a large pool, FIIs have been selling and I do not see us being in an overcrowded trade by any stretch of imagination.


You have this reputation of being the pharma expert on the stock market. When you see an experience like Sun Pharma in 2018, it just shakes you that corporate governance issues have been raises at this bluest of the blue chip company, Debt is not a problem for pharma though growth may be challenging. What does that speak for the sector?
This does not speak for the sector per se, it is a company specific issue. The sector issues were definitely more on the FDA front and those are behind us. The corporate governance issues were not completely unknown to the market. It is only that they are out in the public domain today and they probably did not matter when you were a small company but today when you have trillions of rupees of market cap, they matter a lot more because all the global FIIs have taken an exposure to your stock. There is no choice but to get your act together, clean up the books. 

And you are right, they do not have net debt but that cash in US and the debt in India are not matching. They will have to probably get out of this mess in some way but it reflects more on the company.


We started with John Bogel but let us go back to our favourite investor Warren Buffett. We love to quote him. I wonder if he has to start charging IPs for his quotes...
Yes he should charge a royalty.


 ...he will be a richer man by a billion dollars at least.
For sure.


He pretty much is alluding to what you referred to that you have to buy good businesses when there is a temporary slowdown or news is bad. Where else do you see this kind of a thesis getting played out?
So one space where three-four years of bad period is coming to an end I believe is agri inputs side. Agri has been in a distress and it is more because of agri prices being down than anything else. The global cycle also was on a slowdown since the last three years and over here there is a very good possibility that over the next one to two years there will be a pickup.


Despite what data we are getting from rural India?
No, because there is so much distress that is when governments will be forced to take action and when government take action it will have impact You want to be positioned for it today.


Focus on where the buck is going to move?
Correct. Because there is distress today there is no choice but the agri prices to move up over the next 12 to 18 months and finally this is a cycle. If a farmer is not getting good realisation for his crop he will move to another crop that gives him better realisation and that will eventually create shortage in the other crop and that will make the prices move up. 

Cyclically, from agri prices point of view we are close to a bottom and we should move up in the next 12 to 24 months and that is the local cycle but even globally also, the commentary or the large chemical companies has now started being positive and they have started witnessing growth which had come down to close to zero, now they are talking about 5-7% kind of growth. 

So the confluence of local and global cycle picking up together should play out in the agri input side and we prefer agrochemicals over other inputs."

Are you able to find enough businesses which can give a potential earnings growth of 20-25 per cent for the next 2-3 years and are those businesses available reasonably now?

The kind of buckets that we have, is there an opportunity in the market today? There is an opportunity. What are the kinds of opportunities available? What we look for is a good business, good valuation, reasonable valuation and a business tailwind. It is very difficult to find a combination of all these three things present. So, that definitely is very, very minuscule. 

At the same time, there is a little bit of a cyclical headwind in the business or there are some with structural headwinds also. If you are willing to look at those companies, then there is a bucket and a pool of companies where you can stretch your horizon into three and five years of investment and then make good money over there.

It is only an issue of whether and if sentiment will revive. Business tailwinds will come back, there is a going to be a big supply crunch, for sure. The number of players is going to whittle down dramatically in real estate. That is the positive.


Are you happy to buy real estate stocks, do you own a real estate scrip?

No, I do not own any and the only thing I am saying is that is a bucket which requires more than five years of horizon. If you look at something, that has more cyclical business headwinds. Over there, your horizon can be 3-5 years and you can still make good kind of money.

You do not think corporate banks is becoming like a consensus trade or maybe I am speaking to all the smart guys who are bullish on corporate banks. I do not know what is this, is this a coincidence or is this a consensus trade now?

Consensus or not, you have to look at how much of the ownership is with the institutions and if you believe that price performance has been fantastic, the performance has not even started yet. Honestly speaking, they are still available. These banks are doing sub-1 per cent ROA.

You own this reputation of being the pharma expert on the stock market when it comes to pharma. We look up to you, we look for your thoughts, when you see an experience like Sun Pharma in 2018, it just shakes you. 


It shakes you that here is the bluest of the blue chip company where corporate governance standards have been raised for a sector and for industry where debt is not a problem, growth may be challenging. But they have never had a debt problem, what does that speak for the sector?

This does not speak for the sector per se. It is a company specific issue, the sector issues were definitely more on the FDA front and I think those are behind us. The corporate governance issues I do not think were completely unknown to the market, it is only that they are out in the public domain today.

They have a unique situation where they will have to probably get out of this mess in some way, but I do not think it reflects on the sector per se, it reflects more on the company.


We started with John Bogle, but let us go back to our favourite investor Warren Buffett. We love to quote him, we love to talk about him, I wonder if he has to start charging IPs for his quotes...

What data are we getting from rural India?

Because there is so much distress that governments will be forced to take action. You want to be positioned for it today.


Focus on where the puck is going to move?

Correct. Because there is distress today, there is no choice but the agri prices to move up over the next 12-18 months. Finally, this is a cycle if a farmer is not getting good realisation for his crop, he will move to another crop that gives him better realisation.

That will eventually create shortage in the other crop and that will make the prices move up. Cyclically, from agri prices point of view, we are close to a bottom and we should move up in the next 12-24 months and that is the local cycle. 

Even globally also, the commentary on large chemical companies has now started being positive and they have started witnessing growth which had come down to close to zero. Now they are talking about 5-7 per cent kind of growth. The confluence of local and global cycle picking up together should play out in agri inputs and we prefer agrochemicals over other inputs.


The thesis of cyclical recovery, the thesis of attractive valuations or reasonable valuations is no longer there in consumers or retail banks or for that matter some of the other obvious names. Some of these opportunities are there in the B2B space, but the challenge with B2B space is that you will not see a huge PE expansion and you will not see a huge margin expansion. I am sure you are aware of that?

So, you are absolutely right, on the consumer front getting a good business at a reasonable valuation is the biggest challenge and even though as a theme, we are really bullish on it. On the B2B consumer side, there is a possibility, I mean I slightly disagree with you over there that PE expansion cannot happen and markets have done funnier things. It is not like it is my base case to bet on a PE rerating over there, but if an upcycle over there extends beyond what the market can imagine right now, they will move to a higher plane in terms of rating. 

So consistency and performance is the most important thing. 


We spoke about a niche pocket which you like within the finance space and that was the small finance bank (SFB). Now the RBI ruling has just acted like a sledgehammer for some names there. Are you still bullish on those names with the RBI red line?

Absolutely. See, they are small in size with Rs 2,000-3,000 crore kind of a loan book size and a similar kind of market cap that is number one. Second, we have to realise they are not NBFCs anymore, they are banks. They have gone through the pain of taking over the cost of the banks, they have started providing SLR, CRR and the cost of converting their branches into a bank branch going from a second floor to a ground floor. 

Those costs are in the numbers. MFI still remains a very-very profitable product while there is a non-MFI SFB also. I am not talking only about MFI SFB. And the SME space is the most lucrative space in terms of lending, you need to have your processes right, you need to do your lending right. 

But they have a platform available from where they can grow 20-25 per cent for a decade. That is the kind of runway available to them. Can these Rs 4,000-5,000 crore loan book become Rs 25,000, Rs 50,000 crore? Sure, it can become, there is no reason why it should not. They have a licence to do that. The ultimate aim is to become a universal bank, SFB is only a stepping stone and some of the vetting is done by RBI for us, they have given licence only to the 10 most deserving guys. 

So out of those 10, I am sure at least two or three will emerge to become far larger and much better banks.


You own the two or three obvious names there, the ones which have just got licence from becoming a microfinance to a small bank. Is that the way to approach it, buy all three, four whatever is available?

Yes, we do own a couple of those names.


Okay, that is the best way to buy them because you do not know eventually which one would be the winner?

No. You go through their history, you see which one survived the crisis best and which one is building its liability franchisee properly, which is the one that is diversifying in its product and geography and you take a call based on that. Still that does not guarantee you success, but at least you know what you are getting into.


What would you say is the outsized bet for this year?

As for outsized bet for this year, we run a concentrated portfolio and each and every bet for us is outsized. I will not say that there is any new stock that we have bet on in a big way, but I think just coming back to the earlier theme, corporate banks and within that small regional banks, there is a real good risk reward available over there.


Autos have corrected and there is a fear that there is a slowdown but if economy comes back, the rural demand comes back, Bajaj Autos and the Eichers and the Mahindra & Mahindra’s of the world will make a comeback. The way you invest, can you spot an opportunity there or this is not the alley where you want to walk? 

No, I am not very keen on looking for opportunities immediately. I believe that the EMI-led growth or leverage led growth is going to witness a slowdown over the next 6-12 months, all this growth was led by the NBFCs and the NBFCs have tightened their purse strings by choice or maybe not by choice. 

Because of that, growth will slow down over there. I would rather go to where the end consumer is buying out of his own pocket instead of taking loans for that.


The NBFCs have avoided a cannon ball, but the cruel fact is that look there was an asset liability mismatch, they were borrowing short and they were lending long. This setup has broken, this created opportunity for good players to gain market share. Are you looking at buying something in the NBFC space?

Again, no. It is not...


But that is the place you would be hunting right now, right?

No, I think the problems have just started. 


Even in HFCs?

Maybe not in HFCs. In some of the HFCs, the asset liability mismatch is not such a big issue. Even though you sell 25-year payment but those are actually seven, eight year products and some amount of ALM mismatch is necessary for you to make your ROE over there. 

I am not buying any HFCs at the moment, but I do not think the extent of problem in some of the HFCs will be as big as some of the other NBFCs that are let us say developer loans or any such thing. I think there is a decently chunky real estate developer portfolio which is coming up and it will be recognised as an NPA over the next 12 to 24 months and the conditions are not going to get any easier in terms of funding for the NBFCs. 

I would wait, it is a situation which is in flux, I would wait to see which are the players that are going to survive, which are the players that are going to get hit and I will wait for a year or so before I can say now the NBFC crisis is well and truly behind us and we can place our bets over here.


In 2013, when we met you said if I get a million dollars right now, I would invest it right away. I can see and smell that kind of an opportunity in the market. If you get a million dollars from a client after this interview, do you have the conviction to invest it right away in your set of stocks or will you wait? 

Investing is not an issue, managing the expectation is an issue... I will invest only when there is a crisis in the market or I will invest only when I get the best combination of opportunity, entrepreneur and valuation. 

For that kind of a money, there are very few opportunities in the market but if you are somebody who has a compulsion to look for opportunities and if there is no crisis, ex of crisis I think the valuations are okay, what we need is some revival in growth going forward. 

If that is the case, a reasonable expectation of return can be met. Let us not get carried away, can I make 10x return or something like that in four, five years, surely but probably I would be more comfortable maybe three months, six months down the line where more water has flown under the bridge. 

But investing and deploying in the equities is not an issue. In fact, we are fully invested, we will probably go fully invested into the elections and we will not change our strategy just because there is an event. That can have a big impact on the market, we are planning to live through it.


The way you manage money, the election would be just one of the events?

Yes, I mean, it matters a lot to a speculator and for an investor who has a longer term horizon. I have to only see whether it is going to provide an opportunity to enter or is it going to provide me an opportunity to exit."
63,2019-01-21,Eicher,"Combined with the upcoming budget and seasonality around that, looks like a higher probability of that to happen soon, Nifty to soon cross 10950-11000 levels, Rishi Kohli, CEO, ProAlpha Advisors, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

What is that you think the market is pencilling in with regards to what may happen with the Interim Budget?

The runup to the budget has been positive many times in the past few years and this time it looks no exception to that. In the near run, the technical patterns that are formed on the Nifty, Bank Nifty indices point to a bit more upside in the near term. 

Last time on the show, I had mentioned that Nifty looks like it could go to 11250 or so. Right now it is struggling to cross 10950-11000 levels. But the way the triangle pattern has formed, it is hitting on the upside multiple times. It looks like it will break out soon and that combined with the upcoming budget and seasonality around that, looks like a higher probability of that to happen soon.


What are you making of the strong move in Reliance -- Rs 100 move in just the last two trading sessions? The fact that digital as well as retail is posting good EBIT and the oil and gas business is going to be at best in line, was something which one would assume was already in the price. Why this fresh enthusiasm on Reliance then?
We have seen many times that in the runup to the results, one thing happens and then post results, that pent up buying or selling continues to happen. This time, the stock had consolidated for a bit and overall things are being minorly positive on the results front. This has led to the fresh upmove. Technically, again it looks like it should head back to previous highs which are about 100 bucks from here or may be slightly lesser now given today’s move. 

That should happen but how it handles that region combined with how further quarters shape up, will give rise to whether it is a long-term trend or not.


A couple of months ago when we spoke there was Eicher and Lupin in that portfolio. Are they are still there?
Yes, yes.


Eicher still. How much money have you lost?
So yes, Eicher is down about 15-20% from the last time we talked. Obviously, there has been disappointment in the stock due to lower sales coming in, margins tapering off a bit, plant shutdowns and strikes. It was trading at high PE multiples. The September-October decline in the markets had a hard hit on the high PE stocks. 

The price behaviour is not that out of line with how all this news has developed. Having said that, the underlying fundamentals and the underlying things at the company level still continue to be positive because there are some new launches happening, there is some new capacity coming up.

All of that, as it fructifies into whatever further developments are there, should give a fillip to the stock bouncing back. And currently from a technical standpoint, 20,000 levels are very strong supports. Ideally, it could go into a slight sideways patch before really shooting high like past few years, but from 20,000 a bounce till 24,000 or so is easily possible and one should at least wait there and see what further developments are happening before taking a call to either trim or add or something like that.


Where else do you believe that we could see negative surprises in the earnings season? Would you believe that be it a Hero MotorCorp, a Bajaj or a TVS for that matter, the negative is already baked in the price?
I would largely think so. Two-wheelers and even a lot of the four wheelers like Maruti and all have been disappointing for a long time. Tata Motors has its own issues. A lot of these are interesting plays more from a value and a long term perspective because finally some of these are growth stocks but they have disappointed and therefore taken the hit.

The underlying very strong fundamental thesis on which they have grown over time has not really changed. There are things which obviously have upset the move for one or two years here or there. There’s a similarity in a lot of fronts across these kind of stocks. 


Sun Pharma, Yes Bank, Jet Airways will you buy any of them?
I would not.


Why? If you wait for robin, spring is going to be over.
Which is why some of the other stocks which so far have been underperformers in my portfolios are still there because the underlying themes for which they were bought have not been disturbed too much beyond a point.


Why have you bought Sterlite Tech because my understanding is that prices of broadband fibre which they make, have collapsed 30% internationally and there is a problem with the China telecom order. The thesis for Sterlite Tech is broken according to me.
There is a very large data network opportunity in Sterlite Tech. They are one of the only ones placed for it. The long-term ROCEs are moving higher or are already high. So a business which could sustain greater than 25-30% ROCEs, high ROEs, reasonable earnings growth like FY20, profits could be double of FY18 despite some of the hiccups.


Are you counting for the cancellation of the China order? The management is admitting that there is a decline. The guidance numbers have not been changed. Are you accounting for this virtual 30-35% drop?
Yes. But we are expecting some of these profits and earning numbers to almost double and I can adjust for this a little bit as well. There are other positives also coming in. In terms of the underlying tailwinds in the industry, there may be 10% here or there but it will still amount to some very good numbers and technically again it is at the bottom. Very long-term supports are there, it is at lot of different channels and patterns supports.That also gives additional comfort because it is basically low risk high reward.


Is there trade in IT? Infosys has done exceptionally well but TCS has done extremely poorly?
That sort of a mean reversion is happening from last year because TCS had done very well and Infosys had not and for a lot of people are looking at relative value trades, this was an attractive trade to get out of TCS and get into Infosys, which I have just started playing out now. But having said that, within the IT sector, I had introduced Tech Mahindra in the portfolio and I would bet more on that because it is cheaper than most other stocks in the sector. 

The underlying segments telecom enterprise, some of those things which were down for many years, have started turning around. Numbers have started coming in and on the price charts, it is breaking out on the verge of a breakout.

It is again hitting resistances so many times and consolidating around there, that it is virtually sure to break out. That would give relatively better returns over next year. It could easily give you 30-40% kind of return over the next year whereas Infosys from a long-term channel perspective on technical, is at the higher end of the long-term channels that it typically trades in. Apart from some short-term bounces, here and there, it would end up giving a bit of a struggle in the six month to one-year perspective. I would bet on Tech Mahindra."
62,2019-01-21,Eicher,"Net profit is a widely used metric to evaluate the performance of companies. It is also integral to valuation tools such as earnings per share (EPS) and price-to-earnings (PE ) ratio. However, net profit does not reveal the actual cash position of the company. A company may do business on credit and show revenue and net profit in its income statement even before customers actually pay the money. So, despite the net profit in the income statement, the company may actually have a cash shortage, which may affect its working capital management. Relying only on net profit, therefore, may not provide the true picture of the solvency and financial strength of a company.Free cash flow (FCF), which shows the amount of cash a company has at its disposal, provides a more accurate picture of a company’s profitability compared to its net profit. It is the discretionary cash which a company can use to reduce its debt, pay dividends and employ for growth. FCF is determined by subtracting a company’s capital expenditure from its operating cash flow. Capital expenditure is the money spent by a firm to maintain its fixed assets such as plants, machinery and other equipment.Like net profit, FCF should also be evaluated over a period of time to identify the financial health of a company. Rising FCF is a good sign as it indicates that the company is generating excess cash that can be re-invested in the business. Negative FCF indicates that the company is not able to generate sufficient cash to support its business. However, negative FCF is not always bad as it could imply that the company is making large investments that could generate good returns in the long run. However, a consistently negative FCF over the years should be thoroughly evaluated as it could indicate potential solvency risks.We analysed more than 900 companies with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore and their FCF per share were extracted for the past five years, starting 2013-14. Companies whose FCFs per share were the highest in 2017-18 compared to past four years were sorted out. Then companies whose FCFs per share in 2017-18 were more than the past four years’ average FCF per share were filtered out. Out of these, only companies with consistently rising FCFs per share in the past five years were considered. The final filter looked at companies with only positive FCFs per share in the all the past five years.Only 11 companies passed all our filters. These companies have delivered -3.05%,94.5% and 664.6% average point-to-point returns in the past one, three and five years, respectively. Comparatively, BSE500 index delivered -5.4%, 40.5% and 87.2% point-to-point returns in the past one, three and five years, respectively, ending 8 January 2019. Companies with rising FCFs per share have substantially outperformed the index across time frames.Let us look at four of the 11 companies with rising FCFs per share with favourable analyst recommendations. These stocks also promise substantial price growth over the next one year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.Eicher MotorsThe company manufactures automobile products and related components and owns the iconic Royal Enfield motorcycle business— leader in India’s premium motorcycle segment. Ambit Capital believes that the company’s improved pricing power in export markets, rising scale, and local production of components will aid its operating margin. Moreover, under-control systemic inventory and seasonal strength of the fourth quarter will help revive retail demand.

Let’s a look at the key highlights of Tuesday's session: 

Cobra bites DHFLShares of NBFC player Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) closed 8 per cent down at Rs 170. Earlier in the day, the portal known for investigative journalism alleged the company had siphoned off Rs 31,000 crore into promoter companies to create private wealth through a network of shell companies. The scam has been pulled off mainly by sanctioning and disbursing astronomical amounts in secured and unsecured loans to dubious shell/pass-through companies, related to DHFL’s own primary stakeholders Kapil Wadhawan, Aruna Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan through their proxies and associates, which have in turn passed on the money to companies controlled by the Wadhawans, the web portal alleged. “The money was used to buy shares/equity and other private assets in India and abroad, including in countries like the UK, Dubai, Sri Lanka and Mauritius,” the news portal said on its website.


FACT drops on doubts over networth Shares of Fertilizers & Chemicals Travancore (FACT) plunged over 4 per cent after the auditor said the company’s net worth has been fully eroded. The company reported a net loss of Rs 49.77 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 against a net loss of Rs 4.41 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The scrip settled 4.45 per cent down at Rs 38.65.


Adani Gas rallies 5%Shares of Adani Gas rallied over 5 per cent after reports that the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the company in connection with two city gas networks and said the petroleum regulator should issue free orders to Adani Gas. The scrip settled 5.08 per cent higher at Rs 93.


HDFC slips on drop in profitHDFC, the country’s biggest mortgage lender, reported a net profit of Rs 2,113.80 crore on the standalone basis for the third quarter ended December 31, 2018 against Rs 5,300 crore profit reported for the year-ago quarter. The scrip settled 1.53 per cent down at Rs 1918.80.


Bajaj Finance rises 3% on good Q3The company posted 54 per cent rise in consolidated net at Rs 1,060 crore, the highest-ever quarterly profit, for December quarter against Rs 690 crore reported for the same period last year. Shares of the company closed 2.27 per cent higher at Rs 2,511 on BSE.

67,2019-01-29,Eicher,"I would give a couple of quarters before starting to build positions in midcaps, Prasanth Prabhakaran, Group 
  
  
  president & CEO, Yes Securities, tells ET Now. If you have cash, you are going to be king and you will end up getting a portfolio which will give you returns over the next 12 to 24 months, said Prabhakaran.
Edited excerpts:


What do you make of the kind of volatility that we are seeing overall in the markets? Do you believe that this sort of consolidation to sideways move is the order of the day?
A sideways move with a downward bias is what I will be a little more comfortable with. But the fact remains that we had expected a downward move, anywhere between 10,000 and 10,400, where a position can be built. We expect to see those levels very soon.

The reasons are simple. There is a mixed bag of results that have come about which basically means that financials that we had been expecting did not come out as strongly as we would have liked to. Very few sectors are holding up the segment or the overall markets. The good news is that most of the midcaps have been brought down to valuation which looks attractive but I would still give it a couple of quarters before I start building positions once the ambiguity is over. 

It is a market to sit and wait by the sides. If you have cash, you are going to be king and you will end up getting a portfolio which will give you returns over the next 12 to 24 months. In the short run, at least in the current calendar year, it is going to be see mid level returns in single digits which is going to be the norm.


Bajaj Finance’s Q3 performance has managed to exceed expectations on all counts. The problem is that it is that one stock within NBFCs that everyone is chasing and the high valuation, What do you think new investors should be doing?
Every stocks has a price at which you should buy and sell it and we believe that we are at the upper end. The risk to return ratio for Bajaj Finance, irrespective of the fact that they have shown fairly decent growth in an otherwise tough environment for raising money. 

It still has valuation which is even costlier than HDFC Ltd which has pedigree in raising and running NBFC business for decades together. You have to understand that even in their business model, around 36% of their loans come in from consumer financing segment which is traditionally equivalent to giving loans against consumer durables. This is prone toward defaults. Another 16% odd is into SME financing which is again going through a lot of stress. 

So I would prefer to book my profits out and end up putting it into sectors and segments which will be a lot more stable in the times to come by. If I am holding Bajaj Finance, I would definitely end up looking to move into a cheaper stock with better fundamentals.


What is the outlook in terms of individual sectors benefiting in terms of budget announcements. What is the expectation from a sector and stock market point of view?
The fiscal maths is going to go out of shape. Our expectation of the 3.3% fiscal deficit is definitely going to be moving up to the upper end of 3.5-3.6% which is not very uncomfortable considering the fact that it is an election year.

But the fact remains that the focus is going to be ensuring that the defeats of the last three state elections are covered which basically means that they are going to go after rural with a strong focus area. They will go after the small businessmen who have suffered because of various implementations that have happened during this period of time. 

Lastly, they will get into the middle income group or regular citizens of India where they would end up putting a lot more focus into affordable housing.

These three areas will be the immediate focus of the government because that is the only way you will end up having a chance to swing votes in your favour. And that is where you should look if you want to build up a portfolio in the short run. 

In the long run, fundamentals of stocks hold good and that is what you will end up looking at when you build up a long term portfolio. For the next three to six months, look at these three sectors and find out which can be used to build a portfolio for yourself.


Eicher has hit a fresh 26-month low today. We have all seen how Maruti has gotten battered after its earnings. Escorts has felt the monsoon impact as well. There is weakness across the sector. Where would you find opportunities to invest in autos or should one wait it out because the pain is not quite over?
It is time to wait it out. As I said, cash is going to be king over the next two quarters. You are going to get a lot of these stocks far cheaper than what it is at this point of time because the economic cycle is supposed to have turned. There was expectation of earnings growth in the range of 20 plus. There is a clear mismatch that has happened in the earnings growth that was expected. 

In the commercial vehicles segment, around 55-60% of the vehicles sold are financed through NBFCs and they have gone through a bad patch over the last quarter. It will continue for the next two quarters because most of them are trying to raise money now. Even the regular four-wheeler and two-wheeler segment has a good 35% penetration by NBFCs where they end up having large loan books.

All these segments will show a slowdown because of the simple fact that there is no money available to push the discretionary spend. All these are feel good stories. You will buy a car when you are in a happy mood, when you have extra money in your hand and you have easy credit available. If any of these factors goes out of shape, you will have a slowdown in that sector and that is what auto is going through. 

You should end up looking at the market leaders -- a Maruti or a Hero -- but not today and maybe in next two quarters when you will see the lowest end of this cycle panning out. It is a wait and watch period for stock pickers."

Nifty50 had a volatile session on Tuesday as it fell towards the 10,583 mark but recovered sharply from lower levels in the last hour of trade. The index managed to recover most of its intraday losses and formed a candle similar to a Dragon Fly Doji, as it closed near its opening level on the daily scale.

The index has been making lower lows from last six sessions and has been holding below its 50-day EMA, as it hit the lowest level for this month. Now it has to hold above 10,650 and cross the 10,700 mark to form a short-term reversal pattern. Else, the market could continue to show weakness.

If Nifty manages to hold above 10,690 level, then a bounceback could be seen towards 10,777 and then 10,820 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 10,580 and then 10,535 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,600 level while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900 level. Call unwinding was seen at 10,900 followed by 11,000 levels, while there was Put unwinding at 10,800 followed by 10,900 levels. The option band signified a shift in the lower trading range to 10,550-10,777 zone.

India VIX fell 2.50 per cent to 18.42, as overall higher volatility restricted the upside.

Bank Nifty continued its weakness towards the 26,440 mark and it has been forming lower lows for last six sessions. It recently broke its rising support trend line and held below its 50-day EMA. As long as it holds below 27,000 level, it can continue selling pressure towards 26,400 and then 26,250 levels, while on the upside, a medium-term hurdle is seen at 27,150 level.

Nifty futures closed positive at 10699 level with a gain of 0.21 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Bank of India, PVR, Bharti Infratel and Sun Pharma while shorts were seen in TechM, Motherson Sumi, Eicher Motors and Indiabulls Housing Finance.

71,2019-01-30,Eicher,"Liquidity could get bit a more tight going forward. If the government is not able to meet fiscal deficit numbers
  
  
  , that would put further pressure on bond yields and that does not augur well for credit markets, Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


What is your view on rural plays? There could be some budget linked announcements and there are a lot of sectors and specific stocks that could stand to benefit. What is your expectation and what is the general trend?
Every time the budget comes, we talk about rural themes and some amount of trading bounce takes place in these companies. Thereafter, real benefit does not flow through in terms of higher revenues or profits and eventually investors in those companies get disappointed. Over last four years, companies in the seed business, fertiliser business and irrigation business have given low returns despite much impetus being given to the rural sector. 

I am not that hopeful that a long-term change in dynamics for rural focused companies should take place. If the government does end up announcing a minimum support scheme or a minimum income scheme or additional flow into the pocket of the average rural citizen, then consumption- oriented stocks will benefit the most. FMCG, automobiles and building material companies are the ones which one could consider targeting.

Even a marginal increase in the top line for such companies, results in unusually larger increases in net profits because of operating leverages. Our focus is more on consumption-oriented stocks rather than direct rural plays such as seed companies, fertiliser companies or irrigation companies.


What is the outlook on IT? How are you looking at the overall digital outlook for some of these IT companies? What kind of revenue growth are you pencilling in for the sector as a whole?
By and large, largecap IT companies have reported good numbers and it could be because of the base effect or seasonal or cyclical reasons. But broadly, none of the IT companies are factoring or guiding in significantly higher growth rates going forward, prime example being HCL Technologies, which despite coming out with a decent set of numbers is still guiding towards low double digit or high single digit type of top line growth.

This is the kind of growth rate which the sector, at least the largecap IT sector should factor in, going forward. From an investment perspective. you want to buy into a company which is growing at least at 15-16% top line and about 20% bottom line and IT at best can grow at low double digit, high single digit. Although they are slightly cheap, the lower growth rates have already got priced in. 

So, I am not that optimistic on the IT sector as a whole, but there could be selective companies within that -- a TCS which has got the capacity to grow faster than the industry or IP-based companies like Intellect Design or Majesco which have a differentiated business models. Also, there are very specific niche companies like L&T Technology or Tata Elxsi which focus on design and are in the right space or right verticals and they may do well going forward. 

One has to be extremely selective within the IT space and need to buy into a basket of IT stocks because there is a certain degree of volatility in IT earnings which was not there earlier. One cannot assume that growth rates will be secular going forward. 


Given the high exposure of mutual funds to Essel Group’s debt, there are liquidity concerns in the market. Going further, could one could tighter liquidity conditions for NBFCs?
Yes, absolutely. There is a certain amount of nervousness in the debt markets and not only surrounding Essel Group. The DHFL story also has broken and in any case, there is a huge delay in solving the bankruptcy cases which have already been taken up. On the whole, the entire debt market seems to be in a bit of a wait-and-watch mode at this point of time. 

Liquidity could get bit a more tight going forward. Also if the government decides to be profligate and not able to meet their fiscal deficit numbers, then that would be further pressure on bond yields and that does not augur well for credit markets. 

So, it is one of the biggest threats at least in the near term for the debt market and the likelihood of defaults or delays in interest payments and subsequent problems which may arise because of specific cases. The overall sentiment within that market also is quite downbeat.


Some of quality names are falling off. Yesterday, you saw HDFC fall after its numbers, HDFC Bank as well has been cooling off. Reliance as well is down 1.5% or so. In the last 300-400 point decline of the index, some of these quality names have come off. Should we buy them in this decline or with the market fall, are these stocks also going to fall further?
That’s difficult question to answer. The market remains pretty much range bound and we have not discussed the big gorilla in the room which is political uncertainty. That is keeping a complete cap on our equities and indices at this point of time. 

This sort of scenario could remain for many more months, at least till we are closer to the election. Then may be, depending on what the opinion polls say, markets could react either ways. We are in for a very tough few months till June-July and the results thereafter of the election results would determine the market trend.

We have an RBI policy which is going to be extremely important for the RBI governor and explain what their stance is as far as liquidity and as far as interest rates are concerned. On the whole, we are in a confused situation and given that situation, it is best the market remains within a range. Selectively, you will see stocks going up and also sharp corrections depending upon numbers or stock specific situation. 
There is no doubt that the terrain over the next few weeks and months could be quite difficult for the investor and the trader. 


Are cement companies in a position to hike prices? 
I do not understand the PE multiples at which cement companies are trading. They are excessively high given the underlying fundamentals can justify only a high single digit or at best low double digit type of growth rate. 

The numbers which have come from the cement companies so far, have been disappointing by and large and there is a degree of volatility also in their earnings. Sometimes they are able to pass on input cost increases such as power, fuel and petcoke and sometimes they are not able to do that. It is not a complete sector which investors can buy with deep conviction and you could have selective holdings in cement. But it is a sector where investors should remain underweight in. 

New capacities are coming up, there is intense competition, increasing prices is not as easy as it was earlier after the Competition Commission came down hard on the industry. Going forward, demand will remain around about the GDP growth rates about 7-8% or thereabout. 

My view on cement is negative and investors should remain underweight. Some stocks could do well, like UltraTech, which is getting the benefit of consolidation and now they are taking over the cement plants of Century and some amount of internal restructuring could boost earnings. 


Is it time to buy the pain in auto stocks just yet? 
You have to take a very long-term view in auto companies at this point of time. These are great businesses -- be it Maruti, be it Eicher or some of the other two-wheeler companies -- and they have had a great track record. At some point of time the auto industry will turn and will go back to double-digit type of volume growth which we have seen in the past many years. 

There is considerable headroom for growth domestically as well as in exports and also input prices have now cooled off significantly and that would provide them with some amount of cushion as far as the cost and margins are concerned. 

But volumes may remain tepid for three four more months and we may see another disappointing quarter or two from the sector which is why I say that investors need to have a longer-term perspective in these companies. I am pretty certain that two, three years from now, most auto companies led by Eicher and Maruti which are our top picks within the sector will be 40-50% higher in terms of values.
Given the kind of market conditions these days and the mood of the traders and investors, if there is a minor disappointment in numbers, they want to en masse exit and sell off. There is just no patience for companies with disappointing numbers. In Godrej Consumer, we saw a massive selloff because of a disappointing and it is true across many companies which have failed to deliver results which are better than street expectations. 

We have this kind of a mood and thinking one should be prepared for further hits as far as the auto companies are concerned. I am convinced that it is a growth sector over a three-year period."

Shares of Exide Industries (up 2.19 per cent) , Tata Motors (up 1.24 per cent) , Apollo Tyres (up 1.23 per cent) and Tata Motors (up 0.94 per cent) were the top gainers in the index. 

Bosch (up 0.93 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 0.91 per cent) and Mahindra & Mahindra (up 0.60 per cent) too were trading higher. 

The Nifty Auto index was trading 0.29 per cent up at 8144.10 around 09:59 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 20 points at 10,672.20 while the BSE Sensex was up 97.85 points at 35,690.35.

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 29 were trading in the green, while 21 were in the red. 

Shares of Axis Bank, YES Bank, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, Vodafone Idea, Zee Entertainment, Ashok Leyland, HCL Tech, Indiabulls Housing Finance, SAIL, Tata Steel, SBI, Vedanta, Bharti Infratel, RIL and Wipro were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
72,2019-01-31,Eicher,"Midcaps and a large part of select PSUs can be huge outperformers but it is going to stock specific. There is scope 
  
  
  to be contrarian in a number of sectors, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

At the beginning of the year, the view was that US markets will remain under pressure, emerging markets will come back and the rally would be led by India. But now, everything has gone up and we are feeling left behind. Why is India underperforming the world with such good macros?
Consensus generally tends to get proved wrong. Now, we were of the view that the Dow is due for a very strong rally and the dollar should weaken. Yesterday bond yields hit 2.68%, which tells you that Donald Trump has won over the Fed chairman and now there is dovishness which seems very good news for emerging markets. 

For India, there is this overhang of NBFCs and disclosures by DHFL, Zee. but being an Indian, we know this is part and parcel of all market moves. We are extremely positive. We think the results from select largecaps and midcaps have been extremely flattering and this could prove to be a lull before the storm. We will go up from 11000 to 11200 in February and I can reiterate that by 15th of April, you should be close to new highs. 

That aside, the midcaps and a large part of select PSUs can be huge outperformers and so it is going to more stock specific, but I do not rule out a 500-700 point rally in February.


A 500-point rally, did I hear you right? What could be the trigger, what will take us 2-3% higher on the Nifty?
Two things; a) you will get over the budget where there could be some surprise packages in the form of tax exemption and b) the RBI turning extremely dovish and a rate cut coming. We know that we are in the realm of low inflation, low yields and the RBI trigger, liquidity and foreign flows on a strong rupee will all be the caveats for February being a very good month. 


Let us talk about some of the policy sensitives. You highlighted how the accommodative stance from RBI would help the policy sensitive or the rate sensitive sectors. Could there be a contrarian opportunity in real estate?
Yes. Real estate assets have never been cheaper and stocks have actually been underperforming miserably. Once we get through these elections and see stability, it is a given that real estate prices as fixed assets should get a lion’s share of the money rather than gold. I am very bearish on gold. I would say that fixed assets will do well including real estate. 

Our top pick continues to be Godrej Properties followed by Sobha and maybe a Prestige Estate. These are three stocks where we can actually put a lot of money and be confident because the churning has separated men from the boys. Real estate can stand to gain by the middle of this year and later from there. 


The ICICI Bank numbers are good. The ADR shot up by about 8-9% overnight but the stock has also moved 40% in this fiscal itself. How much scope does it have to move forward from here?
That is a good point. Smart money has been buying ICICI right from the time both the two agony aunts of Axis and ICICI left and if you were contrarian there, you have really made a lot of money. I still think we are headed much higher. Rs 700 is something which I do not rule out in the next one and a half years on ICICI and Rs 800 on Axis Bank. These are going to be prime plays on the corporate lending side and we have seen a cleansing of balance sheet. 

I can even add that State Bank should be a big outperformer in this trio of stocks. Another stock which I am very bullish on is IDFC First Bank. That will be the star of 2019 and Mr Vaidyanathan will see that bank is a huge outperformer in the next one year.


What is the call on IT, especially the bigwigs?
We have had two stocks as contrarian plays; MindTree and HCL Tech. We stand by that and Wipro is the dark horse which has out beaten all. We think these three should be the best combination to play on the IT side. 


You have advocated Maruti but what is the view with some of the two-wheeler names in the wake of the expected big allocation for the farm sector? Will that trickle down into consumption numbers for autos, the two-wheelers?
We have seen autos go through the proverbial problem of competition like in telecom. Bajaj Auto stands out and they have given away part of the margins to get market share and that seems to be working. But I think this is just the lull before the storm, this has been a very strong sector for the last three years and this quarter we have seen problems because of insurance overhang of NBFCs.

I still think that both Bajaj Auto and Hero are looking very good on the two-wheeler side. You even have Eicher and TVS. So, if you bought a basket of stocks and went for a SIP. rather than one outright purchase, you can make a fair amount of money. 

Consumption is going to come back once you get lower rates. Following the NBFC fiasco, most of the other banks started to lend very aggressively and insurance is now on the back burner. So. I am relatively bullish on autos. 

As a contrarian one of my top picks is Ashok Leyland. It is the third largest bus maker in the world. It will have 50% market share in India and you have seen state governments now get on the prologue of electric vehicles where Ashok Leyland has a first over there. Also in the LCV, MHV side. I think they are going to show strong numbers March quarter onwards. So at Rs 80-82, this is a very good bargain buy with a target of 125 to 135 by next Diwali. 


What has gone wrong for Godrej Consumer? HUL is growing at 10% plus, ITC is growing at 8-9% plus. Other companies which have reported numbers so far, are not bad including Asian Paints. Why is Godrej Consumer the odd one out?
It could be a one quarter hiatus and I do not see that lasting. I think they will be back. We have seen the strong numbers in durables particularly the likes of Havells, Bajaj Electrical, Voltas and like you mentioned, the discretionaries and the sales of Asian Paints, ITC. 

Godrej Consumer definitely deserves to be bought. It is a pedigree name, the brand is doing extremely well and it is just a matter of time where higher costs will start to reduce and margins will expand. I think this quarter onwards you should start to see much better traction on volumes.


But the management has said that 2019 will be a bad year for them! Do you think this is an indication of what is happening to the sector per se or this is isolated to Godrej Consumer?No, it could be isolated to them because there is competition which has brewed up over there and like I said, they are a very conservative management. They under promise and over deliver and that is what stands out for Godrej. 

However, consumption is a mixed bag. We have seen autos weak but we have durables doing extremely well. A company-specific move may be on the cards but definitely the broader band of peer groups are doing extremely well. So ITC continues to be our top pick over there and we think that they are going to just expand much more on the other businesses which is evident in the numbers on paper, hotels and the FMCG."
4,2019-02-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The stock market showed confidence in the government’s rural focus and PSU capex plan proposed in Interim Budget 2019 as the equity benchmarks closed Friday’s session with healthy gains.

Analysts assessed the fiscal deficit target as within comfortable limits and interpreted that the sops for farmers and lower middle class would boost consumption and propel the economy.

The BSE Sensex settled 213 points, or 0.59 per cent, higher at 36,469, while NSE’s Nifty50 index closed 63 points, or 0.58 per cent, up at 10,893. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed higher by 0.56 per cent and 0.17 per cent, respectively.


We walk you through the highlights of Friday's session:

SBI plunges despite better Q3 numbersShares of State Bank of India plunged 3.09 per cent to Rs 284.30 on BSE as the country's largest lender reported Rs 3,955 crore profit for the quarter ended December 31. The earnings were better than what the market had expected. Analysts in an ETNOW poll had projected Rs 3,200 crore profit for the quarter. 


DRL rises post Q3 numbersShares of Dr Reddy’s Labs closed with a gain of 2.32 per cent at Rs 2,786 after it reported a 45 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit at Rs 485 crore for the December quarter. Revenues for the quarter rose 1 per cent YoY to Rs 3,850 crore.


Jet Airways flies higherShares of Jet Airways (India) jumped 7.79 per cent to settle at Rs 255.90 after reports that the aviation company agreed to most conditions set by shareholder Etihad Airways. As per Business Standard, both airlines may sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) within days. 


Vedanta suffers 18% lossShares of Vedanta suffered a 17.82 per cent loss to close at Rs 162.30 a day after it posted a 26 per cent drop in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,574 crore for December quarter. Other than poor earnings, Cairn India’s stake buy in Anglo American did not go down well with investors. Vedanta subsidiary Cairn India Holdings bought a stake of Rs 1,431 crore in Anglo American from Volcan Investments, a family trust of promoter Anil Agarwal, which is considered negative for Vedanta.


DHFL plunges 18%Extending their losing run into the fifth straight session, shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) closed 17.96 per cent down at Rs 111.45 on BSE. Hit hard allegations of a financial mismanagement, the company has appointed an independent auditor to investigate the matter. Investigative media outlet Cobrapost had on Tuesday accused the company of giving Rs 31,000 crore loans to ‘dubious’ entities linked to the promoters, who, the news portal alleged, were the ultimate beneficiaries of the funds. Chairman Kapil Wadhawan countered the charges, claiming all the transactions were legitimate. 


Hero MotoCorp jumps 7%Shares of Hero MotoCorp surged 7.48 per cent to settle at Rs 2,807 after it reported a 4.5 per cent drop in net profit for third quarter despite higher sales. Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities has a neutral view on the stock with a price target of Rs 2,928. It said the margins of the company were in-line of the expectations and higher other income restricts the decline in PAT.


Agri stocks shine on farm boosterBudget sops for farmers and the proposed income-tax relief gave a boost to most auto, agriculture and realty stocks. Shares of Sprayking Agro Equipment (up 16.28 per cent), KRBL (up 8.78 per cent) and Simran Farms (up 7.62 per cent) were the top gainers in the agri space.


Tax sops lift auto stocksIn his Budget speech, interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal proposed to spend Rs 75,000 crore per year on income support for farmers. The FM also offered income-tax relief for those earning up to Rs 5 lakh per annum and increased the standard deduction limit to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000. Analysts said these moves would boost consumption. Hero MotoCorp (up 7.48 per cent), Maruti Suzuki India (up 4.96 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 3.16 per cent) and TVS Motor Company (up 2.33 per cent) were among the top gainers in the BSE Auto pack.


Realty stocks see big spurtThe Finance Minister pushed for lowering GST rates on under-construction houses even as he extended income-tax holiday for new projected up to 2020 and offered tax relief on rent incomes on second homes. Shares of Phoenix Mills (up 3.47 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (up 1.84 per cent) and Oberoi Realty (up 1.72 per cent) led the pack of gainers in the BSE Realty index, which closed 1.33 per cent higher at 1,797. 


Spurt in open interestVedanta, with a change of 137.99 per cent, led the pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest rise in open interest on NSE. It was followed by State Bank of India (61.11 per cent), Jet Airways (59.81 per cent), Hindustan Zinc (55.17 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (49.35 per cent) and DHFL (48.58 per cent). Barring Hero MotoCorp, all these stocks closed the day in the red which indicates a bearish trend in technical parlance. Analysts say if a company is expected to perform poorly prior to results the stock will fall and the open interest rises.


70 stocks show potential for riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 74 counters on BSE. Among them were Equitas Holdings, Larsen & Toubro, Hindustan Unilever, Avenue Supermarts, Venky's (India) and Divi's Labs. On the other hand, 38 stocks, including Vedanta, GBL Industries, Tourism Finance, KIC Metaliks and Summit Securities, showed bearish crossovers on BSE.

On the other hand, Alankit, Mahamaya Steel, Esaar (India) and Apoorva Leasing were among the 26 overbought stocks.

Finance Minister Piyush Goyal will present the interim Budget in the Lok Sabha today.

There are expectations that the government may announce measures to address agrarian distress along with tax sops for the middle class and the corporates.

Positive Asian peers helped Indian market stay on a steady path.

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was 81 points, or 0.22 per cent, up at 36,337.50, while Nifty was at 10,851, up 20 points or 0.19 per cent.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.50 per cent and 0.37 per cent up, respectively.

Vedanta on Thursday posted a 26 per cent drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,574 crore in the third quarter ended December 31, 2018 (Q3FY19) against Rs 2,114 crore in Q3FY18, hit by lower commodity prices and disruption in its copper smelter operations at Tuticorin. 

Besides, Cairn India Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, has bought an economic interest in Anglo American Plc. from Volcano Investment (same promoter group) worth Rs 1,431 crore which is 0.7 per cent of Anglo American market capitalisation, which is a negative as per analysts.

""We believe this is negative for Vedanta as the company transfers Rs 1,431 crore cash to group company given that it has a net debt level of Rs 19,000 crore even after accounting cash and investment balance of Hindustan Zinc, which is Rs 23,333 crore, is not usable by the company. Post the transaction Cairn India Holding does not have voting right in Anglo American Plc.

6,2019-02-04,Eicher,"Our house view has been positive on consumption and that gets reinforced after the budget. Incrementally we are 
  
  
  more bullish on auto after a very strong correction last year, Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, MOSL, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

Do you think the Dewan Housing issue has the potential to snowball into an IL&FS kind of a situation?
It is an evolving situation and as we have seen with IL&FS crisis, markets do get nervous around it. We will have to keep watching what happens there because it has implication for the other participants in the system. It is very tough to take a call right now. As far as NBFCs are concerned, the cost of fund situation has gone up and liquidity has been tightening for last couple of months. 

Our view has been that in 2019, it is very important to be cautious on this space. We have HDFC and LIC Housing Finance in our model portfolio and that is what we will stick with. We did increase weight on LIC Housing Finance recently post budget along with increasing the weights on some of the banks and consumption stocks.

What is the outlook is on the consumption space? We did see that a major push came to the space as a whole. Purely from consumption standpoint, how do you see the overall metrics changing and spending picking up as a whole?
We have been quite positive on consumption. Leaving aside the Budget, in last 15-20 days, the results of consumption-oriented stocks have been extremely strong -- be it staples or discretionary. While valuations are expensive, these are the stocks which are going to outperform even in current year because we are going into an event which is very important from the markets point of view. Our view is that one should be a little more defensive, going into the election this year because markets wise, valuations are not very favourable. 

Secondly, the budget just reinforces the very strong consumption environment. Please remember that Rs 6,000 per annum is not a one-off kind of thing and it is going to be very difficult for any government in future to withdraw the scheme. 

Logically, one should only expect that this Rs 6,000 will just keep on increasing either in line with inflation or some such number every year. So, it plays a very strong stimulus for consumption. At Rs 75,000 crore, it is not a very big sum, but given the structural nature of this kind of handouts, these are going to help consumption even in the long run, more so, from low-ticket consumption view point. 

We have been very positive on Hindustan Lever, Titan, Britannia and Pidilite and that view stays. In fact, Titan just reported on Friday a very stellar set of numbers. Another quarter of earnings upgrade and market share gains which are continuing. Our house view has been positive on consumption and that gets reinforced after the budget. Incrementally we are more bullish on auto after a very strong correction last year. 

We like the four-wheeler space more. Given the relatively low competitive intensity and very sharp correction in Maruti that we have seen in the last 12 months, we have increased the weight on Maruti in our model portfolio on Friday.


What is your view on the broader end of the market? Do you think that when it comes to the general trend this year, it is going to be a pre-May and a post-May sort of trend given the general elections? Would you approach midcaps very differently in the first and the second half?
Absolutely. I mean this will be a story of two halves, however, clichéd this may sound. As far as midcap is concerned, I agree that in last 12 months, we have seen midcaps getting battered. It has brought down the premium that midcaps had to largecap. If you go back 12 months in January 18, the premium of midcap to largecap was roughly 50% to 60% and that has now come down to 10-15% at index level. 

While it is still at a premium and therefore slightly tricky to tackle, given the correction that we have seen, there are some interesting bottom-up opportunities in midcaps which are now available. This was not the case 12 months back, where touching midcap was very difficult given the valuations that they were trading at. 

Now that has opened up a bit of a space for any stock allocator to hunt for bottom-up midcap ideas. Secondly, as far as broader market view is concerned, this is a year which is going to be in a tight range with elevated volatility because at 10,700, 10,800, we are still trading at around 17.5 to 18.5 time one year forward band which is not very cheap. 

At the same time, it is not exorbitantly expensive. The only thing that has changed in the last one month is that the corporate earnings have been very strong whether it is on the consumption side or whether it is on the corporate bank side. Our view is that this is a year where you have to be a little more defensive, play through three-four important sectors which are consumption, private banks, select NBFCs, auto and IT to an extent. 

I am still not very positive on other sectors which are more capex driven or dependent on the economic cycle. Though we have been hearing about green shoots in capex, it is not yet reflected in numbers. My approach is to be in sectors where there is quality and earnings visibility. I am willing to make a mistake on valuation rather than on business side. 


And you think these parameters that you just talked about are all conjoining for autos right now? Within autos, while valuations have corrected off the peaks, where do you see some growth finally kicking in?
We are not going to see any big recovery in auto in a hurry. The stock price correction has given enough room now to do more detailed bottom-up analysis on a lot of these stocks which were very expensive 12 months back. What we like in that space are more four- wheelers given that the competitive intensity is relatively less intense there compared to two- wheelers. 

Secondly, for a stock like Maruti which has seen big combination of headwinds battering its margin in the third quarter, incrementally we are expecting those margins to gradually inch upward starting from fourth quarter itself. That is one stock which is our top idea in that space.

The other tactical play could be M&M given that again that stock has seen a big correction in the last 12 months and now that there are some handouts for farmers, for middle class, sentiment could be positive around M&M while valuations are very cheap. 

You may not see any big earnings upgrade in that space but there could be some re-rating there given that the broader context for the auto and farming side has changed a little bit after the budget. In two-wheelers, we are still very cautious on both Bajaj and Hero. I still think that there is very little room left for re-rating unless we see a big margin or a big volume surprise there, which is very difficult right now. 

Eicher is one name where incrementally I am now more positive. Even there, one has to keep watching the RE number on a monthly basis before getting too excited. We have seen what happens to the two-wheeler stocks in the last decade after their glory days are over. I would not be in a hurry to even buy Eicher. Right now to summarise our view on auto, we are more positive on four-wheelers."

7,2019-02-04,Eicher,"Regardless of which government comes to power after May, fiscal strains are going to stay, says Gautam 
   
   
   Chhaochharia, Head of India Research, UBS Securities. In a conversation with ETNow, he said the risk reward is unfavourable for NBFCs in general. Edited excerpts:



Every year, when we think that this is it, this will be a good year for India, a better year for earnings, it never works out.

Clearly, the drivers for the next cycle of both macro and earnings are still missing and we look at four things -- whether the policy framework is in stimulus or consolidation mode, both monetary and fiscal; then the capex cycle; third, the exports or global trade cycle and last, the local credit cycle. 

As we speak, the credit cycle is definitely a silver lining. That should help the Nifty over the next couple of years. But the other three drivers are still in negative zone or not definitely a positive. So, our top-down view still remains that earnings cut will still happen. 

We are expecting about 19 per cent cuts to fiscal year 2020 estimate for Street. Having said that, optically, we should see a double digit earnings growth in 2019-20 for the Nifty because of the NPL cycle reversing for financials.



Now, you did see in the Budget pegging fiscal deficit target at about 3.4 per cent for the current year. You also saw a lot of support coming in for the schemes for farmers as well. Do you believe that all of these announcements, particularly for the middle income category for the farmers as well, will create a huge pressure on fiscal deficit in FY20?

The revenue numbers are ambitious, to begin with. If you look at the revised estimate for FY19, the YoY growth rate of about 19 per cent is higher. FY19 figures are banking on January, February and March numbers, which would be very very strong on a YoY basis. 

On top of that, the FY20 estimate is also kind of building in tax buoyancy, for example GST being built in at 18 per cent YoY growth. Revenue numbers themselves are on the optimistic side and then all the schemes are definitely sticky in the sense that whichever government comes to power in May, it is very unlikely to step away from these schemes. In that sense yes, the fiscal pressures are quite there for FY20. 

How markets will react is one to see. We clearly see the bond market worry about it. Equity markets on Friday seemed fine with that being positive on the growth booster, consumption boost for those sectors. But yes, if the bond yields rise and the currency reacts, then equity markets also follow.


Since we are talking about the Budget, we have to ask you about what the yield has been doing, the fact that we have spiked to a 5-week high, what are they telling you about how the bond market is positioning itself ahead of the RBI policy later this week? Do you think it is a pause or would the RBI be able to push for a rate cut?
Our house view, economist view is for a pause. There is a possibility that they might change the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral, depending on how they look at and interpret the fiscal numbers. On a real rate and CPI basis, our stance was that they would move a neutral positioning, but the fiscal numbers are something which we have to see, how they digest the numbers and how they interpret it. 

But for this policy, definitely, it would be a pause. Bond markets clearly are even talking to bond investors and traders are asking themselves that the bond markets are worried about the fiscal maths very clearly, but they are waiting for further cues from the RBI policy.


Are clients asking you questions about companies like Zee, Sun, suddenly Vedanta? These are stocks which are dominated by global investors, these are stocks where foreigners do have large commitments. Is there a discussion in the financial community about what is going on in terms of disclosures, capital allocation, promoter pledges or this is all part of the game?

Yes, the questions are being asked, but we have not seen any panic or big alarm in a broad-based way, for sure. I cannot talk about individual companies, but some of the issues have been known in the market, including by these investors. Clearly, this is a market cycle or the stage of the market cycle we are in right now. Some of these issues coming up are not digested favourably or ignored by the markets. 

At this stage of the market cycle, stocks do react in an adverse way and pledge is a different issue altogether. Pledge issues are coming up much more in a pronounced way whenever we see liquidity is tight and then get into a vicious cycle. Yes, there is a discussion point and some worry about specific holders of these individual stocks, but we have not sensed any broad-based panic or alarm yet.



How should one understand this entire issue which has cropped up in the debt market? When round one of selling happened, it was all inter-related. Some funds had IL&FS exposure, then that had a cascading effect on other HFCs. Funding had dried up. Liquidity had frozen. Writedowns were taken and then things change. Now that more and more skeletons are being discovered from the cupboard, we know that it is still muddy waters. Do you expect an excruciating fall in NBFCs and especially those NBFCs which are dependent on mutual fund funding? 

Absolutely. The trend was set in motion a year ago with liquidity tightening and then the IL&FS issue and now, the current issues of the entire funding source or the liquidity moving away from NBFCs. And then, the mutual fund route of financing these NBFCs moving towards banks and more so towards retail liability driven banks is something to consider. 

That trend will continue for further foreseeable future and whether the stocks correct or not depend on the individual stocks, valuations, and the like, but overall from top-down perspective, we still find the risk reward unfavourable for NBFCs in general. Individual NBFCs with good parentage can still manage to do well, but at top-down asset allocation level, we will still be cautious on NBFCs.

There is an expectation of a benign rate cycle from the RBI monetary policy as well. Just give us a sense as to what is the expectation on banks? 

It is a sort of consensus trade right now in view, but we also subscribe to the view that the move towards private banks will continue and within private corporate banks, the ones with retail deposit franchise. Our positive view for private banks is not across the board, but for those banks which have their retail deposit franchise. That segment of the financial services system will do well. 

As for corporate lenders without retail deposit franchise, it again depends on the individual bank, but the ask will be tougher. Non-bank financials and SOE banks in general will still struggle in terms of stock prices. Individual, specific NBFCs or small finance banks with good traction and good parentage can still do well. That is the way we are positioning for the financial services space for our investors.



A word on autos because you are not really seeing any meaningful comeback from any of the auto majors. Having said that, the stock prices across the board be it Maruti or Eicher have also taken a sharp knock. Do you see them get into value zone or do you think the pain will linger on for some more time and thereby some more downside in the stock prices perhaps?

We are still cautious on two wheelers and trucks. Passenger cars, tractors pain may not be over yet, but at least given where the stock prices are or where the numbers are, at least we do not find the risk reward that negative but broadly top-down, we are neutral on autos. We are definitely cautious on two wheelers and trucks. It will take time for the numbers to come back to high single digit, double digit for the sector."

  make money, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP, Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What is your take on the RBI policy? Is the rate cut of 25 bps what the markets were looking forward to? What did you make of it?
The rate cut has left all the analysts on the sidelines of both the equity market and on the credit side. Nobody was expecting a rate cut and nobody was talking of Nifty at 11,000 and beyond. Those are both proverbial points. Now credit will expand over a period of time but the sentiment is extremely positive. 

The new RBI governor has done a lot to reinstate confidence in PSU banks, in NBFCs and over a period of time, I see most of the problems getting sorted out. There is an overhang from the IL&FS issue but a large part of that is telling you that some of the NBFCs which have stretched themselves extra are definitely going to be hit. 

But the larger picture is that banks are going to be in a sweet spot because they may not transmit the entire 25 bps and cost of funds will fall for them. Also you are in an environment where inflation, yields are at multi-year lows. This is much in order, given that even the Fed is now sounding dovish. 

On equity markets, the left out feeling was there and most people are still doubting the rally because selective largecaps have made this high. The broader market has still underperformed but that is the way equity markets are. The broader market may start to catch up and you could see consolidation in the largecaps.


You believe that auto is a good contrarian bet. You like Eicher as well as Ashok Leyland. What is the rationale?
I liked Eicher very much below Rs 20,000, Maruti at Rs 6,500 and Ashok Leyland at Rs 81. All three have given a stellar rally. The rationale was that autos for the last three years has been the biggest consumption driver. There has been one or two quarters of NBFC fiasco and the insurance part may have played out negatively. Consumption spending is coming back and we are very bullish on the broader market. 

Autos as a consumer discretionary will see valuations very much in buyer’s favour if you were buying the fear. I continue to be overweight on Maruti, Eicher, Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland by the way will be the largest bus-maker not in India, but globally. They are getting huge traction on some of the EU orders on electric vehicles and so on.

The bus and the LCV market is now looking very bright for slightly longer term. Autos and metals as a contrarian have played out well. We still think there is at least 10% upside in the likes of Maruti and Eicher.


What exactly is your take on the cement space? The overall demand-supply mismatch has narrowed down significantly. What is the view on the general trend within the cement basket?
Cement has been a slight bit of a laggard in the sense that volumes may have played out but margins and the price of petcoke has affected profitability. But this is a one to two quarter hiatus. 

Low-cost housing continues to be the theme and let us not look at the next three months, but months beyond the election. You will see a huge capex from both the private and the government side gathering steam and cement is a no-brainer. If you have a slightly longer-term view, on this correction, accumulate UltraTech and ACC. You can add JK Lakshmi Cement and Shree Cement. Shree Cement by the way came out with the best numbers as their margins were highest amongst the lot and that trend can continue. Cement and commodities could be a huge outperformer in the second half of 2019.


How have you looked at the steps that have been taken? These efforts to create fewer but stronger banks with large balance sheets?
These are welcome steps. You merge some of the bad apples with the good ones and you are opening that synergies of space and more economies of scale play out. Obviously, it will have short-term dampener because the bad banks will take time to be recapitalised. But banks have been well recapitalised and if you stick with the larger ones, then there is a huge amount of wealth to be created given capex revival and write-backs for corporate facing banks. The likes of State Bank, BOB and Can Bank can be huge outperformers. 

Their numbers will prove from the March quarter, when we see a lot of write-backs on infra, power and some of the resolutions of IBC. IBC is the powerful tool. Only, these stocks can take some time before the return on balance sheet improves. It is a very welcome step if you get fewer banks with more consolidation and mergers, but in the short run, they may not create too much wealth for you. It is only in the longer term that they play out well.


What is view on Coal India and NMDC?
Coal India is a proverbial value play with 8.5% dividend yield and the results this quarter will be the best in 18 quarters. At 11 times price to earnings, I have never seen it cheaper. Obviously there is the overhang that at Rs 260, the government sold some of its stake and so on but PSU stocks are trading at abysmal levels. ONGC, NTPC, GMDC, even Coal India. Once we are through elections, PSUs will create a lot of wealth in the second half.

We have seen that most of the PSUs have been performing excellently in their business lines. So, Coal India becomes a no-brainer. I do not rule out a 25% upside. I know it has been a laggard but that is where a value pick comes. 

With that, you can also add NBCC, one of my old stocks which has not performed much but I can reiterate that this is an excellent company. It has pan India visibility in tier I, tier II cities where order flows and construction activity are picking up in a big way. 

GMDC dividend yield is extremely attractive and NMDC also, given that iron ore prices are moving up. This means the steel cycle and commodities are expected to do well globally. Definitely, these would be contrarian buys with a 25% upside by the end of the year.


Which are the pockets that could take the markets higher in the next phase? 
Autos, metals, consumption and construction are looking good. As a sector, consumption has been a huge outperformer -- whether it is durables or discretionary or staples. Even though valuations are looking stretched, they still seem to be the best place to be. The other caveat is that we have had a very good rally from 10,500 back to 11,200. Nifty maybe pricing in everything here. You may consolidate but not see too much on upside over there. 

It is the broader market which I think can come back and that will again depend on soothening of a lot of ex-factor, the ADAG problem, DHFL. Sooner, rather than later, people will try to get into better names like IDFC Bank First. I have been extremely bullish on this stock. This is a doubler in next two years. It is going to be one of the biggest gainers on the fiasco. So be stock specific.

Coal India, NBCC, IDFC Bank First, Ashok Leyland and Eicher are going to be marquee names where you will make money, but I think maybe the index is done for the time being. You will wait for more colour, closer to the election but it will be the broader market which should stand to gain in the next month or so. 


When will L&T start performing?
That is a good question but you have to be patient. Look at the numbers from Siemens, Cummins. They are both telling you that industrial capex is reviving. The L&T management is extremely bullish. Remember that these stocks will not trade at a significant discount to better valuations because in two quarters they can come out with numbers which they have not done in 12 quarters. 

So L&T, ITC are no-brainers. If you are a value investor, you will make a lot of money. The problem is they may have been in range for some time and the market is justly rewarding some of the outperformers. But these are extremely good stocks to own and must-haves in your portfolio."

17,2019-02-09,Eicher,"The range for the markets can be a little bit wider over the next two to three months and also a little more stock- 
  
  
  specific, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


What do you make of the market’s direction in the week gone by and what clues does it give you for the weeks ahead?
The two key events -- the budget and the RBI policy are now truly behind us. In the next few weeks, we are probably looking at more global action. What happens with Brexit is going to be very critical for global markets. The government moves on shutdown that the US markets are facing at this point of time is going to be equally critical. We also have to look at what happens with the global data points in terms of economic parameters, the GDP numbers, the PMI numbers, not just in the context of China but also the European economies ex UK. What happens with the European Union is going to be extremely critical. 

At the same time, we are heading into the general elections and that will keep the markets on tenterhooks. Earnings in general have been very lumpy even for the quarter gone by. A consistent earnings growth is what the market will probably look at to probably justify the valuations that they are deriving at this point of time. You should be bracing yourself for volatility which will continue. 

The range for the markets can be a little bit wider over the next two to three months. It is a little more stock-specific in my opinion rather than playing on the index. Good quality stocks have stood the test of time. Investing in quality names at this point of time is probably the only pertinent choice that long-term investors have.


There is big concern over Tata Motors after the near Rs 27,000 crore loss it showed. There are concerns around global growth. M&M also talked a little bit about overseas markets. Eicher Motors numbers are coming up in the week ahead. In auto, will more domestic oriented names see some interest going ahead? There is general patchiness in the auto sector as a whole -- be it two-wheelers, passenger vehicles or even the M&HCV players. The lumpiness in reported numbers have played out in terms of prices. The second element is also that the input cost inflation had probably eaten into their operating performance and with the introduction of third party insurance and the volatility that we saw in crude prices, the cost of ownership had moved up. This made choices for the end user to be pushed back a little bit more. 

The discounting factor still probably continues as the inventory pipeline at dealer networks remain a little bit on the higher side. A few players like M&M have few launches ahead of them which means that there will be elevated product and promotion related costs. As we move into the regime where BS-VI will start getting incorporated over the next four to five quarters, pre-buying will come in.

With a lot of modifications required for BS-VI, the cost of ownership for the new variants being compliant with BS-VI will go up. The discretionary demand patterns in the markets remain soft at this point of time. They are going to normalise but at what point of time is going to prove to be extremely critical. 

For global facing autos, there’s uncertainty over the model and what probably is being witnessed in terms of the trends towards the EV side both in terms of R&D investments and the rollout of models expected over the next one to two years.

The cash flows are being kept in check, the top line and the volumes are not growing; the margins are under pressure and that is creating a huge valuation gap. The earnings are disappointing and again the earnings might remain a little bit subdued. The auto pack is expected to go through a rough patch at least for the next one to two quarters. Normalisation will definitely happen but in order to take a call, I will wait it out for a couple of months, look at the trends and then probably look at specific stocks within the sector itself. 


Another pocket of the market which everyone appears to be fairly favourable on is pharma. What is your view? Also, which are the other pockets of the market that you are positive on right now?
I am being selective here. The numbers were encouraging to say the least. There are a lot of issues -- be it FDA concerns, pricing issues, the remedial costs associated with FDA issues and the expectations of clearances coming through, so that the ANDA filing can go through giving revenue visibility. 
These are some of the factors that the market and the pharma sector can probably look at FY20 onwards. 

Out of the numbers that have come through in terms of earnings profile, stocks like Cipla, Aurobindo can continue to do well. A disclaimer we hold these stocks in our funds. 

Out of the other sectors, banking is something that we will continue to pursue and like over the medium to long term. The reported numbers by the private retail corporate lenders have been very encouraging. The advances growth is expected to continue on a very strong footing. 

The asset quality pressures have come off and again the reflexion in terms of higher provisioning and reduction of cost to income ratios will mean that the credit cost will start coming down meaningfully over the next few years. That itself will lay a base with strong advances growth and strong capital adequacy for improvement in their ROAs and ROEs. 

We hold on to banks like Axis, ICICI and within the midcap space, the midcap private banks like Federal Bank. In our opinion, the worst is probably over. You might have one more quarter of patchiness in terms of reported numbers but the overall earnings trends and the adjusted book value even at the current juncture looks pretty attractive to us. 

We are being very selective in NBFCs as a space. We have liked gold financing companies and we continue to hold positions here. Our thesis is very simple, the loan to value and the expectations of asset-liability mismatch probably is not very apparent here. The asset quality pressures are coming off, adequacy remains strong and the new RBI dictate in terms of credit risk weights benefit the earnings profile for these companies as well. 

Within the broader, we are very selective in cement companies and a few of the outer-bound consumption names. The ancillary consumption names related to hotels or paper stocks can also do well over the next couple of years."
18,2019-02-10,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty managed to eke out gains for the week gone by despite a deep cut on Friday's session.

However, gains were nominal as weak global sentiment and absence of any positive domestic trigger weighed on investor sentiment. 

For the week, Sensex rose 77 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 36,546, while Nifty50 gained 49 points, or 0.45 per cent, to 10,943. 

Macro numbers, global trend and crude oil prices are among the major themes that will influence the movement of the market in the coming week.


Let's take a look at factors that may dominate market mood:


Budget session: The last Parliament session of the current NDA government is ending on Wednesday. Having announced several sops for farmers and the lower-middle class, in the run-up to the general elections, the market is not expecting any additional populist steps by the government, but as they say, politics is an unpredictable game.


Inflation print: The retail inflation and wholesale inflation prints for the month of January will set the tone for the market. Lower fuel prices further eased India's retail inflation in December to 2.19 per cent from the annual rate of 2.33 per cent in November. The annual rate of inflation, based on monthly WPI, stood at 3.80 per cent for the month of December 2018 as compared to 4.64 per cent for November. The numbers may come out in a similar range for January too. Recently, the RBI cut its repo rate by 25 basis points considering the benign inflation level. 

Consumer inflation numbers will be out on Tuesday, while wholesale inflation is scheduled to be unveiled on Thursday.


IIP data: The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) print for the month of December will be released on Tuesday. IIP growth stood at 0.47 per cent in November, with the high base of last year contributing to the slowdown, according to data released by the statistics office, mostly because of the contraction in the manufacturing sector as a post-festival season decline in manufacturing, fewer working days in the month and tighter financial conditions pulled down output. Manufacturing, which constitutes 77.63 per cent of IIP, shrank 0.4 per cent versus 10.4 per cent growth a year ago. A disappointing IIP data for the two consecutive months may not augur well for the market. 


Global macro: UK's fourth quarter GDP print will certainly catch eyes as a softer number may further aggravate the concerns of global economic slowdown after the European Commission last Thursday cut its growth forecast for the euro zone this year and the next, fanning worries that a global slowdown is spreading to Europe.

Moreover, China's inflation data for January, Japan's industrial production data for December and US Retail Sales for December are the major global macroeconomic numbers slated for release this week that will influence market movement. 


US-China trade talk: As the recent meetings failed to offer any breakthrough, a new round of US-China trade talks is to begin on Monday. This is in the wake of the US President's comment last week in which he negated any possibility of meeting his Chinese counterpart to resolve the issue before the March 1 deadline. A swift and timely resolution of the issue will be no less than manna from heaven for markets.


Earnings: Most heavyweights have released their October-December earnings so far. Among the leftovers, numbers of Coal India, Hindalco, Eicher Motors, ONGC and Sun Pharma will be closely watched by the market. 


Technical outlook: Friday's losses indicated a downside momentum for Nifty on technical charts. On the weekly scale, the index formed a ‘High Wave’ pattern, suggesting selling pressure at higher levels. Any negative close on Monday could see the index test its 200-DMA at 10,855, said Arun Kumar, Market Strategist at Reliance Securities. 

Other than the above-mentioned factors, global markets sentiment, crude oil prices, rupee's movement against the US dollar and the inflow/outflow of institutional investors will also have their say in the market."
24,2019-02-11,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Eicher Motors is all set to report its third quarter results on Monday. 

Investors will keenly follow the commentary on Royal Enfield’s inventory level and its demand in metros, tier 1 and tier 2 cities.

At 10.30 am, the scrip was 0.46 per cent higher at Rs 20,943.35. 

During the quarter gone by, Royal Enfield’s volumes rose 3.8 per cent YoY to 214,451 units.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects the company to report 8.3 per cent YoY rise in adjusted PAT at Rs 580 crore. Consolidated revenue is seen rising 10.3 per cent YoY for the quarter to Rs 2,500 crore. Consolidated margin is likely to be 30.3 per cent.

Net realisation, the brokerage said, may improve by 6.5 per cent YoY. Ebitda margin is expected to contract 140 bps YoY to 30.3 per cent.

Emkay Global noted that Royal Enfield’s volumes saw a 10 per cent YoY decline in November-December despite the absence of negative one-off factors such as production losses due to labour strikes and a weak demand in Kerala following incessant rain and floods.

“Volume performance has been under pressure during the quarter due to the steep but inevitable price increases influenced by external factors as well as the emergence of strong competition with entry of Jawa motorcycles, which has provided an alternative to RE's unique brand and offerings. Jawa has witnessed strong order bookings and existing production capacity is fully booked until September,"" it said."

26,2019-02-11,Eicher,"New Delhi: Gurgaon-based Eicher Motors Monday met street estimates to post a 2% increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 533 crore for the three months ended December 31, 2018.

The company had registered net profit of Rs 521 crore in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. ET Now poll had estimated net profit of Rs 523 crore in the period under consideration.

Revenues from operations at Royal Enfield rose 3% to Rs 2341 crore in the period under review. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) dropped 4% to Rs 680 crore. Ebitda margins last quarter stood at 29% despite a 6% slide in volumes at Royal Enfield at 193871 units.

Siddhartha Lal, Managing Director and CEO Eicher Motors Ltd, said, “The latter half of 2018 was a challenging period for the two-wheeler industry in India. Factors like increased insurance requirements, rising raw material costs and the subsequent price increase due to regulatory safety requirements impacted the momentum of the industry. Royal Enfield’s market share recorded improvement on a sequential basis, while volumes in the quarter were impacted.”

“We believe this is a temporary impact due to a price reset. We continue to remain optimistic about the trend of premiumization in the motorcycling industry, and are confident that this trend will continue in the future”, Lal added.

In the commercial vehicles (CV) segment, VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV) - Eicher’s joint-venture with AB Volvo - was affected by the industry slowdown especially in heavy duty (HD) segment. Net profit declined by 43% to Rs. 76 crores from Rs. 133 crores last year. VECV’s revenue from operations rose by 9% to Rs. 2,818 crores from Rs. 2590 crores in the same period last year. EBITDA declined by 18% to Rs. 186 crores from Rs. 226 crores in the same period last year.

VECV sold 16,936 trucks and buses in the quarter, growing 4% over the same period last year. VECV’s performance in the light and medium duty (LMD) segment continued to be in line with the industry registering 9% growth on a year-on-year basis. In the HD segment, the VECV recorded a growth of 4% while industry declined by 13% year-on-year.

During the quarter, certain non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) scaled back their lending activities affecting sales. The trend of heavy discounting continues in the CV industry despite the sustained demand, Eicher Motors said in its filing to the bourses.

Speaking on VECV’s performance LaL said, “While the demand momentum continues in the CV industry, sales were affected especially in HD segment due to change in axle load norms and liquidity crunch. However, in Q3 2019, VECV increased its market share in HD Trucks through focused market penetration and strengthening the product portfolio with new launches of our modernised ‘Value Trucks’ over the past year.”

Anil Agarwal, the owner of some of the largest mining assets in India, is known for a high appetite for risky bets. Over the past two decades, some of the large-ticket acquisitions helped him build an empire in the mining and metals business but not without a mounting pile of debt.

Board meetings"
25,2019-02-11,Eicher,"The foreign institutional investors might stay away for a bit due to political uncertainties and the time of entry 
  
  
  will still be uncertain, Naveen Kulkarni, HoR, Reliance Securities, tells ET Now. Sonata Software, Cyient, Majesco are the top picks among IT midcaps and DCB among midcap private banks. Edited excerpts: 


What is the expectation from Eicher Motors? We are expecting the margins to contract. The launch cost and increased input cost could hurt the numbers. Is there anything that you are factoring in?
This is a stock that we currently do not have under our coverage but overall from the automobile space, we are not positive on the two-wheeler category as a whole. We are slightly more positive or optimistic on the four-wheeler category. But we see a lot of challenges with regards to channel inventory movement. Second, competitive intensity is continuing to rise. Demand also is not that great. There are much more challenges on the two-wheeler side rather than the four-wheeler side. We are not very optimistic at this juncture on the auto space especially on the two-wheelers.


Would there be a similar view when it comes to passenger vehicles as well? Across categories, one has the impression that other than Tata Motors because of JLR, even a domestic market leader like Maruti has been hurting on volumes?
Maruti’s play is slightly better because the channel inventory is not so high and has been on a decline. There is pressure both on the margin front as well as on the demand scenario. It will take a while for the base to become a little more favourable for the auto companies. That is when optically the growth will start improving, but the real growth rate also has to improve. That will probably take around three to six months. We will be in a little bit of a wait-and-watch mode for even the four-wheeler passenger vehicles. We are quite negative on the commercial vehicle (CV) play. I would say that among passenger vehicles, Maruti is slightly better placed, but even then, we will be in a wait and watch mode.


Let us talk about the overall liquidity. While quite a bit of support came in from the DIIs, FIIs have definitely been steering clear of Indian markets. Do you think that with the big election event around the corner, that kind of a position is likely to continue for the foreign investors?
Yes, it seems more likely the foreign institutional investors may not invest so much, but again it is very difficult to gauge when foreign institutional investors would start looking into the Indian market as a whole. 

The global liquidity situation has been tightening for a while and I would believe that this year might be year of little bit of respite but it remains to be seen when that scenario actually changes. To be specific on the India front, I would believe that foreign institutional investors might stay away but it will depend on what the news flow will be on the political front. In a couple of months, we might start getting some of that opinion polls coming through, where if the political scenario emerges as a little more constructive, then we might start seeing some bit of flows coming through. 

It is going to be a tricky situation because the news flow might continue to remain volatile. From that perspective, for now, the foreign institutional investors might stay away for a bit and the time of entry will still be uncertain.


Let us understand the outlook as well on the sectors that you are bullish on. What is the earnings growth that you are expecting from IT? Which are the stocks that you like within the space?
IT again has been our favoured sector for a while now. We like both the largecaps and midcaps. From an earnings perspective, we are looking at 12-14% kind of an earnings growth coming through for next year. The stocks that we like in the largecap space are TCS and Infosys. Infosys has been our top pick in the largecap IT space. The stock has done quite well now and so that continues to be one of our bullish picks. 

In the midcap space, we like Sonata Software. The results that the company reported last week were pretty decent. The earnings growth has been good. We are looking at an 18% kind of CAGR for the next two years. The earnings growth is likely to remain pretty stable and good for Sonata. So, that is the stock that we like in the midcap space for IT.


Across the midcap category, anything else that you like beside the stocks that you just talked about?
I would say that the IT midcap space looks attractive. The only challenge with the midcap IT space is that the earnings can be a little volatile. In some quarters, there might be misses but what we are seeing right now is a gradual improvement in earnings for the midcap stocks also. So, Sonata Software is the top pick in the midcap IT space. Apart from Sonata, something like Cyient might do better in the forthcoming quarters. We also like Majesco. Overall, the midcap space looks quite interesting to us at this point in time and earnings growth is more likely to pick up in the midcap space from here on.


Within the private banking space, what is catching your eye among the corporate retail lenders ?
Banking as a space has been one of our favoured allocation area. I have been talking about Axis and ICICI Bank for a fairly long period and Axis has done pretty well in the last couple of months.

We even continue to like ICICI Bank at current levels, I believe the stock is quite reasonably valued. There is a lot of room for the stock to rerate even from the current levels. The overall operating performance has been pretty good. So ICICI Bank is another name that we like in the private banking space. Among the midcap names what we like is DCB. That is another stock that we like in the midcap space from the banking sector."

27,2019-02-11,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Eicher Motors on Monday reported a 2.39 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated profit at Rs 532.95 crore for December quarter, which was marginally ahead of Rs 523 crore estimated by analysts in an ET Now poll. 

The company had reported a net profit of Rs 520.50 core in the corresponding quarter a year ago.

Consolidated sales for the quarter rose 3.42 per cent YoY to Rs 2,328.25 crore in December quarter compared with Rs 2,250.65 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. This was higher than Rs 2,290 crore sales analysts predicted in the ET Now poll. Here are key takeaways from the results.


Profit dropped by half CV segment: Industry-wide slowdown hurt sales at VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV), Eicher’s joint-venture with AB Volvo. Heavy Duty (HD) segment was hit the most. VECV sold 16,936 trucks and buses in the quarter, up 4 per cent YoY. VECV’s Ebitda dropped 18 per cent to Rs 186 crore from Rs 226 crore in the same period last year while profit after tax plunged 43 per cent to Rs 76 crore from Rs 133 crore last year. Revenue from operations rose 9 per cent to Rs 2,818 crore in December quarter from Rs 2,590 crore in the same period last year.

MD & CEO Siddhartha Lal said that while the demand momentum continued in the CV industry, sales were affected especially in HD segment due to change in axle load norms and liquidity crunch.


RE volume hit by price reset: Even as Royal Enfield’s market share saw improvement on a sequential basis, volumes in the quarter were impacted. Royal Enfield sold 193,871 motorcycles in the quarter, registering a decline of 6 per cent from 202,736 motorcycles sold in the same period last year. Lal said that the numbers were temporary impacted due to a price reset. “Factors like increased insurance requirements, rising raw material costs and the subsequent price increase due to regulatory safety requirements impacted the momentum of the industry,” he added.

Lal said his company remained optimistic about the trend of premiumisation in the motorcycling industry.


Global deliveries of 650cc motorcycles soon: During the quarter the company launched the Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650 motorcycles in India and other key markets across the globe. The company said that while retail sales have already begun in India, deliveries in the global markets are expected to begin soon.

The 650 twins were also launched in the UK and Europe at the EICMA Motorcycle Show in Milan, Italy and also in Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia and Australia."
28,2019-02-11,Eicher,"From February and March onwards, I expect a pick up. We have seen some positive commentary coming from 
  
  
  some of the two-wheeler manufacturers, Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

Would you be willing to buy Eicher at Rs 20,000 or a little below that?
Numbers still are at about 25 times earnings for Eicher. You are getting other two-wheeler manufacturers at a much lower price. I do not think the Royal Enfield brand is carrying them above that crucial Rs 75,000 month kind of number. They are not being able to pass that for about a year now and actually they have a problem, they do not have enough capacity. It is only a minor expansion that they have done. They do not have substantial capacity.

When you are paying this much for a company, I would assume that growth would have to follow right now but the growth is not there. There is not enough room right now for that kind of growth considering capacity. So unless something new comes from the stable, I am not a buyer in this stock. The Hero and the Bajaj organisations and their stock price itself lands themselves to be more attractive in two-wheeler space than Royal Enfield or Eicher in this case.


What is your overall view of the auto sector?
So we have been long auto. The sector has been beaten up black and blue. If you look at it, it is almost like the end of auto, but I do not think so. From a macro perspective, longer term there is still very large structural growth potential for all three -- be it two-wheelers, passenger cars or commercial vehicles.

 I believe commercials have been hit a bit because of the kind of economy that has had two issues, largely financing related issues because a lot of NBFCs were not able to finance commercial vehicles and there was also a fallout from the axle load rules.

A lot of OEMs and the primary manufacturers themselves would have suffered because there will be a lag effect in terms of demand coming back up. So take this stake also, the auto passenger car in two wheelers where insurance cost is priced quite substantially and input price is increased from raw material perspective. 

We have had a hiatus. It is not really structural slowdown but some of these factors have led to primarily increase in financing cost and reduction in availability of finance and also the regulatory changes have played some part in the reduction of demand in the last six months. 

However, from Feb and March onwards, I expect a pick up. We have seen some positive commentary coming from some of the two-wheeler manufacturers saying that things seem to be picking up from the mid of January onwards. I still do not see that really reflecting until end of February or Maybe even March. 

From then on, numbers should stabilise and start looking better. With BS-VI coming in from April 1, 2020, I believe some of the demand will start getting front loaded toward the end of this year. So if you look at it from perspective of population versus the amount of transportation needed in general, we are a very small fraction of the total market. There is no way we are even close to saturation. So, I believe, longer term it is a great story. Short term we are going to get beaten up. 

If you are a holder of this stock, assume 5% or 10% falls will be standard. If you are in it only for the long term, you want to be in these auto names and I think pick the leaders in the packs whether it is two wheelers, four wheelers or commercial vehicles here.


Do aviation companies make for an investment case? Now that crude prices have cooled off, they are not like what they used to be in Q3?
It turns out really that most airlines seemed to be one-way bets on the crude price itself. They do not seem to be able to either hedge or be able to kind of offset any of that in their cost structure at all. If you look at SpiceJet also, there has been a 50% increase in fuel costs, whereas revenues were up only about 15%. So obviously profits are going to be down. 

The single largest item on their expense list -- about 30-35% of expenses is fuel. You do not have any strategy to kind of hedge or even if you have pre-booked tickets, you do not hedge the cost of fuel which is remarkable.

At this point, it is just disappointing because if I want to bet on crude. I will just buy crude why would I buy an airline. At this point, I do not see any operational efficiency-led investment thesis. It just seems to be crude all the way. I would avoid the sector overall.


What is your overall outlook on the space and an ONGC in particular?
ONGC has had a couple of challenges. One was the whole debt cycle that they had to take to buy out HPCL. Probably by the June quarter, that probably will be wiped off the books. So, that is a positive. I think it depends on whether HPCL will pay a dividend to do a buyback which should augment ONGC’s buffers and allow them to do their large buyback in dividend. 

Having said that right now, discount because of government ownership, is quite high and if you were to ask me I would take a play on OMC rather than on ONGC right now because ONGC will be used by the government for its ability to generate cash in many ways, going forward. The general theory is that it is too much of cash cow for the government which is starved of funds and can’t let it live in peace.

I am cynical about its medium term ability to deliver returns.


Sun TV showed some healthy subscription revenue growth, which drove the top line for them. SL Narayanan says that OTT platforms are going to continue to grow very smartly, and ad revenue growth is going to be driven by the Bengali, Marathi channels as well.What one should do with the Sun TV?
I have not seen Sun’s results. We have stopped following most of the stocks in that sector but I think this quarter onwards we are going to see some pretty interesting changes in revenue because of the new TRAI regulation. 

So, at this point, I will wait. It is going to be positive for content providers and for channels because a substantial increase in revenue, especially with the popularity of Sun TV coming in. This is a positive for near term but I would like to see how the TRAI regulations impact results that is only going to be available in the March results. So I would wait till then to make a call. 

We have not gone through financial details and so I do not have anything specific to say about them. But it is a game changer in terms of the regulation."

  choose strategy going forward, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Eicher management is saying that they foresee weaker sales in foreseeable future. Could we see a significant derating in the stock or would you say that the negatives are already known and well in the price?
Our target price for Eicher Motors is now Rs 19,500. For this year, we estimate that the volume growth will be close to 3%, next year the number would be around 8.5% and then a 6.5% growth, which is likely. 

Though from a revenue perspective, part of the downside has been built in, we feel the margins are likely to be under further pressure because from April 2020, there will be the BS-VI implementation which will further lead to an increase in pricing. 

Already, there has been some price increase because of ABS and some of the other things. Despite 650cc doing pretty well, the risk reward has still not become favourable for investors in Eicher Motors. We continue to have a reduced rating on the stock. 


Hindalco realisations could potentially aide the overall top line growth but high input costs could be a bit of a drag. How have you read into Tata Steel and other numbers from the metal space so far? What is the expectation if any from Hindalco?
In case of the overall metal sector, Tata Steel will probably do well going forward because it is more integrated and now we have seen that the last 20 days has seen iron ore prices being hiked by more than 20%. For that reason, relative to others steel sector stocks, Tata Steel will do well. 

Coming back to Hindalco, the focus is going to be how Utkal utilisation rate improves over the next two years. In terms of Novelis, the kind of spread that they were making on the inventory, that benefit is likely to dip going forward. 

Right now, from a risk-reward perspective, I would wait for a 10% fall in the stock and then look at adding positions in the sector. Valuation wise, the stock looks cheap but because China is slowing down, there continues to be some issues with regard to future outlook in terms of growth for Hindalco. 


SUUTI is looking at divesting the 3% stake in Axis Bank. It has come in at a premium to the current market price?
That is a brilliant move done by the government at the right time. Axis Bank has been one of the top performing stocks over the last six months, it has been our number one favourite in the banking space even relative to ICICI Bank.

It has done very well for us and we feel that going forward from a fiscal perspective, it is a very good move by the government. For a lot of foreign institutional investors, from a liquidity perspective, it is a good time to buy large chunks of this particular stock because for the next two years, this company in terms of how they manage business is going to transform with the new management coming in. Though there may be some very short-term pressure on the stock because of such a large asset sale, but from the next two years perspective it continues to be one of our top picks. 


DLF is talking about zero debt in the residential business and a 15% CAGR in rentals over the next four to five years. How do you see the story playing up for the real estate space as a whole? 
Some of the larger players should do well going forward. The the smallcaps and the midcaps have not done well and the government took a lot of steps in the last budget with regard to unsold inventory and a couple of other measures. The sector might do better, especially the bigger companies. 

With rental business going up, passive income is a critical thing for anyone to earn and from that perspective, most of these companies should do well. In case of Godrej, in Pune, they have cracked a big deal for five to six projects with one of the large land-owners. 

Those kind of deals are clearly something which the market is looking at. I would say stick to quality like Oberoi, Godrej and DLF who have slightly higher risk taking capability. Over the next two years, make a decent amount of money in these companies as the leverage will be lower going forward. 


What is your take on pharmaceuticals in the light of the two observations with regards to the Goa facility of Lupin and Sun Pharma’s earnings today?
We have been negative on Lupin for the last couple of quarters and continue to be so because we believe the US generic market will continue to face pressure and the additional warning letter clearly tells us that going forward things will continue to remain tough. 

The Sun Pharma stock has come down and we have been quite bearish on the company for the last three quarters. After results, corporate governance issue will also be critical. If they deliver decent numbers, then the stock obviously has become cheap but because of corporate governance issues, it is out of favour with a lot of the large investor base. 

In terms of the US market where they are getting into more of complex generics that kind of investment would lead to significantly lower margins in the initial phase of investment over the next two years. A rebound in earnings will be a bit difficult for Sun Pharma at least for a couple of quarters. 


Indian equities seem to have lost steam vis-à-vis the other markets. We have yielded a negative 2% return in dollar terms as well. With some of the heavyweights like Maruti, ICICI Bank, L&T, HDFC Bank pulling down the index, is that likely to continue?
Around six months back, India was the only outperforming market among emerging markets. Now other markets have also done in line with India over the last six to seven months. Coming back to the Indian market, the smallcap index is down close to around 25% odd. That means a lot of peoples’ portfolios have got battered. However, FIIs will come back once the earnings growth bounces back. 

In terms of stocks I like Reliance, ICICI, stocks that can pull up the index to some extent in addition to HDFC. On the metal side, there is still concern of the Chinese slowdown. Overall, we feel one could see more upmoves on the broader market side than on the index. A large part of the rally has only happened because of a couple of stocks going up and now going forward, as we come close to the election time, we are seeing a lot of people postponing decision-making in terms of investing. By May, they want a clarity on who forms the government and then get into the market. 

We have been telling our clients to look at good stocks available at cheaper price. These may not be part of their allocation but one can consider adding up to positions in the market. 

From a sectoral perspective, metals is down more than 28%, auto is down by around 25%. It has become a market which base has shrunk to very few stocks in terms of outperformance. One needs to practice pick-and-choose strategy going forward. 


Are there any house recommendations, anything within the mid or the small cap universe where you have a buy on at the current levels?
Apollo Tyre is one of the stocks that we really like. There was some amount of margin contraction in the last quarter because of inventory levels being higher from the previous quarter. Going forward, the replacement market will continue to do pretty well and we see an upside in the company from the ramp up that we are seeing in the European plant. The stock is trading at around 10x which in the current market scenario is quite attractive. That is one of our favoured stocks from the midcap space. 


What exactly is the outlook in the overall IT space? Is there potential in some of the select midcap IT stocks?
Yes. The digital growth for most of the IT companies continues to be quite robust, above 20% so as long as the core business still continues to grow at 5-6%. We see the bumpup in growth from digital. IT sector should do well going forward as well. 

From a contra perspective, we are quite bullish on Mindtree. Going forward, some of the issues with relation to some investors are trying to sell their stake. It will get sorted over the next one to two months. In terms of growth, they will have industry beating growth of around 18-19% going forward and from that perspective, we are quite bullish on that particular stock. Even something like Mphasis and even L&T Infotech look quite interesting. IT, especially midcap IT stocks, look quite good to us. 

Among largecaps, it would be Infosys as well as Tech Mahindra which we would recommend investors to look at considering the risk reward at this particular point of time."
34,2019-02-12,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Equity barometer Sensex extended its losing streak into the fourth consecutive session on Tuesday, shrugging off the rally in global stocks, as banking, financial, auto, IT and FMCG heavyweights suffered losses.

Globally, shares and bonds saw a renewed surge in risk appetite on Tuesday, as investors showed optimism about US-China trade talks and cheered Washington's deal to avoid another government shutdown, Reuters reported. 

Local investors kept their powder dry, awaiting IIP and retail inflation prints due later in the day. Moreover, they avoided fresh bets on Indian equities in the runup to general elections, while muted third quarter earnings have failed to boost the risk appetite.

Sensex suffered a loss of 241 points, or 0.66 per cent, to close the day at 36,153, while Nifty lost 57 points, or 0.53 per cent, to finish at 10,831.

The BSE Midcap index closed with a nominal loss of 9 points, or 0.06 per cent, at 14,108, while the BSE Smallcap index ended 58 points, or 0.43 per cent, lower at 13,392.

36,2019-02-13,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Moderating volume growth of Royal Enfield, a key brand, is a major challenge for Eicher Motors.

Lower demand in Kerala and Maharashtra and rising competition amid the launch of Jawa bikes by M&M and future launches by Harley Davidson in 2020 and Bajaj Triumph in 2021 are likely to restrain Enfield’s volume growth to single digits in the coming quarters.

Enfield’s sales volume fell by 6 per cent to 194,473 units in the December 2018 quarter. It has been sliding since July with rising cost of ownership of premium bikes due to higher insurance cost.

The pressure on volume accentuated since November after the company started passing on the higher cost pertaining to anti-braking system (ABS). It has increased prices by 6 per cent in the past three months. Prices are expected to increase further by 6-7 per cent in the next few quarters.

The company has estimated production of 870,000-880,000 units of Enfield for FY19 implying volume growth of 6-7 per cent, which is the lowest since FY11.

Despite this, the street is not convinced about the company’s guidance. To meet the guidance, it needs to sell at least 84,000 units in each of the last two months of the current fiscal that ends in March. This looks difficult given that the company sold 72,000 units in January.



In addition, the company said in the latest earnings call that inquiries at the showroom in the mature markets is declining.

Enfield’s volume has a lagged that of the premium bike segment in the past six months. Its market share in more than 125 cc bike segment dropped to 25 per cent in FY19 so far from 27 per cent in the previous fiscal year.

The company has been maintaining operating profit margin of 30-32 per cent in the past ten quarters but it may be affected in the future given rising competitive intensity.

The recently launched Jawa motorcycle is BS-VI norms compliant.

Hence, it may not require any significant price increase to comply with new emission norms. Which means, it may be easier for Jawa to gain market share.

Given the slowing sales volume, the premium multiple of Eicher Motors over the average of the mass market two-wheeler Hero Moto-Corp and Bajaj Auto is likely to shrink further. At the closing price of ?21,032, Eicher’s stock was traded at 20 times of FY20 projected earnings compared with the five average of 30 times."
38,2019-02-13,Eicher,"Difference between Nifty50 and midcap index is widening and that is not a good sign. Challenges around slowing 
  
  
  economy is really hurting overall market sentiments, Jinesh Gopani, Head - Equities, Axis MF, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:



We were just cribbing how we are completely disconnected from the way global markets are panning out. After three days of fall, we have just seen that touch-and-go moment with 11,100. Is this how we are going to be until the election?

 I think so. Volatility will continue till election. Also, the Nifty is in a very tight range. Unless and until the breakout is healthy, we are going to see markets going up and down 1% and 2%, even if the overall Q3 earnings have been okay. Largecaps have delivered good numbers but midcaps have been okay and hence, the midcap pain still continues. You are seeing the difference between the Nifty50 and midcap index widening which in a way is not a good sign. But the challenges around slowing economy in the second half of this fiscal year, is really hurting overall sentiments of the market. If you see markets are in a very tight range, waiting for some trigger, probably election would be the trigger to look for.


Elections are still three months away. How does one deal with the interim challenges like what will happen to NBFCs and Dewan Housing, the cross connection between ADAG and other banks etc? 
The NBFC challenge continues and till March, we have to be careful because liquidity is tight in the system and we will have to see how NBFCs, especially tier II, tier III, tier IV NBFCs, sustain in this period. Hope we do not see any defaults coming by. At this juncture at least we do not see that way, but things are pretty challenging for them and we have to be very careful in asserting how these NBFCs will really thrive over next 6 to 12 months. 

It is very challenging. To be very frank, there are corporate governance issues which are coming up every now and then and that has further impact on the overall sentiment of the market, especially on the mid and small side. Hope we pass this phase nicely till the election and then after the election, I hope the second half of CY2019 is much better than the first half. 


 What is the outlook from the private banks? The general sense is that given the problems plaguing the NBFC sector, there is going to be a lot of market share gain for some of these private sector retail banks. Do you agree? Is there anything specific you would bet on?
Private sector banks are very well placed even without these issues around NBFC. Having said that, obviously some market share gain will come from these NBFCs who slow down in their business models and obviously 10-15% of the good book or good lending will go to private sector banks. So we are bullish on private sector banks. 

If you see our portfolios, we are heavy on financials and more on the private sector bank side and we really feel it is a 5-10 year story. You have an under penetrated market. Market share gain from PSUs is the theme that is continuing for last 15-20 years and should continue further. Most of these private sector banks are technologically advanced and the critical game lies in being able to service your customer in the best form going forward. They are very well placed given their robust asset quality structure and disciplined ALM management. 


How do you see the market composition changing in terms of the pecking order? After some poor corporate governance standards in Zee or Sun Pharma, do you think that in a market where only 10% of the stocks were going higher, now only 2% or 3% will move up? There could be just 10-15 Nifty stocks and 10-15 midcap stocks!
When things are bad, when times are challenging and the economy slowing down, then on a high growth trajectory all these issues come up. Normally, we would like a broad-based movement in the market for a longer period of time because that is what will pan out in terms of earnings growth, once the GDP clocks back to 7.5-8% in a stable manner. 

To that extent, near term because of this fear psychosis, markets are very tight. Even the FII and domestic net buying figures on the cash side have been abysmally low. At this juncture, it is more about hiding in good names rather than taking big bets on some of the stocks which you would have taken if market was on a full momentum. Frankly it is a challenging time. 

Next two-three months are very critical. We will have to see how we cross this election event, what is the outcome and how much impact it has on economy. It is unclear at this juncture how things will pan out for let us in next five years. It is better to be cautious rather than going all out in the market.


Are you finding opportunities in beaten down spaces like autos just yet? What is the feelers one is getting from Maruti, Eicher across the board really?
Demand is slow. Even when we are doing our channel checks, we are not getting very good signs of demand picking up in a big way. It may take one or two quarters more to return as the sentiment is a bit low. Confidence is slightly on the lower side and hence people might just defer buying vehicles. The general overall slowness in economy is being seen in auto sector in terms of the purchases. It is better to wait for one or two quarters and then see how things really go.


How do you read the Essel Group stocks like Zee Entertainment and Dish TV? 
From a business point of view, media is a good sector to be in and the name which you said is one of the good names and they have been in the market as one of the top players for many years. But I would refrain from answering on this pledged share issue or anything specific to the company due to compliance issues.


What is your outlook on midcaps? 
Midcap numbers have been okay as compared to largecap numbers. I think people would like to wait for some signs of macro improvement and that will come only when one has clarity on the politics and its impact on the economy. The next two-three months are really critical. We will be in tight range and hope we do not go down further.


There is a tone of sadness in your voice. When will that happy tone come back -- three months, six months, one year?
It is not about feeling sad or happy. I will be more realistic given the current scenario and the challenges we are facing as well as the coming election. It is always better to be cautiously optimistic rather than becoming over optimistic. We really do not know how the election mandate will come and what will be its real outcome on the economy. If there is a steady government, then things will chug along, animal spirit will return and momentum will be back in the second half of the year. 

But if there is a change in government, then which government is being formed, how the cabinet is being formed, what are their agenda on the reforms process -- will always create a lot of uncertainty in the near term. Markets do not like uncertainties. Markets like stability and consistency. So it is not about being sad, it is about being realistic."

42,2019-02-14,Eicher,"DHFL is in a very precarious situation I do not think there is any room right now for equity holders over there if 
  
  
  bond holders are not feeling safe, Mukul Kochhar, Head of Institutional Sales, Investec Capital Services, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What would Teva’s guidance cut mean for Indian generics? Should pharma be an avoid for now?
It is very stock specific. It is very molecule dependent and this is dependent upon the nature of your portfolio. At the end of the day, the most important thing is valuation. Most of these companies are still trading north of 20 times one year forward. So valuation is not that comfortable yet. 

If you look at some of the portfolios, for example, Dr Reddy’s, most of the forward EPS numbers which people are anchoring on, are supported by two or three blockbuster drugs in the pipeline. If these drugs do not deliver as expected, you will see them downgraded. 

Dr Reddy’s is one stock which is especially exposed to incremental competition in new drugs. But we are fairly comfortable with Aurobindo Pharma, which has a very well diversified portfolio and whose forward earnings are not dependent on two or three molecules. We are comfortable with Cipla as well. Based on valuation, we are willing to get into Sun Pharma as well. It is an excellent franchise but they are spending a lot on innovation which may pressure near term returns, but honestly it is a stock that you can get in. It remains very stock-specific and despite correcting substantially, pharma is not a blanket buy yet. 


How have you assessed the quarterly earnings that we have seen so far? Is the pain likely to be a bit more prolonged when it comes to autos or is there a specific basket that you like within the space?
At the end of the day, it is all about valuations for all stocks. In the auto space as well, valuations had expanded for some of the names and this was on top margin expansion which came on weak commodities. Now the margin is correcting. One big trend that you saw in the quarter was where there is limited pricing power in the near term. As expenses go up, margins correct and when margins correct, you see earnings downside to forward estimates. If valuations are pricey, the stocks will correct, as it happened with Eicher Motors, Maruti. 

But Bajaj Auto survived the carnage because the numbers were already okay, valuation was fairly comfortable and so once again, it was a little bit stock-specific. One thing I would probably mention on trends is discretionary versus staples. There is a significant difference in performances of discretionary versus staples. Staples are very well supported by rural spending. So, contrary to noise out there that rural is very weak, the commentary from companies and consumption performance is really strong and it is underpinned by a strong rural demand. 

Honestly, consumption is okay but in discretionary consumption basket, especially auto stock specific performance based on valuation, you have to be a little nuanced out here. What I mean to say is that it is not essentially a blanket consumption play in autos. It is quite stock specific. 


Coming to YES Bank, two big uncertainties now behind us. Would you say that YES Bank is an investment case now or would you still stick it out with ICICI Bank and Axis?
YES Bank certainly has a place in some client’s portfolio. You have to remember different clients have different risk appetite, different investment strategies. What the divergence report definitely answers is whether or not the problems are getting reported right away in the current book. It does not mean that there is no risk on the book because banks essentially are in the business of capital allocation. Risk reward is a big part of their play. 

There could be problems lurking somewhere but what it gives certainly is a stamp of approval that the auditing is up to mark. If there were hidden problems, there are none there. And honestly, through the auditing process of RBI, YES Bank has not performed as poorly as perception dictates. Credit cost has been very contained, problems have been relatively okay. However, given the volatility in the stock, I am not sure how many institutional investors can take it given that they are answerable to their boards, to the unit holders, etc. 

But if you ask me, personally if somebody can overlook the volatility, the risk-reward here is quite favourable. It is 1.2 times price to book. RBI has given it a stamp of approval. Some of the management issues, questions have been answered although we still need to see how the relationship between the new CEO and the erstwhile promoter plays out and one or two years will probably show how that relationship works in the longer run. But the stock risk reward at 1.2 times price to book is fairly okay. 

YES Bank has built a decent retail franchise over the years. It is a reasonably high ROE bank. The current book is okay. It is not running off. CASA franchise was built okay. Remember it is a bank, not an NBFC. The bank has some residual franchise. I am okay with it as long as investors understand that it is a volatile, news-flow driven stock, although lot of the bad news flow seems to be behind. However, what will be questioned is some of their exposure to DHFL Group which one should be open about. There are others involved in that segment as well. So, some of these questions will linger but at 1.2 times price to book, the risk reward at least seems favourable.


What is your view on DHFL and the problem it could create for other NBFCs, banks and mutual funds? Is the water still very muddy?
DHFL is in an interesting situation right now. One must remember about finance companies and this is true for banks as well. At the end of the day, nobody knows the true nature of the book. So, trust in management is exceptionally important for the capital markets and I would say capital market participants include the mutual funds, debt mutual funds, bond holders -- pretty much everybody who is involved in the ecosystem. 

Out here, the resignation of the CEO does not help. It does not give a good signal to the market of the nature of the book and if people lose confidence, you can get flows out of the company in terms of liquidity etc which can actually exacerbate the problem even if none is there. 

DHFL is in a very precarious situation I do not think there is any room right now for equity holders over there if bond holders are not feeling safe. I am not even sure how to value that right now. The only thing I can mention is that in an election year, the government cannot afford a disaster of this magnitude. There will be support at some level or the other for getting this company going, but for equity holders, there is some amount of value and you should get in. But for equity holders, it is an avoid."
43,2019-02-14,Eicher,"CHENNAI: Workers at an Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield two wheeler production site near Chennai struck work over what trade union sources refer to “victimisation of union representatives by transfers,” besides lack of progress in negotiations over wage hike and redesignating certain employees as permanent staff.

The Working People’s Trade Union Council had issued a strike notice on February 12 (Tuesday), but the strike began the next day at 3 p.m. after the management transferred key persons in the union, according to R Sampath, Vice-President of the union.

Informing the stock exchanges today of the strike, Royal Enfield said it remains “deeply committed, as always in the past, to maintaining respectful relationships with all employees. We believe an engaged workforce and cordial industrial relations, create a culture of excellence where all employees are proud of their contributions to the organisation.”

The management refers to the strike as illegal, and that the majority of the workforce is still committed to production: “It is unfortunate that a certain section of our workforce has resorted to an illegal strike at our Oragadam plant in Chennai despite the company’s best efforts and positive intentions. We have been working closely with our workforce and have undertaken various constructive and confidence building initiatives. Currently, a majority of the workforce continues to report for work at the Oragadam plant. Our other manufacturing facilities, including our plants at Vallam Vadagaland and Tiruvottiyur, continue to remain fully operational. We are focused on resolving all issues in an amicable manner while keeping the best interests of the organization and our workforce in mind.”

This is the second time recently that Royal Enfield workers are striking work. In its December sales update, Royal Enfield said strike activity between September 24 and November 12 resulted in production loss of 28000 motorcycles. 

The strike in the third quarter of FY18-19 arrived at a time the two wheeler manufacturer was facing a challenging period in the market. In the December quarter results update, Eicher Motors MD and CEO Siddhartha Lal said: “The latter half of 2018 was a challenging period for the two-wheeler industry in India. Factors like increased insurance requirements, rising raw material costs and the subsequent price increase due to regulatory safety requirements impacted the momentum of the industry. Royal Enfield’s market share recorded improvement on a sequential basis, while volumes in the quarter were impacted. We believe this is a temporary impact due to a price reset.”"
45,2019-02-15,Eicher,"Bottom-fishing can start in midcaps which have corrected 50-60% and where earnings growth continues, Vivek 
   
   
   Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

There is a lot of nervousness ahead of the elections and some of the other key geopolitical events. What do you feel market is watching out for? To what extent are they being impacted by this? Are they looking at the market technicals at the moment?
It is only market technical at the moment. The geopolitical events, terrorist attack and even the upcoming elections in the next couple of months are passing phases. Quite honestly, it is not the first time that a terrorist attack has happened. We have seen plenty of them in the last 20 years and it has not stopped market from moving on. It has not necessarily moved up always but market has a mind of its own.

Number two, as far as elections are concerned, if we look at the last 25 years, only corporate earnings and liquidity have determined the market trends. You can forcefully juxtapose election outcomes and correlate it to market movements but there is enough data in arguments against it as well. 

Finally it is only about earnings and we are almost at the conclusion of the earning season. Today or tomorrow, the last of whatever results remain would be announced. The result season has been quite mixed. Of course, positive surprises have been very few and far between. Very few companies have delighted on earnings. Even companies which delivered on good numbers did see a selloff. At a larger level, what seems to be happening and going unnoticed as a trend but is widespread irrespective of the size of the companies and across sectors, a huge amount of leverage position has been built during the bull market between 2013 and 2018, which is now unravelling. 

A huge amount of leverage was taken by promoters, by market participants -- be it brokers, operators or investors. That leverage seems to be unravelling, creating panic in stocks or sectors where it was largely prevalent. Lastly, news flow form select corporates also not been something to be delighted about. Positive news flow has also been scarce, leading to selloffs that only aggravates the leverage situation. 


Every section of the market is talking about the heinous attacks in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir. What would it mean for the economy as well as the markets as it seems that it is just a matter of time before a strong retaliation from our country is going to come in as well ?
Eventually a strong retaliation will indeed come and I am sure the whole country is going to welcome it and even the markets are going to welcome it. What we may have is negative sentiment during that period but eventually markets will get back to earnings and liquidity. The last time we had that kind of retaliation and a full-fledged war was Kargil, way back in 1999 -- 20 years ago. Let us not forget it was right in the middle of the technology, media and telecom (TMT) led bull market. War continued for about a month or so. The bull market had continued even while the war was fought and subsequently. Markets have a mind of their own and these are passing phases. 

If this could be compared to 26/11, the Mumbai attacks in 2008 had a huge bull market unravelling just a couple of months after that, from 2009 onwards. Whether you can correlate that to a one-day event of the terrorist attack or any other factors, my view is it is always all other economic factors which will determine the market trend more than the terrorist attack and India hitting back and so on.


While some of the earnings may have been in line with expectations, it is still not necessarily providing that fillip to the markets that we are hoping for. How many quarters before we start to see that engine running?
It may perhaps be a while. The bull market between 2013 and 2017 saw a huge expansion of multiples -- PE ratios, EV/EBITDA, price to book. In some cases, this was supported by earnings growth and in a large number of cases, with sub-par earnings growth. What we are now seeing is contraction of those multiples and basically a reversal of the cycle that you had between 2013 and 2017.

In spite of earnings growth, the prices not being supportive is a clear indicator of contraction of multiples happening. In some sectors, namely the consumption-oriented sectors, the multiples had gone out of whack. I mean 70-80 times earnings, 100 times earnings in some cases like Page Industries, Astral Poly. There were enough high flier names. Eicher Motors comes to mind. What we have seen is even if some of them have disappointed in earnings where the contraction of multiples is justified, but even say in case of Page Industries -- another high priced stock with multiples much higher than market averages -- where the numbers have been decent, much higher than its own historic average over the last 10 years, we are seeing a contraction of those multiples. For that trend to reverse, it has to normalise first.


Would you concur then with the findings of where the EPS trend may be headed and how long we have to wait to see an all-round recovery in India Inc’s performance?
All round recovery may be difficult to really put a finger on but sectorally…


Or maybe go beyond the sectors which have performed this quarter?
Basically, not just this quarter but even if I were to look back at the last eight quarters or last two years of earnings, barring the tech sector, the consumer oriented sectors and private banks to a certain extent NBFCs, none of the sectors has really given you consistent performance. 

Company-wise, across sectors, some have consistently delivered but there have been roadblocks or headwinds here or there as well. Maruti comes to mind as it has delivered maybe in six out of the eight quarters but the last two quarters, it been facing challenges. Maybe Bajaj Auto and Hero had challenges in the previous four quarters and last three-four quarters they have started to deliver. But a) this trend is not really something which is encouraging. b) In terms of large recovery, it is time, PSU sector, banks and even non-banks in the PSU space starts delivering on earnings growth because some really large names are part of the index. They are large even by way of contribution of market cap. If we are talking of Coal India and NTPC, these kind of companies have to deliver on earnings because finally when we are talking of Nifty earnings, it is an aggregation of all of those and it is not just TCS and HDFC and HDFC Bank and Reliance actually. 

Of course it is the few names which have been holding up the Nifty but if I were to exclude the top five names in the Nifty – Reliance, HDFC, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, perhaps Nifty would be much lower than 10,000 levels or even 9500 levels. 

It would be a couple of quarters that we would see a broad-based recovery in the Nifty constituents or even across sectors. But as far as midcaps are concerned, there are enough bottom-up picks, enough companies of reasonable size which continue to deliver and have not yet disappointed and which have corrected significantly. They have corrected anywhere from 40-50-60% and in some cases even 70% and the earnings growth continues. 

So probably the bottom-fishing can start there first and my sense is the broad markets will bottom out much before your Nifty will bottom out."
44,2019-02-15,Eicher,"I still say that in middle of April, we should be closer to 11600 and this time, midcaps will join in, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What is happening in YES Bank and any other aspect which you want to highlight when it comes to market view?
Even though I have been saying the market will go to 11200, it has been a sour spot. The broader market is seeing such despondency which I have not seen in many years. A few errant promoters have definitely upset the applecart but that may be the end of the storm. I am extremely positive on midcaps with their valuations at throwaway prices. On the broader market, our underperformance is reflecting this despondency at a time when global cues have been extremely good.

 Same was the case with YES Bank. Where do you see 30%, 50% moves in F&O stocks? Bears have had a good time but despondency is a very good time to build portfolios and I can thump the table and say that next six months onwards, you will be making a lot of money in select stocks. 

I am extremely positive on the market with a slightly longer term view. This pessimism is overdone. I still reiterate that in middle of April, you should be closer to 11600 and this time, midcaps will join in. 

The temporary imbroglio of midcaps underperformance is a sour spot which is hurting sentiments and some of the flows. 


Those who are looking to buy an electric vehicle, will find it easy because the government is going to offer rebates of up to Rs 50,000 and may even bring it under the purview of priority sector lending. What is your view on EVs being the big disruptor?
After a four-year-long upsurge, the NBFC sector had headed for a slowdown. The auto sector faced tough times as funding from NBFCs dried along with third-party insurance getting costlier, it hit demand. For the next four, five years, a lot of these companies are putting in a lot of work in the EV side. Ashok Leyland is a clear example. From Rs 160, the stock has corrected to Rs 80. The numbers were extremely positive, a double digit EBITDA growth where most were talking of 8-9%; we know that defence spending is going to go up and Ashok Leyland stands out in a crowd. It is a very good play on the LCV, HCV market. It is the third largest bus maker in the world and it has now a huge impetus of 50% market share launching the EV buses in Gujarat and so on. There is a lot of pessimism in autos. We are slightly contrarian on autos and metals. We think that you can make a lot of money if you are going to be patient investor over here because the price is in your favour. 

Similarly, Eicher Motor, which has been hit by competition, offers an opportunity to buy at below Rs 20,000 level. 

The third would be definitely a Hero MotoCorp where their margin expansion in the coming quarters could again herald more consumption spending. 

So, as a contrarian, we are extremely positive on autos and we think these declines should be buying opportunity. On electric vehicles, if you want to play it, it is better go for the lithium ion play where Exide and Amara Raja will give exciting opportunities in the near future.


What is your reading on Emami or any other midcap FMCG plays?
People are trying to find loopholes in every small business. Emami is a very strong brand, built over years and they have a huge market share. I would not comment on the stock because that is a private equity investment but private equity is going to definitely take advantage of collateral risks in a lot of sectors and stocks. 

Coming to FMCG, we still think ITC should rule over there even though the stock has not done much. We think their business forays into all the other businesses except cigarettes are gaining traction on a day-to-day, month-to-month, year-to-year and the vision going forward is extremely bullish. 

You can add a Marico over there and we will re-weigh the works of Nestle where the margins got hit. It has been one of our outperforming stocks. 

Dabur would be another dark horse which has again moved up quite sharply from those 370 levels, but any decline would be a buying opportunity, Dabur has seen the worst behind, could be a huge outperformer in the near term. 


Do you like the quarterly performance that Glenmark delivered?
Yes that and Divi's Lab have been two of our midcap picks in pharma. This spinoff should add more value because that will demarket the marketing, with the generic side playing out well. Overall, if you wanted to play pharma, select outperformance should be seen in Aurobindo, Sun and Dr Reddy’s. Dr Reddy’s has done extremely well. The inspection visit may have been a little dampener but we will they will tide over these problems. Pharma can be a relative outperformer for 18% to 20% upside during the course of this year. But yes Glenmark would definitely be a buy on declines.


Would you be a buyer in YES Bank now that the two big overhangs have been lifted?
Yes good point. As a disclosure, we own YES Bank and we have been slightly contrarian around those Rs 175 levels. This time, they will get past Rs 230. They will not flatter to deceive. It has been three times they have hit here and come back. This time you could see an upside, maybe Rs 275. Given that, April may turn out to be a very good month for the markets, we think YES Bank may definitely lead Bank Nifty rather than being one of the losers. So yes, a large part of that may have played out yesterday. We are not going to chase it 30% up but all corrections will be buying opportunity. If you do sustain over Rs 230, the next target could be close to Rs 275 in the next few months.


What should shareholders do now? With SBI coming on board, would you wait it out to buy Jet, is it a buy right now or is it a complete avoid?
It is an avoid from my side. If I can suggest one stock which can make up all the loses of Jet, it would be IDFC Bank First. That bank is going to be the star of the next two years. I do not rule out a doubling from here. I am very confident on Mr Vaidyanathan. I think this merger will eat into market share of a lot of NBFCs and they should see a lot of bang for the buck. It is a best combination of MSME and retail loans which going forward will see an improvement in CASA. The valuations are extremely attractive. For me, it will be IDFC Bank First rather than anything to do with Jet which is again going to be an imbroglio on enlarged equity and rising crude prices."
46,2019-02-18,Eicher,"The only source of knowledge is experience, said Albert Einstein. And this is true in the world of stock investment too. Who is better placed to testify for this than Dalal Street veteran Anmol Sekhri!

With over 45 years’ experience, Sekhri (67) has mastered the art of picking big compounders. He has seen many boom and bust cycles during this journey and knows most companies like the back of his hand.

So much so, many of his peers on Dalal Street refer to him as a ‘mini-encyclopedia’ of Corporate India.

A valuation expert by profession, Sekhri has over the years managed to spot many multibaggers in their early days: be it MRF, Kansai Nerolac, Eicher Motors, Jubilant Life, Honeywell, Florence Investech and Bengal Assam; stocks that multiplied his wealth many times over last 12 years. Market capitalisations of these companies grew three to 65 times during this period. ETMarkets.com could not independently verify his old holdings.

Two other stocks, Elantas Beck India and Nesco, also worked for him in last six years and they are still part of his portfolio. He still holds over 1 per cent stake in Elantas Beck India.

Apollo Sindoori Hotels is one of his latest finds, which has grown almost three times in last 15-16 months.

Why hold a stock after it has already delivered manifold return? “This is a dynamic decision,” says Sekhri. “Valuation is the driving force behind this decision. If the benchmarks are satisfied, we prefer to hold a stock through a couple of bad quarters. It is like shooting a flying bird,” he says.

The benchmarks he referred to include a few valuation criteria and foreseeable growth. If there is any sign of trend reversal, then a detailed analysis is done, he explained.

Mumbai-based investor Dhiraj Dave, who has known Sekhri for last two years, says, “Anmol Sekhri is an industry veteran, who has in-depth understanding of Indian businesses and managements. Over the years, he has figured out the ins and outs of Indian businesses.”


Investing strategy
Sekhri normally invests in companies that have been listed for at least 10 years or the ones that belong to reputed corporate groups. “Sustainability of a management through tough times, public confidence in a company and its management, sustainability of a business and its linkages with the economy are important,” says he.

Prospects of the economy for the next 3-4 years, product visibility and valuation are other important parameters that Sekhri looks at before picking a stock. He also considers the debt-to-equity ratio.

“He is well known in the industry for the valuation business that he owns. In many of the stocks that he holds, Sekhri has been invested for decades. He has even picked a few for the next generation. He is fun to interact with for the catchy one-liners that he drops, which also provide a lot of insight into a business,” Dave told ETMarkets.com.


Journey so far
Since the days of Harshad Mehta scam in 1992 till the global financial crisis of 2008, Sekhri has many stories to share. He entered the stock market in 1972 with the objective of earning good, honest and large money.

“The Harshad Mehta scam taught me a good lesson. I really flopped in that episode, because I was highly leveraged. I was pledging shares to become rich quickly and virtually built a pyramid of loans against shares. When the crash happened and interest rates rose, the bankers had no option but to sell my stocks,” Sekhri recalled.

Sekhri had recovered from that setback and was back in the market in 2002.

“I lost money in the first round. But constant learning helped me improvise. Great returns over time encouraged me to become more aggressive. Earlier, information was not easily available. Hence, I made investment in a few stocks just to receive information through annual reports, postal ballot etc, so that I could stay updated with what’s happening in the market. I am still not a full-time investor, but love the intellectual challenge and the need to be alert 24x7,” says he.

During the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the global financial crisis in 2008, hypothetical projections were used, and they were very aggressive. “From this learning, I focused on real-time demand and supply, rather than imaginative forecasting,” he says.

Sekhri manages his own funds and he is not a Sebi-registered analyst.


Lessons from failures
The odds were not always in favour of Sekhri. Like others, he too failed many times, especially when he was investing based only on book values. “I lost money on several occasions, for instance, in stocks like GTL and Specialty Restaurants, to name a few. Luckily, these investments were insignificant. However, I have since sold those holdings,” Sekhri adds.

During 1980-1990s, there used to be heavy marketing and hype over IPOs. People gave unofficial rates, which would sometimes lead to wrong decisions. The lesson learnt from this was to avoid getting swayed by publicity and premium-priced IPOs, but to evaluate businesses on my own.

Sekhri lost money in many IPOs, which taught that understanding a business is foremost and reliability of the management is very important.

IPOs of multinational corporations that were forced by the government such as Colgate, P&G and HUL fetched good returns. “But there were many issues, where I suffered losses,” he said.


Secret of success
Sekhri says there is no simple mantra for success in the stock market. His thumb rule? “Read, read and read, and do not follow others.”

He does not follow large investors on Dalal Street. “While I keep myself abreast of what other players are doing, none of my investment decisions are influenced by them. Newspapers influence me and I also read many magazines. I read Warren Buffett’s notes and annual reports of companies,” he said.

Sekhri says one common thing about his investments is that most of his holdings were under-owned stocks at the time of his investment. “I have been a big investor in holding companies, and this has helped me earn multibagger returns,” he said.


Illiquid Scrips - A Treasure Trove? 
According to Sekhri, one should not mind investing in illiquid stocks, if they are quality businesses. “In fact, investment in illiquid scrips has been the most rewarding experience, both intellectually and financially. The challenge of locating these gems –after all no one invests in them or writes about them – is an exciting thing to do,” he says.


His take on current market
Sekhri believes sectors like human resources, technology and advertising, media and entertainment should gain momentum in this market. “There have been a few listings from these sectors. However, valuations are key to investment decisions,” he said.

He further said there are opportunities to gain or lose in all markets. “In the current market, there are several fundamentally strong shares, which can provide very good returns. Also, there are several midcaps which are highly undervalued and many of them export their goods and services. Several pharma companies have been beaten to attractive levels. Some of the cash-rich PSUs are dominant players in their products/markets. Many companies in the current turmoil have become available at close to cash levels. Those are tremendous opportunities,” he adds."
47,2019-02-18,Eicher,"Some of the gold finance companies which had fallen off the cliff after DeMo, have come back up quite sharply 
  
  
  since last year. Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

While the NBFC crisis is not at its peak, it continues to be a big overhang. What are you witnessing in terms of flows in the banking space?
It has been a slow month in the office for fund managers. Overall, the flow from domestic investors have slowed down a tad. It is still at around Rs 5,000 crore, but that is lower than what has been printing over the last year or so. The fund managers have moved to larger corporate banks. HDFC continues, ICICI and Axis are some of the largest buyers for this month and that is a trend that we have been seeing. Money flow towards ICICI and Axis has been increasing. That is one broad-based trend that we expect to continue for some time. 


The real pain has been felt in the broader end of the market. What is the data with respect to some of the top midcaps that have been sold?
For midcaps, it has been a little bit of a mixed bag. Some of the gold finance companies which had fallen off the cliff after DeMo, have come back up quite sharply since last year. We saw some profit booking in Manappuram, the likes of Muthoot. HEG is an interesting play where we have seen a very sharp drop off in the price, almost 50-55% that is another play. Manager have probably made 10x money in that, but seen a sharp drop in price and so they have taken some money off the table. These would be some of the larger plays on the midcap side where we have seen some selling.


What about autos? Do they continue to see outflows or are people buying in at declines?
That is actually an interesting trend that we are spotting. Maruti continues to see some outflows. It is not large but there have been some selling. The auto ancillaries, especially the likes of some of the tyre companies or of Exide have been seeing some buying and that is something that we have been seeing over the last few months. But we are seeing some flows on Maruti, Eicher counters.


What about the top midcap and smallcap holdings?
We have seen buying into the likes of Persistent or Hexaware on the midcap side. The other thing that is heartening to see is some like Indian Hotels or Jubilant continue to see some buying. That would be the broader trend in terms of the consumer spending that is playing out on the midcap side.


How does pharma stand right now?
Pharma is very flat. I was looking at the names. Probably the likes of Natco got some buying but otherwise there has been some selling in Cadila, Lupin. It is not very large selling but that is the counter where we saw some exciting action last year. Now, it has just fallen off the radar for most managers.



What else? The ADAG Group is very active on the back of high volumes. There are other news flow driven stocks like a Jet Airways, Bank. What has been your observation because they have been so sensitive to the news flow on a daily basis?
That is actually a good point that you bring up. When you look at some of the sells that have happened, the likes of Reliance Infra, Apollo Hospitals, two names that were there because of the pledged share news that has been coming out, have also seen some selling. There has been some selling in YES Bank, but if I look at the previous month’s trend, just some money is being taken off the table. It is not really a trend that I would draw from that.


I do not spot metals at all on the buy or the sell list?
Metals is something that is kind of out of fashion right now. So, probably marginal buying in Hindalco but otherwise it is pretty flattish."
48,2019-02-19,Eicher,"MUMBAI: Morgan Stanley has added United Spirits in place of Asian Paints to its focus list. 

""We continue to like Asian Paints as a long-term play, but believe UNSP provides a compelling entry point given its recent underperformance vs the index,"" said Morgan Stanley in a note on Tuesday. 

Shares of United Spirits have fallen 18.6 per cent in the last six months and during that period, Sensex has fallen 7.6 per cent. The stock ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 513.25 on Tuesday. 

United Spirits is Morgan Stanley's top discretionary stock pick. 

""At 28 times F21e (estimates), risk-reward on the stock looks favourable. Even as quarterly earnings delivery may be volatile, we see potential for 27 per cent FY19-FY21 earnings CAGR,"" the firm said in a separate note. 

The firm had added Asian Paints to its focus list in September 2017. 

Other consumer stocks in Morgan Stanley's focus list include Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and Dabur India. 

The brokerage said consumer discretionary is among its largest overweights at 500 basis points and it is neutral on consumer staples. 

Government spending for farmers and middle income families could boost consumption, said Morgan Stanley. However, it is neutral on consumer staples due to high valuations. 

On the technology space, Morgan Stanley said business momentum has been strong but stocks have re-rated and recent outperformance has probably priced in the depreciation in the rupee."
52,2019-02-21,Eicher,"The real picture is in the broader market which in the next year can even double, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP
  
  
  markets and corporate affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now. LIC Housing, L&T Finance and Havells, Bharti & Bharat Forge are the five marquee names that can outperform in 2019, says Bhasin. Edited excerpts:


What is your strategy when it comes to the banking pack at the moment?
There is extreme pessimism and despondency at a time when globally markets are looking the best they have looked in a year and Indian markets are down a little bit on geopolitics. I am extremely positive on the market and I could name four bank stocks -- ICICI Bank, IDFC Bank First, SBI and Federal Bank. In these four names there is a lot of steam on the upside. PSU banks have clearly outperformed on back of recapitalisation. Bond yields are lower and the pessimism is overdone. Assets are going to improve and net interest incomes are going to rise. 


Given the volatility we have seen recently, would you still stick to some of the safer larger plays?
I have been in the market for 30 years and I have not seen this type of pessimism on midcaps. We are missing the woods for the trees. Look at the positives of NCLT, IBC. We are seeing errant promoters who are coming back to bid for their assets -- whether it is Ruias or Jaypee or Anil Ambani. It is telling us that with backs to the wall, banks are going to be in an extremely sweet spot.

Midcaps are going to double in the next one year if not triple. There is a lot of valuation comfort. There is dismal ownership and macros are changing for the better. So, I would be more bullish on the midcaps with a six-month view. 

In the medium ,term there are places to hide but we want to make money on an alpha. We think that there is a lot of room on the upside on a lot of midcaps. In select largecaps, ACC, Asian Paints, Reliance,UltraTech are the marquee names where you could be making money in the short run. The real picture is in the broader market which in the next year can even double. 


Consumption that seems to have been another theme that has been talked about a lot recently. Are there particular plays that you are focusing on?
I will give you four ideas. One would be Bharti Tele on the back of th fact that this election will be seeing the maximum amount of social media we have ever seen historically. Second would be Bharat Forge.


One sector where midcaps have more presence in one year’s timeframe but probably would revive in two years timeframe? Stocks that would substantially reward investors?
It is difficult to give specific ideas but the broader market is extremely positive. Look at insurance, a stock like ICCI Pru is giving enough comfort. Look at metals. I would say select largecaps are extremely attractive even at this price. Tata Steel, JSW, Hindalco are just to name a few. 

In constructionm whether it is Nagarjuna Construction or an NBCC or a Sadbhav Engineering, a lot of ideas are there and in auto, there are Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motor.

We just heard the management of Ashok Leyland talking of 25% growth next year. They are realigned to the BS-VI norms; there are a large number of defence orders on the truck side; there are 200 airports where buses will be supplied and in all biggest gainer will be Ashok Leyland. 

There are enough ideas, but one has to be a brave heart and and build a portfolio when the screen is red. If you do, you may be laughing your way to the bank by this Diwali and definitely by March 2020. 


Why do you like Bharti?
This election is going to see the maximum amount of data usage. Social media is at the highest ever in our historic battle and pricing power is coming back. It will be a two-way battle between Jio and Bharti. Bharti is going to definitely see a lot of revenue on both sides. They are in the process of selling some of their assets. They are in the process of realising the monetisation of their Africa business. The sum of parts, if you can ignore the rhetoric, is Bharti look good for at least 20% upside. 

The other stock which I mentioned was Bharat Forge, also I would like to mention that in this NBFC fiasco, LIC Housing is looking extremely good after the last two quarterly results and it becomes a very good proxy where the management and the pedigree of the promoter will stand out in this carnage which has taken place. 

LIC Housing, L&T Finance and Havells in the consumer electricals would be five marquee names which I think can outperform for 2019. 


What should one stay away from? 
It is a good point but that has been the best place to hide even though expensive have become more expensive and that would definitely be some of the largecap consumer names -- the Levers, the Nestles, the Asian Paints. However we have had a buy on them much lower and we still think they should be part of your portfolio but we do not want to hide. We want to be brave enough and buy the broader market; metals, autos where there is extreme pessimism which I think on the consumption side can lead from the front. 

We also think in the auto space Eicher Motors will stand out given that Siddarth Lal is now enlarging his encompass in India and beyond. Closer to Rs 20,000 is again a very good opportunity to get into Eicher Motors. There are a whole lot of stocks and sectors which can outperform. You have to be just a little brave hearted because that is where you are going to make a lot of money in the next one year."
51,2019-02-21,Eicher,"For the last 14-15 months. the breadth was narrowing now the breadth will start increasing and a lot of alpha 
  
  
  would be generated going forward in certain sectors like microfinance, Amit Jeswani, CIO, Stallion Asset, tells ET Now. Havells and HDFC AMC could prove to be the next Eicher and Bajaj Finance for investors, says Jeswani.Edited excerpts:


A host of PSU banks have been running up on back of recap news. What is your strategy when it comes to that part of the market?
We normally do not trade government banks at all. We prefer private sector banks as that is where big money has been made and that is where big money will be made in the future. That is our broad thesis. 

But even among private sector financials, Axis Bank is a lot better. The price action of Axis Bank has started hitting new lifetime highs whereas an IndusInd Bank is struggling. There is a churn happening in the private bank space. You need confirmation. The small PSU banks is not the basket for any long-term investor. These are stocks you trade in, trade out and you make your 10-20-30% and get out. You are not going to get wealthy by buying those kind of banks.


While Nasscom did not issue a traditional guidance yesterday, they are sounding a little cautious about the outlook from here?
This is the time to actually be a lot more aggressive. I will give you a little brief and not buy defensive kind of stocks. Between October 2017 and December 2017, there were more than 500 stocks hitting 52-week highs daily and the breadth was at the highest point. 

Today about 500-600 stocks are hitting 52-week lows daily. If that was not sustainable, then this is also not sustainable. The markets are at the lower end of the basket and this is the time you go out and buy your beta. The breadth has now narrowed to 10-15 stocks and this is typically how a bear market is. The bear market is near the end. We are already 14 months in the bear market and typically in India, the bear market does not last more than 15 months. So this is actually the time to add a lot of beta on the portfolio rather than buying these IT kind of stocks. But we do like names like LTTS. We are growth investors and we look at companies that can grow at 20-25% plus for the next three, four, five years. LTTS is one candidate there which should do okay and those are the kind of stocks that we are looking out for.


What exactly are you looking for? If bear market does not last more than 15 months and we are already in the 14th month, you are referring to midcaps. Which space within midcaps is attracting your attention? Sectorally, from a valuation perspective and from earnings forecast point of view, which spaces are looking attractive?
In the top 1,000 names this quarter, the median revenue growth has been 15% and net profit growth has been 6%. That is for the median top 1000 market cap companies for this quarter. 

Broadly if you look at let us say microfinance space that is one space that can keep growing at 20-25-30% for the next three, four, five years. So retail credit remains a very large opportunity and there are three, four, five companies who will scale it really large. Those are the kind of bets that we would typically want to be in. 

We do not want to be in the extreme smallcap space now because the only guys who have money right now are the mutual fund guys and they can’t be in 75% of the stocks which have a market cap below Rs 9,000 crore. So, typically the larger leaders 20-30-40% and that is going to happen in so many sectors, but in microfinance, leaders like gold finance stocks which do not correct, typically lead the first phase of the bull market. 

Look at like general insurance companies. General insurance is a space which for the last 18 years in India except for 2015, has grown 15-17% every year. These are the bets you have to be in this kind of market. A lot of bottoms would be made and from here your breadth will start increasing.

For the last 14-15 months. the breadth was narrowing now the breadth will start increasing and a lot of alpha would be generated going forward in certain sectors like higher quality microfinance bets and other stocks in the financial space. 


What is the advice for your clients? Any new buy ideas or are you just saying keep the powder dry in the run up to the elections and one day you would get many opportunities?
We are 99% invested. We are buying very aggressively. There is absolutely no doubt that we are extremely confident that before the end of March, we will see a long-term bottom for the markets. Shaktikanta Das is the most dovish RBI governor we have got. We have got 2% interest, inflation is at 2%, bond yields are at 7 odd per cent. The real rate of return is way too high. No place in the world will offer you 5% real rate of returns. So, there will be at least 100 to 150 bps cut in interest rate in the next few quarters. That is our initial thesis.

You get consumer stocks 30-40% cheaper, go out and buy. Go for good financials. SBI and like other PSU banks have extremely bad business models at extremely cheap valuations. You sell them when they are less cheap so that game is a very difficult game to play for a real portfolio manager. Rather look at companies that will scale up. 

The economy is going to do well for the next few years and you need to bet on 10-15 good promoters who can actually scale up and it is not easy scaling up because India was a $1-trillion dollar economy in 2008. Today we are a $2.5 trillion economy and in ten years not more than 20 or 30 promoters have actually scaled up like a Page Industry, Eicher or Bajaj Finance. But there are going to be new companies that will scale up to those levels and the whole idea is to catch them.


Would you be willing to give out names on where you think the new Bajaj Finances and Eichers would be created?
It is going to be in financials and consumer only so those are the sectors. There are only four sectors which can scale up -- IT, pharma, financials and consumers.


I just want you to highlight the names for the benefit of our viewers.
If you get Havells cheap, it is a great bet. This business model keeps getting better. I can give you a lot more brief about it but if you can get Havells 5-10% cheaper from these levels, I think this company will be like a 5-6x larger than what it is today. So we might have positions and lot of disclosures attached and yes this company just keeps getting better every year you look at it. 

This company started as a cable company and from cable it went to switches and from switches it went to geysers and now from geysers it is there in the AC space. So all these four-five spaces are very scalable business models and all segments of Havells generate between 50% to 100% ROCs. So they become cash machine. So those are the kind of bets that we typically take. 

You can look at HDFC AMC. You are getting it at 30 times PE multiple. This is like bear market PE and bear market earnings. Once the next bull market starts, I do not see how mutual funds penetration will be 3% in the next 5-10 years. It is an extremely scalable business model, good management and leadership position. I can of course go wrong in HDFC AMC as well but make a portfolio of 15 scalable business models and you are broadly assured to do 20-25-30% compounding.


If you are expecting 150-200 bps correction in interest rates. how about investing in a bond fund?
Of course, that can be done. We have removed all money from our liquid funds and invested in the equity market but we were long on the duration. So we were buying the long duration bonds and we were expecting a correction but now we are 100% on our fund.


What is your take when it comes to this metals pocket?
Steel is doing well. The prices of steel now have gone to 47,000-48,000. But these are commodities. You can trade them, but you cannot invest in them. Overall, I do not see any capacity addition happening in steel. There is absolutely no way large steel capacity can be set in India because no bank is ready to give you that much loan. For a million ton. you need about Rs 6,000-7,000 crore. So the capacity utilisation which is at 78-80% today will keep growing to about 90% in the next two, three, four years and 35,000 per ton.

Today the price is Rs 48,000 per ton but the government of India has set a Rs 35,000 per ton anti-dumping duty and so the margins are now protected. This industry should do well but this is not the time to buy commodities for us. 

So the first phase will not be commodity stocks. The first wave of bull market is quality stocks compounders, secular growth and then as the bull market matures, you will play commodities and all those higher beta stocks. But I am not buying commodities right now, this is the last cycle play."

50,2019-02-21,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The market is telling you what’s on the investor’s mind: While low PE stocks continue to bleed, so-called growth stocks have been among the top gainers in an otherwise depressed market.

Looks like investors are in no mood to chase value at the moment. And given the pre-election uncertainty, the trend is unlikely to change for now. 

The disconnect between price and value in ’growth’ and ‘value’ stocks is such that many of the growth stocks are trading at expensive valuations, even on FY2021 earnings estimates, while many value stocks are ruling at inexpensive valuations, even on FY2019 basis, said Kotak Securities. 

Out of the 49 BSE 200 stocks that have gained between 10 per cent and 60 per cent in last 12 months, half had PE multiples in excess of 40, data compiled from AceEquity suggests.

Shares of HUL and Nestle India have gained 30 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively. The two FMCG stocks have managed to sustain high price multiples in last 12 months, even as the benchmark BSE200 has declined 2 per cent in the same period. 

Shares of United Breweries are up 28 per cent; Jubilant Foodworks has gained 34 per cent and Bajaj Finance 56 per cent while Pidilite Industries, Asian Paints and Dabur India have risen up to 25 per cent in last one year.

And look at the low PE stocks: oil firms ONGC, BPCL and HPCL, power firms NTPC, REC, Power Grid, Torrent Power, NBFC stocks Dewan Housing and Reliance Capital, metals & mining companies Vedanta, Coal India and NMDC are down up to 77 per cent during this period.


What disappointed
Calendar 2019 has an even worse record: none of the 40 stocks that quoted single-digit PE as of December 31, 2018 are in the green. 

Analysts say poor returns by these stocks are either reflecting the poor growth prospects and, in many cases, concerns over corporate governance.

“Stocks quoting low PEs at this point mostly belong to heavily-indebted firms or companies with unstable earnings. As such, the pressure on stock prices are further dragging their valuations. Low PE in no way suggests a stock is cheap and that it is a better company to bet on for the future,” said Sameer Kalra of Equity Research Analyst and Founder, Target Investing.

Among the top 10 BSE200 losers so far are three ADAG group stocks Reliance Power (down 63 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (down 62 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 35 per cent). These stocks have been hammered after two lenders sold shares pledged with them by the promoters.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have dropped xx per cent. Company’s CEO Harshil Mehta resigned earlier this month. A news portal recently alleged that the NBFC was involved in a financial scam as big as Rs 31,000 crore. The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

“Certain so-called value companies have found new ways to disappoint investors on corporate governance, thereby making the valuation argument largely redundant for such stocks,” Kotak Securities said.

Graphite electrode makers Graphite India, HEG are seeing tough days as electrode prices have softened due to weak global steel prices, increased Chinese imports into India and select trade restriction placed by the US.

Adani Power and IDBI Bank have been posting losses. Nalco has seen 58 per cent plunge in Q3 earnings, while Vedanta has been in news on concerns over corporate governance.

In contrast, among the top BSE200 stocks this year are from IT sector, where firms do offer earnings guidance at the end of each quarter. Two are private lenders, and one is consumer-oriented firm (Titan Company, which too offers guidance on its jewellery business).


Smart money chases growth
Smart money will always chase growth even at the higher premium, Kalra said. “For good retail and institutional investors, growth has always been a key criteria as cleaner growth is much more sustainable. Growth is what makes them give premium valuations to stocks. Consumer stocks are a case in point. They always trade at a higher premium as they are high cash flow businesses and there is high earnings visibility. It’s easy to estimate growth simply by looking at volumes,” he said. 

Kotak Securities said: ""The market seems to have taken a permanent view on the future of most companies, thereby effectively segregating companies into long-term winners; which are companies with superior business models, trustworthy managements and good corporate governance practices where no price or valuation may be too high to own the stocks, and long-term losers; which are companies with inferior business models and poor governance practices where no price or valuation may be too low to avoid the stocks.""


Election & demand for qualityElection dates are likely to be announced over the next three weeks. In a study of past three general elections, Elara Capital found that volatility usually rises sharply ahead of Lok Sabha elections and cool off only after the election outcome. In a study of the 2004 -2018 period, the brokerage found that quality stocks tend to outperform in an uncertain market.

The brokerage says by high quality, it refers to companies with RoCE of greater than 15 in each of last five years, net debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1, positive free cash flow (FCF) yield for at least four out of last five years and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) either stable or increasing. Within the BSE200 universe, there are 34 companies that fit the bill.

The brokerage has recommended 15 of them, which include Castrol India, Cyient, Eicher Motors, Gillette India, GSK Consumer, Infosys, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Oracle, Sun TV Network and Tata Elxsi.

There are more than 11,000 NBFCs of which 218 are systemically important, having total assets of Rs 25 lakh crore."
55,2019-02-22,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Following the crowd usually takes you nowhere in the stock market. True!

But what do you make of the stocks that figure in portfolios of one after another mutual fund scheme? At the end of January, there were 78 stocks that were part of the portfolios of at least 100 mutual fund schemes, including ETFs, data from Ace Mutual Fund showed.

Don’t forget domestic institutional investors have become one of the key market drivers in recent years, having managed to cushion severe corrections every time there has been a big selloff by the overseas portfolio investors. 

Foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in Indian market, having offloaded shares worth over Rs 34,000 crore since January 2018. DIIs poured in some Rs 1,15,000 crore in the same period.

Not surprisingly, the list of 78 stocks includes the usual suspects. HDFC Bank is part of at least 535 mutual fund schemes; ICICI Bank 528 schemes, State Bank of India 465 schemes and Axis Bank 450 schemes.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

54,2019-02-22,Eicher,"Tata Motors’ Rs 26,993 crore loss in December quarter caused non-BFSI Nifty companies’ aggregate profit to drop on a year-on-year basis for the first time since June 2017. BFSI stands for banking, financial services and insurance.

Cumulative profit of 40 non-BFSI firms fell 36 per cent year-on-year after growing 18.37 per cent in the same quarter last year. Net sales increased 22.13 per cent YoY during the quarter against a 12.02 per cent rise in the year-ago period.

During the quarter, India Inc witnessed headwinds in the form of liquidity tightening, rupee volatility, slowdown in government spending (with onset of elections) and global trade issues.

“Some companies recorded decent revenue growth with volume support from the consumption space, while a weak rupee aided incremental revenues in certain sectors (IT). Some other companies (in non-BFSI) reported lower profitability on account of margin pressure owing to currency volatility, higher costs and commodity prices along with slower-than-expected revenue growth,” Centrum Broking said in a report.

Besides Tata Motors, oil marketing companies IndianOil (IOC), HPCL and BPCL too had a depressed quarter, which resulted in a drop in profitability for the non-BFSI Nifty pack.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal has 'buy' ratings on Nifty stocks ONGC, Mahindra & Mahindra, YES Bank, Hindustan Unilever and Tech Mahindra, with price targets of Rs 181 and Rs 840, Rs 270, Rs 2,120 and Rs 860, respectively.

While the performance of OMCs continued to be impacted by lower gross refining margins (GRMs) and inventory losses, auto companies suffered due to subdued consumer sentiment leading to higher discounts and also higher raw material and advertising costs.

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher is cautious on the OMCs. It has a 'hold' rating on HPCL with a target price of Rs 225.

BPCL posted 77 per cent YoY drop in profit for the quarter, while HPCL saw profit shrink 87 per cent and IOC 91 per cent.

Among auto firms, bottom lines declined 1.03 per cent for Bajaj Auto, 7.85 per cent for Hero MotoCorp, 3.09 per cent for Maruti Suzuki and 3.05 per cent for Eicher Motors.

If Tata Motors and OMCs are left out from the list of 40 companies, then net profit of the remaining 36 firms grew 17 per cent YoY on a 24 per cent rise in net sales.

In the non-BFSI segment, Reliance Industries emerged the best-performing company in terms of sales growth (up 56 per cent), while Sun Pharmaceuticals came out on top in terms of profit growth (up 286 per cent YoY). Vedanta was worst performer in terms of net sales (down 2.84 per cent), while telecom major Bharti Airtel reported a 72 per cent drop in profit.

JM Financial has a 'buy' rating on Sun Pharma with a price target of Rs 575. “Post multiple false dawns, Sun Pharma returned to a normalised earnings trajectory in 3QFY19 with various elements of a diversified earnings engine on display. There was incremental comfort on concerns including terminal decline of US generics, domestic pharma growth being slower than historical trends, slower than anticipated ramp-up of key specialty assets, discomfort around certain corporate transactions and structures and capital allocation discipline,” the brokerage said.

Tata Motors continued to face challenges given the weak performance by its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover owing to market conditions in China. Ambit Capital has a ‘sell’ rating on Tata Motors.

Tata Motors’ consolidated bottom line was hit in Q3 due to Rs 27,838 crore asset impairment in its British arm Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).

“JLR lost share in China’s premium car market from 9 per cent at the beginning of 2018 to 4 per cent now. JLR’s volumes declined around 27 per cent last year and are now contracting by 40 per cent YoY per month. Note that the Chinese premium car market didn’t shrink YoY even a single month in 2018, implying JLR’s underperformance was caused by Audi’s 400 bps share gain in the second half (H2) of 2018 over H1,” Ambit said in report.

Nifty’s BFSI companies, on the other hand, posted over 35 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit for the quarter. Axis Bank posted 131 per cent growth in profit at Rs 1,680.90 crore. Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank posted 48 per cent, 20 per cent, 13.53 per cent and 5.21 per cent YoY rise in profit.

On the other hand, State Bank of India reported a net profit of Rs 3,954.80 crore for the quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416.40 crore in the same quarter last year. Indiabulls Housing Finance, YES Bank and ICICI Bank posted 60.12 per cent, 13.73 per cent, 6.97 per cent and 2.75 per cent YoY drop in profit.

HDFC posted a net profit of Rs 2,113.80 crore on a standalone basis against Rs 5,300 crore profit for the year-ago quarter. However, the numbers are not comparable as the mortgage lender had a one-time gain from its insurance arm IPO last year.

Of the 50 Nifty companies, 16 (32 per cent) posted earnings above expectation, 15 (30 per cent) had them in line with expectations, 10 (20 per cent) reported a mixed set of numbers and nine (18 per cent) reported numbers below estimates, Centrum Broking said.

“The earnings season has been a mixed bag. Incrementally, in FY19, we are pencilling in about 9-10 per cent earnings growth for Nifty, but we see an improving trajectory going into FY20 where we are looking at 16-18 per cent earnings growth,” said Shibani Sircar Kurian, Kotak Mahindra AMC

Kurian said if earnings growth does play out as per expectations, a lot of the valuation concerns that are there, especially in the minds of some of the FII investors when they are looking at India vis-à-vis the emerging markets pack, would start getting corrected. From here on, she expects to see improvement in the earnings growth trajectory and that, she said, should start playing out post elections."
56,2019-02-25,Eicher,"In next three-four months, if one tries to be aggressive, precious resources and capital may get eroded. That is 
  
  
  the worst possible outcome, says Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts:


How are you looking at the market direction? We managed to see that sort of a bounce back. Is the euphoria here to stay?
Markets are in a no-man’s land. It is one of those awkward cricket pitches where it is difficult to play on the front foot as well as on the back foot. Overall, the setup of the Nifty around 10,700-10,800 levels is giving the impression that it is still very close to the psychological 11,000 marks and has not corrected sufficiently for new money to aggressively come into the market. 

That is preventing the huge inflows -- be it at the HNI level or at the retail level -- to pump in money. But the correction at the midcap and smallcap level is intense enough to appear as a classic bear market. 

Now two things can happen; a) the largecaps -- the seven, eight stocks which have been defying the gravity and are staying at high levels -- even they will give up and the entire market will correct to a point where fresh money and the strategic money will come in, so that the fresh rally can happen from there. 

b) Nifty will consolidate at the 10,500 or 11000 levels and then the midcaps and smallcaps will start catching up. It is very difficult to form an opinion at this moment whether the first scenario will play out or the second one. 

Whichever way one looks at it, it is one of those moments where you neither go on front foot aggressively nor on the back foot, but it is very important to preserve the resources. I am sure there are enough events lined up where the volatility will give opportunities in next three to four months to build up for the next three to four years. 

In next three-four months, if one tries to be aggressive, the challenge is that precious resources and the capital may get eroded. That is the worst possible outcome.

So, preserve the resources and be patient and you will get an opportunity to be in the frontline companies with no pledged shares by promoters and which have low or zero debt. Also, companies which are consistently showing good results despite ongoing economic slowdown and the currency and the crude oil volatility. 


Consumption is a very narrow space and within that also the outperformance can be seen in a select few. Everyone on the street is of the view that these are expensive stocks. Bata, Titan have got PE multiples which are nearing 40 plus now.
Absolutely. No matter whether we like the market condition, that is how most of the investors will keep betting on consumption stocks, especially institutional investors. On top of that it is a very narrow theme. At best, four-five themes are playing out. 

There used to be a time when names like say Page Industries used to be the hot favourite of the industry and everybody used to keep buying but now after the damage that we have seen in Page Industries, both in terms of price as well as sentiment, a new wave of consumption names are popping up for fund managers and investors. Bata and Titan are sort of fitting the bill. 

Of course, after this deposit schemes related development, we have to see how this gold deposit related angle will play out on Titan. As you said, the consumption names are definitely getting disproportionately higher allocation from fund managers and that too very select names. 

The only thing is as we had seen with names likes Eicher and Page, once these highly-valued stocks get hammered, the corrections are quite steep. So the investors, while putting in money, should be ready for an awkward outcome as well. There’s nothing wrong in playing the momentum as long as it is with due understanding of the risks involved. 


Why is Wipro hitting a 52-week high on a daily basis?
Two things; one, it was a huge underperformer in the entire IT pack consistently for the last one year or so and now some catchup is happening. Understandably, there is bonus angel to it, 1:3 bonus and we are towards the financial year-end. 

Some bonus-related anticipated buying also happening. Also, though the company had talked about buyback program and giving the money back to the shareholders, they have not officially announced it in the board meeting. That means in the next one or two board meeting, there is a chance that they may announce a buyback also. 

It is a perfect combo of the current ongoing bonus related buying as well as upcoming anticipated buyback in the next one to two quarters. 

Currently, IT is more of a stable play, It is no longer the super growth sector of yester-years but at the same time, in the current environment when there is so much damage on corporate governance as well as default risks, the global money and the local money are both chasing IT as it fits the bill in terms of the quality of corporate governance, almost zero debt levels and perfect play on the rupee weakness and very high cash generation capability. 

The entire IT has rallied. Wipro is a clear outperformer thanks its underperformance during the previous year."
57,2019-02-26,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty opened with deep cuts on Tuesday, as escalating tension between India and Pakistan spooked investors on Dalal Street.

Nearly two weeks after a terror strike at Pulwama, Indian Air Force is claimed to have carried out aerial strikes on terror camps early Tuesday.

Indian Air Force on Tuesday carried out aerial strikes at major terror camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, completely destroying them, 12 days after the ghastly terror attack in Pulwama, ANI reported.

Pakistan has claimed that the Indian Air Force violated the Line of Control (LoC).

Experts say, the move may aggravate the already simmering tension between the two neighboring countries and may have other geopolitical ramifications.

Sensex plunged nearly 500 points in opening deals and Nifty slipped below the 10,740 level. The volatility index India VIX surged 17 per cent, logging its biggest intraday jump this year.

However, market recovered from day's low. At around 12:10 pm, the BSE Sensex was 198 points, or 0.55 per cent, down at 36,016, while the NSE Nifty was 53 points, or 0.49 per cent, down at 10,827. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.46 per cent and 0.87 per cent down, respectively, at that time. 

Rupee also pared some losses, following dollar's weakness and a fall in the global crude oil prices. However, it was still trading 9 paise lower.

Asian markets also showed bearish trend. Asian shares lost steam on Tuesday after scaling a five-month high as investors waited to see if Washington and Beijing can clinch a trade deal, while the pound advanced on hopes UK Prime Minister Theresa May will delay a Brexit deadline, Reuters reported. 

In the 30-share Sensex index, 24 were in the red. Shares of Tata Motors, TCS, Coal India and Bajaj Auto were trading with gains. .

NTPC, ICICI Bank, HDFC, State Bank of India and Infosys were among the top losers in the Sensex kitty.

All sectoral indices on BSE, except auto, were in the red. Gains in shares of Tata Motors, Motherson Sumi, Bharat Forge, Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto were keeping the BSE Auto pack up."
58,2019-02-27,Eicher,"Over the next four to six weeks, the bank index is probably going to be the first mainline index to hit new lifetime 
  
  
  highs and we are recommending our clients strongly to be heavyweight in this sector, said Gautam Shah, Associate Director & Technical Analyst, JM Financial, in an interview with ET Now. It would be the banks, capital good, oil and gas stocks and possibly the IT stocks that Shah would continue to buy and hold. Edited excerpts:


Who would have thought in 24 hours we were back at 10,900. Does it look sustainable because simmering tensions with ET Now continues?
The market has not just seen resilience in the last couple of days but that has been the case for the last two and a half months now. Nifty has been trading in the band of about 400 points, moving like a pendulum around the 10,800 pivot level and there have been four or five occasions wherein the market had news flow or an excuse to actually breakdown and collapse below levels of 10,600. 

We have had almost four or five failed attempts on the downside. The market has only got stronger and having digested all possible negative news flow, whether it is on the geopolitical front, on the local economic front or the global front. This market is looking much stronger. The problem is because we have been in a range, you could not have extrapolated because every time you felt that after a patch of good days, the market is setting up for a breakout, it just did not happen. 

But this attempt that you are seeing right now is possibly the strongest and possibly the most genuine attempt at a possible breakout at about 11,000. For the first time in two and a half months, Nifty is getting support from the broader markets. In the past too we have traded around 10,900-10,950 but the midcap index and the small cap index have been in bad shape. They have never moved in sync with the mainline indices, but this recovery from the lows in the last three days looks a lot more broad-based and has a lot more backing in terms of volumes.

I am tempted to believe that the next attempt above 11,000 is likely to be genuine and once that confirmation happens, you could see the Nifty move towards 11,350 and over the next few months, you could even be trading at 11,700. The bigger picture view remains positive and 10,600 has really become a strong floor for the indices, given that from a risk-reward perspective, it still makes a lot of sense to buy a 10,900. The global setup is helping the indices because global equities have got much more stable, crude has got into a range. 

The currency is pretty much range-bound around the 71 mark. All of these factors suggest that Indian markets are likely to see much better days ahead.


My only concern is given how narrow the rally has been for many months now, what do you think is going to happen? Will newer names participate or will it be just those four-five candidates pushing the Nifty forward from here?
Well that has been the complain. Just top five-ten stocks are doing well and it is showing you that the Nifty is at 11,000 but the overall market was pretty much at levels as low as 9000-9500. But as I said what has really changed in the last one, one and a half weeks is that the broader market is getting better. I thought that the CNX midcap 100 index has bottomed out at that long term support of 16,000. If that is the case, then there is a huge scope for recovery for the midcap 100 index. 

You could actually see a 1000-point recovery for the midcap index from these levels and if that were to transpire, then it will rub off on the mainline indices and then you could see a genuine breakout. 

But I must highlight the banking space because this is one index that has single-handedly helped the markets sustain above support levels in the last four to six weeks. As we speak the index is still trading above 27,000 and if it is just 5% away from lifetime highs. Over the next four to six weeks, this is probably going to be the first mainline index to hit new lifetime highs and we are recommending our clients strongly to be heavyweight in this sector because I think it is going to do very well whether it is private names or the PSU names.


What exactly is driving this conviction in banks and when do you think that we could see this kind of euphoria or optimism?
Well you know when markets go through a difficult phase -- and last three or four months have been extremely difficult given the carnage that we have seen in midcaps and smallcaps -- relative strength is a very important tool. 

All those stocks which have done better than the midcap index or which have done better than the mainline indices are the ones that are likely to see a lot of strength. The FMCG index, the banking space, the oil and gas index are the names which have stayed sideways while the fall happened.

I believe that these are the names that will do exceedingly well once the Nifty gets past that threshold level of about 11000. So relative strength is something that we are watching very closely in the midcaps and small caps, I cannot discuss names but even in the midcap space all those stocks which turned sideways in the last four to six weeks, are the ones that are likely to give you supernormal returns to the extent of 20-50% over the next four to six months.


Do you have the same thesis when it comes to oil and gas and cement?
Cement looks very interesting. Fundamental analysts were telling me that on the ground, the scene is picking up quite a bit on the cement front and when I coincide that with my chart setup, I get a lot of conviction that cement could actually be the dark horse for the next three to six months. 

Most of the frontline cement names have done exceedingly well in the last two, two and a half weeks and today as you see the markets picking up some strength you are seeing cement stocks buzzing and many of them are actually broken out of important bases. 

This is one space I would recommend not only from a trading but from an investment perspective. 

Oil and gas, as a space has been an outperformer. We love the top names in the segment from a six to 12-month perspective. Oil marketing companies, which have been a big drag on the sector and on the market are now looking up. A bottom has been formed out there as well. So yes, both of these spaces look very interesting along with sugar and auto where I think the worst is over as well.


Interesting that you mentioned auto. What about a non-performer like Tata Motors, or a Maruti and an Eicher which have really gotten beaten down? Is time to buy these stocks too?
I would only recommend a very small weightage in auto stocks. I there are much better bets in the market where the risk reward is far more justified and the fact that they have shown relative strength in the bad times. Auto, looks interesting to us only because it is highly oversold. 

The BSE Auto Index itself it has lost about 30% in the last few months and it is approaching that important support of 10,000. From around that level, you are likely to see a recovery of about 10%. 

Talking about Tata Motors, it just cannot get more pessimistic. Auto can be played from a rebound perspective. It is more of a trading idea but if you ask me what I would buy and hold, it would still be the banks, it would still be the capital good stocks, the oil and gas stocks and possibly the IT stocks."

0,2019-03-01,Eicher,"If you find a stock where the company enjoys a competitive advantage, has a moat and has been reporting steady earnings growth, lap it up.

There have been instances of stocks with such traits delivering mouth-watering returns! In one case, an investment of just Rs 10,000 grew to Rs 1.50 crore in 10 years.

In the case of Westlife Development, the master franchisee of McDonald’s restaurants in West and South India, an investment of Rs 10,000 in March 2009 has grown to Rs 1.45 crore as of today, delivering a whopping 1,449 times return.

A little-known stock in 2009, Westlife Developments became the market’s darling during 2012-13 when McDonald's franchisee Hardcastle Restaurants became its direct subsidiary. The stock climbed to Rs 372 on December 31, 2013 from Rs 0.20 in March 2009. From 2013 onwards, the scrip has traded in the Rs 160-400 range. Progressive Share Brokers is bullish on Westlife Development with a price target of Rs 425.

Bajaj Finance has been another big compounder. Since March 2009, an investment of Rs 10,000 in this stock would have grown to Rs 57 lakh, growing exponentially at 88 per cent annually. A similar investment in leading shrimp feeds manufacturer Avanti Feeds would have made you Rs 33.30 lakh.

Astral PolyTechnik, Ajanta Pharma, Vinati Organics, LA Opala RG, Mayur Uniquoters, Eicher Motors and Poly Medicure are other such stocks which have grown an investment of Rs 10,000 into Rs 8-33 lakh during this period. 

Global brokerage Macquarie recently maintained an ‘outperform’ rating on Eicher Motors with a price target of Rs 24,000. The foreign brokerage said structural demand drivers remained intact for the company. However, sales of Royal Enfield (RE) were impacted by large price hikes in the recent past. “RE sales growth should pick up in the coming months,” it said.

Stock returns do not come so easily and it’s not easy to spot such stocks. An investor should devote time to do the research on prospective investment opportunities to increase the chances of spotting such big compounders.

Some basic traits like good leadership, clean balance sheet, revenue visibility, scalability and sustainability usually are first signs that differentiate the wheat from the chaff.

The price at which a stock is bought is also important, as are other parameters such as reasonable to no debt, strong parentage, high return on equity (RoE) or return on capital employed (RoCE) and consistent earnings, even in a weak macro environment. 

Top line and operating profit are two other major components that can give a clear picture of a company’s operating performance. The operating performance should reflect in valuations. 

Companies whose share prices have grown over 5,000 per cent in last 10 years include TTK Prestige, Stylam Industries, Balkrishna Industries, Natco Pharma, Havells India, VIP Industries, Gruh Finance, Supreme Industries, Whirlpool of India, IndusInd Bank, Aarti Industries, Minda Industries and KPR Mill. 

ICICIdirect has a hold rating on TTK Prestige with a price target of Rs 8,800. Religare Broking is positive on VIP Industries with a price target of Rs 551.

1,2019-03-01,Eicher,"The rural segment has reported healthy double digit growth for both passenger vehicle and two
  
  
  -wheeler segments, said Mitul Shah, V-P, Research, Reliance Securities, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


Do you believe that autos will continue to remain in the slow lane, when is to your mind could we see an uptick in the overall demand?
We believe that automobile will continue to report muted volume performance in February as well and the trend has continued since last two-three months after the monsoon got over and we came to know that few districts and few regions of the south and western and parts of the rural witnessed lower monsoon. All that has impacted the rural demand. This will continue at least for next few months and going forward next year’s monsoon will decide the volume performance. 

So, there won’t be any recovery before mid of FY20. Right now the volumes will remain muted but of course Street has considered this type of slowdown and that is why we believe that it will not be highly disappointing number and stock price reaction would not be a big negative considering the volume performance.


Do you believe that maybe we could see recovery coming in in certain segments like two-wheelers or passenger vehicles?
Rural play has very important role for passenger vehicles as well as two-wheelers in past three-four years. In fact, the rural segment has reported healthy double digit growth for both passenger vehicle and two-wheeler segments.

Moreover, we are hearing that a few players have restricted their dispatches to the border area in last 15 days, considering the Indo-Pak tension. This will also have some negative impact on the wholesale number reported by the companies. 

We believe that recovery is still at least a few months away from now and on the other side, inventory level with all the two-wheeler players are reasonably high. 

Again ABS, CBS becoming mandatory from 1st April and so they would be in a hurry to reduce as much inventories as possible. In this situation, reported numbers for February as well as March would not be very great. 


Would you like to take that on board with respect to Eicher?
We do not have coverage on the Eicher but in general in terms of two-wheeler sales, as I mentioned that inventory level is reasonably high and again the Royal Enfield being a speciality motorcycle, the base reaching close to 70,000 itself is reasonably high. 

Recording growth on this base is definitely a challenge and as we have seen in past two-three months, numbers would remain subdued for the Royal Enfield in February also."
2,2019-03-01,Eicher,"Autos are going through a couple of quarters of challenges but they will bounce back again next year, said Nitin Raheja, Co-Founder, AQF Advisors, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts:


When we talk about assets that are up for sale, there are names like Zee, Dewan Housing, CG Power and a lot of other various good assets, maybe Jet as well. How do you see the scenario panning out?
Let us not forget that India is a growing economy and all these assets are in industries which are growing. But due to either mismanagement on account of the existing promoters or because of excessive debt, they have got into temporary problems. Do not forget that when you talk about a stock like DHFL, they have actually sold assets in the affordable housing subsidiary, Aadhaar Housing, they have put their education loan company on the block as well. 

Similarly, we are seeing this with Jet also. The airline business is getting consolidated. There are these three, four large players and it is really a question of mismanagement on the part of the existing promoters which has caused them to be where they are. I am pretty sure that you will see interest, clearly a case in point being a lot of these assets which were in the restructuring in the IBA. Look at the interest that they have found from other large Indian entities who have been willing to step in.

That is a big story which is going to play out. In the whole restructuring, there are going to be a plenty of opportunities within this whole scheme of things because some of these assets are really selling and hence every day you hear about some international entity tying up with an Indian entity, whether it was Kotak on one day, or JM the other day, for setting up distressed asset funds. That is a very interesting opportunity. A lot of value is going to be created.


Maruti, Ashok Leyland again are seeing de-growth on a month-on-month basis. M&M tractor sales have disappointed. The only silver lining so far are the numbers for Eicher CV sales which have seen a pick up. Do you think for some more time we will see a slump in the auto sales?
We all know that there is a liquidity crunch as far as the economy is concerned. NBFCs, which were very strong lenders in this segment, are finding it difficult a) to raise capital and b) a lot of them are actually shoring up their balance sheet and hence constricting growth themselves. 

Also, the government talked about infusing some liquidity as we get into the advance tax season this month. So there is a liquidity crunch and that is having an impact as far as all the autos are concerned. 

Clearly, from the next quarter onwards, you will start seeing liquidity coming back into the economy. You are going to see some pre-monsoon based buying. Post monsoon, you are going to see demand pickup in CV segment ahead of the changing regulatory norms that will come into play from 2020. 

Autos are going through a couple of quarters of challenges but they will bounce back again next year. I would not be surprised if you start seeing a number of companies like Mahindra & Mahindra introduce new models as far as their UVs and SUVs are concerned which are starting to show up in terms of growth numbers albeit in a small way but you will start seeing that acceleration. 


Do you think we have already seen the worst of the stock prices? Are all the negatives already baked in and can one start buying into the weakness in the auto stocks?
I clearly think so. Whether you take the price of Ashok Leyland or Mahindra & Mahindra, a lot of these stocks are trading at multiple-year lows. Ultimately, there is intrinsic value in all of these companies. When you adjust for some of them, their subsidiary holdings and so on and so forth, a lot of them are coming into single digit PEs adjusted for subsidiary valuation. I clearly see value in this pack.


When we look at the markets, you could say that it polarised into two sections; a) one where there is earnings visibility -- the likes of HUL, Nestle, etc, where the valuations do not really dip. b) The other is the area people do not want to touch. How should one allocate or look at the strategy in this space?
Nitin Raheja: The markets are at this point in a complete risk-off mode and hence you are seeing companies with leverage, companies where working capital is high, companies where shares are pledged are being avoided. People are no longer looking at the P&L growth. They are looking more at balance sheet at this present moment and this normally happens in such markets and it is a cycle that the markets go through. 

If one wanted to invest in this market, one has to look through the noise that we are seeing in the short term, whether it is with respect to the political tension that we are seeing or the uncertainty of the elections as such. One has to really focus on individual stocks and stories. Look at companies with strong balance sheets. 

The GDP growth the numbers disappointed yesterday and that can only get better from here and stock prices especially the mid and smallcaps have corrected immensely -- anywhere from 70-80% to 20%. If you look at the entire index, hardly about 15% or 20% of the index is in positive zone and the rest 80% is negative. 

Some of them have come down to levels especially in the recent past backed by this whole fear over share pledges and promoter selling to levels where clearly value is emanating and you have seen them bounce back silently without you noticing them. Some of them have move up almost 10-15%. You could keep waiting for the election and election results to decide what you want to do or you could decide that you could start dipping in a particular company, given its intrinsic value and cheap valuation."
3,2019-03-01,Eicher,"Many stocks both in the midcap and otherwise neglected part of largecaps have started moving up, said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman, Inditrade Capital, in an interview with ET Now.
Edited excerpts: 

Do you think large banks will continue to report good numbers -- the likes of ICICI, Axis and maybe SBI?
They will continue to report good numbers on the back of the fact that the asset quality issues are by and large over. What is going to happen is NCLT process is gathering momentum and some amount of recoveries will start happening which will help them improve their profit on the back of the fact that most of these assets were written off earlier.

Also, the NBFC or liquidity crisis, which started from the IL&FS fiasco, pretty much ensured that the rates of interest at which they have been lending have stabilised or gone up marginally. This is in spite of the fact that RBI is trying to bring down the rates, but the real rate at which they are lending or people are borrowing is marginally higher than what it was prior to let us say September. 

On the back of these two things, the performance of large corporate facing banks are definitely going to improve in the coming days and we have been bullish on ICICI, Axis, Federal Bank, City Union Bank, South Indian Bank and a whole lot of other corporate facing banks. You have to be careful at what price you are entering the stocks because that will be a key factor


What do you make of Airtel and their fund-raising plans?
The verdict is out in the market. With the kind of valuation at which they are making the issuance leads to a significant dilution, obviously the market is not liking it. That is why the stock is being punished and Airtel is completely out of sync with today’s market mood. 

But having said that, companies in this particular sector have very little option but to build a war chest to ensure that they are able to effectively compete with the other big boys in the space. So, there are very few options as far as Airtel is concerned but again the market is punishing the stock because this kind of dilution will definitely erode the investor value per share. So yes, there is a matter of concern but it is a catch-22 situation as far as the telecom space goes. 


NBFCs were the market favourites same time last year. Do you still believe that this sort of correction is the time to buy in good NBFCs with great capital and great processes?
Yes absolutely. NBFCs definitely have a space in Indian economy. The segment of the market which NBFCs have been catering to were not serviced by the banks and large institutions. That was the rationale and that was the reason why NBFCs came into existence and grew so rapidly. 

In last four-six years, they have exponentially grown on the back of the miseries of large corporate facing banks and particularly the PSU banks. The niche they occupy is not yet being serviced by banks. These are the niches which large banks will also not endeavour to service in the near future. They have a role to play and if they have a role to play, the government and the system will definitely find ways and means to meet their funding requirements. 

The challenge is not their systems, processes or people. The challenge is meeting their funding requirements and so a good set of NBFCs with good set of systems, processes, people will get fund. 

We are seeing it getting played out in the market today. There is little bit of stress on the weaker NBFCs but the NBFCs which have a strong balance sheet are doing well or would have started performing very well once again. They are getting their supply of funds and there is no fundamental worry. As far as the markets are concerned, valuation-wise, they have taken a hit but it is a matter of time before it starts recovering once again.


What interests you within the broader markets?
For quite some time, we have been saying that one should look at the broader universe. The Nifty was moving on the back of the movement in a few largecap stocks. After a long time, today is probably an exception. We are seeing many stocks both in the midcap and otherwise neglected part of largecaps also moving up. Today is a different day but otherwise that has been the trend. 

Coming back to the stocks or pockets which one can look at, I have been mentioning that consumption is a theme which is evergreen as far as India is concerned. We will have elections and GDPs moving up and down, but the fact remains that consumption and the consumption related theme will continue to sell in India. 

In that particular space, ITC Ltd looks good at current levels as it is definitely cheaper compared to its peer group. The performance of tobacco has been solid as usual. There are concerns about volume growth but there is absolutely no problem with overall profitability. The real interesting part is the other businesses which were a drag on the profitability, have started showing signs of stability and improvement that is going to pay rich dividend going forward. 

Apart from that, one can look at some of the automobile stocks that really look beaten down. So, a Maruti and even Ashok Leyland at current level look good for an investor with one year plus time horizon. 


You like some of the midcap IT names – NIIT Tech and Mindtree. What about largeccaps and why Mindtree and NIIT Tech?
Mindtree and NIIT Tech are on the back of the corporate action which is being envisaged for some and there is rationale and certainty to the corporate action. It is a matter of time when it happens and considering the valuation at which these stocks are quoting currently, we believe that an open offer is bound to happen post the corporate action and that will definitely unlock significant value from here on as well. 

So for an aggressive investor, these two are good bets even at current levels. As far as large IT companies are concerned, both TCS and Infosys are definitely steady stocks. Their performance has been stable but it is a question of how much incremental money you will make entering at current levels. If somebody has limited resources, I will say let us play through midcap IT but if somebody wishes to have steady stable return over a period of time, even now TCS and Infosys at current levels looks good.


You talked about Ashok Leyland and I just want to highlight what the monthly auto sales are looking like. Barring what Eicher’s commercial vehicle segment has done in February, it has been disappointing all across. Do you now believe that maybe all the negatives are baked in when it comes to autos and one can look at buying the likes of an Eicher Motors or perhaps even a Maruti?
I completely agree with that line of thought. You mentioned Eicher Motors. Look at the Bajaj Auto numbers. They took a conscious call on the export front quite some time back and that is paying them rich dividend today. They also took a conscious call a few quarters back on getting into a price war model for domestic market and again that is paying them handsomely. 

Bajaj Auto numbers have been pretty good, yes the stock took a beating today but the fact remains that the numbers were good as far as Bajaj is concerned. 

As far as the overall recovery of the space is concerned, commercial vehicle sales probably will recover ahead of passenger vehicle sales as soon as the liquidity situation eases and the GDP shows signs on definite upward movement. We will see the commercial vehicle space moving up. Of course, passenger vehicle also will move and Maruti with significant presence across the country including vehicles which work well in the rural market will be a beneficiary. 


How would you look at the pharma sector?
Well I have been bullish on the pharma sector, particularly in the midcap pharma space and there are enough opportunities. Earlier there was a huge pricing pressure on US generics and that was taking a toll on many Indian companies. 

The second was the regulatory issues which were kind of facing these companies. I think on both counts significant positive developments have happened; regulatory issues by and large are behind most of our companies and US pricing pressure is ebbing so that is good news for Indian pharma. 

In the midcap space, Natco Pharma and Aurobindo Pharma are our favourites and we kind of are recommending investors to buy into both these. Apart from solid US business where the pricing has stabilised, Natco also has a significantly large domestic business. Aurobindo has a domestic as well as business spread across other geographies. Overall, considering the valuation at which these are quoting, these are interesting from an investment point of view."
4,2019-03-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty reversed the losing run of three sessions on Friday, spurred by healthy gains in bank, financial, IT and auto stocks, as investors cheered de-escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan.

Speculators raised their bets across sectors on the first day of March futures and options contracts. A rally in emerging markets also influenced mood. 

Chinese stocks jumped after MSCI raised their weight in its global benchmarks. 

Concerns over weak macroeconomic data eased as investors saw a silver lining in subdued GDP and infrastructure output numbers. They hoped that the signs of slowdown in the economy may push RBI to cut interest rate at its next meet. 

The Sensex jumped 196 points, or 0.55 per cent, to close the day at 36,063.81. IndusInd bank stole the show, advancing 2.94 per cent, followed by Yes Bank and Vedanta. 

The decliners included Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, Axis Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech, sliding up to 3.43 per cent. 

Midcaps and smallcaps stayed ahead of the Sensex, with solid gains, rising up to 2.13 per cent.

NSE's Nifty50 settled higher 71 points, or 0.66 per cent, at 10,863.50.

For the week, Sensex inched up by 192 points or 0.54 per cent, while the Nifty added 72 points or 0.67 per cent.

Let's take a look at highlights of Friday's session.


Rs 1.41 lakh crore added to investor kitty
Friday's rally in the market made BSE investors richer by Rs 1.41 lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of listed firms on the BSE jumped to Rs 1,41,82,750.99 crore from Rs 1,40,41,530.33 crore on Thursday.


Spurt in open interest
Reliance Power, with a change of 82.35 per cent, emerged at the top among the stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on the NSE. It was followed by Arvind (71.83 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (48.36 per cent), Just Dial (44.64 per cent), Oriental Bank of Commerce (38.76 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (35.14 per cent).


Over 200 stocks hit upper circuits
As many as 202 BSE stocks, including SML Isuzu, Religare Enterprises, Shreyans Industries, Star Paper Mills, Forbes & Company and Indiabulls Integrated Services, hit their upper circuits. On the flip side, Weizmann, Atlas Jewellery India, Optiemus Infracom and Darshan Orna were among the 162 stocks that hit their lower circuits. 


115 stocks signal upside
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 115 counters on the BSE, indicating that they may climb in coming sessions. Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Engineers India, ITI, Dabur India, Lupin, Repco Home Finance, Mindtree, Dr Reddy's Labs, JSW Energy and Karur Vysya Bank. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Asian Hotels (West) and Orient Beverages were among the 22 stocks that showed bearish crossovers. 


New CEO takes charge, YES Bank jumps 3%
Shares of YES Bank closed 2.68 per cent higher at Rs 237.40 after Ravneet Gill took charge as Managing Director and CEO of the bank. His tenure as approved by RBI is 3 years from the date of his joining, i.e. March 1, 2019 to February 28, 2022. 


Sugar stocks turn sweeter
Most sugar stocks jumped higher, a day after India's Cabinet approved a plan to spend up to Rs 1,054 crore to pay interest on loans to the sugar industry for a year, in a bid to help sugar mills clear their dues to farmers. Dharani Sugars & Chemicals (up 9.99 per cent), Sakthi Sugars (up 6.06 per cent), Triveni Engineering & Industries (up 5.18 per cent), Indian Sucrose (up 4.69 per cent) and Thiru Arooran Sugars (up 4.97 per cent) were among top gainers in the sugar space. 


Airtel falls on EPS worry
Markets reacted negatively to the fund-raising plan of Bharti Airtel as the shares of the company fell 3.43 per cent to close at Rs 307.05. Analysts say the raised funds will help the company pare its debt, but is not enough for its capex and opex plans. Also, the deep discount given for the right issue will hit the company's investors view for further fund-raising and increase worries on EPS estimates.


SBI Life Insurance gains 5%
Shares of SBI Life Insurance Company settled at Rs 612.25, up 5.47 per cent, after CA Emerald Investments, an affiliated entity of a Carlyle Group fund, bought 9 per cent stake in the firm. Separately, BNP Paribas Cardif SA cut its stake in the insurer by 9.23 per cent to 12.77 per cent, the company said. 


Jet Airways jumps 5%
Shares of Jet Airways closed 5.32 per cent higher at Rs 234.65 on reports that founder Naresh Goyal had agreed to step down as chairman. Reuters said Goyal also agreed to reduce his 51 per cent stake in the airline but would continue to be part of the company in some capacity even after stepping down as chairman.


Auto sales
SML Isuzu sold 1,282 vehicles in February 2019 against 965 vehicles in the same month a year ago. The stock closed 20 per cent up at Rs 682.55.

5,2019-03-02,Eicher,"Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, is optimistic about midcap stocks which he says remain quite stable in the face of falling GDP numbers. He expects technology and private bank stocks to gain further traction. He was speaking to ETNow.

Edited excerpts:


What is the screen telling you? Irrespective of the rising geopolitical concerns, the Nifty has really put on a show of resilience. What was good to see in the week gone by was that the broader markets as well began to participate. Would you say this is just a temporary phase because that big overhang of elections is still not done or would you say, we are sort of out of the woods?

We are not clearly out of the woods, it has more to do with the fact that year to date, we have one of the underperforming countries relative to what is happening whether in the developed market or even other countries. Take the case of China, which had gone up significantly because of lowering of tensions between the US and China. 

As for the Indian market, clearly that overhang of election continues. People are still sitting on the sidelines. They still do not have full conviction in terms of adding positions and the geopolitical tensions which are there with Pakistan clearly are adding to that. 

But what one realises is there are certain pockets of the markets, say IT, which have done pretty well over the last couple of days. That market is unlikely to get impacted by whatever happens on the geopolitical side. And for that reason, we are clearly seeing that some of the sectors which are not dependent on what happens on the border are clearly seeing traction in terms of market performance.


The start has been very slow, we had the February auto sales numbers come in. When it comes to Maruti, you have had slow sales. When it comes to Ashok Leyland, the muted movement continues for the fourth consecutive month now. This is irrespective of some hefty discounts from most motown majors. That has been unable to really lift volumes and kick in demand. Do you think that all the negatives are in the price and maybe at the dips one can nibble at for the likes of an Eicher Motors which is struggling at a 52-week low or for that matter, a Maruti which has fallen quite considerably from the top?

It is all about risk reward, which is especially so when we are seeing that the overall industry momentum for auto is not that great. Considering from a risk reward perspective, something like a Bajaj Auto which is trading close to around 15x is something we would be comfortable on. 

Overall, for the sector, we are not that bullish in terms of growth, going forward. Maruti at the right price would be a good buy, a lot of positives for the next two years are already there in the price. If you see the growth numbers, the compact sales growth number was higher, but that was partially due to the fact that the Wagon R category has changed and that was the reason why we saw an 11 per cent kind of growth in that particular segment. 

The numbers continue to disappoint and we would be cautious on the sector as well from here now.


Any particular trend or new piece that you would particularly think would impact the market in the near term?

Yes, obviously the geopolitical front is something that one needs to clearly look at. However, the heartening thing we have seen is that despite falling GDP numbers, we see the midcap stocks continuing to remain quite stable. 

If we see some amount of improvement over the next couple of days in terms of midcap stocks going up, then clearly one would see that some amount of buying interest could come back to the stocks. Overall, consumption and gross capital formation are the kinds of things that one needs to look at. Based on that, something like Titan, which is enjoying more from the gold price going up over the last 2-3 months looks quite interesting to us. 

From the technology pack, a lot of companies whether it is HCL or Tech Mahindra, those look quite interesting to us. These are the companies in addition to the private banks where we now see the slippages to fall. We expect the stocks to do pretty well."
6,2019-03-04,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: The Bullet, it appears, is just not firing on all cylinders at the moment.

Royal Enfield (RE) sales are rather soft, and state-wise volume statistics furnished by industry body SIAM show that the bike that defines panache for motorcycle enthusiasts in India is riding through a rather rough patch. Eight states that make up three of every five RE bikes sold locally have reported deceleration.

Maharashtra and Karnataka together account for 13 per cent of RE volumes, and these two states have seen a drop in 6-7 quarters of the past nine.

Kerala, the largest market of RE, has witnessed volume drops of 13 per cent and 23 per cent in the September and December quarters, respectively. The September decline is attributed to floods. But declines in the December quarter have put the lens on underlying demand. To be sure, volumes at leading carmaker Maruti Suzuki, a proxy for consumer discretionary spending, rose 9 per cent in Kerala in December after declining 25 per cent in the previous quarter.



RE volumes in Kerala dropped 5 per cent in the first nine months of FY19, while it grew 24 per cent in the same period last fiscal. Bike sales in Tamil Nadu saw a fall of 37 per cent in the December quarter.

Industry volume growth of twowheelers in south India was 9.5 per cent in the first nine months, up from 5.6 per cent in the previous year. However, RE’s sales volume growth in the Southern states has been underwhelming.

The Street has been pencilling in volume growth on the assumption that Uttar Pradesh, a less penetrated market, would help offset tepid demand elsewhere. But UP sales climbed 7 per cent in the December quarter. With the base becoming larger in UP, volume growth is likely to be weak. Similarly, among north India states, Punjab sales grew 14 per cent, but remained lower than the industry growth of 28 per cent.

The RE management has given production guidance of 8.7-8.8 lakh units for the current fiscal year. However, it is unlikely to be met. Average monthly run-rate of RE in the first 11months of FY19 stood at 69,569 units. To achieve the stated guidance, the company needs to produce 1.04 lakh vehicles in March. This appears to be quite a daunting task given the weak demand cycle.

The Street is factoring in volume growth of 10 per cent for FY20, which could be trimmed due to about 3 per cent growth in FY19. The Eicher Motors stock fell 30 per cent in the past year following constant negative surprises on the volume front. The stock is trading at 21 times FY20 earnings, compared with the long-term average of 30 times."
12,2019-03-05,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty logged strong gains on Tuesday on healthy buying in bank, financial, auto, oil & gas and metal stocks.

Investors’ risk appetite got a boost after crude oil prices softened further, the rupee gained strength against the US dollar and analysts projected improved prospects for Prime Minister Modi in the forthcoming general elections.

Expectations for an increase in the US crude inventories dragged oil price down towards the $65 a barrel mark. Resumption of Libya's biggest oilfield added more pressure on the commodity price.

Sensex closed the day 379 points, or 1.05 per cent, higher at 36,442, with 24 stocks ending in the green and seven in the red. Nifty50 settled 124 points, or 1.14 per cent, higher at 10,987, with 39 stocks advancing and 11 declining.

Midcaps and smallcaps outperformed Sensex with wider margins; the BSE Midcap index rose 2.01 per cent and the BSE Smallcap index 3.11 per cent. 


Let's take a look at the key highlights of Tuesday's session:

Investors gained Rs 2.45 lakh cr a single day!Tuesday's rally made investors richer by Rs 2.45 lakh crore, as the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms shot up to Rs 1,44,27,254.47 crore from Rs 1,41,81,544.79 crore on Friday. 


304 BSE stocks hit upper circuitsAs many as 304 stocks, including Tata Steel, Graphite India, Vakrangee, Reliance Naval and Engineering, Shankara Building Products and IL&FS Transportation Networks, hit upper circuit limits. However, Jaypee Infratech, Gyscoal Alloys, Industrial Investment Trust, Eurotex Industries & Exports and Oasis Tradelink were among the 177 stocks that touched their lower circuits. 


Spurt in OIRepco Home Finance, with a change of 84 per cent, led a pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest (OI) on NSE. It was followed by Ujjivan Financial Services (50 per cent), PC Jeweller (38.45 per cent), Infibeam Avenues (38.17 per cent) and Muthoot Finance (36.89 per cent). 


Tata Motors jumps 8%Shares of Tata Motors closed 7.72 per cent higher at Rs 194 after its subsidiary JLR reported better-than-expected retail volume for February in the US market. The carmaker said volumes jumped 26 per cent on a YoY basis, which was higher than 18-20 per cent anticipated by Street. Tata Group's move to rejig the $104-billion conglomerate into 10 verticals was also seen as a positive for the company. 


RBI slaps Rs 1 crore fine on YES Bank The Reserve Bank of India has slapped a fine of Rs 1 crore on YES Bank for non-compliance of directions on the Swift messaging software, the global messaging software used for transactions by the financial entities. The Rs 14,000 crore fraud at the PNB was a case of misuse of this massaging software. Shares of YES Bank closed 0.04 per cent down at Rs 237.30.


Cadila climbs on USFDA nod Shares of Cadila Healthcare closed 2.48 per cent up at Rs 331.20 after it received the USFDA approval to market Rivastigmine Transdermal System, marking its first approval for a transdermal product in the US. 


GATI shares jump 2%Shares of GATI jumped 1.90 per cent to close at Rs 80.35 after reports emerged that the company's promoters may sell their entire stake to TVS Logistics. An ETNow report suggested that a deal between Gati and TVS Logistics may be announced soon and other investors may also decide to exit their stake.


Aurobindo climbs on new product acquisition Shares of Aurobindo Pharma climbed 1.73 per cent to settle at Rs 735.90 after the company said it completed the acquisition of seven marketed oncology injectable products from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Inc. 


130 stocks ready to riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 130 counters on BSE, indicating that these stocks may rally in the coming sessions. Among them were Adani Ports, Karnataka Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Havells India, Eicher Motors, SRG Housing Finance and Atul. Meanwhile, Bata India, Kansai Nerolac Paint, PTC Industries and Endurance Technologies were among the 17 stocks that showed bearish crossovers, signalling possibility of drop in these stocks.

11,2019-03-05,Eicher,"For the last four weeks, we consistently saw positive FII inflows and that seems to suggest that there is some 
  
  
  interest coming back into the broader market, said Siddhartha Khemka, VP - Head of Research (Retail), MOSL, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts:

How do you read into the buoyancy in the markets in the afternoon despite some indications of a soft start this morning from the global end of the market? Is this sort of move where we are ignoring what is going across the globe likely to continue especially with what is happening with the broader end of the market?
We had seen in the market that the global rally was taking place. We were not participating because of a host of domestic factors. Now the market is well past that event. The geopolitical issues look likely to have resolved. Other factors like the US-China trade talks seems to getting resolved. Also the pressure from the crude side seems to be stabilising. 

Having said that, the boarder market was oversold. A lot of stocks were hammered and the positive factor that started supporting the market was the positive FII figures. For the last four weeks, we consistently saw positive FII inflows and that seems to suggest that there is some interest coming back into the broader market.


Recently Mark Mobius alluded to the fact that with developments on the geopolitical front, BJP’s chances of winning the 2019 polls have turned brighter. He believes that PM Modi’s popularity for the second term is only going to grow and that our prospects compared to other markets like China are very strong. What do you believe is the sentiment in the runup to the big event?
Yes, definitely there are positive sentiments across the board which is being reflected not only from the domestic side but from the global FII perspective as well. While I am not a political analysts to suggest what the outcome may be, the events that have unfolded has definitely led to positive sentiments towards the current government and especially the Modi-led government where the Street is now talking about a sharp increase in the number of seats that they could win from what they were talking about just before this event unfolded. 

So that is a positive. If the current government continues for the next term, that will definitely be positive for the broader markets which is where we are seeing the interest coming back in the market.


Is Eicher at a good level to be bought into and are all the negatives and decline in the RE sales, priced in?
Yes. Eicher had a lot of issues apart from the volume decline. They had issues with regards to strike at their factories and that also impacted some of the volumes. Compared to the historical past, the valuations were comfortable and that gives some upside to the stock. However, in the near term, we do not see very high growth in the volumes. 

If I were to explain that while the absolute volumes looks like bottoming out, on a YoY basis, we would not see much of a growth and generally we try and track the growth in the two-wheeler or the overall auto sector. It is valued for the high growth that the sector gives which is still some time away. 

Right now, more of value buying is there, which helped investors from a long-term perspective and can definitely have a look given the good portfolio and the niche segment that Eicher caters to. However, in the short-term, I do not think we need to see whether this buying get sustained but in terms of volumes and numbers, I do not see much upside in the near term.


You say there is a decent asset quality improvement in corporate banks now. Which are these banks where you are seeing asset quality improvement and are you restricting yourself only to private sector or are there some PSU names?
Generally, the bulk of the corporate facing banks which includes some of the PSUs are seeing a good improvement in asset quality. Slippages have bottomed out, provisions are getting lowered, because of which even if you see the latest quarter Q3 numbers, most of them reported healthy improvement in earnings. 

But if you see private companies, for an Axis Bank, so far NII grew almost 18% while the PAT growth was much higher because of lower slippages and lower provisioning. The entire corporate facing banks because of the NCLT resolution and because of new NPAs not coming in, are seeing good improvement in the overall asset quality. 

However, in terms of growth potential, I will restrict myself to the top three corporate facing banks which is your ICICI, Axis and one PSU that is again doing well -- SBI. All three are in the same league and are expected to do well going forward. These are the preferred picks in the overall banking space, specifically the corporate facing ones. 


If I have to go a one notch below and compromise a bit on quality, then which are the two or three names which attract your attention?
Some of the banks where I would not want to get into are tier two or tier three PSBs. But you can get into the private space. For example, look at RBL Bank, which is a mix of SME, retail as well as corporate book and has done consistently well. That is a bank which we prefer among our top picks. 

Apart from that, if you wanted to take some risk, Yes Bank is another corporate facing banks which should do well. The quarterly numbers have been pretty good. The new management now is in place. We have also got clearance from RBI saying that there has been no divergence in the latest annual numbers. That baggage is now behind us and that should continue to do well."
10,2019-03-05,Eicher,"Overall, there is a slowdown but at the same time, it is not much of a concern in the medium to long term, said Vinod Aggarwal, MD & CEO, VECV, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts: 
Most of the reports that we are reading seem to indicate that the Indian CV industry is entering a downturn. What exactly is the sense that you are getting? Is the slowdown of the last few months structural or cyclical in nature, according to you?
There has been slowdown in last four months starting from November, But at the same time, we should not forget that the last year, the January to March quarter was a bumper quarter and this year due to that large base effect, the numbers are less as compared to the last quarter’s.

But the numbers are still good. For example, in February, the heavy duty trucks industry was still 25,000 plus and 5-15 ton trucks industry was still 10,500 which are good numbers. So, overall, there is some slowdown but at the same time, it is not much of a concern in the medium to long term.


Would you attribute it to only high base effect or is it something else?
No, definitely there is liquidity crunch. After November, there has been some problem with respect to the financing by NBFCs. To that extent, there is liquidity crunch. Some retail customers are not able to get the financing as easily as it was earlier. Similarly, the interest rates have gone up a little bit. At the same time, there has been some impact of the axle load norms which were changed last year and due to that, higher capacity is also available. 

Then the replacements are required but at the same time, the fleet operators are still waiting and watching because there is a lot of uncertainty. I am sure once the elections are over, we should get into regular demand and there would be a very strong replacement cycle that is coming in and then at the same time you will have the pre-buying impact due to BS VI norms that is going to kick in. 

Another positive for the industry is infrastructure investments. The infrastructure sector is doing very well and as a result of that, even if the overall industry was looking down as compared to the same quarter (Jan to March) last year, the construction trucks -- tippers -- have grown even in February and YTD, the growth in tippers market is 50%. That is a huge growth in the construction trucks. I would say infrastructure is continuing to be very strong. Apart from that, the e-commerce segment is continuing to lead to a lot of demands,. There are these positives which are in sectors which are leading to good prospects for the industry in medium to long term.


Do you see the liquidity situation improve any time soon? Are the headwinds that you just highlighted, going to sustain in the near to medium term as well?
No. The liquidity crunch will get over because I have seen lots of steps being taken by NBFCs to raise the medium to long term finance. They are taking steps to substitute the short-term borrowing which they were doing, through commercial papers. They are coming out with more and more medium-term papers and at the same time, there is more support coming in from the banks. Banks have also started giving loans to NBFCs. I am confident that the NBFCs’ liquidity crunch should be over in next three to six months.


What is the current inventory level at present? Is there slump in demand in heavy duty segment or is it going to be more broad-based?
As far as the inventory is concerned, it is absolutely normal as far as we are concerned. I am not sure about the inventory of the competition but as far as Volvo Eicher is concerned, our inventory is absolutely normal and then we were growing. 

In the YTD basis, we have grown by 14%. If you look at the industry also, on YTD basis, it is still growing handsomely and we are going to new peaks in all the segments like heavy duty trucks which will touch sales of close to 300,000 and light and medium duty (5-15 tonne) truck sales will go up to 1,10,000 to 1,15,00. The earlier peak was 1,03,000 in 2011-12. Buses sales should be around 65,000 to 75,000. 

So, for the overall industry this year, we will see good growth and even in sub 5-ton segment, there is a growth of more than 20%. Overall CV industry will fare very well this despite facing some headwinds in last few months. 


OEMs, according to you, are still doling out discounts in order to push sales. What exactly is the outlook on that front? Do you think that sort of a trend is going to continue?
Discounts are still continuing. They are on deal-to-deal basis. If there is a bulk deal, the discount maybe higher. If there is a retail deal, discounts maybe less. So the discounts are continuing. Of course, you can say it is a factor of demand and supply. Capacity is available with the industry and as a result, discounts are still high.


What is the likely impact on margins given the discounting trend and the decline that one has seen in the heavy and the medium segment so far?
In first nine months, we are maintaining the margins at around 8-9%. Of course, beyond a point, we have a very clear policy that we will not run after the market share, we will not sell the trucks at any cost. So, we have put an upper limit beyond which we will not give the discounting beyond a point. Each company has its policy on the same and as far as we are concerned, we are very clear that we will not go beyond a point."
9,2019-03-05,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: NSE barometer Nifty50 kicked off March derivatives series on a solid note, settling last week a tad above its 200-day moving average. In the process, 74 stocks formed bullish crossovers on NSE, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. Technically, this signals more upside for these stocks. 

The fact that many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late is adding credibility to the emerging trend.

Engineers India looks set to rally. The technical indicator has signalled an upward crossover, meaning a bullish signal, on the counter. Dabur India, Lupin, Mindtree, Repco Home, TVS Motor, Sequent Scientific, Network18 Media and MCX are some on other stocks that look positive on the technical charts. The list also includes Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy's Labs, MOIL, Karur Vysya Bank, ABB India and CESC. 




The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 12 stocks showed bearish crossovers on the daily charts, indicating that these stocks may see downsides in the days ahead. They included Eicher Motors, Tourism Finance Corporation, Endurance Technologies, Asian Hotels (West) and Aditya Birla Nuvo. 



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

In case of Nifty50, it has clearly formed a 'double bottom' on the daily chart, said IIFL Securities. 

It has also surged and tested its critical zone of 10,870-10,900, which is the confluence of the resistance area. ""A break above the resistance would lift Nifty higher towards the 11,000 level, with the 10,800 mark being a key support,"" the brokerage said in a weekly note. 

ICICIdirect sees a resolve in Nifty50 to move out of the upper band of its consolidation range (10,900), unfolding the next leg of upward move towards 11,400 level in the coming months. 

""Volatility would remain high in the runup to the elections, which should be capitalised as an incremental buying opportunity in the 10,750-10,600 range,"" it said.


UNDERSTANDING MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Engineers India shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock showed an upward momentum and vice versa.

On Friday, the scrip settled 2.71 per cent higher at Rs 110.10 on NSE."

13,2019-03-05,Eicher,"Private banks and cement companies are where money would flow in said, Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder, 
Complete Circle Consultants, in an interview with ET Now. Also, one can be selective in consumption and tactical in OMCs, says Chadha. Edited excerpts: 


What is it that the market is pricing in? It seems this is a pre-election cheer which is coming in a tad too early?
It is a little early to call it pre-election cheers but what has happened is that while the entire market continues to focus on the geopolitical risk, a lot of other risks which the market was concerned about have abated a little bit. 

2018 was a year when we had some central banks hiking rates like in US and some of the emerging markets like India and Indonesia. There were some central bankers who were more accommodative. Probably this year you will see all central bankers being more accommodative. US is already indicating a pause in balance sheet contraction. India has already had a rate cut. China has now guided for lower end of the GDP at 6%. You could see both monetary and fiscal stimulus there. 

You will probably have a synchronised central bank accommodative stance this year which is positive for EMs. Also the threat of a full-blown trade war seems to have abated a little bit. Also India has really underperformed the EM basket. The emerging market index is up 11-12%. China is almost 18-20% up and we had underperformed. So. it could be a bit of catching up as well.


Which are those names which you would like to be part of your portfolio? Any particular segment within housing finance companies where you are more optimistic?
In the housing finance space, we have to differentiate the balance sheets. It looks to be a homogenous space, but it is not. A lot of the names have been under pressure -- the likes of Edelweiss or Repco or even Motilal because of their Aspire incurring losses. 

In case of L&T Finance, 60-65% of the book is mortgaged. The balance is developer loans and LAP. Also, NHP does not regulate HFCs as strongly as RBI does for some of the others in terms of banks. I also expect more regulation to come in once this crisis is fully taken care of. 

Within the HFC space, one safe bet is HDFC Limited. They have about six million homes which they have financed. They have a right combination of consumer and institutional book. Even if you see the institutional book, they are more focussed. The growth is coming from the lease rental discounting and construction finance and not much from the corporate loans to developers. We are a little selective here. I would consider something like a Can Fin in HFCs, where 80% of the book are linked to the salaried class, which again are mostly government employees. 

We have to watch out on the liability side. It should be more granular and on the lending side, the exposure to developer loans and the LAP should be a little lower. On consumer finance, the obvious position which I have been maintaining for long is Bajaj Finance. 


You seem to be betting on NCC. What kind of potential do you see over here? What is the long-term target price and do you believe now is a good time to enter?
We are positive on three fronts. They have a order book of more than Rs 34,000 crore, even in last quarter, they had a good EBIT with 12% margin. Most of these orders are government PSU backed. It is one of the largest construction companies right now. 

The only concern is the working capital days which is about the highest in the industry. Their receivable days are about 200 vis-à-vis about 120 for the industry. The safer bet could be L&T in the largecap space which is not necessarily construction, but the entire engineering construction -- the ECC space. In Q4, they have guided for almost Rs 40,000-50,000 crore of order book and in the first nine months, they were at about Rs 1.2 lakh crore.

If they have a Rs 40,000-50,000-crore order book, they will be on course to hit about 10% to 12% growth in orders and the good part is that there is improvement across the metrics. It is not only in terms of the diversification of orders. There are orders from hydrocarbons and refineries because the oil prices have been a little better. There are airports, water supply and they have this time re-categorised the orders into broadly four categories -- which is significant, large, major and mega. I am not really talking about the small orders which are Rs 1,000 crore. There is improvement in working capital cycle as well. So, in this space, we are fairly positive on largecap L&T and midcap NCC.


Tata Motors clocked it is best single day gain in about three years’ time. Do you think Tata Son’s business rejig to cut costs, the fact that they have assured that JLR turnaround is round the corner and the kind of rebound that we have seen in the Feb auto sales would that give you conviction to be a medium or long-term buyer in Tata Motors?
It is interestingly placed. If you see its sales breakup, the passenger cars actually grew 2% in Feb where the CV and the overall business was down. In case of JLR also, the US sales were up about 29%. If you add Germany, Italy and US and put together as a cluster minus China, it grew about 16%. 

There is lot of action in terms of ramping up their I-PACE model. There are couple of more SUV models on the Range Rover platform. So it will be an interesting space to watch out and I think Tata Motors has been attractive sub-200 for a long, long time. 

I think what has happened is that every quarter you had some disappointment or the other. I would like to watch out for Brexit and the China factor because that is where the high margin because US is mostly low margin sales. China is where they have the higher margin as well as volumes sales coming up. So, maybe with news of China cutting 3% VAT on manufacturing, there could be a slight improvement in their China sales.

In domestic business, the response to Harrier and some of the new SUVs which they are coming is quite good in terms of their dealer checks we have done. So it is an interesting one. If you want to buy it right now, maybe 20% now and then wait for a quarter and then maybe gradually accumulate.


Would you buy into Eicher sub Rs 20,000? The stock has recovered much from there and seeing a big move today?
A lot of pain was in the price when the stock was at around Rs 19,000 and sub 19,000. The numbers of February were also a little disappointing as it was approximately 64,000 units versus 70,000 which this fleet was expecting. If you look at it, the strike in one of their plants meant a loss of 3,000 units. So, it is a larger trend which is playing out here. I will not be a buyer right now on Eicher. I will try to wait and watch because I like to see two trends here, one is their new models which are at the 650 cc which is the Interceptor and the Terminator.

Also often not discussed is the commercial vehicle segment and they have some good technology in the medium weight commercial vehicles. We probably will have to see whether the CV cycle is on the downturn or it is a temporary phase. But it is good to add on dips. You can wait and watch for now on some of these auto names, but as I said lot of pain is in the price.


How are you playing the consumption theme? Do you believe that within the consumption space, you would tend to be very selective?
I would be. Every election in India is like a mini QE (quantitative easing). You see the cash in circulation goes up. It has already gone above the pre-DeMo level and a lot of the parallel side of the economy comes into the mainstream with the kind of spending we see.

We are already seeing government transferring about Rs 28,000 crore to the farmers which is part of the basic income support. There will be more loan waivers and as you get closer to election, there will be probably a lot of spending by the political parties. So. that makes me positive. 

There are two-three spaces I like here. The FMCG packs stands out, I like Nestle and HUL in the staples. Nestle is likely to launch about 13 t0 15 new products, you could have a topline growth of 15% after a long, long time and followed by a margin expansion or may be 80 to 100 bps. So, that looks attractive. 

HUL has come off a little bit in the last previous trading sessions. The food and the beverage segment after the acquisition would give them the distribution reach to add on to those gains so positive there. 

I also like some niche consumption plays which are like the pressure cooker and the kitchenware makers like a TTK prestige the market itself will probably grow 3 to 4x as rural areas are only 20-30% penetrated. 

I also like some of the while we have spoke about Info Edge right and Zomato probably the unlisted space has an advantage on the food aggregator side but I like Jubilant for the fact that there has been a good price correction. They are cutting down on their Dunkin Donuts outlets which did not pan out well. They have already cut down from 70 to about 35. The same store growth is about 20-21% and they are now venturing into the Chinese Kitchen which will probably give them some variety to take on to these food aggregator so those are some of the ideas in the space.


How would you approach not just OMCs but also some of the other names like ONGC and some of the gas names like MGL, IGL?
There are two parts to the portfolio. One is buy to hold which is your HDFC and Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints of the world and one is buy to sell. A lot of these OMCs, some of the PSU names you spoke about possibly fall there. One has to be a little tactical in OMCs. HPCL for example at sub-200 was a good buy. It was almost book value. 

Also we have to look at the marketing infrastructure. Some of these are virtually oligopolies. There are chances of obvious government regulating through tinkering with excise duties and subsidies. HPCL, in particular, is one of the largest lube based refineries in India. If I were to be a little tactical here, I will probably pick up HPCL. 

You are right about the city gas distributors. MGL looks very, very good. We are already seeing three-wheeler sales turning positive for most of the auto makers even in February. So domestic connections, increasing three wheelers moving to the CNG and slightly lesser regulation in the gas space compared to petrol and diesel, gives them an edge. 

But again you have to be more tactical here. Some of the other PSU names where you can be a little tactical is NTPC. It is trading at about 11 times. It has a good dividend yield. The coal production is up by almost 7% after a long time. The dispatches are up about 3%. It is a virtual monopoly play. This is almost like 7-8% dividend yield on it. So maybe that part of the portfolio could be looked at, but as I said tactically.


In the next leg of the rally, where do you think the contribution is going to come in from sectorally?
If you see the overall report which has come last year on the entire banking sector, the private corporate banks are getting the bulk of the flows. If you look at for example current accounts, the share of PSU bank has even fallen from 58% last year to 54%. In deposits, they are losing market share and by deposits I mean saving, current and term deposits. 

Once you lose current account share, it basically means that cash management is being handed over to the private banks. The corporate loan fund are going to the private banks which affects the PSU banks’ trade, their fx income and it has a cascading impact on their overall fee and interest income. 

So they will continue to gain market share and bankex typically grows one and a half times GDP. If private banks can gain market share, probably they will grow at 15% to 18% as a category. Also, the credit cost is likely to come off by 100 bps for private banks largely led by ICICI and Axis. Now on a large base, a 1% reduction in credit cost would translate to Rs 5,000-7,000 crore of bottom line movement. That is one space which is looking very good. 

Some of the construction names we have discussed in the capital goods space looks good. Cement valuations look very, very attractive. There have been a price hike of Rs 50 to Rs 60 on an average in south, about Rs 30-40 in other parts of the country. Good picks here could be Shree Cement which is largely north based and ACC as well because the stock has been a little under pressure due to having older splant and some of the clinker capacities are not really coming through. So, these are the broad sectors, which liquidity would chase."

16,2019-03-06,Eicher,"The markets will probably gyrate and the volatility might continue though the positive bias might stay, said 
Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts:


The setup is looking fairly healthy at the moment. The broader end of the market is participating and the flows are fairly encouraging. Are we going to see a prolonged move on the upside or is this a flash in the pan move right now?
The FIIs have probably reposed confidence in our markets and the domestic buying is justifying the move that we are seeing. The rally that we witnessed yesterday was really broad-based. A lot of stocks and sectors probably moved, but my own sense is certain headwinds are still left for the markets to counter. 

On the global scale, we have discussed about it time and again in terms of what happens with Brexit, the US-China contours of negotiations on the trade war and what probably happens with oil. The volatility on these aspects will probably keep currencies probably a little bit on the tighter side. Then we have the general elections over the next few months. So yes, the markets probably were stuck in the range but very close to the upper end of the range.

The markets will probably gyrate and the volatility might continue though the positive bias might stay. I am adopting a stock specific approach in markets like this. 


What is the sense that you are getting when it comes to IT? Do you believe that it will continue to outperform?Ticking off the positive elements that the sector has probably gone through, you could be right. The digital investments as a percentage of top line has increased significantly whether for the top-tier players or mid-tier players. Anywhere between 30-40% is where the digital percentage of revenues are which is a high margin business. 

The second element obviously is in terms of onsite staffing. There was a significant amount of hit that a lot of these players have taken to recalibrate their entire business model and the wage hikes that typically happen in the first two quarters. The EBIT margins which probably got affected have gestated to a large extent, the kind of impact that one probably sees from these factors. 

The third element obviously is the order book and the order book takes off because of the wins that they are probably getting, specifically in key areas like BFSI, retail, manufacturing, life sciences that holds them in good stead. 

The fourth element obviously is utilisation levels. The utilisation levels have started picking up, but attribution levels for a few players are still on the elevated side. As the bench strength starts getting improved and as the execution starts improving, you are probably going to see the earnings traction happen both in the constant currency and dollar terms. 

The risk-off factor probably is slower than expected discretionary spending from US corporates in the event of a slowdown that one probably talks about. BFSI which is very critical for a large number of players, is one sector to be closely monitored. 

The second element obviously is in terms of the slowdown where you are probably going to see lower utilisation levels and higher onsite costs. Having said that, the top tier names is something that investors can hold at. We hold Infosys within the top tier names and HCL Tech in our portfolios. 


What is your outlook on autos? Which are the stocks you prefer?
The slowdown is here to stay for at least next few months, a) they are working on a very high base, b) you are probably looking across the spectrum of the auto universe -- two-wheelers, four-wheelers and even the MHCV players. 

There is high inventory level in the system at this point of time. Over the next few weeks, the liquidation of this inventory is going to be very critical and liquidation of inventory will obviously happen at a discount. Add to that, if we talk about two-wheelers, the entry level segment is where the heavy discounting and undercutting is still continuing to probably have a foothold in terms of market share gains. 

The premium bikes have witnessed certain amount of slowdown pressures as well because of ownership cost moving higher due to higher insurance cost as well as costlier fuel cost in the quarter gone by. There were delayed purchases from the buyer end. 

On the PV side, the competition is hotting up and for volumes to normalise, it will take a few months. It is not going to be a V-shaped recovery in terms of volumes that one can really expect from the auto universe. 

It is a very slow and gradual recovery process that will happen. Even on the MHCV part he LCV market has held up pretty well, the HCV part is probably still languishing because of concerns on what probably happens through in view of axle load norms. 

Again as pre-buying will starting taking place in the second half we will see traction coming but there will be price hikes in the last quarter as well. I am being very, very selective. Eicher Motors is something that we own the two-wheeler space. It has gone through a lot of pressure points but the new twin 650 cc launches that they have done has seen good response. The export market is holding up for them as well. 

Maruti probably looks very interesting. Though the correction has been very sharp, the recovery will be very gradual but valuations probably look very attractive at this point of time. 


I always find this argument rather silly that you should do defensive buying when markets are uncertain and buy staples and auto stocks because they will not fall?

Mayuresh Joshi: So to a certain extent I think a) one must really look at how the earnings recovery and the earnings trajectory is going to pan out. Cyclical sectors go through volatile times and in these volatile times you are going to see these sectors getting beaten down. But there is a huge amount of impact that can also come through in terms of strong earnings recovery. How do you position yourself specifically in terms of the sector allocation that you are probably expected to do with the expectations of strong earnings growth and earnings recovery is something to be seen. 

Financials that you are probably alluding to have probably gone through the worst possible patch. They have also moved up quite sharply. But as credit growth starts picking up in the system, a large part of recognition has probably happened on the book. The valuations probably can get rerated even from the current level. You are talking about specific NBFCs. They have got beaten down out of shape because of liquidity concerns. But the well-capitalised, less-leveraged NBFCs will recover the most as the recovery process starts coming into play. One really needs to understand the dynamics in terms of which sectors might do well. 

Consumption, again is a large basket, but within consumption, there are sectors which can get played out. Our sense is we are probably looking at the paper sector which in our opinion can do really well over the next few quarters and even certain stocks within the hotel industry."
17,2019-03-06,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: High growth days in India’s auto sector seem to be over till a new story, say electric vehicles, comes into play .

Automobile makers reported another month of tepid sales in February. Analysts say even the forthcoming wedding season and the general elections may not help lift passenger vehicle volumes, while two-wheeler sales could see a boost in the medium term.

That said, analysts are still showing a preference for passenger vehicle makers to two-wheeler makers due to relatively less competition, with Maruti Suzuki being the top pick from the segments. Among two-wheeler manufacturers, Bajaj Auto remains the favourite pick.

Most analysts say the commercial vehicle segment will continue to disappoint Dalal Street in the coming months. There has been a buildup of unsold inventory, as RBI rate cut has failed to lift buyers’ sentiment. Looming general elections is another concern.

Centrum Broking says auto demand will continue to remain volatile, but the two-wheeler segment may gain momentum due to recent pro-rural Budget announcements.

”High cost of ownership continues to dent passenger vehicle (PV) volumes. The upcoming marriage and festive seasons could support sales. The CV and tractor cycle seems to have peaked, but pre-buying in H2FY20 could help grow the numbers,” it said in a note.

Nomura sees downside risk for most auto makers, except for Bajaj Auto. The foreign brokerage sees high inventory and rising cost pressure to weigh in going ahead.

“Wholesale volumes are likely to remain subdued despite some improvement in retail sales in March due to the marriage season,” it said. The brokerage maintains a 9 per cent YoY industry growth estimate for FY20.” It said Maruti Suzuki is the best play from the sector.

Maruti posted a set of subdued numbers for February, with domestic volumes rising 0.2 per cent. Unlisted peer Hyundai saw sales drop 3.1 per cent. SUV maker M&M showed strong growth at 16.6 per cent.

Motilal Oswal prefers PV players over CV and two-wheeler makers due to a relatively stable competitive environment. This brokerage prefers Maruti Suzuki among the largecaps.

Analysts said while volume growth for passenger vehicle makers has been tepid, new product launches might offer some respite going ahead.

The two-wheeler space proved a mixed bag. Bajaj Auto logged double-digit growth at 10.2 per cent on attractive product pricing, but Hero Moto Corp registering a 2 per cent decline as it faced challenges in retail sales. Higher cost of ownership and intense competition added to Hero’s woes.

Eicher Motor’s Royal Enfield sales dropped 14.3 per cent. TVS Motor posted 1.7 per cent sales growth.

In the commercial vehicles segment, sluggishness was visible all over due to the lag effect of the implementation of revised axle load norms. Ashok Leyland reported flat volume growth at 0.4 per cent. Eicher Motors also saw a 6.7 per cent decline.

Analyst expect pain for CVs to continue in the coming months. Tractor volume growth slowed down in February to 3.3 per cent YoY, owing to a high base and muted farm sentiment in key markets. Escorts continued to report strong 12 per cent YoY growth, while M&M’s volumes declined 7 per cent YoY.

Analysts expect 10 per cent growth in tractor volumes in FY19, followed by 5 per cent YoY drop in FY20, as the cycle peaks out.

In the two-wheeler segment, Bajaj Auto with 40 per cent exposure to export markets is the top bet in domestic as well as overseas markets, said Centrum Broking.

In all, the PV segment is expected to grow at 7 per cent, while the two-wheeler segment will witness a 6 per cent growth over FY20/FY21, said CLSA. The foreign brokerage expects truck makers to log only 2 per cent growth in FY20, followed by a 12 per cent decline in FY21."
18,2019-03-06,Eicher,"The outlook going forward in terms of growth is getting better. It was only a matter of time before buying emerged from lower
  
  
  levels. What surprised most people was the speed of the rally, said Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor, in an interview with ET Now. SBI, Bank of Baroda or even some of the tier two or tier three banks like Union Bank are appearing attractive, says Mavani.Edited excerpts: 


 Are we seeing a short-term rebound in the market?
At this point of time, it seems to be a short-term rebound. But it could sustain for a while. Let us put things in perspective. Last six months, some of the largecaps and more of the small and midcaps got hammered. A price erosion of 30-40% seemed quite common. Stocks had been beaten down 60-70% off their highs exactly a year back. We are talking of January-February of last year. Some of them deserved to be beaten but a lot of them had sound fundamentals with short-term concerns or pains.

They were whacked out of shape and at lower levels, value buying at some point of time would have emerged. The key indicator of value buying was that a large number of promoters, entities linked to the promoters buying their own stock or accumulating their own stock via creeping acquisition at lower levels. That is a very convincing sign that things are not so bad or have sort of bottomed out. 

Technically also, the indicator seemed to be giving us hints that the worst seems to be over as far as price is concerned. In last two-three quarters quarterly results, a large number of companies in spite of 30-40-50% correction have still delivered quite reasonably on their earnings front.

The outlook going forward in terms of growth is getting better. It was only a matter of time before buying emerged from lower levels. What surprised most people was the speed of the rally. In less than two weeks, stocks have rallied anywhere from 20% to 50%. That probably is surprising everybody and hence I would say that this seems to be like a missing out feeling that most market participants had last week or even yesterday. Before you missed out on the opportunity, you need to jump on the bandwagon, before it starts to move.

Now is that likely to continue? Perhaps yes, because the NBFC crisis was real, but the crisis did not hit everybody but everybody got hammered as a result. You had even an Edelweiss correcting 60% which probably was undeserved in that sense because when you really scratch the surface and see where Edelweiss has a problem, you are likely to see that Edelweiss really does not have a problem. I am just giving an example and you could extend that same to several other stocks as well. 

If they have been rallying from the bottom, quite rightly they should be. Will this sustain? My sense says it will. Whether it will be stock specific? It will. Are we headed for 12,000? I have no comments on that but individual stocks certainly have bottomed out.


When you say individual stocks have bottomed out, let us say talk about weaker pockets. We have seen Maruti, Eicher Motors. Irrespective of all the news flow on them, Eicher has seen sales dip in February. Is the negative is all baked in and is it time to start buying these stocks? 
I do not think so. Eicher particularly, I do not think so because in Eicher, sometime last year also, valuations had gone quite out of line with its own historical multiples that it has traded in or even with auto companies. Not just in India, but it is globally number one. The kind of growth rates Eicher was clocking month after month, quarter after quarter seemed difficult to sustain and we have been seeing the pain points in the last six months. Not only is sales in Royal Enfield, which was a growth driver, slowing down, now it is probably the third month when sales have actually dipped. 

In case of Eicher, that huge expansion of multiples contracting because of earnings growth is not there, at least in the foreseeable future. So Eicher probably may not bounce back as much. Eicher has not participated in the rally in the last two weeks where large number of or most midcaps have participated. 

In case of Maruti also, there is growth problem in terms of system inventory levels, likely production cuts and so on and so forth but Maruti was never trading at euphoric valuations in the first place. Maruti also has not participated in the rally and I do not see a very serious downside in Maruti either, maybe another 10% downside is all I would sense in a panic situation as far as Maruti is concerned. 

But as far as other auto stocks are concerned -- Mahindra & Mahindra or Bajaj Auto or Hero MotoCorp -- all are at quite attractive levels for value buying. 


 There is reassuring words coming in from Tata Motors Chairman and the management saying that they are looking at turning around JLR. With Feb sales showing that bit of an uptick, would you buy into the story at all?
I would buy into the story not so much for the statements that the senior management or the chairman or officials from Tata Sons make. But a clear indicator for confidence in the management of any company is are the insiders buying and Tata Sons in the last couple of weeks has bought close to 1.5 crore shares. So 1.5 crore shares is almost Rs 300 crore plus investment. Tata Sons is actually putting their money where their mouth is. I can believe that more than what statements they make. The sign of confidence is they are putting their own money in the stock at these beaten down levels.


They also bought when Tata Motors was trading at Rs 350 also.
True, I am only referring to a certain sign of confidence. See for Tata I do not think they need to really make that statement that they will turn around. They have no choice but to turn it around. Otherwise, in a way Tata Motors is too big to fail given the size of their balance sheet. More importantly, from a perspective of pride, Tata Group cannot allow Tata Motors to go down the drain. Nobody is going to forget this in a hurry, not to say the kind of repercussions it would have on the banking and financial system not just in India, are going to be quite serious. 

Any call on Tata Motors has to be not less than two to three or five years, unless one is willing to take that kind of a view. It will be very difficult for anybody to be making those kind of forecasts or projections as to how soon or in with what intensity will JLR turnar ound. I can only wish them all the best. There is value in the company at these prices sooner than later. The problem will get sorted out and perhaps a couple of years down the line, the stock price certainly will be higher than what it is right now.


Are the banks still sitting out of this bounce back?
As far as the private banks are concerned, the banks which really had no concerns per se -- HDFC Bank, Kotak bank, IndusInd Bank -- had not corrected meaningfully in the first place and things are fine for them.

Two or three banks which stand out -- ICICI Bank, Axis and Yes Bank -- supposedly had some problems over the last two-three years as regards their balance sheet issues, governance issues and with corrective action taken in the last six months or so. 

After almost a three or four year of underperformance, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have come back roaring. So ICICI Bank probably in the last one year has returned almost 50% or at least 40% returns. Axis Bank has also shown similar kind of returns in the last one year/

A lot of the underperformance between 2015 and 2018 has been made up. Yes Bank has yet to make up but if things go fine with the new CEO coming in and cleaning up, Yes Bank should also bounce back. 

As far as PSU banks are concerned, there too the worst seems to be over as regards their bad loan problem but somehow the market is not fully convinced. That is what the price seems to suggest. SBI at Rs 276? In the last two years or last three years, SBI has been range-bound at 250-260 on the lower side and may be 300-310 on the higher side. It could have shot up by few rupees beyond that but certainly they have value from a I would say if the worst in case of the balance sheet issues and bad loans is behind us most PSU banks on a price to book multiple are quite attractive. 

From here on, we would see growth returning and which is where the capital expenditure and the corporate side lending activity has to come back in double digits otherwise from current levels, there is not much of downside. But from a medium to long-term, very attractive bets are SBI, Bank of Baroda or even some of the tier two or tier three banks like Union Bank.


 What are you making of Edelweiss because it seems like maybe value unlocking is the way to go forward. We will see these separate entities under Edelweiss get listed at some point in time but just going by the valuations of the ECL Finance deal at Rs 9500 crore, that is sizable. Would you still buy into Edelweiss at the current levels?
Oh certainly. I would buy into Edelweiss from not just from one-year perspective but even from a longer term perspective. You put any number up to next 10 years, I would be a buyer in Edelweiss at these levels simply on the macro theme of financialisation of the economy and financialisation of the savings.

Number two, as far as maturity of the financial markets as regards asset reconstruction, wealth management, private lending or individual lending spaces are concerned, NBFCs have done a reasonably good job where banks are not present. 

In all of that, Edelweiss is quite well placed that is number one. To answer your question about value unlocking, that is the way to go and that would actually apply not just to Edelweiss but to Kotak Bank as well. HDFC has shown the way. 

HDFC and ICICI have shown the way where ICICI has got two insurance companies already listed. HDFC has got the life insurance and the AMC business listed. Reliance Capital also has shown the way with listing of home finance business and the AMC business. Perhaps some other subsidiary is also likely to go public. It is a clearly template laid out and every bank or every NBFC is at some point of time going to do that in terms of value unlocking the subsidiary whether it is by listing or by having a strategic investor does not matter.


Now there are so many subsidiaries or so many companies, sum of part valuation. Which company you would value more?
The NBFC would have the highest value simply because of the size. Today, when we look at Edelweiss as a consolidated entity, simply the NBFC by virtue of its size in the total is going to have the highest value. Next will be the wealth management and brokerage business. 

Today in terms of sum of parts, it is the size of the business and contribution to the consolidated revenues but that not necessarily may hold true in future because some of the smaller businesses may catch up much faster."
20,2019-03-07,Eicher,"India will either move up or emerging markets correct, whichever way, my guess is that India will move up, said 
Sridhar Sivaram, Investment Director, Enam Holdings, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


Given the fact that we are seeing the evidence of a slowdown in China, are we better placed when it comes to the macros?
To start with, we have significantly underperformed the emerging markets. If you see year to date, emerging markets have had a flying start. They are almost up 11-12%. China is up almost 15-16%. There has been a significant underperformance for India and maybe for the right reasons. We have had our own issues with NBFCs and HFCs, plus there has been uncertainty with elections coming up. But this underperformance will not last too long and our view is that we will see the underperformance bridge. India will either move up or emerging markets correct, whichever way, my guess is that India will move up. 


What gives you this conviction?
Because there is nothing globally to suggest that there is any major scar right now. The US-China tantrum trade war is going on and we keep getting news flows on that but barring that, we are seeing a benign liquidity situation. Even the Fed has given a benign outlook. Given all this and the fact that India has significantly underperformed, majority -- barring a group of five or six stocks -- were beaten down much more than required. 

Not necessarily earnings are catching up but the valuations of many of them have started looking attractive. We will see a catch up in the Indian market to at least closer to the emerging market…


We may have underperformed since the beginning of 2019 but we outperformed in 2018. So, some would argue that we are simply aligning with the reality. 
The outperformance was a mirage. Take any average FII emerging market fund or India dedicated fund…


You did not say that in 2018, did you? Did you use the word mirage?
No, I am just saying that it is just those 5-10 stocks that actually performed the broader market and even the portfolios of average fund managers. I am saying the FII fund managers underperformed by 500 to 700 bps in 2018. So, it was not as if the portfolios did well. We had 5-6 stocks which held the market up but we all know broadly that the market was in pain. It was not as if the market was giving a positive return, the portfolios were not showing that and I think that is what is getting corrected now.


Zee, Vedanta and a lot of promoter groups got exposed because of cross holdings, large debt at promoter holding or capital allocation. Does that worry a classic long-term investor like you? 
100% because when promoters are doing well in one business, they tend to extrapolate and think that they can do well in others too. He had a missed out feeling that infra is doing well or roads are doing well or something else is doing well. Telecom is doing well, I want to get in there and how do I get in if I do not have money? I pledge my shares or do whatever else to get the equity. But what we have seen now is that there is core competence for all promoters. They are good at doing something. I may not be good at doing everything and that results in minority shareholders interest being compromised. That is what we are seeing right and I am happy that this has come to fore.

In many cases we did not even know that they were pledged because the structure was so complicated that they did not have disclosed it as pledged because it is some structured finance and stuff like that. I think that has to be cleaned up and minority shareholder interest has to be kept at the top. I am happy that many of the promoters now have to sell their crown jewel to pay their debts. It is a good sign, it will clean up the market. 


Report after report this morning or start of the week till now and the chorus is only getting louder for a broader market recovery. Does it seem like the worst is behind us after a hiatus of almost a year and a half or underperformance? The worst may not be behind us and I can come to that later, but for the broader market, the valuations of many of these stocks have come down so much that I would want to believe that the broader market will rally. We have been meeting consumer companies not necessarily FMCG, trading at below one time sales; paper-related companies trading at two or three times earnings. Many of these were quite shocking and with adjusted dividend, yields were unbelievable. So, there was a disbelief in the market that these will rally. 

Also, there was the entire PMS issue which came up. 2017 was such a great year for any investor. People thought they were better than Warren Buffett because any stock that they bought, went up! So you think investing is so easy and then 2018 was the reality check. Many of these fund managers have not seen cycles. So I am not saying as if we have not made mistakes, everybody makes mistakes but it is just that understanding that there is cycle and that has resulted in this situation. PMS have caused more damage to midcaps and small caps. 


So you do believe that there is value within mid and small caps and that is beginning to be realised.
Yes correct.


What did you think went wrong? What did you assess which is proving out to be a wrong?
Last year, we were bearish for a long period of time, we started getting comfortable sometime middle of last year and then we had this IL&FS issue which was not in our calculations because prior to that, most companies were giving sort of bullish outlook that festive season may be very good this year and you are starting to get that sort of a feel. 

Once IL&FS happened everything sort of collapsed because many of these NBFCs and HFCs were also funding consumption in many ways and there was second derivative impact where projects stopped, real estate construction stopped and all of that had a significant impact on earnings on the sentiment. Some of that is now reducing. I would not say those issues are completely over but a lot of that is now looking priced in. But as I have said in the past also, I still do not believe that the problems for NBFCs, HFCs are over.


Are there going to be more skeletons coming out of the closet -- anything as big as IL&FS?
It is very difficult to say whether that will happen or not but HFCs have been very vocal on this that their books are not the best because on an average, in HFCs, about 40% is builder loan and a LAP combined. Mortgage is only about 60% and HFCs can restructure the loan and not disclose anything to the minority shareholders because that is how the NHB regulations are. So, it is not as if they are doing anything wrong! It is high time that we had an AQR for HFCs because you cannot remember any large builder NPA for any HFC.

Recently there was a presentation by one of the sort of a company which tracks real estate that NBFC funding to real estate has gone up in the last six years from 35% to 65% . Incrementally, real estate has been funded predominantly by NBFCs in the last four-five years and yet we have not seen any NPAs whereas banks are declaring NPAs. But that is not possible and so, I think there is lot that needs to be done. The process of NPA detection for of HFCs and the corporate facing NBFCs has not even started. That process has to happen.


Stories yet to unfold there.
Yes, that is my broad view.


My only fear with that assumption is that because that wheel is going to stop, that pipe is going to get caught, that will throw a cog in liquidity. If the housing sector does not do well, then there is a problem for cement, for steel and then there is a problem for the economy. I hope our assessment is not right.

Yes, what you are saying is right but my prediction is that many of these promoters will realise that their funding has stopped because their main source of funding is either the banking system or the mutual funds. Mutual funds have already stopped. Now it is only the banking system where they have to beg and cry and may be do some selling of their assets to get some money. This cannot last for too long and so they will sell out the business. 

In my view, if the NPAs are between 5% and 10%, then the bond market is safe because the equity holder has to take a haircut. The bond market is safe which is broadly fine and if that happens, equity guys are anyway taking the risk. You should understand that there is risk here! If you are taking risk, that is a reward but there is also pain. 

As long as the bond market and the banking system does not face the crisis, this crisis can be resolved and one of the steps that NHB has now suggested is higher capital adequacy, a step in the right direction. and increasing the capital adequacy is only that much leverage that you can take. So, I think these are steps in the right direction. They need to ensure that restructured assets are disclosed to minority shareholders and that is very important because only then can investors assess between the good, bad and the ugly. I am not saying all HFCs are in the same basket, but the point is many HFCs may be hiding behind the easy regulation that NHB has.


What about autos, more pain?
There could be pain but it is a cyclical sector and you make money when you buy at the bottom of the cycle. I have not seen especially two-wheelers trading at 12-13 times PE for a very long time. Our view is that consumer discretionary will improve as we enter into election season and beyond because once the NBFC issues get resolved a lot of them are also funding many of the two-wheelers and discretionary spending in general. 

Our view is this is a good sector to bet now because it is a cyclical stock, you do not buy it at the top of the cycle, you buy when things are really bad and given that India’s penetration, many of these can still improve. There is a scope to play on this. I would look at autos. Everything will not fall in place but two-wheelers look very interesting.


Is not the two-wheeler space very competitive? Bajaj Auto has set the cat amongst the pigeons by saying we do not care about margins, we care about market share. What happens when the dynamics change?
I agree. The company should have done this a long time back. They lost 10% market share in seven, eight years but they will reach a saturation point where they cannot get more because they do not have one entire segment -- which is scooters -- also moving up. Given where the valuations are, things will settle down, even they have to make money at the end of the day for their minority shareholders. 

There is a risk reward play here, if everything was perfect then you would not get these stocks at these valuations. You make a risk reward assessment of the sector and you feel that if I look at the 10-year, 15-year history, these are valuations where it troughs out. That makes the probability of making money high. It could go wrong if they completely go the other way round but that is the risk you take.


What about Maruti? Is the worst in the price?
Yes, I will not comment on individual stocks but if you ask me I am more comfortable with the two-wheelers than passenger vehicles.


When you say two-wheelers, what about others like Eicher? Is the Royal Enfield fad over? Would Eicher have a fair case to bounce back?
That was the issue with autos, especially two-wheelers. We were giving them consumer valuations and not discretionary valuations and once you realise that these are actually cyclical stocks and you cannot give them consumer valuations, you would be fine. 

As the valuations have corrected more to discretionary levels, your risk reward is better. When a consumer discretionary get priced at staples or consumer FMCG valuation that is when you know you have trouble. That is why I said the risk reward is looking better for this pack in general.


Classic investors have always taught me that any stock which gives you a dividend yield of 4.5-5%, becomes an attractive value buy. There are half a dozen stocks in the Nifty which give you this proposition.
Many more actually if you go down the curve.


NTPC, Vedanta, Coal India, Nalco, HPCL, BPCL, would you buy these stocks?
I will not individually comment on this.


PSUs in general, non banking PSUs?
PSUs in general, I would avoid but some of the banking PSUs are looking more interesting.


That is not because of dividend yield you like the business side?
Correct, I like the business side but if I want to play dividend yield. I will also want to see if I have business certainty. Many of the private sector companies where I am seeing dividend yield also have good business prospects. I am getting a combination of both. 

I am only playing for dividend yield and I do not know what the government will do. I would like PSUs for dividend yield but there are many private sector companies which are trading at attractive dividend yields. In fact, we have been suggesting to them that instead dividend they should go for buybacks because that way they structurally reduce the total dividend outflow for the company over a longer period of time. Plus, it is more tax efficient.


That is Rs 10 lakh plus. How many minority shareholders will be getting Rs 10 lakh or dividend?
No, no, it is better for the shareholder also. Forget the Rs 10 lakhs. Even as a normal shareholder you are better off because everything helps, once your shareholding comes down, you have to service that much lesser plus the dividend outflow for the company is reduced for perpetuity."
19,2019-03-07,Eicher,"With prospects of a NDA victory at 2019 general elections brightening, the money waiting in the sidelines is now 
  
  
  getting into the market and we are seeing much better liquidity flows into small and midcap stocks, said Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts:


The ride to 11000 has been great. Broader markets have also participated. Do you think it is only flattering to deceive us or is it going to be more sustainable this time?
The trading range is gradually moving up and that has more do with the fact that recent events which have taken place in the border state has perhaps improved the chances of NDA coming back to power. The money waiting in the sidelines is now getting into the market and we are seeing much better liquidity flows into the broader market -- the small and midcap stocks. 

Maybe this trend could continue for a few more weeks or so but the ultimate test will be when the May election results are out and perhaps even before that when the opinion polls gave a bit of an insight into who the next government is going to be. While we can play this trading rally, one has to be extremely cautious because an adverse election result would dampen the sentiment! There could be a great deal of volatility somewhere in the middle of May when the actual numbers are known. 


How are you playing the banking space as a whole? Also, do you think that Lakshmi Vilas Bank’s deal with Indiabulls would be a win-win for both the parties?
Yes, absolutely. The recent crisis in the NBFC space have made two things extremely clear; one is that you need to have a strong liability franchise. NBFCs with good retail support in terms of deposits or which are part of a bank or are a business group, were largely unaffected in raising resources for lending. That is one trend. 

Secondly, size does matter and bigger the company, the better is it able to manage all the volatility and uncertainties within the industry. For NBFCs, getting merged or getting access to a banking licence is very positive and we have seen many such instances. There has been the Equitas-Ujjivan deal, which after initial teething troubles, has seen numbers turning decent over the last couple of quarters. 

Their prospects going forward are significantly better. Any amalgamation or corporate action between NBFC and a bank will be definitely viewed positively by the street. 

Another example which comes to mind is IDFC First Bank which got merged with Capital First and that also has been doing pretty well these days because of better prospects and the fact that the retail franchise business of Capital First is getting good synergy from the wholesale and the banking platform of IDFC Bank. 

So there are many such examples which have turned out to be quite favourable for investors and any such action between Lakshmi Vilas and Indiabulls will be viewed positively by the street. 


How are you looking at the housing finance sector? Recently, we had NHB planning stronger capital norms for housing finance companies. How do you think all these changes will impact the overall ROE and leverage in coming times? Whatever steps the NHB is taking will be positive for the housing finance companies and the stronger housing finance companies should have no problem in meeting those norms. But it is a sector which is highly competitive and has a fair degree of maturity and until the real estate condition really improves, it is going to be a challenge to grow the volumes for HFCs. 

Nonetheless, there is adequate headroom for growth but growth is likely to be muted going forward, until the housing market picks up. The better way to play the NBFCs would be through consumer finance companies or through vehicle finance companies or pure retail lenders like say microfinance or gold finance.

Those NBFCs would have higher growth rates than housing finance companies and there are many exciting companies within the space like Bajaj Finance which is more consumer-oriented finance or L&T Finance for that matter which has got microfinance as well as equipment finance and other many such other divisions.

Within the gold finance business, there is Mannapuram and Muthoot which have shown good performance in the past two, three quarters and going forward also are quite confident of their growth rate.

Then come a whole host of microfinance companies like Equitus or Ujjivan or AU Small Finance Bank. There are many smaller NBFCs which are focussed on consumer lending other than housing finance and those would offer higher returns for investors than pure play housing finance companies. 


Does it make sense to stick to HDFC Ltd?
Yes. If you want to buy housing finance companies, then HDFC and LIC Housing also merits a mention. LIC Housing came out with a good set of numbers for the December quarter, which was better than what the street was expecting. 

But almost all the so-called retail finance companies, NBFCs have got housing divisions -- be it Bajaj Finance or L&T Finance for that matter and some of the other companies as well. Either they have got it as a division or as a subsidiary company. When you want to play the housing finance story, I still feel it is better to play it through the non HFCs. 

The non pure play HFCs and NBFCs have got several divisions and housing finance is one of them. If you want to buy a pure play HFC, the best two companies still remain HDFC and LIC Housing. They have got a fantastic track record. They have got a good liability franchise, they are able to raise loans at extremely attractive valuations and good brand value in terms of attracting customers for lending as well and excellent risk management systems as well. 


What is your perspective on Bharti and Idea? Are people now willing to bet in on oversold names like Bharti and Idea?
A trading bounce definitely is possible in Idea as well as Bharti. The fact that promoters are reposing so much of faith in the business and investing their own funds even at these levels despite extremely challenging scenario does show that the long-term prospects of the industry are great. But one needs to keep in mind that the way the promoters think and the way the investors think are different. The promoters have a much longer timeframe than the average investor bet it institutional or retail and my sense is that while the long-term prospects may be great for the industry, when there is actual consolidation and gradual increases in the yields for the industry as a whole, from a retail perspective, the next few quarters will remain extremely challenging. You may not get the kind of growth in earnings that the street is expecting.

I would say that if any positive news flow such as right issue announcements would lead to a trading rally, then investors who are stuck in the stock could look at exiting out of these companies depending upon what the news flow is. 

Broadly, I am not that confident of the short or medium-term prospects of the industry and over the longer term, there is too much disruption. There is 5G also which is coming and that will entail more capex for these companies. 

It is easier said than done to try and increase the yields as far as the services which they are offering are concerned. I am not that optimistic on the sector as a whole but still say a trading bounce is likely. Since they have been beaten down, short positions are there within that sector and short covering could lead to a rally but whether you should participate in the rally on the long side is questionable. It is an opportunity to exit out of the stocks rather than build fresh positions. 


What is the outlook when it comes to Tata Motors? It has been an acute underperformer of late. 
This is a great opportunity for investors to exit out of Tata Motors and this view could be wrong only if the company decides to sell off Jaguar Land Rover completely. That would change the dynamics for the company per se but until that event takes place -- and one is not sure that it will take place at all -- the rally in Tata Motors is a great exit opportunity. 

There are far better automobile companies to get into which also have been quite beaten down like say Maruti, Eicher or TVS Motor. Those companies will give a significantly higher return than Tata Motors. Tata Motors has just too much of volatility in their earnings because of JLR and even though the domestic business is a very small portion of the bottom line, there is a fair degree of volatility and they have achieved limited success whether it comes to commercial vehicles or passenger vehicles for that matter. 

Our view on Tata Motors is not positive. This is a perfect opportunity to cut the losses and move on into some of the stronger automobile names which could be auto ancillaries also. Those may give higher returns than Tata Motors over the medium to long term.


What do you like out of the auto ancillaries?
Within the auto ancillaries, Motherson Sumi is looking quite attractive. Here’s the disclosure that we and our clients are invested in it. The valuations are reasonable, the company has been reducing its debt levels and all the capex which has taken place over the past couple of years should start contributing to the top line and bottom line. 

Apart from that, the likes of Minda Corporation and Minda Industries also are quite interesting, given the kind of specific products that they are into and they are also amalgamating their subsidiary and joint venture companies and those should start contributing to the top line and bottom line. 

Apart from that, the tyre companies also are quite interesting at this point of time. We have seen a steep correction over there and raw material prices impacted their earnings over the past couple of quarters or so. As and when these pricing pressure, input cost pressures reduce, you will see good earnings coming back into the tyre companies as well. 

Broadly, these are the two, three companies and the space that we are looking at as far as the auto ancillaries are concerned. Within the OEM space, top picks still remain Maruti and Eicher and TVS Motors. Maruti’s numbers for February were quite interesting and if you exclude the low contribution product -- the compact cars, the UVs -- it had decent growth rates. 

We are seeing a gradual turnaround as far as Maruti’s monthly sales numbers are concerned. Do not get fooled by the overall number for the company but if you go deeper, the products which matter, have got higher margins. Growth has come back over there at least it is high single digit or low double digit."

Analyst calls
• IIFL has retained reduce rating on Eicher Motors with a target price of ₹18,400. The brokerage has cut FY20-21 EPS estimates by 5-6% due to continued weakness in volumes. The cumulative EPS cut in the past six months stands at around 20%, said IIFL.

 • CLSA has maintained outperform rating on Ambuja Cements with a target price of ₹250. Ambuja should benefit from the better pricing environment which should drive strong earnings growth, said CLSA. There is near-term concern on further market share losses, but this should reverse as new capacity comes on-stream in CY20, the brokerage said. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded Maruti Suzuki India to add from buy and reduced fair value to ₹7,500 from Rs 7,600. The domestic passenger vehicle industry is likely to grow in low single digit due to increase in costs related to stricter safety and emission regulations, it said.

26,2019-03-11,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Thanks to healthy buying across the board, stock benchmarks Sensex and Nifty went from strength to strength on Monday morning.

An over 300-point jump in the BSE Sensex is signaling a pre-election rally, experts said.

Market looks optimistic on the improved prospects of Narendra Modi coming back to power in the general elections of 2019. The latest CVoter pre-poll survey for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections has predicted the BJP-led NDA falling just short of the majority mark of 272, potentially winning 264 seats. 

However, analysts advise a stock-specific approach. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 12 stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager, Technical Analysis, YES Securities

On the weekly chart, HDFC Bank has turned upwards after taking support at the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. Further, it is on the verge of a breakout from a triangle pattern neckline placed at Rs 2,160. A close beyond this resistance will trigger a bullish breakout taking it higher to levels of Rs 2,225-2,275.

Godfrey Phillips India| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,060-1,100| Stop loss: Rs 880

On the daily chart, it has broken out from a sideways consolidation on extremely high volumes affirming the bullishness. Moreover, RSI has turned higher from the 40-level indicating that bulls are in control in the stock.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

Bajaj Auto| Buy| Target price: Rs 3,180| Stop loss: Rs 2,870
The stock has indicated a breakout above the Rs 2,945 level on the daily chart and implies further upward thrust in coming days.

Kansai Nerolac Paints| Buy| Target price: Rs 490| Stop loss: Rs 425
The stock has formed a multiple bottom formation pattern near Rs 428 to signify a strong base. It has currently produced a bullish candle to show strength and has the potential to rise further. The RSI also indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy. ""With good volume activity seen in the stock, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 490, keeping a stop loss of Rs 425,"" said Parekh.


Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities

L&T Finance Holdings| Buy| Target price: Rs 157| Stop loss: Rs 131
As per the weekly chart, the stock has witnessed a smart upside bounce in the last week. After a bottom reversal pattern like hammer and doji in the previous two weeks, the stock price has shifted to a sharp upmove last week. Volume has expanded with upmove in the stock price, signalling active participation. Weekly 14 period RSI is indicating a strong upside momentum in the stock. The overall positive chart pattern is showing a long trade set-up for the near term. ""One may look to buy L&T Finance Holdings at the current market price, add more on dips down to Rs 135, hold for the upside target of Rs 157 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 131,"" Shetti said.


InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo)| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,370| Stop loss: Rs 1,170
After showing a downward correction in the last couple of weeks, the stock has shifted to a sharp upmove last week. It has shown a positive sequential movement like higher tops and bottoms, as per the weekly chart, which is signalling strength of an uptrend. Weekly MACD is showing a positive indication, signalling the strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price. 



Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

Jubilant FoodWorks| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,450-1,470| Stop loss: Rs 1,301
The stock has given a breakout from a Triangle pattern on the daily chart. It is a bullish breakout since we have seen prices retreating up after a swift pullback. The RSI is signalling strength in momentum on the upside while the trend strength indicators are also hinting at a short-term upside move.


TVS Motor Company| Buy| Target price: Rs 520-530| Stop loss: Rs 470
A breakout is seen on the daily scale after a long bearish channel on the upside while we have seen a bullish Mat & Hold pattern which indicates the continuation can be seen in prices on the upside. RSI Above 50 is also favouring the upside while a narrow range suggests that we may see expansion in volatility as well. 


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

NTPC| Buy| Target price: Rs 165| Stop loss: Rs 144
This counter appears to have resumed its rally, defying the bearish formations registered in last Thursday’s session. In this process, it also closed above its critical near-term hurdle of Rs 151. 


Eicher Motors| Buy| Target price: Rs 22,905| Stop loss: Rs 21,388
Strong move registered on March 5 from the lows of Rs 19,320–21,877 is clearly hinting at a durable bottom in place around Rs 19,000 level. In that case, on a decisive breakout above Rs 21,965 level, this counter can scale up to much higher levels.

32,2019-03-14,Eicher,"HDFC Mutual Fund’s chief investment officer Prashant Jain has become the first Indian fund manager to complete 25 years managing a single fund. He achieved this in 2019 with HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund which has generated an alpha of 9.54 per cent over the Sensex since 1994, Morningstar Direct data show.

HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund (the erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund), launched in February 1994, is the largest equity-oriented fund in India with assets of Rs 37,395 crore as of February 2019. The fund, now categorised as dynamic asset allocation (equity can be 0 per cent to 100 per cent), in its earlier avatar as HDFC Prudence Fund (a balanced fund). Data from Morningstar Direct show that when compared to other global funds managed by a single fund manager for 25 years and above, Jain’s fund has generated an alpha of 9.54 per cent over the Sensex, second only to legendary Peter Lynch who managed Fidelity Magellan till 1977, generating an alpha of 10.92 per cent.


Anthony Bolton managed Fidelity Special Situations from December 17, 1979 to December 31, 2007 and generated an alpha of 9.2 per cent. HDFC Balanced has returned an annualised 18.48 per cent since inception.

Financial planners point out that one of the main reason for Jain’s success is his ability to identify market cycles ahead of time and ride through cycles. For example, he made the most of the IT-driven rally between 1995 and 2000 by buying Infosys that multiplied 113 times. Between December 2000 and December 2017, Jain was quick to spot the capex/banking and commodity stock rally identifying stocks like BHEL which rose 35x, L&T 33x, Reliance 19x and Tata Steel 16x and SBI 14x. In the next cycle between December 2007 and December 2017, where FMCG and pharma stocks rallied he bought HUL which rose 8x, ITC 5x, Lupin 8x and HDFC Bank 6x.

Currently, Jain is betting on corporate banks, utilities and capex with stocks like Infosys, ICICI Bank, SBI, L&T and NTPC being the top holdings in his portfolio. Jain has had his shares of misses as well. He missed multi-baggers like Kotak Bank, IndusInd Bank, Eicher Motors and Asian Paints. Then there are a number of stocks where he exited early. Though he was quick to spot Shree Cement and made 10 fold returns, he sold off early at Rs 700. Similarly, he sold out Page Industries early on at Rs 7,000.

“Jain has a sharp ability to spot cycles ahead of time. He adopts a long-term approach to stock picking, sticks to his investment mandate and is not worried about underperformance in the short term,” says Himanshu Srivastava, senior research analyst at Morningstar India.

While Jain’s strategy has worked in the long term, it has also tested investor patience in the short term. “The transition years, where he books profits and identifies stocks to ride the next cycle have been the most difficult for Jain, as returns lag those of peers in the short term. However, if you consider block of 3 or 5 years the returns are good,” says Deepak Chhabria, CEO, Axiom Financial Services."

34,2019-03-16,Eicher,"PUNE: A fast growing middle class and burgeoning consumption will bolster growth in the commercial vehicles space in India going forward and the biggest beneficiary will be the light commercial vehicles (LCV) segment, industry stakeholders said.

“Going forward, increase in urbanisation and consumption will lead to shifts in market segments,” said Satyakam Arya, chief executive, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles, while speaking at the ETAuto CV and Logistics Conclave, on Friday. “We are seeing light commercial vehicles segment growing fast for lastmile connectivity.”

Globally, LCVs account for 75% of commercial vehicles sales, said Nitin Seth, president of LCV business at Ashok Leyland. “In India, it is only 62%. So, 62% to 75% is still a long way to go,” he said.

But there are three big challenges the industry needs to overcome to realise this sales potential, said Seth. These are lack of availability of finance due to liquidity crunch at nonbanking finance companies, the upcoming BS-VI emission norms and a lack of drivers.

“With the introduction of BSVI, the cost hike will be much higher than the prediction of 5%-7%. We are trying to cover a 10-year journey (of evolving regulations) in three years. The industry is in for a shock,” he said. Calling the rush to BSVI ‘haphazard’, Arya said by next year India will be the only country to have BS-VI emission norms compliant trucks based on cowl architecture, which is deemed to be less safe than a trailer truck.

In the future, keys to growth will be reducing time taken to bring new models to the market, making vehicle platforms more flexible and dynamic, and staying abreast of the changing needs of the customer, said Rajinder Singh Sachdeva, chief of operations and head of R&D at Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles.

On the technology front, Sachdeva said that electric and autonomous vehicles are an inevitable future.

Speaking about vehicle propulsion technologies of the future, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles’ Arya said the industry will have to be ready with multiple technologies. “LCV will go more towards full electrification,” he said.

As cab aggregating services like Ola and Uber have brought a disruption in the passenger vehicles space, we are seeing the beginning of “uberisation” of the CV industry, said Rajeev Singh, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India. He said another promising technology is predictive analysis that can help manufacturers reliably calculate the life expectancy of different components for different regions, seasons and climates."
35,2019-03-18,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty registered a gap-up start to Monday's session on hopes that the US Fed will sound dovish in its policy meet next week.

39,2019-03-18,Eicher,"Over next three to six months, deploy money in a systemic manner, because risk-reward of investing in Indian 
  
  
  markets are very well in place, said Vikas Khemani, Founder, Carnelian Capital Advisors, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts:



What a comeback by bulls! They have surprised everyone.
If you remember our conversation, one of the things which I had highlighted was that the market will always come back sharply when nobody expects and in that kind of market, the idea is to keep on deploying over a period time because risk reward was very well placed. But obviously nobody can time the catalyst to the turnaround and that is what has happened! 

Two or three things have changed over last couple of weeks. One, the global scenario has changed especially around the Fed turning dovish around the liquidity scenario and is very important from a global sentiment perspective

Second, general election is one of the biggest events ahead of us which most people were worried about. All kinds of speculations were being made. All of us in the market expect continuity of the government or at least there is a greater chance of it.

Third, with the global clue that the interest rate environment has started falling in place, the new RBI Governor has done a great job in calming down the whole system in the aftermath of the IL&FS fiasco. For a long period of time, it was getting worse and worse. In my opinion, the new leadership has done a great job in settling down and these two-three things in my opinion coupled with the flows towards the emerging market, have helped our revival. This kind of environment is always sharp because there are lots of shorts which are waiting to be cut. There is always a little bit of buying, backed by short covering. So this is not the first time that we have seen this. The market environment sentiment has definitely changed and this is a good situation to be.


Would you be in a long only mood in the runup to the election, or has the party just about started or is it time to take 10% chips off the table? 
I do not know how to play in short term in the run-up to elections because I think it is a very binary kind of event. My personal view is that the present government will be coming back to power, but anyway you can never take a call. You can only manage your portfolio at your own risk. I have been long believer that you should deploy money over next three to six months in a systemic manner, because risk-reward of investing in Indian markets are very well in place. 

I do believe the Indian economy is very well on right track. A lot of structural reforms have been done and we will start seeing fruits of that coming through soon. Secondly, if you believe that the India story is good, you remain an optimist and pick up good businesses and stay invested even if it disappoints you short term and you have take a hit or for some macro reasons, markets come back. 

I will continue to believe that India is a great story. We have a much better future ahead of us and we have just begun. Next five to seven years are very good. We had a very bad sort of setback in the recent past that has reset a lot on the basis that it has cleared the froth. The market is much better placed than what it was before. Of course, people have taken a knock on their portfolios and their wealth but there is no point in living in the past. You have to rebase, restart and as I look forward, next four-five years look very interesting.


We are seeing a lot of leadership coming in from banks. What is your stance on the overall growth outlook for banks?
BFSI as a segment accounts for a large part of the market cap. Secondly, it is very very critical for economic growth and I believe it will continue to deliver. You cannot aspire for 7%-9% growth and make money from Indian capital markets and not include banks. That is not possible. It will be a leading sector. 

Also for revival of the credit cycle, banks’ confidence is very important so I think I am glad that markets are reposing faith and banks would lead the rally. There is no doubt on that. Of course it is not only banks, it’s the entire financial segment and in last two-three years, we have seen the market diversifying with BFSI space to many more players and you will continue to see that happening over next five-seven years.

I have no doubt in my mind that being almost 30-35% of the market cap, the banking sector BFSI’s entire basket will do well and even if you take 7-8% growth adjusted for the inflation and shift of market share from PSU to public this sector can grow at 18%-20% growth in a reasonable long period of time. So I think that gives me confidence that this will probably one of the big sector which given what reforms have been done in the past in form of IBC, RERA, GST I think this sector benefits the most from all the reforms which has been done and hence my confidence in the segment would continue to remain very high.


IT has had a solid move it lasted as over a year now but do you think because of the currency move, that trade could get challenged and it is best to take your profits off the table then?
I would say that the risk-reward in moving out has started falling into place. Other sectors like banks, industrials and consumer, would probably outperform over next couple of years for the simple reason that global growth is slowing down. While current outlook and order book of IT companies look good, the market typically tends to look forward. If you start looking forward, the market might start hypothesising a little bit of slowdown on the demand outlook as the global growth slows down. 

That could vary and secondly rupee is also going to create a little bit of impact on the margin. What was working as a tailwind over last two-three years probably could turn little bit of a mild headwind. I would not say that sector is going to do decently well but given the valuations, given the little bit of mild headwinds, you would be better placed in some of the domestic-oriented stories. IT will be more of a defensive portfolio but risk-rewards are definitely shifting in favour of domestic plays.


Would you buy autos in this downturn?
Auto is coming from a significantly high growth background and a very high base. What we are seeing in Maruti and some of the cases is a result of that. The IL&FS crisis added a little bit more to it because of the credit squeeze to this segment.

Auto is a sector which gets impacted more from the availability and cost of capital. Along with the high base, both has impacted the segment and that is the reason you are seeing the reactions you have seen. 

Maruti and Eicher grew very rapidly. That has got corrected. Auto will remain a sector which will do well but when to pick is the question. I would say wait for a few more quarters because the stocks are still not cheap. They are reasonably valued, they are good companies but market’s faith will not come back immediately from revival perspective till the time you see the volume growth coming back.

Probably you will have to wait over the next three, four quarters and pick the right time for the revival to be around the corner. But in CV space, players like Ashok Leyland can do very well. As credit supply eases out and interest rates come down, that segment will get impacted first from positivity perspective then cars.


IOC has gained over 5%, the most since 22nd February. What is fuelling this fire for OMCs?
Honestly, I have not been tracking much of that but the only intelligent guess is maybe this is because of dividend yields which are around the corner. Most of them are high dividend yield story but honestly I have not really tracked in terms of what is driving or fuelling this particular sub segment.


What did you purchase in this downturn that happened in Jan and March? A lot of midcap stocks were down 10-15-20%, what did you buy in that leg of decline?
There are lots of interesting stories in the midcap space. One of the sectors that I have always believed in is building materials. It came down very sharply and you could buy a lot of stocks there which were earlier sought after and corrected almost 40-50% in the last seven, eight months. 

Chemicals as a sector did not correct much but the stocks were available at reasonably good price which have already pushed up. Within the NBFC space, some of the NBFCs which were well capitalised, diversified owned by corporate houses because those business models are very robust and sustainable, remain very interesting plays to look at. 

There is a very wide variety of stocks, sectors you could look at in my opinion in the midcap space. We are looking at some of these three, four sub very aggressively."

41,2019-03-18,Eicher,"The next 200 points could see some volatility or range -bound behaviour, but overall the trend is pretty clearly 
  
  
  on the upside, said Rishi Kohli, CEO, ProAlpha Advisors, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 

We have seen a fantastic runup and the word is that despite the profit-booking or tapering that we have seen in today’s trade, the momentum is building right now. Would you agree?
Yes I do agree. I have been pretty positive on markets while there was a lot of volatility going on and the view was very clear that 11,250 is very much on the cards in the near term and that zone has been broken through with a lot of momentum.

Given that the last 500 points upmove on the Nifty has been pretty much non-stop, obviously there could be a halt for a week or two, especially on the Nifty. If you look at Nifty futures, then 11,550 to 11,650 is a short-term resistance zone and then you have the 793 kind of levels which are the previous highs. 

The next 200 points could see some volatility or range -bound behaviour, but overall the trend is pretty clearly on the upside and while the lower levels were defended in the earlier decline in September-October and the range bound movement after that, it seems very clear that 12,000 is on the cards in a couple of months. That is the overall view for the next few months. Short-term volatility should be taken advantage of that view.


 I am curious about the view on the IT space because you seem to have increased allocation on Tech Mahindra. Since the rupee is moving from strength to strength, is that a worry when it comes to the overall margin?
Overall yes, but the rupee has been depreciating continuously for so long and obviously we had the sharp spike from 72 to almost 75, 74.5 or whatever and from there it has appreciated right now to about 68.5. But I think going below 67.5-68, will be very difficult for the rupee. At best it will remain in a sort of range between 68 and 70-71 zone and from there, over the next few years, there would be a depreciation because that is related more to macro.

I do not think there is any case for a very sharp appreciation which is long-term in nature. There can be short-term movements here and there. From that perspective, I am not worried and coming to Tech Mahindra specifically, there is technically a very strong long-term cup and handle formation which looks to be on the verge of a break-out, which with the break to new highs will get confirmed. That has happened in the last one month and the minor decline seen after the strong breakout has taken support at previous highs. 

It is very copy-book pattern and giving a target of 1100 which even from a fundamental perspective PEs and all, looks like a reasonable target. Otherwise, business has been doing well.

Earlier bottoming out of the telecom sector and other things that we have spoken of in the past seems to be happening in line with expectations. Given that the fundamental picture is in line with expectations, rupee in the long run will not be a worry for this stock. The technical strong picture seems to have a target of 1100 and that could happen in like six to nine months. A 30-35% upside is clearly warranted in the portfolio.


What is your take on auto? On one hand we have had so much to talk about the consumption story but in the immediate term, it still looks like that pressure is really mounting on some of the auto majors?
Yes, and that has been the case over last year. Almost the entire auto segment has been weak and whether it is two-wheelers or four-wheelers, everything has been underperforming. I have had Eicher in the portfolio and we have discussed multiple times on this show if that looks interesting or not and why.

The last time around, it was hovering around Rs 20,000 levels and I was clear that let it be short term for now because obviously it looks like some things can get extended but a bounce from Rs 20,000 to Rs 24,000 looked to be on the cards. I had held on to it for that. 

It did bounce up to around 23,000 levels and then consolidated between 22,000 and 23,000. I do feel that 24000 will come and then either some trimming or some rebalancing can happen. So that is regarding the portfolio, but otherwise I think stocks like Maruti, Tata Motors, Mahindra still need some time to recover. 

But having said that, the downsides from here on seem limited so in a staggered way, one could enter it from a medium to long-term perspective. One interesting stock in that segment is Bajaj Auto. It was doing nothing for a long time and recently at least on the technical long term charts, it started turning around and broken out of long-term resistance trendlines. That is one I would focus on.


The plans to buy this large stake in MindTree to a certain extent has led to a fall in the value of the software services arm of L&T. CCD is also in focus. The latest news says the co-founder has said this is going to be a hostile bid which he wants to prevent. What is your outlook on the news flow so far?
The news is pretty much out there. The synergies was discussed apparently but I would still go with Mindtree because the stock per se is fundamentally good. In such kind of a hostile takeover situation, the minority shareholders will gain because if it gets messy, then both sides will bid higher to protect their stake. This is a very simplistic analysis but I have seen in many cases in the past even globally how that works. Given the underlying positivity on the fundamental side, there is no downside on that approach. I would go with that view and hold the stock.


Let us talk about OMCs. Would you add them to your basket?
Yes, I would. Last month’s move was very strong after the decline. On any dips from here on, I would get into it. The medium term signals have gone into positive from negative. From a six-nine month view, I would be long that but I would wait for a slightly lower levels to get into some of them."

47,2019-03-19,Eicher,"Waiting for a relief rally in a bear market to sell the stocks you own and waiting for a correction to buy the stocks 
  
  
  you want to buy in a very strong bull market does not pay off, said Amit Jeswani, CIO, Stallion Asset, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 


Sanjay Dutt from Quantum Securities believes that Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Capital among ADA Group companies still have fundamental value. Would you go with any of the ADAG names?
You play Reliance Capital, Reliance Home when the bull market is at the end phase. We are at the start of a major rally and you want to be in quality stocks that will grow at 25-30%. You need certainty of returns now. Typically, play these low-quality stocks when you are at the last phase of the bull market. Now is the time to be with leaders, strong growth companies, good ROCE and so we are positioned that way.


Where do you see that leadership within the banking space?
Banking and consumer are the two sectors. ICICI Bank had 10% NPA till last year, even then this stock is hitting life-time high. Financials and consumers are one space which keeps getting better with size. There are times when you want to be long on gold finance companies, We are very bullish on microfinance as a space right now. We have been adding stocks out there like small SFBs. A lot of stocks in financials look good. Axis Bank is there. 

Private financial space gives you beta and consumer stocks would not lose money if the market goes down. So if anyone has a portfolio of private financials and consumers, the financials will do very well in a bull market. In a bear market, the consumer stocks will save you. A typical portfolio of these two sectors would do extremely well throughout market cycles. 

The horses keep changing in financials. In the 2013-2017 bull market, it was the housing companies (HFCs). This time, it is going to be private financials again. At some point of time, PSUs will also join the rally. We do not have any positions in government stocks. We do not buy government stocks but it looks like that stage is getting built up because NBFCs are not able to grow and NBFCs are 25% of the market. 

Some delta trade can happen in PSU banks but you have to have Kotaks, HDFCs in your portfolio. There is a large opportunity size and these guys are getting better with size. Only a few business models get better with size. Most companies, including construction companies, airline companies, steel companies get worse with size but a financial services company like HDFC or Kotak or those kind of stocks get better with size, as does Bajaj Finance. We always have those kind of stocks in our core portfolio. 


We are seeing a big roar in Union Bank, PNB, Bank of India. You have already said the rally is going to spread to PSBs. Are they worth investing in?
Humans imagine and markets discount. Today everyone wants to buy on dip, but the dip is not coming. Waiting for a relief rally in a bear market to sell the stocks you own and waiting for a correction to buy the stocks you want to buy in a very strong bull market does not pay off really well. 

Markets have now started discounting and till the end of May, they will keep going higher. The stocks will keep churning. Now the rupee has given a breakdown below the 69 level. So, the rally will slowly move towards smallcaps and midcaps which can go up 10% next month. That is how strong this wave will be. It is going to go from extreme oversold to extreme overbought. As long as the rupee stays below 69.20, that is the whole idea here. 

All the small banks, PSUs, kachra stocks can do well for the next month or two. It might be a buy on rumour and sell on news kind of a market. 

So, by May, you have to go back to your top 20-30 stocks you can do all the kind of trading you want to in this kind of bull market, but after May, markets are going to chase quality, growth and the same things; high ROE, leadership.

These two months you can trade PSU banks, Bank of India, PNB whatever but after that you have to get back to your HDFCs and your Kotaks and the quality names where you can make and retain money. 

A lot of smallcap investors made money 2017 but they had to give it back. Money does not get retained in smallcaps. You have to trade them in and out. After May we will get back to your Dow Jones, your MSCI emerging markets and all those things. Till that time, it is a very strong rally and let us just enjoy this rally. 


You have been fairly bullish on sectors like steel, real estate in the past. We are starting to see a resurgence in some of these extremely beaten down pockets of the market. Are you still bullish on these trends?
Absolutely. Real estate is an extreme long-term trade for us. Right now, Godrej is like Rs 1,000-1,500 crore a month sales and this is a downcycle. You need to buy the leaders here, I am not bullish on real estate overall, 90% of builders will go bankrupt but the 10% builders become really large. I am just giving you an example, we might have vested interest. 

Godrej Properties is doing Rs 1,000-1,500 crore of sales in a down market. When the up market comes, these companies can actually scale up to a lot larger companies and it is a negative working capital cycle business and brand is the thing that is working now. So a Mohan Builder or Shyam Builder, Ram Builder those builders cannot pre-sell, it is going to be the Godrej kind of companies that will pre sell. Godrej knows how to create market cap. They created Rs 70,000-80,000 crore market cap out of killing mosquitoes on Godrej Consumer. 

They are into hair care and all other things as well, but Godrej knows how to scale up a business. Those are the companies you want to bet for long term and this will do extremely well for the next three, four, five, 10 years. It is a very long-term trade in real estate, but we are very bullish on it. 


There has been a lot of debate on whether or not certain names in the market are underperforming versus whether or not earnings growth can genuinely catch up in the runup to elections. Which side of the fence would you sit on?
I am very bullish till elections and after that, the same old 20-25 stocks will do well. The high growth, high return on equity leaders are the stocks you buy. Other stocks do not make you money. 


Do you have any contra bet or a space that you like for the long haul? It could be agri, fertiliser, tea companies or something like that?
We have nothing like that in our portfolio. We are looking at auto again. The markets are pricing auto according to growth rate. Let us take Hero Honda. Hero Honda will grow at 5% and markets have priced Hero Honda at let us say 15 PE multiple. Markets were expecting Maruti to grow at 15% and were pricing it at 33 PE multiple. 

Of course, in the last few months, growth has been extremely poor. In fact, they are de-growing at 8-10%. At some point of time, these stocks will have to come to like 20 PE or something like. At 20 PE, the expected sustainable growth rate for the market for Maruti or an Eicher Motor would be somewhere around 8-9%. Basically, those are the kind of bets we can look at if I want to be a contrarian. But we are actually not contrarian. We buy companies that are growing fast and showing good price action. For now, we are buying financials and consumer and some real estate. We already have some infrastructure but we do not recommend that. But those are the four broad sectors that we are invested in.

After election, you want to be more into quality and not into the midcaps because we will start following the MSCI EM again. Look at the price action in Reliance. There is 30-40% growth in Reliance. The stock is hitting new highs. The management knows how to scale up a business. They are growing retail business at 100%. Jio is growing extremely fast and it is a next gen business. 

These companies can be leaders of the bull market and they might do 30-35% kind of compounding. Let us see how we play but for now, I am going to come back to your show and tell you if I am going to select a sector. But for now, it is just consumers and financials. 


Where exactly are you seeing the market headed in terms of the election? Do you have any particular targets in mind?
Till the time, rupee is below 69, you might see a surprise 66 kind of move towards the dollar. Basically, the dollar will hedge towards 66. It is going to be very fast. It is basically a repeat of what happened in 2014. What are the sectors to buy? It is going to be the same stocks. You look at stocks which are going to grow at 30% plus. There are only 30-40 names and good quality management which will grow at 20-30%.

The FIIs love financials and I do not know why but 75% of FII investments are there in financials and the FIIs are the biggest buyers. Financials might do well in the run-up to the elections. After that, we might see what to do but for now it is the same old things."

The firm has estimated Aster’s GCC EBITDA to double in five years despite the current macro weakness in the region. 

• CLSA has a buy rating on Sadbhav Engineering with a target price of Rs 340. While the stock is up 45 per cent in the last one month led by risk on rally, CLSA sees more legs to the stock. One of the key catalysts is potential divestiture of 9/11 of 12 operating NHs in favour of a global strategic investor, said CLSA.

53,2019-03-26,Eicher,"In an interview with ETNOW, Nitin Raheja, Co-Founder, AQF Advisors says there is value in financials., city gas
  
  
  distribution companies, chemicals and auto companies.Edited excerpts:


Would you be willing to put your penny on Jet Airways just yet?
No, absolutely not. Overall external environment is so uncertain, you are entering the election phase and you are seeing the US growth rates slowing. At such point of time, we would rather stick to stories where business models are well defined. There is visibility on earnings. We would just not want to play stocks which are more like a punt in terms of it could go either way.


When we are looking at the markets right now and looking at the upmove building again. Where would you find value? What are the segments that you are looking at?
We like the financial space because post the scare that we saw in the September-October last year, things have started to stabilise. Liquidity post the swap programmes that the RBI inculcated was just one of the measures that the government and the RBI are taking to bring liquidity back into the markets. Financials continue to look good and we are seeing that the demand for credit has outstripped deposit growth. 

That tells you there is healthy demand on the ground. That is one space that we are fairly confident about. We like the city gas distribution space. Those businesses have huge visibility as far as earnings grow. We like the chemical space. Chemical companies, after seeing a sharp runup, saw a fair bit of correction, came back and now they are starting to pick themselves up again. 

These companies have a good deal of visibility. We see a lot of value in the auto sector. It is a contrarian bet. Right now, the last two months’ figures have not been great. There has been inventory build up. But if you are talking of the economy starting to rebound, post elections, a lot of auto companies are trading at extremely attractive valuations. From a longer term perspective, that is another area where we would look at.


Where within autos do you find value? Is it going to be the beaten-down ones like an Eicher or a Maruti or something like Bajaj Auto where you have protection because 30% of revenue is coming in from exports?
We like the two-wheeler space and within that, it is again stock specific. Bajaj probably stands out there. We like the passenger vehicle cum UV space. We think valuations of something like Mahindra & Mahindra are very attractive, trading close to historic lows. 

They have had a good rollout in terms of new models which have seen a good amount of demand. Again it is function of where these companies are getting valuation because ultimately in the market, value of a stock acts also as one of your biggest safety nets. You might not have immediate quarter visibility on growth but clearly if you are buying them close to historic valuations and the economy upcycle with interest rates getting cut, start showing strength in the next three-six months, these are the stocks where you are going to make money.


In the larger energy basket, we have got a variety of different trades going on. Would you be looking at any play basis on what we are seeing on crude or the currency or any of these factors that would affect what you are looking at in the market?
I have no view in terms of where crude is going to go. It is all over the place. It is an egg on the face for analysts on both sides, just the sharp moves that we have seen in last six months as far as crude is concerned or even the currency is concerned. 

As I mentioned, in such an uncertain environment and also in an industry which is so heavily regulated, we do not really like the OMCs as such. If you were to play the energy space, city gas distribution companies is where we are more comfortable. It is more of a quasi B2C play. It is a play where the environmental norms are pushing you towards cleaner fuels and there is a government push in terms of just the sheer number of areas that are being thrown open there.


Looking at areas that have been beaten down in the market, would metal stocks be a pocket? Any select names there?
Steel seems to be panning out well. If I go by the reports that we keep hearing and some anecdotal evidence when talking to managements, it seems if you take the next couple of years, you are going to see a demand-supply tightening in that space. Again, we would like the companies which have access to iron ore because that is the space where we are seeing a tightening of supply. So, integrated companies as far as steel is concerned. 

For the rest of the metal pack, we are looking for companies with high visibility. A lot of these metal pack companies are difficult to play because of the way prices have yo-yoed through the year. We are not traders, but are investors with a longer-term tenure and I believe these companies do not give us that amount of visibility.


What is the sense that you are getting on the currency math and how do you see margins for some of the IT companies shape up? Do you have any favourites?
The short-term price movement of IT companies is high correlated to the way the rupee behaves. The strength that we have seen in the rupee in the short term is of course, affecting the prices. But from a business point, almost all the IT companies are finding good visibility as far as their business is concerned.

The whole move is towards digital and every single company that you talk about talks to you about what percentage of their revenue and order book is coming from digital. 

Clearly, there is an opportunity out there from a longer-term perspective. These are quality businesses. They throw out cash and they have been among the businesses at the forefront of buybacks in recent years. Whether you take an Infosys, a Wipro, a TCS or a Tech Mahindra, all these businesses have been throwing out cash and continue to have robust economics. 

As far as the rupee is concerned, as long as you are going to have a trade deficit, you are going to have an inflation difference and long-term depreciation of the rupee will continue in the range of 3-5%. 
Short-term, I do not know where the rupee will go given the way things have been in the last six months but longer term, the trend of the rupee is clearly towards depreciating and annualised at that rate although in lumps, the business has visibility. IT is a good place to be. Companies which are on the telecom side such as Tech Mahindra will benefit completely from the 5G rollout and that should add to visibility.


What are your thoughts on the media space? Do you sense a scenario similar to telecom space could play out for media and OTT players as well?
There is a huge disruption that is happening as far as the cable guys or even the satellite guys are concerned with the advent of OTT and broadband coming in. It is great from the consumer perspective, not so great from an investor perspective. 

Whenever the scenario is murky, it is very difficult for you to make money. Where regulations are changing, it is like shifting sands. If you were to be in the media space this year, print media is where you should be. All the print media companies so far have not seen the huge move away from print media to electronic media in terms of internet. Their businesses are generating cash at the present moment, also this year being an election year, should be good for these companies in terms of ad spend that will come their way. The next couple of quarters should be good for print media companies."

58,2019-03-28,Eicher,"If you are a long-term patient investor, autos, consumer oriented stocks, even FMCG, appliances are great contra 
  
  
  bets at this point of time, said Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

The Bank Nifty managed to close above 30,000 for the first time ever and from the January lows, has recovered nearly 15%. Is this kind of momentum here to stay? How are you looking at the overall credit growth backdrop? Also, what do you think is driving so much optimism in banks?
Banks have always been the leaders in this bull market so far and now that they have resumed their upswing, we can expect the broader indices also to move up. The underlying forces behind banks is that going forward, the entire industry will face lower credit cost. Some of the PSU and corporate banks may have writebacks of interest or write-backs of provisions as many of the NPA cases get resolved, that is the first reason. 

Second, they are sensitive to interest rates and as interest rates start to move lower liquidity improves, their volumes also tend to go up and that also should drive earnings going forward. 

Lastly, it is one sector where we are seeing a structural and secular growth momentum for the past several years and given the headroom for growth, given how under-banked India is and the demand for credit especially at retail and low- ticket loans, there is considerable growth opportunity for most of the banks, especially the ones which are well capitalised have managed their NPAs better, have good lending practices and have a nice distribution and brand. 

There are many positive factors going for banks and NBFCs and this trend should continue and they would remain leaders over the next few years as far as any bull market is concerned. 


You are not really a fan of aviation. Would you look at Jet right now amidst all this turmoil?
There is an opportunity for Jet shareholders. If the banks are able to get a strong strategic investor in the company, then there is a potential to turn around Jet Airways. It still has a very strong brand. It has got all the slots at the various airports, it has got the aircraft, it has got all the ingredients required to run a successful aviation company. Some amount of mis-management and lack of control over costs have resulted in the mess that Jet Airways is. 

And if a strategic investor is able to bring discipline into the operations of the company and reduce debt, then even at these levels, Jet may be quite attractive as a solid turnaround story. We already have witnessed one turnaround story in the aviation industry in case of SpiceJet after the change of owners.The kind of wealth that company has created, makes one optimistic about Jet Airways and also positive on the aviation sector.

But one should expect volatility in their earnings depending on the competitive intensity and fuel prices. One thing is certain that a certain amount of pricing discipline has come back to the sector and airlines are not just chasing volumes. They are having a very sharp look at the yields as well and that will augur very well for the sector. 

I am not too concerned about the single digit passenger growth because end of the day, the yields are 40-50% higher than what they were a year ago and that should certainly give a big boost to the profitability of the entire sector. 


What would you look at within autos?There is another downgrade on Tata Motors coming from S&P with regards to JLR. Would you bet on indigenous players or would you rather hedge with a player like Bajaj Auto whose revenue has 30% export content?
I would like to go with the leaders and in the auto industry. Maruti has been the leader. They have an exceptionally high market share and as and when the passenger vehicle growth starts to pick up, you will see Maruti stock also doing pretty well. 

There are issues with discounting and high level of inventories but then the industry has gone through much in the past and came out only stronger. What is plaguing Maruti at this point of time is new model launches and that certainly will be addressed over the next few quarters or so. Having said that, another company which comes to mind within the two-wheeler space is Eicher Motors see. 

The best returns are given by Bajaj Auto. If you had bought it when it was really down and out and losing market share and was not able to display strong monthly sales figures, you would have got it comparatively cheap. Then the management took action and you are seeing the result at this point of time. A similar story will play out in Eicher Motors as well where because of declining or flat monthly sales and perhaps a poor quarterly performance, the stock is available at these levels but as and when sales pick up and management will take necessary action -- be it is exports or domestic or new product launches -- and you will see turnaround in the performance of this company as well. 

As I said, in the case of consumer-oriented or consumer-focussed companies, it is better to buy these companies when they are really down and out and where sales are flagging and there are certain industry or stock specific issues because as and when those get addressed, you see a great alpha as far as their profitability is concerned. 

Bajaj Auto has already delivered great returns and from this point forward one could not expect exceptional returns but except say an Eicher Motors or a TVS Motors, over a two-three year period, provide outperformance versus the sector as a whole and perhaps even Bajaj Auto.


Some consumer staple companies and auto companies are telling us that the demand trend in the next coming months will be south bound. What does that mean for a) staples and b) autos?
There are many great companies in the sector. They have been great wealth creators in the past be it in auto, be it in staples, appliances or typically consumer facing companies. There are many great companies over there and they have very strong moats around their business as well. 

It is just that there is a mild cyclical slowdown within the sector and it is not going to last forever and conventional wisdom is that you buy stocks when they are down, when there are specific company or industry related issues which are transient in nature and that is the reason why these stocks are available at a lower valuation and attractive price levels, there is a certain amount of margin of safety built in. 

If you just hold on to these companies for two, three years or so these demand adjustments take place, pent up demand comes into play, base effect comes into play, consumer spending also does come back and eventually you will see that these companies again starting to report exceptionally good earnings and that is when the stock prices start to skyrocket because essentially there is a scarcity of their equity considering that these are low capital intensive businesses and there is not much dilution of equity. 

If you are a long-term patient investor, autos, consumer oriented stocks, even FMCG, appliances are great contra bets at this point of time and end of the day there is not much downside for these companies. The entire India story and the demographics and the consumption trends, will come back eventually and when they come back into that high single, low double digit, you will see even operating leverages come into play for these companies.

I would not be too negative over the longer term. But that is easier said than done. You may have to see disappointing quarterly numbers and maybe somewhat flat to declining stock prices as well. If you hold on to them for a longer period of time, these could be great stories in terms of delivering exceptional index beating returns as well. 


How are you reading into the overall consumption theme as a whole? You seem to be fairly bullish on the sector. You also like infrastructure. What makes you optimistic here?
After many years, we are seeing all construction companies, especially infrastructure construction companies with bulging order book position. What is more impressive is these order books are at healthy margin of profit and some of the mistakes that these companies made in the past have been addressed. Whatever order book they are sitting on just now will be margin accretive and there is a high degree of visibility as far as their billings are concerned. The next two-three years could be great for these companies starting from L&T to Dilip Buildcon and most of the other smaller companies like NCC.

The next two-three years could see 15% to 35% earnings growth and that means these stocks will always remain in focus and would be favoured by the investors, so they could have some amount of outperformance over there. 

Whichever new government comes into play they will certainly keep the momentum going as far as infrastructure is concerned. Thus medium to long term prospects are also good for the companies. Coming to the consumption theme, one needs to have a slightly differentiated strategy and look for specific pockets of growth like media, entertainment, aviation and also appliance companies are doing quite well, as are liquor companies after some disruption.

As far as elections are concerned, there are still enough pockets of outperformance within the consumption space. Considering that is a very wide sector, investors need to have select exposure within the overall consumption basket and that access is a good hedge towards any kind of disruption in the markets considering that these have been greatly placed as far as safety is concerned.


Is there money to be made in cement?
There is no money to be lost in cement either. These are mature businesses with restricted type of growth rates going forward. There is price discipline but there are also cost increases and there are pockets in the country where, from time to time, companies will make a good sales and profitability but the long-term trends have to be in the low to high single digit, irrespective of whether real estate or infrastructure does well. 

Capacity utilisation is at fair levels and valuations for cement companies are on the higher side. The entire cement picture appears to be quite cloudy on a long-term basis. But in short term, from time to time, you could see a good trading bounce taking place in select cement companies. UltraTech is still awaiting corporate action as far as merger of Century Cement business is concerned and that could provide a fillip to the earnings of the company.

So, there could be select opportunities within the cement space but broadly I do not want to be overweight in cement at this point of time, given that the long-term growth trends are in low to high single digits. Typically, when you are looking to buy into businesses, you are looking for at least 15% earnings growth over a long-term trajectory. That does not seem to be possible in cement companies."

59,2019-03-29,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: In 2019, the shock absorbers of India’s two-wheeler industry have been tested on rather rough roads, but Bajaj Auto has held firm – at least until now. But that outperformance may not sustain in a business climate that doesn’t look too promising for bikes, and investors in the stock shouldn’t expect outsized returns relative to Bajaj Auto’s peers.

It’s true that Bajaj Auto has returned 8 per cent since the beginning of the year. By contrast, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motor and Eicher Motor have posted negative 8-18 per cent returns. And that’s where the positive divergence begins to look rather shaky.

Bajaj Auto is trading at a premium compared with its long-term average, although industry growth is moderating. It is the only company in the listed two-wheelers space trading at a premium - at 17.4 times FY20 projected earnings compared with 16.4 times of the five-year average. The industry has seen flat growth in the past two months, compared with 14 per cent growth in the first nine months of FY19. Inventory levels reached 80-90 days in February compared with the normal metric of 30-45 days.

Bloomberg

Bajaj Auto’s domestic motorcycle growth rate plunged in January and February, compared with 34.3 per cent in the first nine months of FY19. The entry-level segment—more than 75cc and less than 125 cc bikes—has given significant market share gains. This segment has seen moderate growth.

The Street has been ascribing higher multiples to Bajaj Auto following its aggressive pricing strategy to gain market share. The Street was expecting that the company’s pricing stance would hurt the margins of Hero Moto-Corp more than of Bajaj Auto as the entry-level segment constitutes 15 per cent of the total domestic volumes of the Pune company, compared with 60 per cent at Hero. Still, the margins at Bajaj Auto continue to be under pressure. Operating margins fell 370 basis points YoY to 15.6 per cent in December quarter, the lowest in about nine years.

Analysts are penciling in volume growth of 6-7 per cent for the next fiscal year, compared with an expectation of 25 per cent in the current fiscal for the domestic market business of Bajaj Auto.

The pressure on margins could increase due to the inability to pass on the entire cost of regulatory changes effective April 2019. The government has mandated putting Anti-Braking System (ABS) in all bikes above 125 cc from April, and this feature is likely to increase unit prices by .Rs 5,000-6,000.

Bikes more than 125 cc constituted more than 40 per cent of the domestic sales at Bajaj Auto. Therefore, the impact of increased vehicle prices due to ABS is likely to be more on Bajaj Auto than on its peers. According to Bloomberg, consensus EBITDA margins for FY19 and FY20 are 16.6 per cent and 16.8 per cent, respectively. Hence, mounting margin pressure could result in profitability slippages."

62,2019-03-30,Eicher,"Global funds are making a beeline for India big time. Their growing interest, along with expectations of Narendra Modi taking power again and forecast of plentiful rains ahead, gave the bulls enough will power to stay in-charge for the sixth straight week on Dalal Street. 

The Sensex rose 1.33 per cent, or 508 points, to 38,673 for the week to March 30. NSE's Nifty jumped 1.46 per cent, or 167 points, to 11,624. 

The finance ministry said liquidity in the economy is comfortable and will improve further with the central bank’s move to infuse Rs 35,000 crore through the rupee-dollar swap auction. That was good enough to stoke investment appetite.

“Hopes of a stable government took the Sensex higher by almost 8 per cent this month. Buying has been mainly led by FIIs who have put in around Rs 45,000 core into domestic markets. We believe that any rate cuts in developed markets such as the US or Europe may result in steady inflows for emerging markets (EMs),” said Hemang Jani, Head-Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

All eyes are on national elections starting next month, which will keep domestic markets volatile in the short term. The results are due on May 23. 

In the long term, corporate earnings growth and revival in private capex remain crucial for further market upside, say experts.

2,2019-04-01,Eicher,"SBI Caps Securities chooses to give a wide berth to the two-wheeler space even as auto sales numbers for March trickle in. 

The industry continues to battle headwinds, given structural weakness coupled with a lot of regulatory issues concerning safety and emission norms.

“We have been recommending a cautious view on the two-wheeler space, especially with a negative view on Eicher Motors and TVS,” Chirag Jain, auto analyst at SBI Caps, told ETNow.

Jain said the brokerage still keeps a buy on Maruti Suzuki India.

Maruti saw a 1.6 per cent decline in total sales at 1,58,076 units for March. While domestic sales fell a paltry 0.7 per cent at 147,613 units, exports saw a sharp decline of 12.9 per cent at 10,463 units.

“Clearly, the numbers have been on expected lines for Maruti for this month. I think the slowdown in demand has been fairly known and accepted. What needs to be seen is obviously recovery. Our dealer checks indicate that the consumer intent remains quite strong with respect to consumer enquiries, which still is in the positive zone,” Jain said.

“Even the used car market is growing quite strongly. So, there is definitely an interest to buy cars. It is just that there are multiple uncertainties, especially ahead of elections. There are liquidity issues and stuff like that, which are delaying car demand. So, it is just a matter of time when there is clarity with respect to macroeconomic environment,” added Jain. 

Once the elections are out of the way, there could be recovery in demand, but near-term demand is quite weak, according to Jain. 

Maruti's franchise value keeps the stock going and it's the weakness in macros that's impacting the volume growth, he said.

On Tata Motors, Jain said the commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) segments are under stress as well. 

“It is more about how the JLR performance pans out, and as far as domestic (sales) are concerned yes, the expectations are by and large flat growth. No major volumes, but yes more than that I think how the retail performance pans out in the last few months and especially March is something that needs to be seen rather than just the wholesale numbers,” said Jain.

On tractor sales, it is almost a third year of upcycle running. Despite the strong first half, last couple of quarters have been a disappointment. 

“There are certain players like Escorts which are still doing well and mainly because they are largely present in the northern and central parts of the market, which are growing ahead of the entire industry. By and large, even on the tractor front, we have seen momentum slowing, probably because obviously it is a cyclical industry,” said Jain."

0,2019-04-01,Eicher,"The much vaunted consumption engine driving India’s economic growth is showing signs of wear and tear. After years of healthy growth, weak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a slowdown. 

Is this a temporary blip or is the consumption theme losing steam? Should investors recalibrate exposure to consumer stocks?


Not firing on all cylinders
Initial signs of fatigue have been visible in the automobile sector for the past few months. Starting from a lacklustre festival season in October last year, volumes have been tepid across segments. Sales in February dropped 8% from a year ago. This resulted in a pile up of inventory, forcing vehicle makers to cut down on production. Passenger vehicle inventory has grown to around 50-60 days, against the norm of 25-30 days. Even Maruti Suzuki, the largest passenger vehicle maker, has not been immune to the slowing demand. Reports say it has cut its monthly output by 20% to clear the backlog.

Two-wheeler makers are also feeling the heat, with sales falling 7.97% in February. Premium motorcycle manufacturer Royal Enfield saw a massive 14.3% drop in domestic sales compared to figures a year ago. Inventory levels in two-wheelers now stand at around 80-90 days compared to 20-25 days earlier. Hero MotoCorp, Honda and Eicher Motors have also cut production in response to the rising stockpile. Higher cost of vehicle ownership is one of the factors holding back consumers. Higher insurance outgo due to mandatory upfront payment of premium for a five-year policy has led to a sharp jump in the on-road purchase price of two-wheelers.

Apart from automobiles, other consumer durable makers are also witnessing a pullback in demand. Delayed onset of summer has impacted sales of cooling appliances such as refrigerators and air-conditioners. This has prompted several appliance makers to slash prices by up to 20%, according to a report by DBS-Emkay.

February saw a steep decline in auto volumes

Higher cost of ownership is one of the factors holding back consumers.


Consumer staples firms have so far reported healthy volumes, but this too may moderate in the near future. While Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Dabur have posted strong volume growth in recent quarters, this is attributed to a favourable base effect—volumes had dropped sharply after introduction of GST a year ago. A CLSA report suggests that the growth rate for consumer staples firms should moderate to high single digits from double digits in the last five quarters. “This is visible in rural as well as urban markets. In fact rural, which was growing at over 1.3 times of urban, has seen a contraction in multiplier due to a weak macro environment including moderation in GDP growth and wage inflation,” the CLSA report points out.


What should investors do?
Does this signal a pull-back in India’s consumption story? Not quite, say analysts. There is a sense that consumers are postponing big-ticket consumption till after the elections. The tepid growth in durables can also largely be attributed to the liquidity crisis in NBFCs. These lenders have been unable to advance loans at the same pace or at earlier interest rates due to higher funding costs. 

Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, says, “The liquidity crunch in NBFCs may have precipitated this demand slowdown as many have had to cut back lending activity sharply.” Once these shadow banks resume lending, discretionary consumption will revert to the earlier trajectory. Although surprised at the demand slump, Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital, rules out any secular decline in the consumption story. He insists that the current weakness suggests a lot of pent-up demand is likely to translate into sales in the coming months. “Sales not coming through now will definitely show up in the coming quarters, which will give a bump to revenues,” Gupta points out.

The consumption theme is likely to remain a dominant play in coming years. However, investors may feel the pinch in the near term. Analysts expect the weakness in automobile volumes to persist till the elections. “The 2019-20 fiscal could be a challenging year for the sector due to transition to BS-6 norms,” says a Kotak Securities note. 

Motilal Oswal Securities prefers passenger vehicles over two-wheelers or commercial vehicles as it is the least impacted segment currently. Maruti Suzuki is its preferred pick. “We estimate Maruti Suzuki will gain more market share led by strong product lifecycle,” says the report. Its alliance with Toyota addresses the company’s long-term sustainability issues by getting access to electric vehicles and hybrid technologies of Toyota.

Kotak Securities expects two-wheeler industry volumes to be subdued over the next two years. This is due to increase in vehicle prices post increase in insurance costs and a weaker consumer sentiment. In this segment, analysts are positive on Bajaj Auto which benefits from 40% exposure to export markets. Bajaj Auto was the only two-wheeler maker to clock healthy volume growth of 10% in February. Baliga expects demand for low-value items to pick up before elections and hence prefers consumer staples over discretionary. HUL, Nestle and Dabur are among his preferred picks for their reach and distribution."

8,2019-04-02,Eicher,"Entire growth in earnings in next two years will largely be driven by banking where we are expecting 36% CAGR, said Pankaj Pandey, HoR, ICICIdirect.com, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 
  
  
  


Do you think that one should really not get carried away with the kind of might that we are seeing in the markets and is it time to go with a bit of caution?
If you look at both the domestic as well as global setup, it remains quite conducive for the overall markets to sustain higher levels. For the next two years, we expect earnings CAGR of about 21 odd per cent. In FY21, our Nifty target is 13,450. This entire growth in earnings will largely be driven by banking wherein we are expecting 36% CAGR growth because of the lower base. 

Then there will be other sectors which will deliver low double digit to higher double digit growth. The overall setup remains quite positive. 

One of the factors which were missing earlier was liquidity. In March alone, we have seen inflow of about Rs 32,000 odd crore from FIIs and the global setup remains conducive for the inflows to sustain and with a stable government probably for the next five years, we would expect markets to be far better than what we have seen in the last five years.

A good part of the last five years went in addressing the banking challenges and that had impact on the overall economy. But with all that behind us, we expect that with a stable government, next four-five years will be pretty good for the markets. 


Whatever we may decipher in the short term -- be it election, earnings, stock picking, sectors, themes -- everything is irrelevant the minute you look at the market graph. Markets have climbed the wall of worry.
You are right. Timing the market is extremely challenging given the fact that in the last one and a half months, we have seen a 10% rally. For us, crude is one of the biggest macroeconomic variables and last year you have seen a sharp runup in crude right from $60 to $87 odd till the month of October and that sort of impacted the currency. The trade deficit had gone up and as a result of that, RBI had to hike rates. 

But going forward, the setup looks quite good given the fact that in the second half of this calendar year, despite OPEC plus production cuts, the US production is going to increase by one million barrels for the next two years and that is quite heartening. We sense that crude will largely remain range-bound and with that kind of setup, inflation challenges will not be there and from that perspective, we are not going to repeat some of the problems what we have seen in 2018. Overall, things are shaping up quite positively and even if we see some correction, that should be used as an opportunity to buy rather than exiting the markets at current levels.


Auto sales numbers -- particularly the two-wheelers -- have seen a bit of a rough ride. Is that likely to follow through?
This year has been quite bad for auto. In case of four-wheelers, the inventory challenges are not that high compared to two-wheelers. If you look at the commodity, prices are still higher for them. From November onwards, the steel prices are up more than 10 odd per cent. So the challenges for auto remain from a near-term perspective. Besides that, the sector is already facing structural challenges in key markets where ridership is taking a toll on the overall volume growth.

The auto sector also faces the threat of technology disruption and most of the Indian players are under-invested in technologies. That’s why the entire auto pack looks negative.


Sid Lal is out and Vinod Dasari has stepped in as Royal Enfield CEO. Is that going to make much difference?
For Eicher, some of the key markets like Kerala despite the base effect going off because of Kerala floods and all that, have not really seen a bounce in volumes. As long as the company was delivering good volume growth, it could sustain higher multiples but the 9.5 lakh figure also is not exciting enough. My worry is that the valuations or the multiples would continue to be under pressure and which is why, despite getting a good leader also, we do not expect much of outperformance relative to the market.

Overall within the two-wheeler space, we like Hero and Bajaj where the multiples are far more attractive. From that perspective, probably that might be a space one can look at but in general both Maruti and Eicher are still commanding quite high multiples relative to their growth. 


The consumption space is going through a visible slowdown -- whether it is staples or autos. But Titan, Bata, Pidilite are standing tall. Do you have a view on these three stocks? If yes, which one?
We like all the three stocks especially Titan because the share of organised players in the jewellery space is about 10 odd per cent. Similarly, on the apparel side, the share of organised player is about 15 odd per cent. Largely, our sense is that with a company like Titan which is a pan-India player, you really do not have competition on a pan-India basis. The valuations are definitely rich but the growth outlook is quite intact. 

You really do not see much of headwinds going forward for a company like that and within the overall discretionary spending, except for auto, in most of the other segments, the discretionary spending will remain intact. From that perspective, despite the stock being expensive, one has to look at the bigger picture. It has been our portfolio pick and will continue to remain so.


What are you recommending to your clients when it comes to two-wheelers? Do you expect to be safer in suspect Bajaj Auto because you have got that cushion of 30% exports?
Within two-wheelers, except for Eicher, both Bajaj and Hero are relatively attractive on a PE multiple basis. The threat of disruption probably will be largely an urban phenomenon and since Hero has got a good rural portfolio, the threat of disruption is relatively lower. Last year, we have seen good growth across the FMCG pack. There was a good amount of double digit growth. From that perspective, the growth on a higher base appears to be slightly lower but that is one space where one can look at within the two-wheeler space. Otherwise, the entire sector looks challenging from overall growth perspective."

Board meetings
 Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained its buy recommendation on SRF with a target price of ₹2,315 as pick up in specialty chemical business was a strong earnings kicker for the company. In the long run, the company’s leadership in refrigerant gas and significant capital expenditure in specialty chemicals will drive return ratios and other segments like technical textiles and packaging film to continue to generate strong cash flows, said the brokerage. 

• Emkay has initiated coverage on Capacite Infraprojects with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹288 citing strong growth path with attractive valuation. Besides government reforms such as real estate regulatory authority, the company is well-positioned to gain traction driven by impressive execution track with stable margins, lean balance sheet with healthy return ratios, strong management pedigree and asset-light business model said the brokerage. 

• Elara Capital has maintained its buy rating on TCS with a target price of ₹2,400 as the 19.8% PE premium assigned for TCS based on consensus estimates is inadequate. The brokerage expects the margin gap to widen further over FY20 as it expect TCS to improve operating profit margin by 180 bps year-onyear to 28.8%, even as Infosys sees operating profit margin erode by 100 bps year-on-year to 24.2%, said the brokerage. 

• Axis Securities has initiated coverage on Chalet Hotels with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹410. Chalet stems from its unique positioning and efficient asset management strategy such as the industry is coming out of a 10-year lull and we find it prudent to back asset owners in an upcycle – superior operating profit case in point, said the brokerage. 

• Edelweiss has maintained its buy rating on DLF with a target price of ₹237. DLF has successfully completed a qualified institutional placement of ₹3,170 crore involving an issuance of 173 mn shares at ₹183.4 apiece. This paves the way for the balance fund infusion of ₹2,250 crore by promoters as well as conversion of debentures/warrants worth the entire ₹11,250 crore into equity shares, said the brokerage.

14,2019-04-04,Eicher,"I do not think the MPC will be adventurous enough to go for a 50 bps cut, says MavaniI am more positive on Bajaj 
  
  
  Auto and Hero MotoCorp in the two-wheeler space and I would be a buyer in Maruti on declines, said Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Morgan Stanley has downgraded Eicher Motors yet again. They have cut their target price by a good 25%. Which camp are you in?
I would avoid Eicher Motors at this point of time. There is a serious issue with growth especially on the Royal Enfield side. They had stellar growth rates for three-four years between 2013 and 2017 and in last one year, the issues with growth probably are not something that will get corrected as soon or as easily. 

Of course, the market was slightly excited in the last couple of days with Vinod Dasari, ex-Ashok Leyland CEO and MD joining Eicher. I would avoid Eicher at this point of time and it is going to get seriously derated in the sense that valuation multiples will contract over the next one or two years with growth being elusive. In fact, I am more positive on Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp in the two-wheeler space and I would be a buyer in Maruti on declines. 

The news flow is negative. There is volume growth issue. Apparently, in Bajaj Auto, the volume growth issue seems to have sorted out. They have been reporting double digit growth but in case of Maruti and Hero, in spite of the negative news, the stocks are not falling. Although we may have a couple of more quarters of slowdown or growth pangs or growth issues, the collateral damage on the stock is done with. They may not fall much from here and it is certainly time to accumulate on declines for a two-year view.


RBI monetary policy is coming up today. The general consensus is we are going to see the 25 bps cut. What are your expectations, what is the impact?
In terms of the impact we have already seen a 25 bps cut. It has been expected for more than a month now and although we are focussed on equity market, the bond markets have seen a very sharp rally across the board in bonds -- whether it is G-Secs or corporate bonds or PSU bank bonds -- and the yields have fallen by anywhere from 20 bps to 40 bps.

That also is positive from the market point of view in terms of higher availability of liquidity in the system. So that partly will help some NBFCs which have been facing tight liquidity conditions over the last six months or so. While interest rates are likely to be heading down, for NBFCs the cost of borrowing has been increasing practically every month or every quarter and the indication is every month we seem to be having one large bond issue, NCD issue, from some NBFC or the other. The latest is from Shriram City Union Finance offering 10-year bonds at 9.75 or even L&T Finance offering for the first time higher than 9% or 9.25 whereabouts for 10-year paper. And these are the primary issues, reasonably large issues of few hundred to a couple of thousand crore. If the liquidity eases there, you will see some action on NBFCs as well. 


The state of uncertainty over Zee cracking a deal continues. Will you buy this one?
They have been on record that for the last few months, they have been in talks with Sony Group. Even Sony has confirmed that the deal can go through. It must have been to do with valuations and in terms of post a certain shareholding transfer in terms of control of the business. There could have been some disagreements there and hence the deal did not go through. 

These things happen in course of business. Now it certainly is a negative because the market was hoping the deal will go through. It would have been a massive entry of Sony into the Indian media space besides the presence that they already have, Zee would have been a priced catch. More importantly, even for the Zee promoters, it would have led to a lot of their problems easing. Now neither is happening. We are concerned with Zee and I would avoid it till there is more clarity there.


Which way would you be sticking your neck out? Do you think it is going to be a 25 bps cut with the dovish commentary or a straightaway 50 bps cut which would really please the markets?
I do not think the monetary policy committee (MPC) will be adventurous enough to go for a 50 bps cut, but a 25 basis points cut maybe a given with a slight neutral to a hawkish commentary because with crude rising and inflation hawks in the MPC and within RBI probably will also have a say.

I do not think that they will as dovish as one would have expected. We financial market participants always want central bankers to be dovish and generous and benign, but they are more likely they have a mind of their own. So, a cut with a neutral commentary rather than a dovish commentary is already there in the price both in the bond markets as well as equity markets. 

I do not think there is much to expect. The serious negative surprise would be that if they decide to do nothing. If they decide not to cut and just give a neutral or even if they give a dovish commentary, the market is going to be terribly disappointed."

19,2019-04-05,Eicher,"The sprint maybe over but the marathon is here till the end of the year and 13,500 on the Nifty and midcap outperformance 
  
  
  is very much on the cards, said Sanjiv Bhasin,Executive VP, Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

What are you telling your clients to do now, take chips off the table or ride the momentum?
We have had the fastest sprint I have seen in the last one and a half years and 10,500 is 11,700! But the new highs are seeing only pessimism. I think we have at least another 500 points on the upside, 12,000 to 12,200 and aside from that, the little bit of momentum that we have lost on the midcaps should again see a resurgence. By the end of April, I am sure 12,000 will be tested. We are asking our clients to stay put because the sprint maybe over but the marathon is here till the end of the year where 13,500 on the Nifty and midcap outperformance is very much on the cards.


Highlight some of the fresh names which you would recommend buying?
Some of our recent picks or one-year picks have been outperformers. We were one of the few who were sticking our neck out at Rs 75 on PFC and Rs 100 on REC. They have given a stellar 50% return. GMR at Rs 15 was one our dark horses. That has been a huge outperformer and so is the case with IDFC First. We are staying put with those. 

We think some of the autos are giving you a very good entry point. We are extremely bullish on Ashok Leyland. Eicher Motors, TVS Motor and Maruti was closer to that 6,700. All these are excellent plays. Metals have had a dream run in the last month but that is just the starting point. JSW, Hindalco would be included there and our regular top picks, Reliance, ITC, ACC, Axis Bank and Asian Paints continue to be the top heavyweights which we are overweight on. 


We are tracking Titan this morning. There was a huge bump up on SRF yesterday on account of the plant closure being revoked. What is your take on these stocks?
Three things: Titan has been a huge outperformer. It is telling you that the consumption part, particularly discretionary, is seeing huge amount of uptick and that will now flow into autos as we get into elections. Already you have seen SUV sales touch all-time highs in the shape of Toyota and Mahindra. 

Titan continues to be one of the darlings of the market and even though the stock is expensive, the management guidance is extremely positive. 

On aviation, one is more heavyweight on IndiGo. But at Rs 15, we thought that the best play on the aviation sector on airport side is GMR. Now, it is in the process of demerging the power and real estate from the airport business which is turning out to be huge cash multiplier. I continue to be overweight on GMR. I think you could get a target of 30 maybe in the next one year. The airport business itself will suffice. 


What is your view on SRF?
SRF, Atul and Aarti have been our top picks in the speciality chemicals and we think SRF is giving a brilliant opportunity as an one-off buying opportunity. We still think that China is under pressure because of the environment reasons and SRF margins have been maintained at the highs and even Rs 2,700 could be on the cards in the next three to four months.


What is your take on IT?
They are fully priced. All earnings are priced in and I do not see that much of growth. Globally there has been a hiccup and the best of IT may be played out. They have been over owned by both foreign and the domestic side and given the rupee’s strength, I would expect some sort of selling. If you wanted to play the rupee weakness, we would rather play it through the pharma route. 

A disclosure, HCL Tech and MindTree are two contrarian plays where we have initiated buys -- Rs 925 on HCL Tech which has been a handsome outperformer and Rs 825 on MindTree. We continue to own both those and recommend those to be bought on declines."

20,2019-04-05,Eicher,"India’s equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty are like twin sisters gone separate ways – the former is a people’s choice and the latter traders’ favourite. 

It remains a never-ending debate whether Sensex represents the economy better or Nifty. It resurfaced earlier this week, after the 30-share Sensex delivered 17.30 per cent return for the just-ended financial year to outpace the 50-share Nifty’s 14.93 per cent.

This is the second straight financial year that the BSE benchmark managed to be ahead. Prior to this, Nifty outperformed Sensex in 2015-16 and 2016-17. In last 10 financial years, each has managed to outpace the other in five.

In terms of absolute return, long-term data shows both the indices climbed 73 per cent in last five financial years. However, Sensex rallied 277 per cent in last 10, and Nifty 265 per cent.

From Nifty’s base date of November 3, 1995 till April 2 this year, it has advanced 1,064 per cent, while Sensex has grown 1,020 per cent. 


What’s in it for market participants?
Sensex is now around 3.3 times Nifty, having climbed to 38,672 on March 29, 2019 from 32,967 on March 28, 2018. Nifty has moved to 11,623 from 10,113 in the same period.

A rally in the stocks that are common constituents of both indices – Bajaj Finance (up 71 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 54 per cent), Axis Bank (up 52 per cent), ICICI Bank (up 43 per cent) and Tata Consultancy Services (up 40 per cent) – mainly supported them in 2018-19. 

Similarly, a fall in the shares of Tata Motors (down 47 per cent), Vedanta (down 34 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (down 28 per cent) put pressure on both. 

Two other stocks, Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 31 per cent) and Eicher Motors (down 27.50 per cent), proved a drag on Nifty, which Sensex survived as the two are not part of it. Nifty also suffered due to subdued performance of Zee Entertainment (down 23 per cent) and Grasim Industries (down 18.36 per cent) – stocks not part of Sensex.

“Out of the 20 Nifty stocks that are not part of Sensex, 10 fell badly. They belonged to two major segments: oil and gas PSUs and two-wheelers,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.

This was attributed to volatility in crude oil prices, a slowdown in two-wheeler sales and issues related to share pledging. Other individual stocks suffered due to a generally weak business outlook. “That being the case Nifty’s underperformance may not change significantly in the short term,” Chokkalingam said.


So, which index to follow? 
Sensex, which came into being in 1979, long enjoyed its monopoly as India’s heartbeat index and became synonymous with the domestic equity market till Nifty’s arrival in 1995. The latter gradually won investors’ allegience as NSE’s pioneering futures and options market grew popular and allowed investors to bet on the index. This also helped Nifty gain global acceptance by becoming a true proxy play on Indian equity.

There are claims that most people in the market today follow Nifty, instead of Sensex, as the former represents larger number of industries. “Nifty is widely tracked as it contains 50 stocks. It is a broader index compared with Sensex and gives a better view of the economy,” said AK Prabhakar, Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets. 

The 50-share index accounted for about 54 per cent of the asset under management of India-focussed ETFs at Rs 1,13,827 crore as of February-end 2019, data provided by NSE Indices showed.

BSE MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan recently said Sensex is a picture of changing India and will continue to remain so in the time to come. 

Sensex completed four decades of existence last week. “Over the last 40 years, it has given CAGR of over 17 per cent which is the highest returns for any asset class in India,” Chauhan said.

He insisted his index is a true reflection of India’s growth over all these years. “It is the symbol of India’s aspirations and will continue to guide future generations as it has done in the past. It has incorporated new industries like IT, pharma and banking over these 40 years and shed industries that didn’t do well,” he said.

Mukesh Agarwal, CEO of NSE Indices, says Nifty50’s total return index has delivered 15.8 per cent in last 10 years, which he claims is in alignment with India's nominal GDP growth during the same period at 13 per cent CAGR (FY09 - 19E). This, he claims, validates the fact that the equity market returns are aligned with the long-term income growth trajectory of the economy.

Veteran Dalal Street money manager Saurabh Mukherjea trashes both the indices, saying they are no longer a proxy for India’s economic growth. 

Mukherjea, who recently founded alternative asset management firm Marcellus Investment Managers, says India’s GDP growth (in nominal terms) has averaged at 13 per cent in last 10 year, while Nifty’s annual earnings expansion has been 8 per cent.

He says the increasing disconnect suggests key drivers of the Indian economy have gone missing from the listed space."

Edited excerpts: 



The week was a much needed breather for the market but the good thing is we have not fallen.
Absolutely. The mix of the market was very good this week. In the first half, you saw a bit of volatility coming in. One of the strongest sectors in March was the Bank Nifty or the banking sector, That sector took a bit of a breather. The Bank Nifty corrected 650 or 700 points from its recent swing highs. But what was supportive for the markets this week was the emergence or the re-emergence of new sectors. 

Cement stocks made a very strong comeback in the fag end of the week. We saw auto stocks like Eicher Motors, Tata Motors also trying to make a very good comeback. To top it up, on Friday we saw very good recovery into the metal pack. Net-net, I believe that this week was more of a consolidating week for the Nifty but the internals shaped up pretty well and all of that indicates that this is a sign of a new trend in the making for the broader markets and the benchmark indices.


What would be your bet in the auto pack? What do you think happened over there? 
As the saying goes, at the bottom, the news is always negative but the prices are at their multi-year support levels. I would look at purely chart patterns and then looking at the patterns, last week we saw very good mix up happening into names like Hero MotoCorp which was making a comeback. Maruti, Tata Motors also improved. When you see a weaker index or a weaker stock rallying by 10-15% and supporting these benchmark indices at a time when the stronger sector underperforms, that is a very credible comeback. 

One of the patterns which we have seen in every phase of bull markets is that the weaker stocks are the last movers and when you see mild recovery in the weaker sector, that itself is a strong trend. In terms of names, Tata Motors is one of the stronger candidates for a strong breakout on the upside, then followed by Maruti as well as Eicher Motors, which is trying to make a very strong price pattern on the weekly timeframe.


Metal stocks rallied this week after poor performance in last 30-40 days or maybe even one quarter. Is this a start of a trend, not only in India but also in global metal names?
So yes the push is coming across from the global markets for the sector but in terms of open interest built up on the futures and options segment for the metal stocks, or whether it is a cash or delivery data, the volumes on intraday or daily basis, there is a strong sense of a credible comeback for metal stocks. More important part is the way the sector has performed. 

Largecap stocks like Tata Steel, JSW Steel made a very strong comeback and midcap names like SAIL and Jindal Steel also made a very good comeback in the last two weeks. Net-net, with the structure and the health of the sector improving in terms of volumes and open interest, there is a very credible trend in the making for metal stocks.


When we talk about the metals pack, what is the trend that has been seen generally? Do you think that if the trend reverses, the move could be quite phenomenal? 
Yes, sectors like metals and realty are very high beta spaces. When you see a new trend in the making, those trends do not last for one, two, three weeks. They go into a multi-week, multi-month, multi-quarter rally and I believe the metal stocks are showing signs of those kinds of trends. It was led by Tata Steel which bottomed out first in the metal pack and then it led to the midcap names also participating. I believe that there is a new trend in the making and given the high beta nature of these stocks, there is much more upside left in the short to medium term.


Any stocks that are looking interesting to you?
Yes and since the markets have raised the bar, even I will raise the bar and rather than giving two stocks, I will give three stocks. Two from the same sector and that is metal stocks we have been discussing earlier. SAIL is a very strong buy. It shows inverse head and shoulder chart pattern. The stock is showing beautiful traction. Volumes on the weekly charts are extremely strong. So, it is a buy on SAIL, targets revised to Rs 66 and stop loss could be tailed to Rs 56.

Tata Steel is another buy. The stock is trying to make a very good comeback. We saw swing breakouts for Tata Steel and that is also a buy, targets of Rs 580, stop loss at Rs 535. 

From the auto pack, I have picked up Eicher Motors. It is showing bullish hammer pattern on the weekly charts. That stock should make a strong comeback, Rs 22,000 as a target on Eicher Motors, suggesting a buy with stop loss Rs 20,250."

27,2019-04-11,Eicher,"I am not certain that markets can convincingly say the next PM will definitely be Narendra Modi and there will 
  
  
  be continuity, said Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


Bharti Airtel, along with Warburg Pincus and Singtel, is aiming to buy nearly 61% stake in Dish TV. They have also got a war chest to take on Rel Jio. How do you see this story shaping up?
Whatever the outcome, the consumers will certainly benefit. From a shareholder point of view, it does not make sense to invest in the telecom sector. A bloodbath is still underway. The pricing discipline is a long way away and these companies need to keep on investing in maintaining and upgrading their networks. There is also 5G, which may come into play 18-24 months down the line. In any case, the industry is working on absolutely low return on capital employed.

 Keeping all these factors in mind, it is best to completely avoid the telecom sector. You may have trading rallies from time to time, because of a decent quarter or a market share gain for one or more of the listed companies, but on the whole this is not a sector which is going to create or deliver superior returns to investors going forward. It will be great for consumers but from a shareholder or investor point of view, this sector is a complete avoid. 


For a shareholder what do you have as an option? Latest news is all the FMPs and mutual funds which lent to the Zee Group have got impacted. What should one do now? Book your loss and get out?
We are watching Zee Entertainment very closely and there is just this one event about the entry of a strategic investor. Once there is clarity about who that investor will be and exactly how the company will be managed and how the roles will be shared, you could see revival in the stock price of Zee Entertainment. 

Given the scale of business, the size of the opportunity, the success of their OTT venture and the levels at which the stock is trading at, it certainly is at a very attractive level in terms of price to earnings multiples and risk-returns. 

Once this uncertainty is over and done with and whenever this announcement is made about a stake sale by the promoter, you will see a nice trading bounce. But even at those levels, it may make sense to buy into Zee Entertainment because whoever is going to come in will certainly bring a lot on the table and will add value to the business going forward.

In any case, it is a professionally-run company and there are few such brands and businesses available at these valuations. One needs to watch Zee Entertainment very closely and if you have a little bit of risk appetite, at every correction like this, whenever there is some adverse news, one could look at buying into it and trying to average lower going forward and then maybe increase the holdings once the strategic investor’s name the plan is going forward is known. I am quite positive, not only on the sector as a whole but Zee in particular. 


The elections are here. Do you think the market is stepping into this big event a little bit light and what we have seen in March, may not replicate this month?
If the markets were to remain at these levels, I would say we are entering the election verdict on a bit of a high and that is not always the best case scenario. You want to get into an event with the market correcting so that in case of any adverse news, the fallout is restricted. 

As of now, the NDA victory has been priced into the market and any disappointment could lead to a selloff. I am not particularly happy with the trends that we have seen. Investors are coming into buy at corrections. It could be foreign portfolio investors or domestic investors and the risk- return ratio does not favour investment at this point of time because we have a major event and I am not certain that markets can convincingly say that the next PM will definitely be Narendra Modi and there will be continuity. 

You could easily see a prolonged period of political uncertainty and that could hamper the sentiment in the economy and stocks as well. The view has to be a bit cautious at this point of time. Whichever way the results go, there will be opportunities to buy into stocks at corrections and with a margin of safety.


You only buy after 23rd of May?
Absolutely. We also have an earning season coming up and typically there is a lot of stock-related volatility when earnings are announced and that could also provide opportunities. There will be so much of news flow over the next six weeks or so and for an investor who is more or less fully invested with only 10-15% in cash, it is better to wait and watch and buy once all the uncertainty is out of the way. 

I would say it is better to err on the side of caution then get extremely excited and assume that we will have political certainty and buy on that basis. If something else were to be the outcome, then the effect could be quite severe and then one would have missed the opportunity to buy stocks at a more steeper correction. 


What is the view on the auto sector? What is your outlook on two-wheelers and four-wheelers within auto?
Bad quarterly numbers not just for March but also for June quarter is a given. Not only will you have lower volumes and lower revenue growth, but you will also have negative operating leverage coming into play. That will pressurise the operating profit margins as well. 

There’s a need to brace for big disappointment as far as the auto company results are concerned but these companies are great long-term structural stories and they are available at reasonable valuations at this point of time. If an investor can look beyond six to 12 months or so and buy into these companies, then it is a perfect contrarian play as well and you could easily see the likes of Maruti, Eicher or even TVS Motors up at least double from this price in the three to four years or so. 

At some point of time. the auto volume sales will certainly revive, pent up demand will come into play and as we are seeing, interest rates are also coming down that will trigger more auto sales maybe a few months down the line. Now that insurance- related issues are behind the industry, in three to six months, you will certainly see a revival in auto sales. The base effect will also come into play. Then there is BS-VI also. There could be some buying before the implementation of BS-VI. 

The worst seems to be over for the auto industry in terms of performance as well as stock price and investors could look at opportunities to get into the auto industry. These are great businesses with very high return on investment and companies like Maruti have a very dominant market share and companies like Eicher Motors have a fantastic position within the sector. I would be positively inclined towards the auto industry but look for revival in monthly volumes before taking the plunge.


When and if that correction were to come, what would you buy? Do you buy some more HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries or do you hunt for new earnings?
The overall theme for 2019 will be softer interest rates and we have seen two interest rate cuts and maybe some more also along the way. Once you are convinced that there is political certainty or uncertainty and that gets priced in, then the best stocks to buy would be the interest sensitive stocks starting with the banks and NBFCs. Then you could look at automobile shares. You could look at even real estate and to some extent capital goods because we are definitely seeing an uptick in the capex cycle. 

As far as engineering construction companies are concerned, irrespective of whichever government comes into power, they will continue to give a lot of importance to infrastructure and there is a great demand to create various infrastructure projects. These are the broader themes that one could look at. 

Maybe one could go a little bit easy on consumption because we have the monsoon risk as well and that certainly will impact consumption at various levels -- be it FMCG, appliances, even certain segments of the auto industry. 

It is going to be extremely tricky. In 2019, one needs to navigate through all these scenarios and be a bit cautious. One should go for safer stocks, defensive stocks and not get too ambitious and expect significantly higher return at least for the first half of this year or so. Consider getting more into small, midcap stocks only once the monsoon outcome is known and where the interest rate scenario is and what the global set up is. It is going to be a difficult year. 2018 also has been difficult and my sense is most of 2019 also will be quite tricky from investment perspective. 


The massive buyback in Wipro is coming in. What exactly is your outlook in terms of the overall valuations and how much of a positive sentiment could we see on the back of this buyback?
You see a trading rally based on this news and a kind of floor will be set as far as Wipro stock price is concerned. Going forward, is it going to be a growth-oriented stock? Can it deliver that 15-20% type of compounded returns over three to five years on a longer-term basis? The answer to that is certainly no and that is true for most IT companies -- largecap as well as midcap. 

The underlying industry growth rates are at best, low double digit or maybe high single digit and with the global economy slowing down, they could face headwinds over there. While you will not lose too much money in the sense that IT companies and Wipro in particular will not be great value destroyers, but from this point on, they would be great value creators as well. So, you could have them in part of your portfolio for just trying to protect the capital, IT may not be able to deliver the higher returns. 

In India, if you have lower interest rates, many businesses start to look very attractive. I would be favouring domestic focussed businesses rather than companies like IT at this point of time. There could be a few outliers and you could have a trading bounce in a few select companies which could be a TCS or an Infosys where the earnings momentum is higher than the overall industry, a few select midcap IT companies which have a slightly differentiated business model like say Tata Elxsi or L&T Technology Services or maybe Intellect Design which is more IP oriented. These companies could outperform the sector as a whole and still deliver decent returns. 

Broadly one needs to be careful in software, be extremely selective and look for companies which can have a sustainable high mid-teens or high mid-teens type of earnings trajectory at least for the next one or two years or so."

29,2019-04-17,Eicher,"The Nifty, which has hit all-time highs for the second time in April, has advanced 12% in the last one year. But these gains are yet to reflect in many mutual funds’ net asset values (NAVs). Mutual fund categories--large-cap, large- and midcap, and multicap have not been able to beat the Nifty, while values of mid-cap and small-cap categories have eroded in the period.

Analysts said the underperformance of the schemes despite Nifty’s record levels is because the rally in the key indices has been driven by a few stocks. As much as 91% of the Nifty returns during the last one year came from six stocks – Reliance, HDFC Bank, Infosys, TCS, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. Reliance has been the biggest gainer in the index over the last one year returning 43%, followed by Axis Bank at 40%, ICICI Bank 37%, TCS 33%, Infosys 28% and HDFC Bank 17.9%.

“The rally in the last one year is concentrated with a few stocks participating. Mutual funds run diversified portfolios which cannot take concentrated bets and hence have lagged behind the Nifty,” said Amol Joshi, founder, Plan Rupee, a Mumbai- based distributor.

The fall in auto stocks like Maruti, Tata Motors, Hero Motors and Eicher Motors, in which fund managers were overweight, also impacted their returns. Generally, mutual funds run diversified portfolios with holding in a individual stock not exceeding 10%. Most funds have 40-50 stocks in their portfolio. Focused funds could have even less with 25-30 stocks, while midcap funds have a higher number of stocks, as many as 70-100, in their portfolios.

Distributors said SEBI’s recategorisation of mutual funds, which came into effect in the last one year, too, has crimped fund managers. “Earlier many funds could chase performing stocks irrespective of the category they belong to. However, with recategorisation, schemes have to stick to their mandate, which reduces the chances of outperformance, ” says Gajendra Kothari, founder, Etica Wealth Advisors.

Distributors also point out that large participation in mutual funds by investors in the last three years have led to many large funds ballooning in size. “As a fund size increases, a the manager tends to become conservative, as he is continuously under watch. This reduces his ability to generate alpha,” says Gajendra Kothari.

30,2019-04-18,Eicher,"Flows did improve from retail individuals in the month of March but managers did not really over allocate into
  
  
  equities in March, said 
Kaustubh Belapurkar
, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser, in an interview with ETNOW.


Edited excerpts:


We have made it to all-time highs from the last time that we have met but there is that massive missed-out feeling with the market. What has been the broad trend that you have seen across funds?
In the previous couple of months, we have seen domestic institutions taking a back seat which have been driving the markets over the last year and a half or two. The FIIs took a forward step and it seems significant amount of flows have come in. Flows did improve from retail individuals in the month of March but managers did not really over allocate into equities in March.

If you look at it, the money has been largely allocated through the CPSE ETF offering into the PSU names like NTPC, ONGC, Coal India and IOC. That is largely where a huge amount of the allocation has gone. 

The other interesting trend is that financials which has been such a huge play for such a long time, have taken a pause. In fact, given the run up in some of these banking counters, there have been some marginal trimming of positions. I do not think fundamentally anything has changed but just the valuations. Some pause has occurred across the managers.


 It is a bit strange with that with the banks but what has been going on with stocks from the broader universe, what has been the key trend there?
I would say one interesting trend that we notice is the emergence of some buying into insurance. Mainly life insurance. Obviously, there were some offers to sale or stake sale happening from the likes of ICICI Pru Life and SBI Life. They have garnered some flows but the likes of HDFC Life have seen interest coming back from buyers, given that the stocks have been trading at lows for quite some time now.

Otherwise, if we look at it, financials are tepid, healthcare not really going anywhere, technologies have paused a bit, cyclicals have not really moved on the auto side. But in other consumer names, especially on the midcap side, you can see some interest building up. The likes of Sheela Foam, Relaxo Footwear, Jubilant Foodworks has seen some interest.


Consumer names…
The consumer names and travel and tourism industry. Travel is not working but the hotel space is…


Tourism is…
Tourism is. In fact, Indian Hotels has seen a fair bit of buying. The likes of Lemon Tree are seeing buying. So, there is interest in that space. Unfortunately, the other leg is not really playing out.


Typically, when you see some traction build into the hotel names, is it long lasting money or is it a very short-term money which just gets in and gets out during the peak season?
Hotels is one trend that we have been seeing building up for a while now. The quantum of flows is not huge given that these are much smaller counters . But you can see that money has been trickling in month on month. So, it is not like it has come in and gone out in a flash. It has definitely been adding up positions over probably in a 12-18 months. 


How would you classify some of these top buys? Would you classify them as PSUs or as energy plays? What is going on in NTPC, ONGC, Coal India, IOC?
So largely the PSU names because of that Rs 10,000 crore flow into the CPSE offering in the month of March. But NTPC is actually one of those names. It is not only CPSE money there has also been a fair bit of active management buying coming in largely because we have had some positive news around the regulatory tariffs and they are getting some capacity online. As a stock, the industry has been very positive.


We have been talking a lot on whether auto is going to make a comeback. What is the logic there?
Maruti price has really corrected and it had almost reached Rs 6550 levels. But the position adding is not very large. If you look at other auto names -- Eicher has been sold, Bajaj is being sold, some of the auto ancillaries like Bosch, Motherson Sumi, the tyre companies Apollo, MRF are all seen selling. I think there is a definite pause or trimming of positions in auto. More than trimming, it is actually selling of positions.


Even Maruti has risen consistently from its lows?
We have seen a fair bit of selling on Maruti this month. There is a bit of a flip, but from what we hear on the street, people have not turned extremely gung-ho yet on that counter. There is still fairly large positions and managers hold on Maruti. It is not like we have completely gone out of that but they have been trimming positions.


When you are saying trimming, is it also simply profit booking in Eicher or Motherson or some of the others or would you say that is a bearish tone on auto?
I think it still is a bit of a bearish tone. It is not a one-off that has happened especially on the likes of Eicher which has been under pressure for a while now."
32,2019-04-22,Eicher,"MUMBAI: Ending the last fiscal year with its lowest growth rate in almost a decade, Royal Enfield, the premium motorcycle brand owned by Eicher Motors, has revamped the organisation structure post the high-profile appointment of Vinod Dasari as the CEO of the company.

The aim is to reinforce focus on the domestic market, protect leadership and grow volumes in the face of a slowing market and rising competition, said people in the know.

After the announcement of the new CEO, an annual meeting of the top 200 executives was held in Chennai where the strategic business plans were discussed, and then within a week, large scale transfers and positions were announced.

In that meeting, Siddhartha Lal, MD, Eicher Motors acknowledged that the India business is facing challenges and it needs attention. He said while international markets will take time to evolve, the most important resources will be behind India business and there is an urgency to get the India story back on track.

The company has segregated sales and marketing into two separate functions as against one team led by Shaji Koshy. The company has moved back Pankaj Sharma to domestic operations as national sales head from his position of global customer experience head; Sharma will report into Shaji to manage smooth transition on the completion of his extended term. The company has given the complete marketing responsibility to Shubhranshu Singh who was earlier global head of brands.

The biggest organisation change in terms of senior managerial concentration is the creation of chief commercial officer position under Lalit Malik, who is also the chief financial officer of Eicher Motors with sales, marketing, service, finance, legal and admin reporting into him.

Apart from the major changes, the domestic sales and marketing set-up, the other key changes on the international operations include movement of Arun Gopal from Latin America to Europe, replacing Paul Rowney, who has exited the company. Rod Copes, a former Harley executive who manages the US market also gets the additional charge of the Latin American market.

When contacted, Royal Enfield spokesperson said the changes in structures and teams, and deployment of personnel are in line with the objectives of emerging opportunities and priorities. The spokesperson said that the company’s ambition to grow mid-size motorcycling (250-750 cc) globally from India remains on track.

On the renewed focus on the domestic market, the spokesperson asserted India is the core market and the company derives scale, competitive cost structures and profitability from this market, but cautioned that Royal Enfield is now on a different part of growth cycle in India and it has synced with the rest of the market, leaving it to the influences of industry ups and downs. “We strongly believe that changes in a business cycle give us the opportunity to introspect, figure out problems and roadblocks in the system. We are certainly not sitting still or taking this lightly. We are rolling up our sleeves and putting our resources and attention behind identifying these challenges and solving them,” assured the spokesperson."

1,2019-05-05,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: A host of triggers are likely to help benchmark indices move out of rangebound trading next week. While quarterly earnings will drive stock-specific actions, economic data such as March factory output and manufacturing growth prints, fifth phase of elections and progress of US-China trade talks will be keenly followed. 

Oil prices, rupee-dollar exchange rate and foreign flow trend will also be tracked keenly. 

For the week gone by, BSE Sensex fell 104.07 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 38,963, while NSE’s Nifty50 fell 42.40 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 11,712. 


Here are key factors to watch out for next week: 


US-China trade deal
A Chinese delegation will arrive in Washington on Wednesday (May 8) to discuss the proposed trade deal. Donald Trump on Friday said the trade negotiations with China were going on pretty well. The comment by the US President came after White House’s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney earlier this week said the trade dispute with Beijing will likely be resolved “one way or the other” within the next two weeks. A report by CNBC quoting sources suggested that a trade deal could be announced by Friday this week. 


Q4 earnings
A total of 216 companies will report March quarter earnings in the coming week, BSE data suggests. Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank and Marico will declare results on Monday, Vedanta, Escorts and CEAT on Tuesday, Titan Company and Dhanlaxmi Bank on Wednesday, HCL Tech and Apollo Tyres on Thursday and SBI, L&T, Eicher Motors and Allahabad Bank on Friday.


IIP, manufacturing growth data 
On Friday, investors would like to know whether the industrial output growth improved in March from a 20-month low of 0.1 per cent hit in February. The factory output last month was hurt mainly due to a contraction in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, the numbers on manufacturing output to be released the same day will also be watched. Meanwhile, Nikkei India PMI Services data for April will be released on Monday. The three data prints will give cues on the state of the economy. 


5th phase of elections
The fifth phase of voting in the general elections will take place on Monday. Voting will happen in 51 Lok Sabha constituencies across seven different states. After four phases of elections, the voting percentage stood at 67 per cent, comparable with 67.6 per cent reported in 2014. Equirus Securities said flattish turnout has historically proved to be good for an incumbent party. 


Global economic releases
Among global cues, investor will watch Euro zone’s retail sales figures on Monday, China’s foreign reserves data on Tuesday, its trade data on Wednesday and CPI and PPI data on Thursday, and US’ CPI numbers and Baker Hughes oil rig count on Friday will be watched keenly.


Oil, rupee movement
Investors are keenly waiting to see if the recent fall in crude oil prices was temporary. A drop in crude prices will help the rupee appreciate or vice versa. Data suggests Brent crude futures settled at $70.85 a barrel on Friday, down 2.6 per cent for the week, snapping a five-week rising streak. US crude futures on the other hand fell around 3 per cent for the week to $61.94 a barrel.


Foreign flows
Foreign flows into India were pretty strong at Rs 72,394 in the last three months. That said, inflows in April at Rs 21,193 crore were down 37 per cent from March’s record flows of Rs 33,980 crore. In May so far, FPIs have pulled out Rs 367.30 crore from domestic equities."

3,2019-05-09,Eicher,"If somebody has Reliance share in the portfolio, it is a hold. But it is a difficult call to take whether it is a buy at this point of time, said Devang Mehta, Head-Equity Advisory, Centrum India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 


The largecaps have taken quite a beating and Reliance Industries definitely merits a mention given the selling pressure. Now, Morgan Stanley is also rather circumspect and have downgraded the stock saying that the upside is going to be limited. What are you advising on RIL?
The markets have been extremely polarised in the last few months and the rally has been led by five or six businesses including Reliance, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and TCS. Unless the broader market starts participating in the rally, a crack in stocks which were doing extremely well, would cap the rally. 

The correction that we are seeing is more FII driven and that is clearly notable. They have overweight positions in the stocks which I have mentioned earlier. Reliance also is getting a bit of its correction because it has been a dream rally for the stock. I do not see a big challenge in the business as such people knew the earnings of petchem as well as the core business of oil and gas has been slowing down in the last two-three quarters.




But still, the stock was making new highs and this can be a natural correction -- probably 5% more from here as the market ,corrects led by heavyweights. I do not see a big problem emerging. If somebody has it in the portfolio, it is a hold. Whether it is a buy, it is a difficult call to take at this point but it is a good hold in the portfolio.


 The world is migrating towards corporate banks but looking at Yes Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank numbers, would you say the long crowded trade in corporate banks is getting challenged?
There were different set of numbers from different banks. Yes Bank faces a typically different type of problem. There was a kitchen-sinking done after the stock performed very well in the earlier couple of quarter. One quarter is mirroring what Axis Bank or a Yes Bank, ICICI Bank did two-three four quarters back, but there are not many compelling trades in the market in the banking sector. Of course, HDFC Bank commands a premium as a retail bank but clearly if somebody still needs to buy on dips, a better candidate where ROE expansion is going to happen is Axis Bank. The management is talking about 8% ROE getting into an 18% league in another three years.

After the clean-up, there is a lot of scope for these banks to give if not 25-30%, at least 15, 18, 20% type of return CAGR for the next two-three years, particularly for Axis Bank. 

So, yes the cream is out of the rally. The 40-50% return has already been made but it is back to 15-18% boring returns that can be made out of Axis or ICICI.


What is going on with some of these pledged share scenarios like the Essel Group? The fact that Reliance Mutual Fund sold it had created a lot of nervousness in the markets. What is your take?
It is better to avoid the space, where there is a lot of pledged share issue. In last two-three months, there has been bouts of volatility. A lot of these companies have good businesses and good pipeline as well. The numbers also are good for a lot of these companies, but the overhang on these type of stocks have always been the promoter pledge or the debt on the books which is very difficult to manage, during these types of market where on one side, there is polarisation and on the other, market breadth has been very weak. 

So, fundamental has taken a back stage for this type of businesses. It is better to stay away from these types of businesses. If you have to buy at all, go for a screaming buy or place your bet on the valuation side. That way, you do not suffer in the shorter term but over a longer period, you make good returns but yes, refrain from buying into companies where there are pledged shares.


We are gathering that there is going to be a steep hike in cement prices, the second one in the last two months. Your view?
In the last couple of quarters, we have started hunting for such businesses. Generally we refrain from buying more cyclical businesses as we are more into high market share or market leading businesses where there is pricing power. But cement in the last couple of quarters, have been showing a bit of traction. The last quarterly numbers of a lot of companies like UltraTech also see that the demand scenario coming back plus a bit of pricing power with price hikes. 

After a long time, probably the demand for cement is coming back and may be monsoon would be subdued. But for somebody with a one-one-and-a-half-year type of a view, cement presents a good opportunity. Cyclicals is one space where with select capital goods or cement, you can start constructing a portfolio and post election results, if a stable government is in place, the construction demand, infra demand and a bit of housing demand could come back. Cement can act as a proxy play for this type of construction activity.


Do you think one should just get more realistic rather than following a predefined template of buying good companies and great businesses? One should acknowledge that these companies are nowhere available at levels at which they warrant a buy?
There is a clear distinction between a great business, a good business and also a third category which IS classified by Warren Buffett as gruesome business. You do not want to buy any gruesome business in the portfolio at any type of valuation. May be it is a value or a value trap. We do not know any business so gruesome you have to stay away. A good business is probably about some cyclicals you have to time as and when you feel that this is the right price or the cycle is changing. Of course it is very difficult to say but cement and capital goods probably qualify as some of these companies have good business. 

Great businesses are some of the businesses like a Britannia or may be Dabur or HUL. These are types of businesses you do not want to sell or either you want to buy in distress. These are distressed times and probably after a 5% or 10% correction, the price may be right. But Page Industries from Rs 35,000 to Rs 32,000 or Rs 28,000 was probably overvalued. A couple of bad numbers brought it to Rs 22,000 right. Probably you need to time your bets -- that this is a time when you buy some consumption businesses like Page Industries or take a contra call like Eicher Motors which people will not find favour with right now at Rs 20,000. But at Rs 18,000 it would a screaming buy.

So, rather than adventuring into companies which you do not know, get into plain vanilla businesses where you know that the high market share and market leadership would come and help you in good times and which would not shatter you in bad times. So keep your bets ready, keep your list ready and these are the businesses in India which you need to buy. There are 100-150 good businesses where you can make money in a simpler way rather than adventuring out of the 500 stocks that present itself."
4,2019-05-09,Eicher,"HDFC Asset Management, the country’s largest mutual fund house by assets, lightened its largecap holdings and bought additional shares of select midcap and smallcap companies in April, when the benchmark equity indices advanced 1 per cent. 

The money manager more than doubled its holding in select aviation, NBFC, cement and consumer durables plays in April, even as it sold stake in industry leaders Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints and ICICI Bank. 

The fund house added more shares in as many as 61 companies, while reduced its holdings in as many as 84. NSE’s Nifty index rose nearly 8 per cent during the January-April period, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap100 shed up to 2 per cent each.

Brokerage Elara Capital says midcaps continue their underperformance against largecaps. “Relative valuations are plunging towards -1 standard deviation levels, making midcaps very attractive. A negative SD shows the price to equity ratio has slipped to the lower end of average valuations.

Stocks where the top fund manager raised its holding in April included in InterGlobe Aviation, where its holding has gone up to a whooping 1,94,200 shares as of April 30 from 15,600 on March 31. Likewise, it increased stake in Indiabulls Housing Finance (from 99,238 shares to 3,72,605), ACC (from 8,000 to 27,200) and Bajaj Electricals (from 8,65,300 to 24,60,000).

According to Stewart & Mackertich, improved pricing power, lower ATF coupled with rupee appreciation should aid an improvement in profitability of domestic airlines. With the global ban on Boeing 737 Max 8 planes coming into force from March, capacity is not likely to rise at the expected pace, thus demand should outpace supply in the near future. This means the prospects for yields would be encouraging, the brokerage said. 

“We expect IndiGo to outperform, as it has a deep domestic network with over 43 per cent market share, availability of slots, lowest cost structure and a healthy cash balance to fuel the airline,” the brokerage said.

ACC has been demonstrating sustained ability to improve sales volume since Q1CY17, which had remained stagnant through CY11-CY16. While its CY18 volume growth stood at 8.7 per cent YoY, capacity utilisation came in 85 per cent, Ashika Stock Broking said in a report. 

“We expect ACC to deliver improved RoE backed by better pricing and lower operating expenditure,” the brokerage said.

HDFC AMC also developed fancy for select power plays. Data shows the fund house bought over 1 crore additional shares in NTPC and BHEL during the month. It held 35.75 crore shares of NTPC and 2.04 crore shares of BHEL as of April 30, 2019.

Antique Stock Broking prefers utilities firm like NTPC over equipment makers like BHEL. “In the short run, for a year or two, demand in power equipment and projects is unlikely to grow. Policy makers are consolidating and streamlining the existing 68GW of projects under construction. Plus, in the near term, the focus is on making good of the 175GW renewable target. This is visible in subdued order pipeline for BHEL, a state-owned power-equipment manufacturer. However, with commissioning pace of thermal plants are inching up,” it said

Tiles firm Kajaria Ceramics, telecom major Bharti Airtel as well as private sector bank Karur Vysya Bank also drew interest of HDFC AMC, which added 13,000 shares of Kajaria, 43.65 lakh shares of Karur and 16.77 lakh shares of Airtel during the month.

Coal India, Bank of Baroda, Apollo Tyres, GAIL India, Sadbhav Engineering, Bharat Electronics, Tata Steel, Bharat Dynamics, Jagran Prakashan, Chambal Fertiliser, Power Finance Corporation, Firstsource Solution, REC, Redington, REC, Kalpataru Power, KEC International, Axis Bank, Indian Hotel, BPCL, Gabriel India, SBI, Cipla, ITC, ICICI Prudential, Zee Entertainment and HDFC were among other stocks where the fund house raised its stake during the month.

On the other hand, it offloaded more than 13 lakh shares in Infosys, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries. It also sold over 50,000 shares in Maruti Suzuki, Adani Enterprises, HPCL, Britannia, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Allahabad Bank, Wipro and NBCC, among others.

Brokerage firm YES Securities recently gave a ‘sell’ rating to Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 5,850. “Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) reported a weak performance in Q4FY19 with Ebidta coming in 8 per cent below expectations,” said YES Securities.

In the Nifty50 pack, shares of companies like Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, Wipro and HCL Technologies surged over 20 per cent in the first four months of 2019, while Hero Moto, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki declined over 10 per cent.

Average asset under management (AUM) of HDFC AMC stood at Rs 3.43 lakh crore as of March 31, 2019. It was followed by ICICI Prudential AMC (Rs 3.21 lakh crore) and SBI Fund Management (Rs 2.84 lakh crore) in terms of AUM."
5,2019-05-09,Eicher,"Whichever government comes in, if growth is going to be the focus, then we should be more hopeful than despondent, said Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment Advisors, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

On May 23, we will know who is going to form the government. What are your expectations from the new government? 
What is important from an investor’s point of view is what are the cards that the new government is going to be dealt with. In 2004, the UPA-1 government was dealt extremely favourable macro scenario globally as well as domestically and they reaped the benefits of that. The opposite was true for UPA-2, where they actually came in post the global financial crisis and we had a protracted slowdown, which has carried on till now. 

So for all practical purposes, it has been almost a decade of earnings lost. 

In that kind of backdrop, it is very important that whichever government comes in, should focus on growth. PM Modi said somewhere that the last five years went towards meeting the needs of the poor and the next five years are going to be focussing on their aspirations. 

Whichever government comes in, if growth is going to be the focus, then we should be more hopeful than despondent.


Before we talk about the five-year agenda, let us talk about 23rd of May. Markets will swing. It could be a 5% or a 10% swing. What scenario do you think is in the price?
The most likely scenario like everybody keeps saying is the return of NDA government, maybe with a reduced number of seats. That is the base case that the market is playing with. But there is unlikely to be a major move if that is the outcome. Unless there is a new government or if there is simple majority for the incumbent government, then and then only will the market movement be exaggerated. Otherwise, we will go back to focussing on the global backdrop and the domestic factors.




If the outcome is adverse, then what are markets betting on? Are we looking at a tsunami of selling or would the selling be contained and muted?
It has been 10 years of earnings slowdown and we have spent the last five years cleaning up the books -- whether it is at promoter level or the government forming regulations and framework to help the corporate India clean up their books. We are probably more than half way through that clean-up. Going forward, whichever government comes, over a five-year scenario again it will be a beneficial thing only. We have a platform ready. We have a billion consumers who are connected with mobile and we have GST. Now we are a one geography. 

We are the last standing consumer in the world. Everybody is looking at us with a lot of hope that we are going to take over the mantle of growth in the global economy when two big giants are probably facing a slowdown. In that kind of scenario, I do not think one can be negative on the Indian economy and Indian markets for too long. 

So barring the initial reaction of the disappointment of the incumbent government not coming in, we will go back to focussing on the factors and there are lots of small positive changes which the market is not focussing on right now, that will come into play. Also, right now, the valuations optically seem high but that is the top 25-30 stocks. If you look at the rest of the market, we are really at pre-2013 valuations. The world has changed for the better. Crude is in tolerable zone. Rupee is stable. Inflation rate is contained and RBI is cutting rates. We are in a rate cut cycle. So in that kind of scenario, I do not see us dropping dramatically beyond the initial knee-jerk reaction.


How are you approaching the market right now? Election will occupy everyone’s mind but the concern is with slowdown in autos and consumer sectors because of the NBFC crisis. There is no demand and production is being cut. What is going on?
Those are more important factors than elections from the economy point of view. The consumption slowdown is driven more by the NBFC crisis and less by Indian consumer facing some kind of pinch. If political stability comes back and BS-VI is triggered, down the line, there might be some pre-buying for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. That could lead to a revival sometime in the second half. 

Right now, even though it is looking dire, I still feel it is a cyclical slowdown and not a very structural issue, This slowdown is manifesting itself in EMI-based products.


Soaps and shampoos are coming down and that makes me wonder! Slowdown or no slowdown, EMI or no EMI, you do not stop having a bath or start rubbing a bar of soap?
That is never the case. It has to do with competitive intensity may be the rural economy is facing a little more issue right now. A lot of stimulus has been given. The pie is not shrinking, it is just that the penetration of that category has reached a level where growth is difficult.

Maybe some substitute products have come in for all we know. But having said that, rural economy has received a decent amount of stimulus which is yet to play itself out. For example, this PM Kisan Yojana -- Rs 2,000 that is going to be given thrice a year. Two instalments have already gone in. That can play a big role in reviving the rural sentiment. The farm loan waiver that has happened in the last one year and also the fact that whichever new government comes in, the priority will be for them to revive the farm sector.

In that kind of a scenario, even the rural revival is on the cusp. Maybe six months, 12 months down the line, we should have a revival. The cyclical slowdown will not prolong itself that is my opinion.


Where are you shopping? Where are you getting out? 
There have been very few places where one can find a clean story where the valuation as well as the tailwind is in your favour. One of the spaces is the corporate banks and that has played out to some extent.


Is it the only thing which has played out for investors?
Yes, but it is not over yet. The asset quality improvement that is going to drive the ROE still has some legs to go. Also, credit growth is finally picking up. The NBFC crisis is playing into the hands of the large private corporate banks who can actually buy these NBFC portfolios and that is very easy growth and easy pickings for them. 

Some amount of realignment from NBFCs back to banks is going to happen and it is in progress and it is happening. This trade will still last maybe 12 to 24 months going forward as well.


A lot of midcap stocks have sold off across the board and the common theme here is not business, not demand. It is promoter pledges. Are you picking something which can be called distress sale, where the selloff is technical and not fundamental?
In a perverse way, actually this is a very bullish sign. Usually this happens in the late stage of the cycle. So, who are the sellers? Either it is the lender that is selling or liquidating or desperate promoters are selling, trying to get some asset value out of their asset to repay their lenders. 

All these are desperate sellers and to some extent there are retail investors who are tired of not getting any kind of returns for the last 18-24 months. Their patience is wearing thin and that is giving rise to an opportunity. 

Coming to your question, we have not picked any such distressed asset but we are constantly and continuously monitoring, we will wait for the opportunity where we feel the asset value is dramatically more than whatever the market is reflecting right now. 


Would you buy autos in this sell-off or would you buy consumers because a stock like Eicher is down from Rs 35,000 to Rs 22,000-23,000. HUL is down 15-17% from its recent high?
If you put a gun to my head and I have to choose only between the two of them, I might actually not choose either of the two.


You will not buy autos also…
Yes, I would rather go for more secular stories than a cyclical on. But having said that, may be three months, six months down the line with more some price correction, I will start looking at auto but in consumer stocks like Lever, definitely valuations are more expensive. There are other companies within the FMCG pack where you can probably look. There is a large tobacco company which is available at much cheaper valuation. One can pick and choose within the sector. You do not need to go with the most expensive stock.


Are you buying risk or growth in your portfolio or it is time to take a safety shelter kind of an approach stick to stocks?
Growth is not visible in most of the companies at this point of time. Now, you have to go with the quality of the company and the valuations. You have to pick the company or stock where you believe they would not make the cardinal mistake of overleveraging or doing capex at the wrong time of the cycle and if market has punished them for the slowdown in growth.

 Growth is a temporary thing. It is more a balance sheet issue that cannot be resolved very easily and so if the problems are of P&L, I am more open to buying them. But if the problems are of balance sheet, then I am still a little wary of picking them up right now.


This is the fourth year where earnings estimates are going to be downgraded.
I think it is eight or ninth year.


The optimism had come back four years ago.
It is eight or nine years since estimates have been downgraded.


What does one do now?
Do not stop estimating because you are not getting it right at all. The estimates would be around 25% earnings growth, even if we do not end up showing a 25% kind of growth, we will end with somewhere close to 18%-20% growth which is good. It is not a bad year. What matters more is the quality of earnings growth. If it is just a mathematical increase in earnings because you have provided less, that does not excite me. 

Most of the earnings growth is going to come from the banks which have gone through the provision cycle and their provisions are tapering off and that is leading to an increase in profits but if that is the only reason, then I would be a little wary of the earnings cycle rebound. Looking more for where the growth is panning out and where some operating leverage is coming in, it is leading to an ROE improvement. Those kind of stories would attract me more.


Are there enough options where growth, valuation, operating leverage or financial leverage work together?
You have often said that good headlines and good valuations do not go together. Right now we are in a situation where there is bad headlines and along with that, comes good valuations. So, valuations and the quality of the company remains the core you have to focus on at this point of time. 

You have to focus on the broad opportunity and believe that whatever the slowdown is happening is temporary in nature and if your horizon is beyond one-two years, then those companies will provide you with fantastic returns over a three to five year horizon."
6,2019-05-09,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: A drop in sales of Royal Enfield (RE) is all set to pinch Eicher Motors’ fourth quarter earnings on Friday. The auto maker is expected to report a double-digit drop in profit and at least 200 basis points (bps) contraction in margins on a year-on-year basis. Inventory update and clarity over RE production target of 9.5 lakh units for FY20 will be followed keenly.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects the company report an adjusted profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 540 crore, down 16.3 per cent YoY or 1.9 per cent QoQ. Consolidated revenue is projected to fall 2.7 per cent YoY (up 5.1 per cent QoQ) to Rs 2,460 crore.

During the quarter, Royal Enfield reported a volume degrowth of 13.5 per cent YoY to 1.96 lakh units. Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles also reported 9.1 per cent YoY drop in units sold to 21,010 units largely on a high base.

HDFC Institutional Equities is factoring in a 4 per cent drop in sales. “Realisations will be higher due to price hikes taken through the year. Ebitda margin contraction 200 bps YoY to 29.5 per cent (up 50 bps QoQ). Profit may decline of 10 per cent YoY (up 9 per cent QoQ,” the brokerage said.

ICICI Securities projected sales at Rs 2,413 crore, down 4 per cent YoY estimates March quarter Ebitda at Rs 728 crore with corresponding Ebitda margins at 30 per cent, down 230 bps YoY.

“Ensuing PAT is expected at Rs 589 crore. PAT for the quarter also includes profit from VECV JV amounting to Rs 58 crore. At RE level, pureplay standalone PAT is expected at Rs 494 crore,” the brokerage said."
8,2019-05-10,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Indian domestic indices soon took a turn for the worse, after opening mildly higher in morning trade on Friday, after US hiked tariffs on Chinese goods. 

Other Asian markets traded mixed after the tariff hike. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3 per cent, led by gains in Chinese shares. China markets were on midday break when the higher tariffs took effect. The Shanghai composite rose as much as 3.1 per cent early on Friday before paring much of that gain, leaving it up 1.5 per cent.

The BSE benchmark Sensex was down 28 poinst or 0.07 per cent at 37,531 whereas its NSE counterpart Nifty was trading at 11,294, down 7 poinst or 0.061 per cent.

""The index needs to hold key support of 11,200-11,250 and enter a base formation to see a pause in the ongoing correction. The recent consolidation breakdown area 11,550 would now act as stiff resistance, as per change of polarity concept earlier support would now act as resistance,"" said ICICI Direct in a note.

Reliance Industries was the biggest Sensex gainer, up around nearly 2 per cent, after Mukesh Ambani-led company acquired iconic British toy-maker Hamleys for around Rs 620 crore in an all-cash deal. 

Other gainers included -- ICICI Bank, Vedanta, Tata Motors, SBI and Tata Steel.

On the other hand, HCL Tech fell the most, down 4 per cent, following its March quarter numbers. The IT services major posted a 14.3 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 2,550 crore for the March 2019 quarter and set an ""aspirational"" annual revenue target of more than USD 10-billion (about Rs 70,258 crore) in FY2019-20. 

Asian Paints, Kotak bank, Coal India, HUL and Power Grid joined HCL Tech on the loserboard.

On the BSE sectoral front, realty was the biggest gainer. Meanwhile, FMCG, telecom, consumer durables, oil & gas were among the sectoral losers.


BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap traded marginally higher, up 0.02 per cent and 0.14 per cent respectively.

The markets would keep an eye on stocks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Eicher Motors, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, PVR, Oberoi Realty, Syndicate Bank, Vakrangee and Venky’s which will report their March quarter results on Friday."
9,2019-05-10,Eicher,"Markets look poised for a rally but a lot depends on how the next government takes some of these reforms forward, said Sridhar Sivaram, Investment Director, Enam Holdings, in an interview with ETNOW. Sivaram travelled in four states to find out the ground reality. Edited excerpts: 


How many kilometres have you travelled?
Almost 1,000 km over four weeks.


What is that one word you have come back with -- good, slowdown?
The consumption slowdown is there but different pockets had different sort of anecdotes. At least in Tamil Nadu, the TVS dealer mentioned that the demand in April has started to improve and in fact he was doing almost 20-25% growth for April, but it is very difficult to extrapolate that for the entire year or for a quarter. It could be because of the election effect. In certain other pockets like in UP, the slowdown was still there and there was inventory issue. The inventories were getting cleared so it was not like a clear view across the country. 




Is the slowdown cyclical or structural? Is this largely because of delay in decision making for funding, because of election or is this something which could be a prolonged two-three year slowdown because in the last five-seven years, we have not seen a marked slowdown in consumption. Is this the beginning of the slowdown cycle which we were fearing?
The sense that I got is this is more cyclical than structural because the funding issue is for real. When we spoke to people on the ground, it was very clear that they are getting this funding for two-wheelers or passenger vehicles very easily. Now the number of players available is much lesser and the credit criteria they are now asking for is much tighter. Plus GST related issues are not related to auto, but in other consumption sector, it still comes up that some of the smaller traders are still not very happy with the way GST is shaping up and the amount of filings that they have to do. 

A lot of it is cyclical because we have had a change of taxation structure and that takes about two-three years to stabilise. May be in another six months, whichever government comes, may end up benefiting from some of the reforms which have happened in the last two-three years which are having the teething issues right now, may stabilise and will benefit in six to 12 months time.


I notice you said whichever government comes to power... there is lots to read in between the lines…
I have no expertise as far as elections are concerned.


But at least you are not coming with a sure shot view after your entire roundtrip?

No, I mean it is very difficult to call and just doing four states or 1,000 km is hardly enough.


Four big states account for 50% of Lok Sabha seats -- Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra.

 I can say that it looks like the market consensus may be right which is that the current regime will continue with a lower majority, but the big question mark is what happens to UP? There, depending on whom you spoke to, you got a range of 20 to 60 for BJP. It really was not very clear.


What is the market positioning one month ahead of the election? There is no euphoria this time unlike 2004 or 2014?
If you look at the broader market, that gives a better sentiment. If you leave out the 10 stocks and look at the broader market, it is clearly telling you that the positioning is very light. Nobody wants to go on 23rd with the heavy position. Even if you get a consensus view, my gut feel is that the market could rally a bit but keep in mind that there is also a slowdown. Eventually earnings have to come. If the earnings do not follow through that sort of a rally could be sold into. 

All I am trying to say is that fund managers, friends, nobody is sure of the outcome. We have seen in the past that election results could have volatile short-term movements and nobody wants to play that right now.


The US-China trade scenario has put the world under pressure. Tracking the US ten-year paper makes you feel like it is going to hit recession some time?
First my view on the tariff itself. I actually support US on the tariff. If I look at all the speeches of Trump, one of the phrases that he used is reciprocal, which is that if China is able to export so much to the US, then there should be a reciprocal arrangement for the US companies to do that also.


But they are inefficient, their wages are high. 
That is not true. You can allow Google and Facebook to start operation in China. None of the financial services companies are allowed to standalone, take a position or to operate in China. When it says reciprocal, it does not mean exactly in manufacturing itself. It could be services. Over the years, the US has a $500 billion trade deficit with China, which is unsustainable. I am surprised that the previous regimes have actually allowed it to go to this level. I have read some article saying only one mad man can handle another. Now I do not know what people are referring to here…


There are many of them out there.
I know. But I am just saying that you need some drastic steps to happen for this sort of equation to settle down. To that extent, I support what the US is doing. What happens to global trade in the interim? There will be turmoil but in the last 18 months, this trade talks has gone on. Market takes a knock for about a month or so and then they rallies back. 

The US is in a cycle where the Fed has completely turned from wanting to tighten to being open to a cut. If that is the global environment, then that is a great thing for emerging market. I will just add one more point here. UBS recently came out with the report and they have done a CEO survey of about five or seven countries including China and many of the ASEAN countries on this entire manufacturing and what happens? India has come out very highly on that as far as shift of manufacturing is concerned because China is becoming more and more expensive to manufacture. 

It is an opportunity for India, but not in the short term. This is a medium and long-term opportunity, provided India plays its cards well. The two ways of looking at it is in short term, there will be volatility and one has to brace for some volatile moves.


You are saying it is a justified move as of now at least…
 That is my personal view.


This ongoing economic slowdown is also appearing to affect the construction sector where activity has slowed down. How dangerous would that be for the overall economic growth? 

During my trip to Tamil Nadu, I found a different view. There cement demand grew more than 20% last year and cement dealer after dealer kept telling me that the demand is coming because of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and that people are building houses there because there is a huge subsidy which the government is giving. The demand is not there in the big cities and towns, but it is there in the rural areas.

When speaking to some bureaucrats, the sense I got is that Tamil Nadu as a state has adopted central schemes very well irrespective of who is in the centre. If the scheme is very good for the state or for the people at large, they have adopted it very well and that is the sort of response I got. If other states are able to adopt, it is possible that cement demand could come up maybe in the next regime whoever comes and they take this forward. 

We could see demand come back as far as cement is concerned. But I agree that broadly there is a slowdown as far as the larger real estate is concerned and that remains a concern not only on the slowdown, but also on the way they have been funded. That is of concern for the market.


A very simple dipstick analysis tells us that NBFCs are not lending. There is going to be an asset liability mismatch. What happens if the entire NBFC wheel has already turned? 
My biggest concern for the market is actually the NBFCs and HFCs. I have been speaking about this for almost two years. Today my concern is not so much on the NBFCs especially the retail, my concern is more on the HFCs because of the way they are structured. Mortgage is only 60-65% of their book, rest is all builder and LAP. We do not know what is happening there because the regulation, because they come under NHB and it is a very weak regulator. We really do not know if the numbers being thrown out by some of these companies are true and fair. They are very similar to how the banks were three years back. 

None of us believe the NPA numbers. Today after what we see, most of us can say 90% of it is true. But for an HFC, a corporate facing or a body with large exposure to builders, we hardly see any NPA from builders. 

In my view there needs to be an AQR. People like Arvind Subramanian have also raised this point that there should be an AQR for HFCs and NBFCs. It is only then that confidence would return in this sector and funding will start. 

Incrementally, they are not getting funding. Maybe the top three-four are getting funding. The rest are not getting any funding. Barring the top three, mutual funds have shut shop for many of the other NBFCs. There is a trouble here. Whenever the new government comes, they, along with RBI have to figure out a way to resolve this mess. 


What are you buying which is looking distressed? Are you buying autos, consumers, metals because of the trade warfare?
So autos, yes, because as we think this is a cyclical slowdown and you are getting companies with brand, with cash flows, with no debt and at valuations which are fairly compelling right now.


Define what is attractive -- Eicher is 25 times, Maruti is 30 times, two-wheelers are teens?
You can look at the other two-wheelers also. I do not want to name companies but there are enough two-wheelers available which are...


Paanch to company hai total (there are five companies in total)?
That is for you to guess and the investors to guess. There is opportunity available there. I think that autos in general and auto ancillaries have corrected significantly. If auto were to come back, auto ancillaries will also come back. That is a space which looks quite interesting.


What about metals and consumption?
Metals are really stock-specific trades. I really cannot say that all of them will move together and we do have some exposure in metals, based on the past and we continue to hold many of them. 

On consumption, we are better off with discretionary than with staples. We prefer the discretionary consumption over staples because even through the stocks have corrected, but not significantly. Their earnings and volume growths have significantly corrected. If you see the last five, six results, volume growths have come off from double digits to single digit in some cases and low single digits,

That remains a concern and risk reward is not looking favourable right now there.


What about telecom? How do you approach this entire scenario now?
Normally, my view is when you have a pricing war between various players, you are better off being a consumer than a minority shareholder. I am enjoying all the data that I am getting right now.


Even with the leader?
Whether it is the leader or the follower, I am enjoying all the data that I am getting. I can watch anywhere, everywhere.


Not getting call drops?
That is the concern. When you have so much, your quality does go down but jokes apart, that is the broad view. It is very tough to take a call. 


There are sectors which have gone through serious pain; hotels, telecom, real estate. Will the leaders survive?
Of course.


There were 12 telecom players, now there are three. You can only buy two, one has got a bad balance sheet, one is still a formidable market leader. Does it make sense to take a slightly cyclical view?
Where the risk reward is good, it is worth it. I am not saying that we are completely away from telecom so that is an interesting sector where we know that maybe in a six to 12 months time things will change. This pricing war cannot continue for infinite time. The leader should be able to maintain his leadership position or at least profitability may come back. Those are risks one has to take as a fund manager. Some of them are reaching there from a value standpoint.


Sunil Mittal said in Davos his ambition is not to be the biggest but to be the most profitable telecom player and he actually quoted Kotak Mahindra Bank. What is your view?
Promoters have changed over the last 10 years. Ten years ago, most promoters wanted to diversify, get into a different country, do some other business. After the mayhem, better sense is prevailing and they are realising one is better off with core competency and small is fine. There is no point going into other businesses. But this awareness has come at the cost of a lot of pain to minority shareholders. 
I would say that it is good that sense is prevailing because even minority shareholders will make money in the long run. 


In the next two to three months, do you think all this euphoria around the election would settle down? The trade war would be in the price and the markets would be back to attempting a fresh high or not in such a hurry?
Honestly, it is a very tough to call to take in the short term because we have seen in the past that event risks have such volatile movements in the market that even if I want, I will not be able to make a constructive assessment of that. All I can say is that in the medium-term, India is poised and looks interesting. 

The tax to GDP could possibly go up because of the way GST is structured and we could see more collections as time goes by. I did meet the GST commissioner in Tamil Nadu and he was very happy with the GST collections and in fact he suggested that I do not even want to do any raids because collections are quite good.


So in six months it will all settle down?
Exactly. Once it settles down, we will see more people in the tax net and once GST settles down, people will be happy that they are getting offsets, they are getting more funding because they are coming under GST. Markets look poised for a rally but a lot depends on how the next government takes some of these reforms forward."
10,2019-05-10,Eicher,"Quantum SecuritiesI will remain positive on capital goods and engineering and infrastructure space, said Neeraj Dewan, Director, Quantum Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

US is going ahead with the tariff hikes against China. What will be the implications in terms of impact on equities?
What happens globally definitely has an impact on India though we are not directly impacted by the trade tariffs put up by US on China. Once this comes through, then there can be some pressure on global growth which will in turn have an impact on the flows which are coming to emerging markets. In the last few days, the FII flow figures have been negative. They have been selling again.

The renewed buying which we were hoping for may not come if the tariffs and reciprocal tariffs are imposed and global growth concerns come back, People will be more cautious and liquidity will not be that great. 

Domestically also, we have very important cues coming up, which is showing up in slowdown in FMCG stocks. One would like to be cautious for some more time.


Do you think the slowdown is priced in Eicher Motors? We are not going in with very gung-ho expectations. Where does Eicher go from here?
One good thing about the numbers that have been coming in from the auto pack is that we know what to expect. Expectations are low and the stock has already corrected from the high levels. The valuations are now more reasonable. Even if the numbers are muted as expected, unless and until there is a very significant downside on the numbers, the stock will not react in a big way on the negative side. The stock may in fact bounce back also because bad numbers are already priced in.


What about Reliance? Do you buy this decline or do you wait it out because of concerns with regard to the huge debt on the balance sheet and the core business not contributing as much?
I would wait it out because you are not getting that FII flow back. In the last couple of months, the market was doing well because FII money was chasing these four-five stocks, and they were becoming more expensive. Now because that buying has stopped or selling is back, these positions are getting reversed. 

More or less the concerns regarding their core business, oil and gas business, is also there in the stock. Though I am positive on the telecom and the retail front, I would be a buyer at some point but I would wait it out. The stock may not correct a lot but there can be some time correction in the stock.

.I will see when the circumstances are reflecting that you are getting a renewed buying coming back from institutions and then Reliance can again get back on the radar as far as buying is concerned from FIIs. 


Why do you feel FMCG could be a potential sector to look at?
There are concerns on the global front. There are concerns on the domestic growth front as well. We are not very sure of what is going to happen on the political front. So everything is negative and we are only looking at the negative part. 

But FMCG stocks, specifically staples, have actually been trading at very high valuations. And because of this slowdown, it is an opportunity where we are getting them at decent valuation. Stocks like Hindustan Lever, Dabur, Godrej Consumer, have corrected and their performance have been very great. 

There can be one or two quarters here and there but if you see a trend over the last three to five years, the CAGR growth have been tremendous and the volume growth is also picking up for most of these companies. These are the opportunities where we are getting these companies at decent valuations. We are getting these companies at 35 or less than 35 times next year earnings. That is the opportunity to buy some of these companies.


What about corporate banks? I understand that some of these corporate banks are longer-term plays but in the near term, the market is still a little nervous when it comes to financials?
Yes, the market is nervous because the liquidity crisis has again come back post September. We had this fear of liquidity crisis which we are going through now, plus a lot of these corporates have pledged shares and exposure to some of these corporate banks. So, that concern is there. 

But the major part of the concern is that a lot of these things have already again been priced in some of these corporate banks. One needs to be very selective when you are looking at corporate banks also. 

There will be the largecaps which have all again corrected, even a bank like State Bank of India. 

There are other parts of banks which are exposed to MSME lending. We like some of the stocks which were lending to MSMEs because MSME as a sector has come out of a lot of trouble in the last three, four years because of GST and demonetisation. 

Now that they are out of all that trouble, again that sector is picking up. Some corporate banks which are exposed to them have opportunities in that sector also. One needs to be selective but at this price also, there are opportunities even from a medium to long-term perspective. 


Looking at a liquidity squeeze coming up, would you be bullish on cyclicals, infra, capital goods pockets?
Yes, because there are two factors; one is that interest rates are still low and the order books are very healthy. So once you are out of this election period, you are going to get that capex cycle coming back again. It may have slowed down temporarily and the coming back may take a quarter or two, but I am positive looking at the order books and looking at the interest rate scenario because of low inflation in the country, it is bound to come back. 

A lot of the private sector also had held to their capex because of the liquidity crisis in the last quarter, last year plus because of the impending elections.

Capex also has to come back and though it may have got delayed by a quarter or two, it is very much on the cards and it should come in the next two, three quarters. I will remain positive on capital goods and engineering and infrastructure space."
11,2019-05-10,Eicher,"Eicher Motors on Friday reported 18 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 544.84 crore for the quarter ended March 31. Analysts in an ET NOW poll had projected a profit of Rs 542 crore.

The company had posted a net of Rs 461.53 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

Consolidated revenue from operations, however, fell to Rs 2,500.08 crore from Rs 2,528.01 crore in the corresponding period last year. Ebitda of the company declined 14 per cent YoY to Rs 685 crore.

The board of the company also recommended a final dividend aggregating Rs 341.03 crore (or Rs 125 per share) for the financial year ended March 31. The payout stood at Rs 299.93 crore, or Rs 110 per share last year.

The company announced its earnings post market hours. Earlier in the day, the scrip closed 0.23 per cent higher at Rs 20,329.25 apiece.

The company sold 1,97,567 Royal Enfield motorcycles during March quarter, registering a decline of 13 per cent from 2,26,907 units in the same period last year.

“The latter half of 2018 was a challenging period for the two-wheeler industry with factors such as revision in insurance cost, increase in prices on account of new safety norms, affected consumer sentiment. At Royal Enfield, we recorded flat sales volumes after several years of augmented sales growth. Despite a challenging fourth quarter, the trend of premiumisation continues to show significant potential,” said Siddhartha Lal, Managing Director of Eicher Motors.

In the commercial vehicles space, VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV) -- Eicher’s joint venture with Volvo -- was affected by the industry slowdown, especially in the later part of the year.

For the quarter ended March 31, VECV’s revenue from operations was 3 per cent lower at Rs 3,209 crore against Rs 3,317 crore in the same period last year.

The unit’s Ebitda declined 13 per cent to Rs 274 crore from Rs 315 crores in the same period last year. Profit after tax slipped 22 per cent to Rs 139 crore from Rs 177 crore on a yearly basis.

VECV sold 21,010 trucks and buses during the quarter, registering a decline of 9 per cent YoY.

On VECV’s performance, Siddhartha said: “While registering a decline in the fourth quarter, VECV finished the year at par with the industry growth of 12 per cent. The market conditions were adverse due to all-time high price discounting. VECV entered Indonesia and South Africa with Kuzer under the UD brand. We continue to believe that we can be the catalyst to drive modernisation of commercial transportation in India and other developing markets.”"

Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on KEC International with a target price of ₹350. KEC's fourth quarter numbers were a mixed bag-while revenue and EBITDA missed estimates, balance sheet improvement was encouraging, said Edelweiss. While order book and order pipeline are healthy, the management's 15-20% revenue guidance for FY20 looks a tad on the lower side, probably indicating persistence of a few domestic execution challenges, the brokerage said..

• Anand Rathi has maintained buy rating on Visaka Industries with a target price of ₹495. Higher selling and branding expenses along with losses due to a delay in the Jhajjar plant commencement and losses in ATUM resulted in Visaka’s restrained operating performance in the fourth quarter, said Anand Rathi. The yarn division’s better performance is another positive, said Anand Rathi. 

• CLSA has maintained sell rating on Shriram Transport Finance Company with a target price of ₹ 960. The brokerage expects a pick-up towards second half with 14%-15% growth in AUM in FY20-21. Asset quality showed some improvement with a fall in stage-3 loans to 8.4%, but the brokerage is concerned by aggressive growth in rural markets and business loans. Clarity on the group structure is awaited and may be a medium-term overhang, said CLSA. The stock ended up 0.29% at ₹1,030.85 on Thursday.

• Jefferies has maintained hold rating on Titan Company with a target price of ₹1,100. Titan continues to execute strongly in terms of design aspect, new customer acquisition and store expansion coupled with strong market share gains continuing since demonetisation given industry headwinds, said Jefferies. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained buy rating on Brigade Enterprises with a target price of ₹290. Brigade ended FY19 with a strong performance on the residential business, with 83% YoY growth in pre-sales at ₹16.5 billion and an exit quarter performance of ₹5.2 billion, aspiring for a 30% YoY increase in FY20 on the higher base, the brokerage said.

Analyst calls
• IIFL has maintained buy rating on HCL Technologies with a target price of ₹1,250. The brokerage believes that a pick-up in organic revenue growth in FY20 is essential for rerating of the stock and strong deal wins provide visibility in the medium term for the company.

 • Edelweiss has downgraded Tata Steel to hold from buy and cut target price to ₹520 from ₹600 on the European Commission's non-approval of JV of Tata Steel Europe with ThussenKrupp's Steel Europe. Owing to the JV between TSE and TK-SE not going through, the brokerage said it finds incremental value in the stock undermined. 

• ICICIdirect has downgraded Apollo Tyres to hold and revised target price to ₹180. Apollo Tyres posted a weak set of numbers for the fourth quarter, the brokerage said. Apollo Tyres is amid aggressive capex spend, which will stretch its balance sheet with no meaningful free cash flow generation over FY19-FY21, said ICICIdirect. 

• IDBI Capital has downgraded Eicher Motors to reduce from hold and revised target price lower to ₹18,777 from ₹19,860. The brokerage firm has maintained cautious view on success of 650 twins in coming times and does not expect any major revival for products such as the Classic in the near term. 

• CLSA has downgraded Cadila Healthcare to sell from buy and cut target price to ₹250 from ₹430 after the US drug regulator issued 14 observations on the company's Moraiya plant. The brokerage has cut US sales forecasts by 12-17% over FY20-FY21 assuming delays in approvals and disruption in existing supplies due to remedial action.

17,2019-05-13,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Eicher Motors declined over 7 per cent in trade on Monday after the company on Friday reported an 18 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 544.84 crore for the quarter ended March 31. 

The board of the company also recommended a final dividend aggregating Rs 341.03 crore (or Rs 125 per share) for the financial year ended March 31. 

The numbers it seems have failed to excite the market. Brokerage HDFC Securities has maintained its sell recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 18,900. 

""We reiterate sell as Royal Enfield’s over 30 per cent margins are behind in our view. We are building in 27.7/27.5 per cent over FY20/21 for RE business, respectively,"" said the brokerage.

The brokerage sees the demand environment to be weak even as competition (Jawa) has commenced product deliveries. New product launches and foreign forays are time-consuming, with returns expected with a lag and earnings growth falling to single digit over FY19-21E, the brokerage said.

Edelweiss has maintained its buy recommendation on the stock but cut the target price to Rs 23,386 from Rs 23,781. ""Our FY19–21E EPS CAGR of 21 per cent factors weak volume growth in FY20, followed by pick up in FY21 as the premiumisation trend sustains,"" said the brokerage.

18,2019-05-13,Eicher,"Very few good performing names of the earlier midcap cycle are continuing to do well in the next one. You have to wipe the slate clean and relook at the market, said Prateek Agarwal, Business Head & Chief Investment Officer, ASK Investment Manager, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Last week, there was a 4% fall in the index. Considering US-China trade talks are still uncertain and in the run up to the election outcome back home, what do you expect from the market this week?
Yes, that would be a fair assessment. US-China trade talks on the margin may actually help other countries, including India. But while there is uncertainty about China being such a large part of the emerging market basket, when people pull out monies from the emerging market funds and if the fund manager sells across-the-board, then even India ends up selling. 

This is something where the short term and the medium term conflicts happen in the market. For some time, till the trade issues settle, we should be expecting continued selling. Moreover, political uncertainty will go in 10-odd days but then also, the result season has been lacklustre, the breadth of the good, nice, positive numbers are not there. We are seeing a slowdown and the market is reflecting that.


Are you sticking to Bajaj Finance, L&T, HDFC, HDFC Bank or do you think this is the time to start buying midcaps now?
We are sticking to the earlier names that you suggested. We do not believe this is the time to look at midcaps. Midcaps for the new cycle will emerge. The classic thing that one has to remember in midcaps is that very few good performing names of the earlier cycle are continuing to do well in the next one. You have to wipe the slate clean and relook at the market and time for that will come in the future. It is just not there as of now.


The traditional defensive plays are not really providing an opportunity apart from select names here and there. Where does one go and look for a safe haven in a market like this?
One area in the marketplace where you get a combination of some amount of valuation comfort and continued strong growth is financials. Apart from names in the NBFC and banking space, names in the insurance and mutual fund space interest us. Given the low penetration, these spaces can continue to grow very strongly for several years. We also like companies which are exposed to the microfinance space where the supply versus demand still is a very large gap. So this is one big area of interest.

While the consumption space lacks valuation comfort, certain niche companies in the jewellery space, are nicely positioned. We are looking for companies which are dominating the spaces which are growing well. In this space, Titan is very nicely positioned and is something that interests us for sure.


We are looking at earnings. Although L&T guidance, the order flow were impressive, the stock is down. Eicher Motors was a mixed bag. Margins were a dampener and the stock is sharply lower. Where within autos are you finding an opportunity?
In autos, you get monthly numbers and you are prepared for the quarterly numbers. Thus, quarterly numbers themselves will not impact the stock prices too much. What happens or is continuing to happen in terms of numbers on a monthly basis is what causes concerns and impacts. We believe that a period of slowdown will continue in autos. We have reduced our exposure to the space. 

We believe the slowdown will be there because of several reasons; one, cities still account for over 40% part of auto sales and in most cities, there is no place to drive, people are leaving cars home and taking public transport. So, where is the need to buy a new one? 

Two, the overall cost of ownership has gone up considerablly. It is not only fuel prices, parking prices have moved up sharply and in many parts, you have to own a parking. The parking may cost more than the car itself. 

Third, the electrical vehicles (EV) are coming in. Anything that you buy just now may just look fuddy-duddy over the next one or two years. Some people may be pausing for that as well, apart from the price increase and the taxation increase and the insurance led price increase. 

We believe there is some slowdown to be expected. We believe the biggest reason is the low ability to drive on roads. A the infrastructure gets built and roads get freer, we would again see a bump-up in car sales.


Are you sitting on cash or significantly higher cash in the runup to the election? Is it better to protect right now? This is a market which is reasonably priced and there is a marked slowdown in consumers. So, even if markets like the verdict, Nifty will not go to 15,000 very soon. What do you do in this kind of a scenario?
We stay fully invested, but I am sure our investors are keeping money on the sidelines. That is something that we are definitely feeling. Any large investor that we speak to, wants the election uncertainty to be over before committing their entire money. We continue to get flows but a large part of that flows are happening through systematic transfer plans. Not everything has been put into the market immediately. 

That said, we are also telling investors who have to invest into the equity markets -- people who can stay on the sidelines forever, it does not apply to them -- that invest on both the legs of the elections. I agree with you valuations are not cheap, just about defendable at this juncture. If the verdict is as per what the market desires, you would get 8%-9% kind of a bump-up quickly and then post elections, the ability to invest the entire money after elections would not be there. People will be worrying on the valuations much more than they are doing now. So, we are actually telling people to invest on both the legs of the election outcome.


We are watching out also for ITC today. Any kind of concern that is building up as you view these counters?
We understand that the NBFC slowdown or credit crunch is impacting FMCGs, which have a higher percentage of distributor-led sales. Companies like Levers. who are able to address or own most of their distribution network and do not rely so much on the distributor-led model, are less impacted, whereas other companies where this percentage is higher are more impacted because the NBFCs fund a lot of distributors and there may be a cash crunch. 

If distributors are unable to pick stuff from the wholesalers or from the company, the stuff is not getting pushed into the end shops. That is the reading that we have. It should get addressed as the liquidity position in the NBFC space gets addressed. We believe it will take some time so anybody who is looking at the space should be prepared for that. That said, elections are on and there will be a lot of spending post elections. With the money that people now have in the bank account on account of that Rs 6,000 the government is already sending to farmers, that should have some impact on the smaller category consumption items like small electrical, heaters, electric wires apart from FMCG stuff and that is a part we are focussed on."
19,2019-05-13,Eicher,"Banking is where the cheer is and non-BFSI is probably where the real drag is at this moment, said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


Anything from the earnings this weekend that may have stood out for you besides L&T?
One should keep an eye on the overall Nifty 50 earnings. As we speak, 25 companies have posted the results and the BFSI numbers are appearing to be quite robust and probably can compensate for the slowdown that it is clearly witnessed in the non-BFSI space. The non-BFSI earnings have grown just 5% out of the 18 companies that they have posted. In the BFSI space, on the other hand, be it because of the low base effect or the losses that the banks have posted over the last few years and few quarters, banking is appearing to be a reasonably positioned. 

But by the end of the season, at least at the Nifty 50 level, we may have at best a stable or muted earning season. We have to live with it because Nifty had rallied so much to justify the valuations and to stay for the Nifty at the elevated levels. It may be a difficult place. There was a lot of damage at the midcap and smallcap related earning season, though all in all, we will have to wait for few more quarters for the uptick to take place. Banking is where the cheer is and non-BFSI is probably where the real drag is at this moment. 


Given that the market has been a little nervous about the squeeze with regards to NBFCs, and the corporate affairs secretary has talked about how we may see further turmoil there. On the other hand, earnings have been fairly stable for some key corporate banks. What is your take away?
In terms of the NBFC point, we firmly believe that the Capital First and IDFC transaction which went through and successfully created the merger, probably may not become the template for each and every transaction out there. I am sure RBI will go through each and every transaction on its merits. Many relatively not-so-strong banks are looking for merger so that they will have the NBFC platform and NBFCs are looking at an opportunity to enter into banking in an indirect manner. 

While there is credible win-win situation for both banks and NBFCs in this kind of arrangement, we have to ensure whether all the mergers will really make sense from the overall compliance and the overall banking industry positioning point of view. We have to take it very slowly. Investors will have to keep an eye on how RBI approaches the whole thing. 

I personally believe IDFC and Capital First was probably relatively easier decision for the RBI to take and for some of the other mergers that are on the table, probably RBI will take more thoughtful decisions in terms of how to go about. 

As for PSU related bankings and the earnings season, SBI because of the heavy provisioning that they have done in the previous quarters, turned into profit this time. That was good to see. But, as we speak, more and more commercial paper related and liquidity related issues keep coming almost on a daily basis. Till the time, that settles down, it will be difficult to believe whether the banking and especially the PSU banking related issues are out of the woods. 

As we speak, a lot of repair work has been done over the last two to three years and that is definitely working in favour of banking.


 How closely are you tracking some of the earnings that we have seen this time? What is your strategy on some of these names -- be it discretionary like auto or FMCG?
Even before the earning season started, the slowdown in the auto industry was quite evident and the best part is, the market entered the earning season expecting very muted earning season from the auto sector. But what came as clear surprise in the current earnings season is the stark slowdown on the consumption theme. 

It is right in the face and very difficult to ignore. Make no mistake, the India story has been clearly the consumption theme in the last four-five or may be 10 years or so. That entire story is coming under a big question mark and those stocks are not undervalued. In the consumption space, It is very difficult to find any stock below 40 times or 50 times price to earnings. Keeping that into account, if things do not improve soon, I think there is a very risk of de-rating on the consumption theme. 

Let us hope that post elections the confidence will be back and once the liquidity settles down, hopefully, consumption will come back. Else, we may be witnessing a de-rating of some of the popular consumption names. Whether we like it or not, they hold majority percentage holdings in many mutual funds and many large portfolios in India. The portfolios may start underperforming. The underperformance in Nifty can be quite stark if the consumption related stocks start doing badly. It is at a very critical crossroads. 


What did you make of Eicher’s numbers? Do you buy this decline in Eicher just yet?
The volume growth in Eicher Motors has been very slow for quite some time. That is likely to continue and as we discussed, the stock is by no means undervalued. Probably, some more pain may be evident. And that is true across the auto sector. 

In the case of Eicher Motors, because of heavy dependence on single brand and single model, that probably will speak more. So more time is needed for auto stocks to move aggressively.

But having said that, it is a clear contrarian theme at this juncture. Keep it more from the accumulation point of view as you will get your opportunities at much lower levels. There is no need to be aggressive there."

Nifty continued its weakness for the ninth consecutive session as every bounce got sold into in the market on Monday. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and continued to form lower highs and lows for past six sessions, indicating weakness.

As long as it remains below 11,350 level, weakness could continue towards 11,088 and then 11,000 levels, while on the upside hurdles are seen in the 11,320 -11,350 zone.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 10,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 level. There was Call writing at 11,500 followed by 11,700 levels, while minor put writing was seen at strike price 11,200. The Option band signified a shift in the lower trading range to 11,000-1600 zones.

India VIX moved up 3.09 per cent to 27.15 level. A higher VIX suggests volatile swings could continue in the market till the election outcome.

Bank Nifty consolidated for most part of the day but witnessed strong selling pressure in the last hour of the session. It formed a Bearish Candle on daily scale and failed to hold above 28,888 level, as it extended losses and headed towards 28,600 level.

22,2019-05-13,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Marking its longest losing streak since 2011, equity benchmark Nifty closed with a deep cut for the ninth session in a row on Monday. 

Speculations over the US-China trade talks and uncertainty over the outcome of India's general election kept the market depressed.

“Investors are keeping themselves away, as there is ambiguity over US-China trade talks. Uncertainty over election results is another factor making investors nervous,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICIdirect.

Sensex fell 372 points, or 0.99 per cent, to 37,090 while Nifty closed 131 points, or 1.16 per cent, lower at 11,148. In the last nine sessions, both Sensex and Nifty have plunged 5 per cent each.


We walk you through the highlights of Monday's session:

Rs 8.5 lakh crore gone so farIn the market fall in last nine sessions, investors have lost over Rs 8.5 lakh crore as overall market capitalisation has dropped to Rs 1,44,55,039.74 crore from Rs 1,53,08,828.49 crore on April 26. On Monday alone, investors lost nearly Rs 2.12 lakh crore.


300 stocks hit 52-week lowsMahindra & Mahindra, Sun Pharma, Bharat Forge, Biocon, Cadila Healthcare, CEAT, Eicher Motors, IDBI Bank, Wockhardt, Reliance Capital, Phillips Carbon Black and Motherson Sumi Systems were among the 289 stocks that hit 52-week lows on BSE. Meanwhile, DCM Shriram, Merck and MT Educare were among the 25 stocks that touched 52-week highs.


PSU bank, pharma pack tankWhile the selloff was widespread, PSU banks and pharma stocks were among the worst hit. Nifty PSU Bank index closed 5 per cent down, finishing the day as top sectoral loser. It was followed by Nifty Pharma index, which lost 4.37 per cent. The pharma pack as a whole reacted to reports of a lawsuit against Teva Pharma and 19 other generic companies in the US. Names of some Indian companies in the lawsuit spooked investors. 


HDFC shares rise on Q4 numbersShares of HDFC closed 1.06 per cent higher at Rs 1,951, ending as top gainer in the Sensex pack, as better-than-expected March quarter numbers buoyed investor sentiment. The company reported a 26.80 per cent year-on-year rise in standalone profit at Rs 2,861 crore, which was better than Rs 2,600 crore profit that analysts had estimated in an ETNow poll. 


Jet shares nosedive 8%Breaking the winning streak of the last three sessions, shares of Jet Airways closed 8.14 per cent down at Rs 139.45 after media reports said a buyout offer from Etihad Airways was non-binding and might not guarantee a deal for Jet.


ITC falls 3% after Q4 resultsShares of ITC closed 2.64 per cent down at Rs 289.85, extending losses into the fifth session, as the FMCG major reported an 18.73 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit at Rs 3,481.90 crore compared with Rs 2,932.71 crore net reported for the same quarter last year. 


L&T shares down 3%Shares of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) fell 2.81 per cent to close at Rs 1,317 after the company last Friday reported a 7.91 per cent year-on-year rise in profit (attributable to owners). Brokerages offered mixed views on the numbers and its growth prospects in FY20. YES Securities has downgraded the stock to ‘hold’ with a target price of Rs 1,469. 


Eicher Motors plunges 8%Shares of Eicher Motors ended 7.69 per cent down at Rs 18,766 after the company on Friday reported an 18 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 545 crore for the quarter ended March 31. The numbers failed to excite the market. Brokerage HDFC Securities has maintained its ‘sell’ recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 18,900.

23,2019-05-14,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: The stock of Eicher Motors hit a 52-week low of Rs 18,600 on Monday after the maker of iconic motor bike Royal Enfield reported a nineyear low volume growth for FY19. The stock closed the session at Rs 18,766.4 on the BSE, 7.7 per cent lower than the previous day’s close.

The company has enjoyed premium price-earnings multiple over the past few years due to its pricing power, premium models and sustainable operating margin above 30 per cent, which were nearly double than the mass market bike makers. However, each of these factors now appears to be under threat.

The Royal Enfield volume fell by 14 per cent year-on-year to 1.9 lakh units in the March 2019 quarter, the second quarterly decline in a row. For the full year, it was measly 0.7 per cent higher at 8.26 lakh units, the lowest in at least nine years. The volume of the top-selling bike Classic 350, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of sales dropped by 5 per cent in FY19; a few years ago, the waiting time for its delivery was 8-10 weeks.

The volume growth in the last fiscal year was impacted due to higher cost of ownership on account of new safety norms and higher insurance cost. The pressure on volume is likely to persist in the medium term as demand in urban markets moves closer to the saturation point. In the post-earnings conference call, the company said for the first time inquiries in mature markets have declined. Royal Enfield added 90 dealers in the previous fiscal taking the total number to 915.

The company expects to grow production by 13 per cent to 9.5 lakh units for FY20. The street seems to have little belief in the guidance since most analysts expect flat to low-single-digit volume growth for the year. Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura see projected volume of 8.1and 8.2 lakh units, respectively, for the current fiscal year, which implies a decline in volumes.

In response to rising costs due to regulatory measures, the company has increased prices of Classic 350 by 11-14 per cent since December 2017. The margin at EBITDA (operating margin before depreciation) level fell to 27.8 per cent in the March quarter from 32.3 per cent in the year-ago quarter. The company’s EBITDA margin remained in the range of 30-32 per cent over the past 10 quarters, and in the previous two quarters it fell below 30 per cent. The company expects margin between 25 per cent and 30 per cent in the coming quarters.

Given these factors, the stock has undergone major resetting of volume and margin expectations. The projected earnings per share for the current fiscal is revised downwards by 23 per cent in the past nine months. In June 2018, 71 per cent of the analysts tracking the stock had a ‘buy’ rating. The proportion has dropped to 41 per cent since then.

The stock has underperformed the benchmark indices by over 37 per cent in the past year, and the trend is unlikely to reverse in the nearterm. The stock traded at 20 times the 12-month projected earnings on Monday, a 36 per cent discount to the long-term average."
28,2019-05-14,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty broke a 9-day losing spell on Tuesday as global sentiment improved after the US and China agreed to continue talks to find a resolution to their trade dispute.

""Such rallies confirm that the market has come to terms with the fact that trade war is here to stay and even as the long-term impact can dent profitability of some of the Indian corporates, not much damage will be done to stock prices in the short term,"" said Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities. 

Besides, rupee's rise against the US dollar and softer crude oil prices also influenced investor sentiment, triggering a fresh spell of buying in afternoon trade. 

Heavyweights Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, HDFC and ITC were the top contributors to the rise in Sensex index, in that order.


Let's take a look at the highlights of Tuesday's session:

333 stocks hit 52-week lowsEven as the market managed to close the day with decent gains, as many as 333 stocks hit 52-week lows on BSE. Among them were Hero MotoCorp, Vodafone Idea, Mahindra & Mahindra, Amara Raja Batteries, Apollo Tyres, Bharat Forge, Bosch, Cadila Healthcare, Eicher Motors, JK Tyre, Motherson Sumi Systems and Tata Elxsi. Meanwhile, Atul, DCB Bank, Merck and SRF were among the 24 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


Jet shares fall 7%Extending the losses into the second successive session, shares of Jet Airways ended 7.42 per cent down at Rs 129.10 after it said its Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer Amit Agarwal has resigned due to personal reasons. Post market hours, the company said its CEO Vinay Dube has also resigned from the company. In the last two sessions, shares of the company have come off 15 per cent. 


Vodafone Idea down 3%Shares of Vodafone Idea closed 3.11 per cent lower at Rs 14 after global brokerage CLSA cut the target price on the stock to Rs 12.50 from Rs 27 while maintaining a ‘sell’ recommendation after the company's March quarter numbers. The brokerage said the company missed on revenues and its operating metrics look weak. 


HDFC shares extend gainsShares of HDFC logged gains for the third consecutive session, ending the day 1.10 per cent higher at Rs 1,973.25. The stock gained 3 per cent in the last three days. The company reported a 27 per cent increase in profit for the quarter ended March 201p which received a thumbs-up from brokerages. Global brokerage CLSA said HDFC is its top pick among NBFCs. 


Airtel shares jump 5%Shares of Bharti Airtel closed with a strong gain of 5.40 per cent at Rs 335.75 after, as per a PTI report, the company tweaked its post-paid plans, a move that involves gradual phasing out of offerings that are less than Rs 499 and retaining limited number of plans above it. The move is expected to help the company chase better realisation from mobile subscribers while improving its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).


ITC snaps 5-day losing streakBreaking the losing streak of 5 successive sessions, shares of ITC settled 1.43 per cent up at Rs 294, a day after the FMCG firm reported Rs 3,481 crore profit in line with a Rs 3,201 crore profit estimate that analysts had made in an ET NOW poll. Macquarie and Credit Suisse have 'outperform' ratings on the stock with target prices of Rs 376 and 370, respectively. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan have 'overweight' ratings with target prices of Rs 320 and 340, respectively.


Siemens shares rise after 6 daysAfter six successive sessions of losses, shares of Siemens rose 3.38 per cent to close at Rs 1,086, buoyed by its better-than-expected March quarter results. The company posted 27.6 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 280.3 crore for the March quarter 2019 mainly due to higher revenues. Net profit in March quarter 2018 stood at Rs 219.7 crore. 


43 stocks ready to riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 43 counters on BSE, signalling that these stocks may rise in the coming sessions. Among those stocks were Reliance Power, Alok Industries, DCB Bank, Titan Company, Hexaware Technologies, Usha Martin and Mahamaya Steel.

26,2019-05-14,Eicher,"ITC, HDFC, Ashok Leyland, Titan and UPL are the stocks where Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, is bullish today. He was speaking to ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 


I do not know where to start.
Sell in May is an odd adage and it is held true to the date. Donald Trump and the election uncertainty and weak earnings have all played out. But believe me, this is a brilliant opportunity to buy. The second half of May will be a deceiver and a counter pullback rally is very much on the cards, maybe today or tomorrow, but there is a 600-point rally now waiting to come and the other elephant in the room will be the elections. 

Till then, there will be rumour mongering. But a large part of the fear element may have played out. We think the market will ignore most of the tweets because the damage is already done. But truly, this May has been rather unsettling and we still got the second half to go but I am relatively sanguine. Oversold conditions notwithstanding, we should see some smart pullback in select stocks and the index.


Foreigners were selling. DIIs were buying. The data is exactly the same. Thousand crores of net buying, thousand crores of net selling and yet markets capitulated yesterday.
You can see forward, the US futures and so on. People had an inkling of where this trade war was going. So smart money or the people who are on the trading side saw that weakness get sold into. By the way, data tells you that the 9th day consecutive fall is the first time in eight years. It is telling you how heavily oversold you are and like you mentioned, there is an equal amount of buying and selling just one crore of difference. Then why should you be down 150 points and that too in the last half an hour? . There is a lot of extreme shorts and extreme pessimism but it is not so on the numbers. We know that auto, discretionary, consumption has been a weak spot but look at the positives. If I can name them, cement, corporate banks, capex and construction all these seem to be in a very fine fettle.

It is a glass half full, half empty. I would say the second half of May and beyond should see smart pullback, a counter-trend rally and we will take it from there. The other event would be the elections. But most of the volatility may be in the price now.


What do you do with pharmaceuticals if you are an investor? I do not recall the last time you had Sun Pharma drop down 20 odd per cent in one given day! 9% was the fall yesterday. How do you approach this weakness? Do you buy on dips yet or is that like trying to catch a falling knife?
That’s a good point. It has been in the eye of the storm whether for corporate governance or some of the issues regarding some of the subsidiaries. Now, you are totally rumour driven. We do not know what the impact is but definitely yesterday was the day where the bears have hammered the stock. 

Fundamentally, numbers and some of the generic pricing pressures should ease. They have seen a lot of approvals on the FDA side. If you are a value picker, that whole basket of pharma looks good. We have to ignore the negatives that play out for some time just as President Trump tweets. We know that finally a deal will be reached with China. It is just that the volatility is hurting and same is the case with pharma. 

A lot of the stocks have gone through a lot of the tiring processes but the ones that stand out would be Dr Reddy’s, Lupin and Aurobindo where the price damage is giving you an opportunity. On Sun Pharma, a SIP would be ideal here for the next 16 weeks or 6 months because you could average out on a good stock just because of amalgamation of rumours and some downgrade maybe the cause of the price fall.


Give me a list of three stocks where you are a buyer today.
Not three, I will give you five stocks. It would be ITC, HDFC, Ashok Leyland, Titan and UPL. All five are in different sectors. All earnings are to be upgraded and the pessimism in ITC was overdone. Last week, I travelled to five cities in three states and saw the mood there. These are smaller cities -- some in Gujarat, some in Karnataka -- the mood is not BJP versus… it is Modiji versus the mahagathbandhan irrespective of the candidates.

So my call if I can stick my neck out is 240 to 250 on the BJP, 290 on the NDA and you will cross the mid line aaram se. I think the pessimism is overdone. Let me also specify to the retail investors that gold is no longer the new defensive. The new gold is SIP and that SIP is here to stay not for the next 6, 9, 12 months, for the next many years. So, please do not ignore your SIP, in fact up your exposure because SIP is the new gold for many, many years.


A year ago if I would have spoken about Eicher, before I finished the question, the response which I used to get from everyone was great company, buy the stock. Now it is don’t buy Eicher at Rs 20,000, buy it at Rs 17,000. Your view?
Good point and you have summed it up well. Siddhartha Lal is a visionary. He could look much well beyond. I used to drive the Bullet when I was in college and look at what the Bullet is now. He has transitioned the Bullet into a Harley Davidson concept in India. Pan India, there are 750 outlets and like you said, this is a cyclical slowdown rather than a structural one. I am very sure that Eicher should see volumes, margins all starting to bounce back maybe in the next two quarters. 

The undertone remains that auto is one of the lame ducks and we know a number of reasons, I would not go into that. But I think if you can see some of the CV players (a disclosure we think Ashok Leyland fits the bill), you are talking of 200 airports. You are talking of truck orders which have gone out after the Pulwama attack and for that, Ashok Leyland will stand out heads over others. We think their foray into CIS countries is another modification of their geographical area. I can put my money on Ashok Leyland, Eicher and Bajaj Auto in that order."

36,2019-05-17,Eicher,"ICICI Prudential Asset Management, the country’s second-largest money manager by assets, was busy all through April lapping up beaten down stocks, when the BSE benchmark Sensex advanced around 1 per cent.

The fund house increased exposure to select stocks such as Vodafone Idea, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Avanti Feeds, Bharat Electronics and NBCC, that have plunged 45-72 per cent since January 2018. 

S Naren, ED and CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC said, “The market currently is fairly priced. The strategy in such market condition is to adopt a stock-specific approach. There are several pockets of opportunities across sectors and market capitalisations, where scrips are available at attractive valuations.”

Power, auto ancillaries, metal and telecom looks attractive to Naren.

Vodafone Idea recently concluded a Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, which was oversubscribed nearly 1.08 times. Ace Mutual Fund data base showed ICICI Prudential was holding 46 crore Vodafone Idea shares as of April 30 against 8.77 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house subscribed to the rights issue.



Besides, the fund house bought additional shares of IT majors Infosys (1.30 crore) and Tata Consultancy Services (4 lakh). Infosys last month posted a 10.5 per cent rise in consolidated profit for March quarter at Rs 4,078 crore, and gave a guidance for 7.5-9.5 per cent revenue growth in FY 2019-20. 

TCS reported 17.7 per cent year-on-year growth in March quarter net income at Rs 8,126 crore and Rs 6,904 crore profit. The IT major last Friday once again became India’s most valued firm by market valuation, surpassing Reliance Industries. 

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Infosys with a price target of Rs 782 and a ‘buy’ call on TCS with a price target of Rs 2,312.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added shares of auto players Eicher Motors (5,484 shares), TVS Motor (13 lakh) and Mahindra & Mahindra (4.15 lakh). Financial majors Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank also manage to draw the fund house. 

In the power sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 2.83 crore shares of NTPC, followed by Power Finance Corporation (40 lakh), REC (36 lakh) and Adani Power (1.34 lakh). Antique Stock Broking has ‘buy’ rating on NTPC with a price target of Rs 161.

“With improvement in commissioning and commercialisation, NTPC should see an uptick in operational performance. Further, capacity addition in the next five years will sustain the momentum. We foresee 5-6 per cent capacity addition CAGR,” the brokerage said.

The fund manager also bought auto ancillary shares like Apollo Tyre, Exide Batteries, Motherson Sumi Systems and Amara Raja Batteries.

“I will be a little contrarian on auto and auto ancillaries at this point. Although lead indicators suggest a bit of consumption slowdown, two-wheelers should start looking better. I would probably be a buyer on dips starting with two-wheelers and also in some of the auto components and auto ancillaries. There has been a reasonable price correction because of the overall slowdown,” Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, told ETNOW.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 111 companies, and sold in 116 across sectors. The fund house held 552 stocks as of April 30.

Yes Bank, Axis Bank, Rain Industries, Coal India, ONGC, Bharti Airtel, Federal Bank, SBI, ITC, Suzlon Energy, SpiceJet, ICICI Prudential, Wipro, HDFC, Power Grid, Bank of Baroda, Ambuja Cement, Axis Bank and Zee Entertainment were among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month.

Zee Entertainment shares declined nearly 10 per cent last week amid concerns over stake sale by its promoters.



Total asset under management (AUM) of ICICI Prudential AMC stood at Rs 3.30 lakh crore as of April 30, 2019. It was followed by SBI Funds Management (Rs 2.97 lakh crore) and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC (Rs 2.50 lakh crore) in terms of AUM. HDFC Asset Management stood market leader with total AUM of Rs 3.47 lakh crore."

Analyst calls• Reliance Securities has maintained buy rating on JK Tyre and Industries and revised target price to ₹115 from Rs 135. The brokerage said that the company may face challenging environment in the near-term, while its performance is expected to improve from second half of FY20 owing to sustained growth in sales volume, reduction in manpower cost and better cost control. 

• Edelweiss has downgraded Bajaj Finserv to reduce from hold and revised target price to ₹6,481 from ₹5,948 after rolling over valuation to September 2020. Bajaj Finserv reported a mixed performance in the fourth quarter with strong momentum in the financing business and lower profitability in general insurance as well as life insurance, said Edelweiss. 

 • Kotak Securities has a buy rating on Phoenix Mills with a target price of ₹754. Rental renegotiations, new project launches, and completion of under-construction assets are likely to maintain healthy performance for the company going forward, said Kotak Securities. Residential revenues are likely to witness contraction going forward due to revenue recognition largely done during FY19, it said. 

 • Nomura has maintained buy rating on Minda Industries and reduced target price to ₹454 from ₹490. Minda Industries' fourth quarter revenue growth of 8% year-on-year and EBITDA margins at 12.5% were largely in line with our forecast and the consensus estimate, said Nomura. Minda remains a key beneficiary of rising content in vehicles and regulatory push driving adoption of safety and BS-VI, said Nomura.

 • CLSA has maintained buy rating on Jammu & Kashmir Bank and rolled forward target price to ₹68 from ₹50. For the fourth quarter, the bank’s profit was ahead of estimates aided by a better top-line and treasury gains, said CLSA. The bank’s CASA franchise is strong, at 51% of deposits and its focus on home state retail loans will help improve profitability,it added.

41,2019-05-21,Eicher,"If you have a stable government and lower interest rates, then maybe the Nifty, Sensex companies may not be the right place for investors to look at parking their money. We could see a turnaround taking place in the midcap stocks, said Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


It was a surprisingly big move yesterday. It almost seemed like the market is in a hurry to get all of it done by 23rd?
It is facing some resistance at higher levels and there is some amount of realisation that even if the new government was to come into power, the older problems still remain. Also, what is the strategy for the new government going to be faced with all the challenges in the economy? 

Overall I think some amount of absence of follow up buying is also taking place. There are fears about global markets as well and that is also affecting the sentiment but let us just wait and see what happens on the 23rd. If we have a solid number coming in for BJP and NDA, you could see gradual rejuvenation of the markets and overall improvement in sentiment.

A lot of investments and consumption is waiting on the sidelines for this election result to be over and done with. We could see that coming back into action and play post May 23rd. Also, one thing affecting the sentiment is the poor Q4 numbers. Apart from cement and a few NBFCs and may be private sector banks, by and large, the quarterly numbers have been disappointing and as such investors are very perturbed about turnaround in corporate profits.

We have been expecting it for several quarters and it has not been happening so that is resulting in a narrow range of movement for only the companies which have been able to deliver good performance. So, there are a few issues and speed breakers at this point of time, but I am hopeful that going forward, a lot of the issues will eventually get resolved.


How much anticipation are you tracking the election results with? Do you feel that we are almost in the clear or would you still be incredibly cautious on Thursday just to make sure the exit polls got it right?Investors ought to be cautious. One is an exit poll and the other is the actual result. You should always be prepared that the actual result may materially differ from what the exit poll was. At least, since the results have been out we have not been chasing any stocks or advising investors to put money to work. It is better to wait for the election numbers to come through. 

If the numbers are slightly lower than what the exit polls predicted, there could be a minor disappointment, slight decline in the sentiment and could have a sell on news type of syndrome playing out. It is best to just wait and watch. There will be a lot of opportunities to get into stocks.

Notwithstanding what move we saw yesterday, there will be many opportunities. One should just wait for the air to completely clear out as far as the election results are concerned and then perhaps take the plunge and decide on medium to long-term strategies. Also, stock selection may change if there is a change of government. Also important will be what the next government’s focus areas are going to be. That will come through perhaps in the budget or initial communication from the new government. 

It is best to just wait and watch. In any case, there is an earnings season underway and one would not want to buy into companies where the earnings are still left to come because there could always be nasty surprises. This is an ideal time to just sit tight, conserve liquidity and wait for opportunities once there is more certainty on earnings front and on political front. 


You seem to be looking at rate sensitives more favourably. Is that also in anticipation of a rate cut that seems inevitable or are you looking deeper into that arena?It is clearly based on interest rates going down steadily and the June policy of RBI is very important. It will be the first policy after the new government and if interest rates do come off at that point of time, then certainly it will be very positive. That is what the street is expecting. 

Also, there is the Jalan Committee report which we are looking forward to and if any there is transfer of dividend from the RBI to the centre, then that also would ease fiscal pressure and reduce government borrowing and that would give some amount of levy to the government to reduce taxes and give a boost to the economy. 

Lower interest rates are extremely positive for our economy and immediately results in rising consumption of automobiles and real estate and certain other non-discretionary products. That in itself has a chain effect down the line and we see ancillary units and then basic materials also start to do much better.

Broadly, if inflation remains under control and monsoons are as expected pretty much normal, than you were looking at benign inflation scenario and that should lead to lower interest rates and that could certainly be a trigger point for the markets to move up.


The Tata Motors management is claiming they are going to have that turnaround and we have seen brief periods of intense action on that stock price as well. Your view?We are not very positive on Tata Motors. It is a complicated company with a high degree of volatility in their earnings and JLR is difficult to get a handle on. Sometimes China does well and sometimes US does well and sometimes Europe does badly. Then there is this entire hedge strategy of theirs which also tends to confuse investors. 

There is just no sustainability of visibility of earnings as far as Tata Motors is concerned. The only reason to buy Tata Motors is perhaps its cheap valuation, apart from that there is very little in terms of what investors can make a projection of for the domestic business or for JLR for that matter. I would say it is best to avoid Tata Motors which is a highly complex and difficult to track and follow.

Within the auto space, the best pick still remains passenger car manufacturer like Maruti or a premium two-wheeler player like an Eicher Motors where there is some visibility that once this trough in the auto sales is over and done with, we will see revival in the auto industry and at least the market leaders will be the first to benefit from the volume growth that will come into the industry.


Would you buy more of the same? How much more ICICI Bank or Axis or Bajaj Finance? Do you think that once the uncertainty and the event risk of 23rd is behind us, maybe newer names would participate if there were to be a rally?
If you have a stable government and lower interest rates, then maybe the Nifty, Sensex companies may not be the right place for investors to look at parking their money. We could see a turnaround taking place in the midcap stocks. The midcap indices have been lagging Nifty, Sensex for many months now and that kind of underperformance seems to be unsustainable. 

A lot of midcap stocks are available at very attractive valuations having corrected anywhere from 30 to 50% from their top. So if you are convinced that gradually the political uncertainty, the monsoon uncertainty, the RBI uncertainty is getting resolved, which I think will happen by mid July-August or so, we could see a bull market coming back in to small midcap companies and across-the-board, auto ancillaries, cement companies, infrastructure companies, real estate companies, the smaller automobile manufacturers, to an extent some of these building material type of companies, appliances, media and entertainment coming into play. There is a wide variety of choice when it comes to small and midcap companies. There are many in the financial services space also which are quite attractive. 

So I would like to position our portfolio more towards midcap stocks once we are convinced that the May 23rd result has gone down well with the market and we have a stable government and monsoons are generally going to be okay and interest rate regime is going to be kind of soft going forward. 

2019 will be the year where you may see the midcaps starting to outperform the larger cap because end of the day the large index stocks be it Reliance or HDFC Bank or Bajaj Finance, HUL are priced to perfection and their earnings also are going to definitely slowdown because of the base effect and there is hardly any scope for the PEs for these companies to get rerated upwards. 

A government investment is one where you can see the alpha happening in the earnings and the PE multiple also expanding and those sort of scenario you will find more in the small, midcap stocks at this point of time than in some of the large index stocks which have frankly held up the index and that has led to a high degree of underperformance for the midcap indices. 


How would you advice investors to approach the NBFC space?We are very positive on NBFCs and apart from two or three NBFCs where clearly there has been a downgrade and which have some issues with NPAs, by and large most NBFCs have been able to manage the crisis pretty well. Those NBFCs which are connected with large business houses or which have been around for several decades have done pretty well. But they have curbed their lending because of fear that they may not get resources to lend going forward and there may be redemption, which is why they are sitting on higher cash levels as well. 

At the same time, they want to protect their capital adequacy. There are certain short-term challenges for the NBFC sector but by and large, we are seeing those getting resolved. At the same time, this provisioning for IL&FS also has dampened sentiment for a few NBFCs as well as few private sector banks and public sector banks as well. 

You need to give them some more time -- may be a quarter or two and once there is more clarity on IL&FS, once we see the debt markets getting back into rhythm and once these NBFCs get the resources to lend, you will see that their growth rates picking up and valuations become very attractive.

There are some pockets within NBFCs which despite the credit crisis have done exceedingly well like micro finance or gold loans and investors could look at those companies where not much has changed over the past few months or so."
42,2019-05-22,Eicher,"I am extremely bullish on all India centric plays and that includes select autos and insurance, said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP markets and corporate affairs, IIFL, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

What are you buying?They are the four Cs which we are extremely bullish on. It starts with cement, the second would be construction, the third would be corporate banks and fourth would be capex. All those four Cs are going to initiate a lot of local initiatives on the infrastructure. You have seen cement earnings. We think that will be the catalyst for housing both -- low cost and high end. Construction. which has been abysmally low will start to pick up in a big way. Corporate banks have been in the eye of the storm and now some of the banks are well positioned. Fourth is capex, which has not moved in the last two years. 

Stocks like L&T, hit a new high today. A disclosure, L&T has been one of our infrastructure top picks on the capex side and we think there is a whole plethora of midcaps which will actually join the party and outperform in the next six to nine months. 


The poll results are out tomorrow. We are flat but there are no wild gyrations on expected lines? Do you think this is in anticipation of tomorrow’s event?The real action was last Wednesday when you had me over and you were staring down the gun of 11150 and when I told you it is a counter trend rally of 600-700 points. I did not expect it will come so fast and I am sure tomorrow we are going to test 12000 and above. The market is sanguine, it is very optimistic that the real earnings catalyst is going to be this new government and they will be able to have a huge momentum not only locally but globally where lot of the money which is sitting on the sidelines, will find India to be the right destination. We think that for local capex, the government initiating a lot of reforms will be the catalyst.

Thirdly, the big issue of liquidity which has been missing and which has driven consumption to its lows will start to revive. So, I am very optimistic on the broader market and the economic performance and we think that these are times to buy and tomorrow and hopefully I will be proved correct.


Are you any accounting for any risk on the downside?Equity markets are all about risk and reward but the risk was there last week of missing this rally and hence if you recall that we stuck our neck out and we still think that the numbers may actually be just in line or if you do get 290 seats on the NDA then you are done. Now you have to look at the real action plan. 

The biggest change would be a new finance minister who can reinitiate a lot of the changes and so on. We are very very optimistic that there would be a total upturn and what the exit polls have shown, we will see that tomorrow.


Anything else that you are looking at from a short-term perspective?Two more sectors. One would be the PSUs and their rerating would be across the board. I would definitely recommend to investors the CPSE ETF which has about 15 of those stocks which are prime blue chip PSU stocks. Please buy that ETF as a SIP or buy that outright. You will definitely make much more returns than in any other account. 

The other would be insurance. It is just at the tip of the iceberg of pedigree stocks. These are very well-run companies like ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, HDFC life and SBI Life. All these are going to give you extremely good returns over the next three to five years. So if you are looking long term, these are very good candid plays. 

In the midcaps we suggested some of the construction plays. We think of autos as a dark horse. I could take three names -- Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto. These can be huge wealth creators in the next year, given that the extent on the commercial vehicle will pick up the LCV, MHV market. Eicher gets back its act in the Royal Enfield and Bajaj Auto which has been a huge market gainer by sacrificing of little margin. These three can also be huge wealth creators in the next one year.


What is your outlook about the capital goods space, infrastructure names. Lots of hopes being pinned here?Yes and rightly so. There has been almost three years of no growth and now capex is just waiting to go, particularly on the private side. Once you have clarity and stability and continuity of the government, it is going to be a huge income generator both on the employment and on the GDP. 

L&T, Siemens, ABB, Sadbhav Engineering, Nagarjuna Construction, NBCC are there. You will see rerating of the entire PSU pack, valuations have never been so cheap and now you are going to see a huge capex which will see cash inflows on a very big scale, particularly in most of the PSUs where there has been extreme value but a problem of liquidity. I am extremely bullish on all India centric plays and that includes select autos and insurance.


Within capital goods, what do you like?So L&T, Siemens, ABB, Sadbhav Engineering would be four top picks and in the midcap we like Nagarjuna Construction and NBCC. All quasi infrastructure capex/construction companies. 


Within the banking pack, can I get the pecking order from you?Clearly SBI has just broken out. I have a target of Rs 425 by the end of the year. SBI, ICICI, Axis are the largecaps and three stocks which are going to be midcap outperformers are DCB, Federal Bank and IDFC First. The numbers were weak but the management has explained that credit growth is the best they have had. Their margins are expanding on the NIMs and their CASA ratio is improving. These can be extremely good buy as a franchise for the next two years where you can get good numbers and capital creation. 


Any of the real estate names on your list?Yes, we have three companies that is Godrej Properties, Sobha and Prestige. A disclosure, these are under our buy list and we think that RERA, the other improvements, the liquidity which will comes back will see pedigree performance from the larger players which have stood out in this times of chaos."
43,2019-05-23,Eicher,"The Narendra Modi-led government’s victory in 2014 triggered a bull run in Indian stock market that has led to the Nifty gaining 63% in the last five years. Financials, auto and consumer companies led the outperformance during this period. With the outcome of the national polls due today, ET takes a look at some of the top performers during the NDA regime from the BSE 100 index and details their outlook going ahead.


BAJAJ FINANCE
CMP: Rs 3,447.70 Change in last 5 years: 1,852%

Bajaj Finance has been the biggest wealth creator among BSE 100 constituents over the last five years due to consistent earnings performance. “The company has grown at a 35-40% CAGR for eight-nine-years in a low and its liability management has been strong. Profit has grown 10-12 times in the last eight-nine years,” said Digant Haria, AVP-research at Antique Stock Broking. Haria believes premium valuation of can sustain going forward till business execution stays strong


BRITANNIA INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 2,851.25 Change in last 5 years: 560%

Britannia did well in the last five years since new CEO Varun Berry was appointed in March 2014, just before the NDA was elected, said analysts. “He implemented a lot of strategy changes that resulted in margin expansion and return ratio expansion. The stock was adequately rewarded for this,” said Deepak Jasani, head of research at HDFC Securities. Jasani said the stock may not repeat its strong show in the next five years due to stretched valuations and a high base.


TITAN COMPANY
CMP: Rs 1,240.45 Change in last 5 years: 304%

The implementation of GST and lower corporate governance levels in other listed jewellery stocks made investors shift to Titan, said independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga. “Titan’s corporate governance was never under any question. Financial performance should sustain but stock may not outperform. The stock is not cheap, it will perform in line with the consumer space,” said Baliga.


HAVELLS INDIA
CMP: Rs 756.35 Change in last 5 years (%): 302%

Jasani of HDFC Securities said Havells has transformed itself from an industrial to a consumer facing company with strong focus on brands, mass premium markets, innovation and strong distribution across the country. “Investors recognised the moat in their business and pushed up the stock prices,” said Jasani. He believes the stock may not repeat its superlative performance in the next five years as valuations are high.


PIDILITE INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 1,212.30 Change in last 5 years: 289%

Demand revival, entry in new markets and adjacent categories, and anticipated demand shift from unorganised to organised players are likely to boost Pidilite’s revenue and earnings, said Abneesh Roy, senior vicepresident-institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities. Roy is optimistic on Pidilite Industries – which is a market leader in the adhesives segment, due to anticipated demand recovery and market leadership.


PAGE INDUSTRIES
CMP: Rs 22,526.8 Change in last 5 years: 280%

Page has underperformed in the last one-and-a-half years because of expensive valuation, consumer slowdown and margin pressure, it is one of the outperformers in the last five years, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets and corporate affairs at IIFL. “The management is very competent and the brand value of Jockey is immense. It is one of the best consumer companies in the midcap space,” said Bhasin.


BIOCON
CMP: Rs 519.6 Change in last 5 years: 263%

India’s largest bio-pharma company Biocon is expected to perform well going ahead as well, said analysts. HSBC expects biosimilars momentum to continue for Biocon on gradual launches, pick up in the US and the EU, and ongoing traction in emerging markets. “...progress on the biosimilars regulatory front in developed markets and launches in the developed as well as emerging markets are likely to be key levers for the company.”


HDFC BANK
CMP: Rs 2405.1 Change in last 5 years: 199%

Investor favourite HDFC Bank’s profit has grown at a compounded rate of 20.6% over the last five years. “Considering the healthy balance sheet growth, superior asset quality and management, the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. It remains a portfolio stock with premium valuations,” said ICICIdirect, which sees the stock at Rs 2,700 in the next one year.


KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK
CMP: Rs 1495.50 Change in last 5 years: 230%

Another consistent performer from the banking space over the last five years is Kotak Mahindra Bank which Antique Stock Broking recently called ‘stock of all seasons’.”Kotak Mahindra Bank is currently trading at a P/B multiple of 5.7 times/4.9 times on FY20/ FY21 book value and we expect the premium valuation of the bank to continue on back of its superior asset quality, high ROE and balance sheet growth well supported by strong performance of its


EICHER MOTORS
CMP: Rs 21,221.85 Change in last 5 years: 233%

After rallying sharply over the years, the stock may face headwinds going ahead. There seems to be brand fatigue for Royal Enfield in metro cities which is visible in sharp moderation in same store sales, said HSBC. “The stock is facing sector headwinds as well as product headwinds. It could underperform going forward,” said independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga.


ASIAN PAINTS
CMP: Rs 1,366.75 Change in last 5 years: 155%

Although the stock trades at 50.2 times one-year forward earnings, having gained over 150% in the last five years, analysts are still bullish on the stock. “Given strong volume growth visibility for paints in the medium term and the competitive advantages of Asian Paints, we believe the current valuations present a good buying opportunity,” said UBS in a note recently."

50,2019-05-27,Eicher,"Give me one company which was growing at 10% and people made 25x on it. I cannot find even one, said Basant Maheshwari, Co-founder, Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisors, in an interview with ETNOW. I cannot see a recovery for the next 6-9 months at least, says Maheshwari.Edited excerpts:

You have migrated from Kolkata to Mumbai. So, the financial capital attracts everyone?
 It is more the idea of meeting like-minded people.


Buffett stayed in Omaha and he said look I am very happy, I do not need to interact with Wall Street people; Franklin Templeton is in Chennai, they said look we want to stay away.I wish I was Warren Buffett and Templeton. I would have gone to Asansol.


No, but he said that we want to stay away from the noise because the noise affects our day-to-day market thinking. You should be away from the noise. You have come to the centre where all the noise is there.That is very commonly said but it is not about noise. It is also about information, about sharing news and views but in today’s world, Twitter, Facebook, you get to know everything. It was just let us go and try and see what happens.


What a timing! You have come. What a welcome, what a decisive mandate and what a reaction by the market! What next? Is this the trigger point for all those bleeding small and midcaps to come back to form?I have a different view on this. The broad market is still in pain because if you have 6-6.5% GDP growth, you cannot have 200 companies doing very well. Just imagine a situation where there are five people in a room and there are just three mangoes. The stronger ones will go and take on each and the two weak guys will be left without a mango. If you are five people and seven mangoes, then each one gets to have one of them. The moment we have 7.5-8% GDP growth, it is that point where the smallcaps, the midcaps, the tiny caps and the penny caps do well. Also, there is no problem in the Nifty, there is no problem in the top 30-40-50 companies that are delivering earnings. 

See what happened a couple of weeks back; Pidilite came with a horrible set of numbers.We all thought that the stock is going to go down but it did not, it just went up because just three months of earnings cannot define a company which is going to stay for the next 50 years. We are back in the 2009-2015 era where a handful of 20-30-40 companies would do well, liquidity would chase growth and if there is growth, people will say okay let me get a pie of it.


So, there would not be a broad-based recovery? Would it be very selective even within broader market?I cannot see a recovery for the next 6-9 months at least.


We were taking cognisance of what is going on within the infrastructure space and there is a lot that has been done, a lot of reform push. A lot is anticipated in terms of picking up the overall private capex. If they stick to their promises for doling out sizable amounts, what do you make of the progress in infra?Infra, selectively the Bharatmala, where Nitin Gadkari was handling things, he was really pushing things around. But the problem in infra in 2019 and 2004 is, in 2004 you had probably 25 infra companies in India, in 2019 you have 250 companies and infra is always an L1 thing. The guy who bids the cheapest, gets the order. While infrastructure could make money, buying those infra companies will require a little more intelligence than what it did earlier.


The sliver of the market is growing within financials, consumption and those stocks are available at levels where you would say you got to be crazy to be buying silver at the price of diamond, forget buying gold at the price of silver. This is like if you buy a Bajaj Finance 8 times a book, if you look at AU Finance again, at same kind of a level, how does one invest in this market?I give this example most of the time; if me and you are being chased by a lion, I do not have to run faster than the lion, I have to run faster than you. The point is if there are say 200 companies and just seven of them are growing at 30%, money will chase those seven. A disclaimer, we own Bajaj Finance in truck loads, maybe up to the throat. But the point is, if I get something else at three times book growing at similar rate with similar valuations, I would sell Bajaj Finance the next day and tell the broker to switch all the trade. But there is not anything available. Look at the kind of beating the other NBFCs are taking right now.


Exactly a year ago, RC Bhargava came on the channel and said “itna demand hai ke gaadi ka shortage hai” (There’s so much demand that there is a shortage of cars.) The same guy after one year tell us that we are cutting our production because there is just no demand. HFC guys said a year ago, they were certain of a 15-18% or 18-25% growth. That grown has become de-growth. When demand turns around, it turns around so dramatically and radically that you cannot ever figure out?The theory is if there is a company which has 50% of market share like Asian Paints, Maruti, no recommendations. Maybe Pidilite, maybe a Horlicks which Glaxo Consumer used to sell sometime. When you are yourself 50% of the market, how can you grow at 25% when the market is growing at 10%? So there is an alarm bell and there is something to get very impressed about that this company has 50% of market share because if you are 50% of the market share you would not go out of business, you will still make the business but you cannot grow fast. 

All those companies with 50% market share will reach the growth plateau sooner than later. Look at what happened to Page Industries. In the mid segment, it has 60% of the market share. But you cannot grow fast when you have 50-60% market share. Look at companies where you have 2-3% market share but the market is expanding at say 10% then you can grow at 25% because all you have to do is grow and grab market share from others with a 50% market share.


So what within consumption has the potential to grow at 25%?, Right now we are seeing almost a blanket decline barring in two or three odd names?It is very difficult because a company that grows at two, three, four does not grow at 20%. A company that grows at 5%, grows at 7%. A company that grows at 20%, can grow at 22%. In the consumption space, we own just two companies -- a grocery retailer and a jewellery retailer. No recommendations again, because we think that these are the only two companies that can grow faster. 

Apart from that, I can make a case for Bata may be but then there is the same problem. Bata itself is quite dominant in its space and we like to look at top line growth whereas markets look at bottom line growth because once you have top line growth, the bottom line growth can come in and you can inflate bottom line growth by cutting expenses, advertising, expansion and capacity, but you cannot create top line growth and ultimately over the long term, it is the top line growth that matters. 

Look at companies like Amazon and Apple and Google. May be they spend billions of dollars just to get market share, but that is a way to look at it. I cannot find too many opportunities in even consumer and financials.


Another headline this morning on the Economic Times is that hopes of big reforms will take D-Street bulls to new highs. There seems to be a consensus that with the new government in place, we are going to see a boost in overall sentiments. Only global factors could come as a hindrance. Where do you think we stand on the market front now?The government is likely to go for a big infra push. It had tried to do DeMon so that it could get a couple of lakh crore but that did not happen and it asked the RBI for dividend, but that did not happen. It is looking for a big amount of money which they can put in through the infrastructure space. People tell me that may be an inheritance tax could be coming. But that is not for the stock market to celebrate because this government has told us that it will not walk one line, it will be somewhere between socialism and capitalism. 

If it is only capitalism, then it gets voted out like India shine in 2004. If it is only socialism, then what is the difference between the Third Front and the NDA government? So, the stock markets should celebrate but the celebration should not go beyond the designated time.


We compared the five-year chart of NDA-1 with global markets and realised that in the last five years, S&P and Nifty have given almost neck and neck returns. 4-5% here or there is point to point but that is a way all we need to do. What is the data telling us?Over the last five years, the Nifty has done almost nothing. If you go into the broader market, there is more mud there but still you could find your company. When we meet Bajaj Finance, it has done phenomenally well. It is said it is a stock pickers’ market, you have to become a value buyer. All those things are good enough but ultimately over the last 25 years of Indian stock markets, money has only been made in companies that are growing at above normal rates -- be it Infosys, L&T, Unitech, Pantaloon, Bharti Airtel, Page Industries or Eicher Motors.

Give me one company which was growing at 10% and people made 25x on it. I cannot find even one."
52,2019-05-28,Eicher,"The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility, said Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


The Indigo numbers are nothing short of a blow out. How much more headroom is left for Indigo? It has almost become a duopoly kind of a space now?See the market at this point of time is so polarised that wherever you see a good growth visibility and some stable margins, the money is only chasing those sort of stocks. And that is what we have seen in the last whole year, last six months or so. So we have very few stocks where one can really have a growth visibility. The Indigo management is telling us that in terms of international and domestic operations, they are extremely well placed. They are also going to get delivery of almost about 20-25 aircraft. 

The passenger growth has not been that great but even if it remains about 12-15% with only two major players. The overall environment is extremely favourable and so though the stock has run up, given the state of the market, we might see some more upside for a player like Indigo. 


I always thought that Divi's had this API model which was almost like an annuity business. Irrespective of what is happening to the pharma world, Divi's had a strong disruptive model.Yes, particularly after this US FDA related issue got resolved, the company started delivering good set of numbers and the good thing about Divi's is that unlike most of the other pharma companies which have a lot of dependence on the generic opportunity and the deal with pricing related issues, Divi's had a very different business model. 

But given the fact that the entire sector in the US and in many parts of the world is going through challenges in terms of litigation, etc, and when you are supplying to some of those pharma majors, somewhere you will also have to take a hit in terms of the slowdown whenever it happens. In case of Divi's, we have seen that but overall the business model and the margins part is playing out extremely well. So we are not too negative on Divi's. Yes the performance was weak so the stock has corrected but we are of the view that somewhere it will stabilise and will start doing pretty well.


Would you avoid any of these high PE haloed stocks -- Page, Eicher, Bosch? That is where the casualty is. Markets maybe at an all-time high but some of these stocks are at a multi-year low. How would you approach a Page, an Eicher or a Bosch or Shree Cement?Definitely because of the high valuations and the fact that we are seeing slowdown, particularly in the consumption space, the derating process may continue for a while because at the moment the entire money is chasing the set of stocks where there is a growth visibility and where you can expect quarter-on-quarter improvement in the performances.

Only a few sectors are showing signs of revival. The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility. The focus should be on the banking and the financial space where there is going to be a good amount of traction a) because of the repo rate cut, liquidity infusion and because of the greater visibility because 60% of the earnings growth next year in the Nifty will come from the banking space. 


What do you make of this entire wave of buying in the PSU stocks? It reminds me of 2014 when after the NDA-1 mandate everything got re-rated.Yes, because of the underperformance and the possibility of liquidity infusion and the rate cut going ahead, the market has already started pricing that in for some of the PSU banks and yes selectively we do see State Bank of India and a couple of the large PSU banks are seeing decent amount of improvement in the operating growth, loan growth and the slippages part also has been sorted out. You might see some more upside mainly because of higher probability of rate cut but again this is not a sector where one can take one year, two year kind of a call. From a tactical opportunity perspective, there is more upside for SBI in particular.


What is going on with IndiGo? The promoter spat aside, it is a problem of restrictive choice. You only have SpiceJet and IndiGo now in the aviation space. IndiGo clearly is the leader with the largest market share. They are already guiding for a 30% increase in capacity in the next financial year.Yes absolutely. Partly because of the growth in the passenger traffic which has been pretty good in the last couple of quarters and the fact that because of the Jet saga some of these incumbent players could take a price hike so the pricing power to some extent is coming back plus operationally – a) because of the expansion on the international front and because of the expansion on the fleet per se on the neo part, there is a sense that the overall growth could be extremely good for a player like IndiGo which is extremely well placed.

They have also managed to get some more slots. The market is extremely positive there. But we have not really covered this airline sector because of the kind of volatility, news flow and sensitivity to government decision making. So yes we do appreciate the fact that IndiGo is extremely well placed but we are staying away from giving any specific recommendation for IndiGo or SpiceJet at this point of time."
51,2019-05-28,Eicher,"Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto may be professional rivals, but their managing directors are anything but. In a recent business magazine interview, London-based Eicher Motors CEO Siddhartha Lal spoke of his friendship with Bajaj Auto’s Rajiv Bajaj. He said, “Obviously, in the market, we have to do what we have to do. At the front end, there is no friendship. But at the backend, we are friends.” 

Lal added that Bajaj was like an older brother. “When we were tiny, and we needed guidance, he opened his doors. We always had an amazing friendship, there is no doubt about that. But at the front end, it is all competition.” 

There may be some truth to that statement. Even though Lal is currently London-based, the duo reportedly own holiday “cottages” next to each other in Rishikesh. Despite all speculation, the two have always spoken positively of each other. Once asked if he viewed Lal as a rival, Bajaj said, “I don’t think of him as a competitor. I don’t think things should be seen in such a small way.”

BOARD MEETINGS
 


ANALYST CALLS
 • Citi has a sell rating on Glenmark Pharmaceuticals with a target price of ₹615. Notwithstanding the recent weakness in the stock, Citi said it is looking for signs of meaningful traction in the US business to turn constructive — as this is key for margin improvement as well as cash generation and meaningful reduction in debt. 

 • IIFL has an add rating on Bharat Electronics with a target price of ₹149. While gross margins are likely to moderate in FY20/21 due to sales mix, benign employee expenses and other fixed overheads will help operating profit margins sustain at 20-21% levels, with 13-15% sales growth, said IIFL.

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Ujjivan Financial Services with a target price of ₹375. The brokerage believes that FY20 should start seeing normalisation of the cost-income ratio, a key concern. The valuations are inexpensive with gradual recovery in return on equity towards normalised levels and addressing the issue on listing of the bank should aid valuation expansion from current levels, the brokerage said. 

 • IDBI Capital Markets has maintained buy rating on Nava Bharat Ventures and trimmed target price to ₹125 from ₹127. The company’s EBITDA in the March quarter was lower than estimated due to weaker-than-expected profitability in the power segment, said IDBI Capital Markets. The stock trades at an attractive valuation, the brokerage added. 

 • CLSA has maintained buy rating on J Kumar Infraprojects with a target price of ₹315. The key message from J Kumar Infra’s fourth quarter result was its pick-up in new orders despite election-led, slow-down fears and robust execution, said CLSA. The brokerage expects J Kumar’s EPS to see an 18% CAGR over FY19-FY22 and highlighted that the stock looks cheap at 4.6 times FY20 estimated EPS.

8,2019-06-06,Eicher,"If the long-term trajectory on the growth remains perfectly intact, it is easier to stay on course rather than flip and buy something which may not be quality. Ultimately, it is the quality and growth on your portfolio that make absolute returns and also deliver relative returns over a period of time, said Manish Sonthalia, Associate Director and Head Portfolio Management Services, Motilal Oswal Asset Management, in an interview with ETNOW.  Edited excerpts:


On one hand, quality is getting chopped -- be it Page or Eicher and on the other hand, corporate banks have made a comeback! On the global side, oil is cracking! What is going on? Quality never goes out of fashion. These are transient times. Sooner or later, you will see many of these names coming back. One has to live through this journey on a time correction or a price correction. If the long-term trajectory on the growth remains perfectly intact, it is easier to stay on course rather than flip and buy into something which may not be quality. Ultimately, it is the quality and the growth on your portfolio that make absolute returns and deliver relative returns over a period of time. 

I stick to the course rather than flipping around and buying into tactical plays which may be beaten down in current times because portfolios are created for three years and above and not for one or two years.


Companies which you own currently, are going through a visible slowdown on sales front and also on the demand front -- be it Eicher or Page. Are these cyclical slowdowns or structural challenges which have come up for the two-wheeler industry, apparel industry or innerwear industry? These are good companies but if demand goes down, good businesses can also start contracting.If Jockey as a brand has stayed relevant in the United States for 140 years, I do not know how it can go out of fashion or go into oblivion in 25 years in India? Last quarter, we saw a perennial slowdown for the entire consumption space that has nothing to do with just one specific company. It has to do with liquidity issues, with wholesalers stocking less and it has to do with rural demand slowdown.

But there is a latent demand in the system which will fructify over next two-three quarters. Let us see how the rains play out. The point that I am trying to make is that if you do not want to own consumption stocks in a portfolio in India, there is no case for investments in India. Do not buy India if you do not want to buy consumption stocks because otherwise if you buy investment related theme, the quality of your earnings is going to be subpar because it comes with a lot of leverage. There is financial ROE that gets built into your overall ROE. There is risk in the system, the financial distress in the system which will manifest in whatever way it will, it is not going to be very good looking so to speak because there is a financial distress in the system. The government has taken a stance that these are solvency issues, these are not liquidity issues. Liquidity by the way has just turned positive. 

Liquidity is not moving and that is the whole problem which is having an impact on demand on the consumption side. But the net result is that there is latent demand in the system. It will get played out over a period of time. One has to live through that journey.


Would you not want to stretch beyond just Eicher and look at some of the other two- wheeler or even passenger vehicles names at all? All of them are at rock bottom right now both in terms of news flow as well as prices?Everything is worthwhile looking at in the auto space. As of now, it is a problem with the sector per se. There is no problem with the company. Valuations are perfectly fine. Auto sector slowdown has a lot to do with liquidity conditions which were tight over the last six-nine months. Give it a further two quarters and things will get sorted out. So be it Maruti, Eicher or TVS, everything is worthwhile looking at and nothing should be sold in the auto space at this given point in time.


I am being a devil’s advocate here. For the first time after a gap of six or seven years we have seen a visible slowdown in the consumer space. Do you think the consumer slowdown is structural and if not, when do you think consumer demand will come back -- not only for Eicher, Hero MotoCorp or Page but in general? We have a new government at the centre. Hopefully things should be better off. What we are all trying to extrapolate is that the GDP growth of India is headed below 6% for a very long time. I mean that is not the base case scenario that one should work with. Yes the fourth quarter GDP numbers are below 6%. It is 5.8% but is it going to stay there for very long time? I do not think so. The new government has taken charge. The key priority areas are jobs, income and capital formation which have been the bane of this economy for the last five years. Whenever the economy goes through tough reforms like the GST or an IBC, you have a transition period, a pain point in the economy and that is what we are witnessing now. 

Give it some more time and you will have the good results of these tough reforms playing out over the next one, two, three years. Auto as a space is a very large sector for the economy. It is a Rs 9-lakh-crore industry. One cannot really ignore this space as a whole. If you have a perennial slowdown, you will have incentives coming all the way. You will have something coming from the government side to boost demand, etc. 

So large pockets of the economy cannot be facing a slowdown if one was to believe that India’s GDP growth rate would be north of 6% and short of 8% and that is the band that we are working at. These are the only times when you see certain disruptions in the economy which will set out correctly once we have new measures coming in to propel demand, to propel capital. 

I know these things are not very easy but incrementally at the margin, do you think that the worst is priced in? I would not believe so or if you want to believe that, it may be one quarter more that these things are going to get played out. It cannot be going on for maybe 9 months, 12 months I do not think that is the base case scenario.


What are you making of the kind of earnings that we have seen so far? Do you believe that an incremental improvement in the overall earnings could kick in by Q3-Q4?So in the quarter gone by (Q4), only the banks earned, corporate India did not earn anything. It was negative growth or zero growth but let us talk about financial year 2019. As a whole, corporate India grew by 13% in earnings growth and we are talking about Nifty earnings growth for FY19. FY18. This number was 4% or 5%. So obviously, FY19 earnings growth is better than FY18 earnings growth. 

We begin the new financial year 2020 with an earnings growth assumption of 25%. Of course, bulk of this earnings growth will come from the banks per se but there will be other sectors chipping in. If that scenario does not play out and that is the base case scenario, why the markets should be looking up rather than down at this given point in time is that you have a new government, you are starting the financial year 2020 with an assumptions of a 25% earnings growth. 

The markets want to give them two quarters to see how the earnings growth plays out. If the earnings growth plays out 25% plus, you have the upward journey on the markets staying intact. If it does not, we fall back to maybe Rs 40,000 or below that. I would be more optimistic than pessimistic at this given point in time but it has more to do with how the monsoons play out, the agenda on the economic front in the first 100 days of the government. Sentiments currently are positive and the short-term sentiments determine the direction of the market more than fundamentals.


What is happening to the NBFC space? It started with IL&FS. That opened a can of worms. Today Dewan Housing Finance a big firm with a loan book of $20 billion failed to repay their loan obligations. My only worry is that I hope this does not spread like a contagion. Can we close our eyes to this entire mess situation in NBFCs?I do not think it will become a contagion at all. If you read the RBI commentary saying that it is a solvency issue. It is not a liquidity issue as liquidity in the system has turned positive. It was deficit Rs 1-1.5 lakh crore a few months back. Right now, if the liquidity is not moving, the hair cuts are going to be taken by the debt side of mutual funds or the banks who have exposure to these NBFCs. 

There will be haircuts on the asset side and you will have global capital buying these assets for scraps. That is how the whole situation is going to play out. I do not think it will be a contagion which will spread all over to the economy. It will get localised to specific companies. That is the beauty of the new IBC code that we have. There will be a solution, there will be haircuts taken by specific companies which have gone overboard in terms of the risk management practices and specific investors will have to bear the brunt and this time around a key lesson that has been imparted to investors also is that debt does not come free of risk; you always thought equity market was full of risks and now you will also have to see that debt markets there. You will see negative NAVs on debt mutual funds and that will also be a lesson for investors that there is a risk to every side of investing.


Indian markets are up 10% in the first half of this year. Is another 10% coming in the second half or is this is as good as it gets for largecap stocks? What has been your last big purchase? I am very clearly of the opinion that markets are going to see 50,000 first on the Sensex before a 35,000 and this would happen over the next two quarters staring from the base case assumption of a 25% earnings growth. The markets would want to see whether that hypothesis gets played down in the first two quarters of this financial year. If that is the course, the markets will move upward and believe me this time around the buying is coming from the FPIs who have been sellers all of the last two years. We, local funds, also have been sellers. It is always a conundrum but emerging markets are to be bought in times of chaos and last year was a whole island of chaos and they are lapping up good quality stocks at very good prices. 

What we have been doing in our portfolios is that we have been trimming down Bajaj Finance for the simple reason that it is now too pricey or too excessively valued. It is a capital raising exercise that markets want to give this sort of valuations. Two times loan book is difficult to digest given the amount of risk that they are taking on incremental unit of return. 

It is better to switch from a ten price to book to a two price to book. We have been buying ICICI Bank in place of Bajaj Finance which we have been selling. Of all the numbers that we saw in the fourth quarter, we feel very optimistic about Titan. It is a pricey stock but the real crux of the unorganised to organised space is playing out here. Just to give you some hypothesis on a few facts incrementally which has come to light, India is sitting on a stock pile of $800 billion worth of gold. If the recycle time on this just improves quite a bit and if there is a shift, this 300,000 mom and pop jewellery shops which are finding it extremely difficult to continue business in the new GST environment and these workers which Titan is now attracting all over India, which is the crux to making bridal jewellery in a higher margin business.

These valuations are going to sustain and not only sustain the growth rate on Titan is going to be north of 25% for many years to come. They have opened fewer stores, only 375-380, given the huge country and now that they are focussing on accelerating their presence, this is a story that is here to stay. I feel extremely positive about this one, we have it in few of our portfolios."
9,2019-06-10,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: The Bullet is hitting the country roads to take the brand back to where it belonged: Growth leadership.

The maker of Royal Enfield, India’s premium adventure bike for generations, is venturing beyond urban areas in search of sustainable growth that has lately been hard to come by. The company told global investors at a recent summit in the UK that it plans to open 350 small stores in FY20. These stores will be 225 square feet in size for sales and 275 square feet for workshops, just about a sixth of the regular properties. Royal Enfield expects these small-format stores to sell up to 20 units a month. If the formula clicks, more than 1,000 such outlets would be set up across the rural hinterland.

But will the strategy help Royal Enfield, represented on the bourses as Eicher Motors, help kick-start growth?


The stock of Eicher Motors has underperformed the Sensex by 10 per cent and 40 per cent in the past three and twelve months, respectively, as volume rose 1 per cent in FY19 in the slowest pace of expansion since 2010.

In the near term, the strategy may help add some volumes to help offset soft demand in the traditionally large markets such as Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Volumes dropped 29 per cent, 10 per cent, and 5 per cent in Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka, respectively, in the March quarter. Even states with lower penetration of premium bikes, such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar, saw moderate growth. With disposable incomes in rural India not rising fast enough, Royal Enfield might have to wait a bit before it sees a meaningful contribution from the new format of stores.

Eicher attributes the moderation in volume to economic slowdown, not brand fatigue. Royal Enfield has 28.5 million searches on Google, up 9 per cent YoY, which is around 2.37 million searches per month, compared with 0.6-1.1 million for the next three competitors.

The Street is pricing in volume growth of 807,000-856,000 for the current fiscal year, which implies growth of minus 2 per cent to plus 3 per cent. The company has given production guidance of 950,000 units after the March quarter earnings.

The stock is trading at 20 times its twelve-month projected earnings, a 36 per cent discount to the longterm average."
10,2019-06-10,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Just what are the biggest funds in the business buying these days?

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and local mutual funds typically make investment decisions that other classes of investors, including HNIs, often follow, albeit with a lag. These bulge-bracket funds have deep pockets, are better trend-spotters across asset classes and geographies, and focus on long-term wealth creation. So, it makes a lot of sense to study their investment bets.

ET Intelligence Group studied the shareholding data of companies in the BSE 100 and BSE Midcap indices to ascertain what FPIs and mutual funds have bought in the past one year. The study showed that FPIs enhanced their exposure to beatendown quality stocks.

These are Eicher Motors, HDFC Life Insurance, Castrol India and Colgate-Palmolive India. FPIs have enhanced stakes in these companies by 1.2-5 per cent in this period. These companies promise high returns and have stable growth prospects, while valuations seem attractive when compared with the recent past.



In the same period, mutual funds have loaded up on capital goods and utilities. NTPC, Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Electronics, and Cummins India have seen mutual funds increase their stakes in the 1.5-7 per cent range.

There are two major reasons mutual funds bought into capital goods and utilities. First, these companies have shown high growth in their short-cycle order books. Two, in the past one year, these companies have also beaten their order inflow guidance despite less fresh business from the government."

12,2019-06-11,Eicher,"MUMBAI: Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV), a joint venture between Sweden's AB Volvo and India’s Eicher Motors, on Monday unveiled the country’s first commercial vehicle that is compliant with BS-VI emission norms, which are set to roll in from April 2020.

Vinod Aggarwal, managing director of VECV, said the company has been making Euro-VI compliant engines for its partner Volvo for six years and was able to leverage this experience to make BS-VI-compliant vehicles for India ahead of the emission norms rollout date at an investment of Rs 500 crore – a much lower expense than what a manufacturer starting the development from scratch might have to make. Euro-VI norms are equivalent to BS-VI norms.

“We are in a relatively advantageous position. We have all the experience and knowledge of the challenges and issues that emerge during the implementation of these engines,” Aggarwal told ET, adding that the savings in investment will be passed on to consumers.

The company unveiled its Eicher Pro 2000 series of light- and medium-duty trucks in two variants—Eicher Pro 2049 and Eicher Pro 2095XP.

According to Aggarwal, the BS-VI-compliant vehicles will go on sale only in the latter half of the current financial year based on demand environment and availability of BS-VI compliant diesel fuel.

Aggarwal said demand for commercial vehicles in India has contracted in recent months, and with the impending transition to the new emission norms weighing down on margins, profitability for the company during this financial year “looks stressful”. The company will, however, favour profitability over market-share, he said.

The MD said he expects sales to pick up from September as consumers are likely to start pre-buying vehicles to avoid paying higher prices for the BS-VI compliant vehicles. The pre-buying will compensate for the demand slowdown and the industry may even post a marginal growth for the complete year ending March 2020, he said.

Infrastructure activity too should pick up, according to Aggarwal, now that the election is over. This will revive demand for heavy commercial vehicles.

VECV sold 43,500 medium and heavy commercial vehicles in FY19, with its market share contracting marginally to 11.1%. Light commercial vehicles (LCV) sales came in at 18,350 units with a market share of 3%.

Aggarwal said the company does not have the problem of inventory piling up with its dealers—currently a big concern in the Indian automotive industry."

While near-term demand outlook is hazy, Royal Enfield could surprise on quality and pace of new launches, it said. 

 • At 16 times FY20 estimated earnings, Natco is trading at 40% discount to its 5-year average trading range, said JM Financial. The brokerage believes that the current valuations barely price in the base earnings with the value of Natco’s US portfolio and pipeline with strong launch and earnings visibility not factored in. 

 • Nomura has downgraded Housing Development Finance Corporation to neutral from buy and increased target price to ₹2,300 from ₹2,000. HDFC’s business model remains most resilient among NBFCs/HFCs and it has been able to weather the NBFC crisis better, said Nomura. 

 • CLSA has a buy rating on Tata Consultancy Services with a target price of ₹2,460. TCS’s FY19 annual report showcases its sources of differentiation, approach to digital transformation and what worked in capturing growth recovery, said CLSA. 

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has retained buy rating on Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail with a fair value of ₹220. The acquisition of ethnic wear and accessories brand Jaypore will give an entry into the ethnic wear segment where the company has had a limited presence, the brokerage said.

17,2019-06-18,Eicher,"Avanti Feeds was a microcap company in a niche business in 2009, but the stock traded at Rs 1.30. Investors who spotted the potential and invested Rs 1,00,000 in this stock back in June, 2009 would be sitting at a cool sum of Rs 2.70 crore this June.

The stock has delivered nearly 270 times return to investors in these 10 years, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 75 per cent.

“The stock changed life for many investors and liberated them early. I was fortunate to be one of them,” says Soumya Malani, a young Kolkata-based investor, who made 71 times return on the stock. 

Last year, the company faced double whammy of a spike in input cost and softening output prices, which squeezed margins.

“Things seem to have stabilised now and better numbers are expected from here on. It is a phenomenal company with one of the best pedigrees in place,” Malani said.

There are many stocks like Avanti Feeds that have delivered multibagger returns to investors even when the market navigated many headwinds amid intermittent bull runs.

NBFC major Bajaj Finance is another such stock. Had you invested Rs 1,00,000 on this counter in June 12, 2009, it would have become Rs 2.33 crore today, growing at a CAGR of 72 per cent annually. A similar investment in cooler maker Symphony would have become Rs 2.11 crore. 

While past performance does not guarantee future returns on Dalal Street, brokerages say there is more steam left in these stocks. 

Edelweiss Professional Investor Research is bullish on Avanti Feeds with a price target of Rs 480. The scrip traded at Rs 335 on Tuesday. The company saw substantial improvement in bottomline during FY2009-2018 and posted Rs 465.40 crore profit for FY2018 against a net loss of Rs 7 crore in FY2009. In FY19, the profit figure swelled to Rs 306 crore, but it was down 34 per cent YoY.

“Avanti reported weak numbers for FY19 mainly because of a crash in global shrimp prices and farm gate prices, as farmers moved away from aquaculture, impacting demand for feed. However, the processing business is doing well and seeing healthy growth,” Edelweiss said in a report.

Bajaj Finance is among the alpha pick of Indiabulls Ventures with a price target of Rs 4,000. A subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance has transformed itself from a captive auto loan provider for Bajaj Auto to one of the most successful and diversified NBFCs.

It had leadership position in the consumer durables segment with a large customer franchise of 34.48 million and loan cross-sell franchise of 20.67 million as on FY19.

“Bajaj Finance has constantly grown its market share even in challenging times. It has a track record of maintaining healthy financials and sound returns ratio. We believe the company will be able to grow at a CAGR of 40 per cent on the bottom-line over next two years,” Indiabulls Ventures said in a report.

Symphony is one of the largest players in the air cooler market with an organised market share of around 48 per cent. In order to explore new opportunities in the industrial and residential cooling segment, the company has made acquisitions in different geographies including Mexico, China and Australia.

At present, India business contributes around 57 per cent to the topline while the rest of the world brings in 43 per cent. ICICIdirect.com is bullish on Symphony with a price target of Rs 1,530. “With rising temperature in a major parts of the country coupled with low dealer-level inventory, Symphony is likely to record robust performance in the FY20E. With a lower base and revival in air cooler demand, we model standalone volume CAGR of around 18 per cent in FY19-21E and topline growth of 20 per cent during this period,” the brokerage said.

Two other companies that turned investors millionaires are Relaxo Footwear and plastic products maker Astral Poly Technik. Both stocks rallied over 1,000 per cent in last 10 years. 

Relaxo Footwears surged to Rs 825.80 as of June 14, 2019 from Rs 5.10 on June 12, 2009. Astral Poly Technik has risen to Rs 1,350 from Rs 11.40.

Brokerage Anand Rathi Financial Services likes Astral for its consistent focus on growth and profitability, supported by innovative product launches, vigorous brand-building and successful product diversification.

With over 50 times rally, La Opala RG, Ajanta Pharma, Vinati Organics, Atul Ltd, Eicher Motors, TTK Prestige and Cera Sanitaryware have been some of the other top wealth creators from the BSE500 index in last 10 years.

Domestic equity benchmark Sensex has rallied over 150 per cent since June 2009.

The pecking order will surely change for next 10 years and Dalal Street will throw up a new set of wealth creators.

Malani says what can possibly help spot potential wealth creators early are a combination of visionary management and a business with scalability, pricing power, tailwinds, high growth, higher incremental ROCE, low equity, under ownership and leadership in a niche areas.

On its 10th birthday this Monday, business news channel ETNOW invited 10 renowned stock pickers from Dalal Street – including Basant Maheshwari, Porinju Veliyath, Vijay Kedia, Sandip Sabharwal and Manish Sonthalia – to build a Power Portfolio of 10 stocks for next 10 years. They picked Titan, Britannia, Tata Global Beverages, Repro India, Britannia and DCB Bank, Edelweiss Financial Services, HDFC Life and Syngene, among others."
18,2019-06-18,Eicher,"The consensus trade after the thumping victory of the incumbent government, was to buy midcaps and smallcaps which has not played out, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


When Prime Minister Modi got re-elected, everyone thought India’s moment in the sun had arrived. The bulls were thumping the table thinking a stable mandate means good news for the market and the markets will go higher and not correct. But look at what is happening?Clearly after 23rd May, the sentiment had turned quite positive but one after one, the accidents which were happening earlier are not finding any conclusion. Starting from IL&FS to DHFL to the Yes Bank saga to even Jet Airways, there are so many accidents happening even within the Nifty stocks. Look at what is happening to the midcaps and smallcaps. The consensus trade after the thumping victory of the incumbent government, was to buy midcaps and smallcaps which has not played out. 

If you look at the last one month’s trade, a lot of midcaps and smallcaps have languished because of the prevailing liquidity situation. FIIs always want to buy market leaders or the top five or 10 stocks, which has been the story in the last one-one and a half years and that has continued even after elections. We are again seeing a polarised market with mid and smallcaps probably not going up. 

People are expecting something from the monsoon and also expecting that the government will come up with a stimulus in the form of consumption boost for the budget which would put something in the hands of the consumers, something in the hands of the farmers. People are also worried about how the government finds a solution to the NBFC crisis. All these questions remain unanswered. So, markets are temporarily experiencing a jolt in the wake of no good news, trade war and also the impending trade issue between India and the US. But the crude trading around $60 provides a bit of positive. In the next five years, we have a stable government in place and that is again a positive. 

In my view, there can be 3-4% correction in the market but use it to find your opportunities.


For the longest time, bulls have defended JSW Steel by saying this is a converter and if you buy a converter, you do not run the risk of commodity cycle?It has been the one stock which has always not followed the trend. The times are now such that globally there is a big impending slowdown. In a slowdown, it is very difficult for cyclicals per se and metals to do very well. If you look at a lot of numbers of Tata Steel or even other metal counters, it is going to be intrinsically difficult to justify how they would go up from here. 

If valuations do not go up, even the price points would be difficult to go up. My sense is JSW Steel can probably defy the trend for sometime but we would not like to touch metal counters at this point considering the global volatility. A lot of domestic centric plays are getting cheaper by the day and more correction can be experienced in the next month or two. 


If somebody buys tyre stocks, should one focus on the bad news coming from autos or good news coming from crude and good news coming from the raw material side?At a time where you are seeing auto stocks getting hammered, auto ancillaries, which depend on auto and are played as proxies when the auto sector performs well. My view is why not take a direct exposure in auto stocks which have seen huge correction? For companies like Maruti, Eicher, the world is not coming to an end but there are problems and the statement would look a little more superficial in the prevailing slowdown. In the last 6-8 months of big demand slowdown which could be extended for one more quarter, for a company like Maruti or Eicher which owns market share in their respective segmentations. 

I would say why not buy these stocks as they get inexpensive by the day. There will be a time when auto ancillaries would also play out as larger stories but a lot of tyre companies are also dependent on global demand. 

Of course, the OEM demand has been slack. The replacement demand probably does not slow down big time, but my sense is yes to answer your question. We would buy the auto stocks for a couple of years horizon and then something in auto ancillaries. A couple of tyre stocks will look good here also and even some auto components which have seen huge correction. Companies like Endurance Technologies look quite sound for a two-three year horizon."

20,2019-06-19,Eicher,"MUMBAI: German luxury car maker BMW Wednesday said it has appointed Rudratej Singh as the president and CEO of BMW Group in India from August 1.

Singh moves to BMW group from Eicher Motors' motorcycle arm Royal Enfield, where he served as global president of the company.

""We are delighted to welcome Rudratej Singh as the president and chief executive officer of BMW Group India. As a priority market for the BMW Group, India presents tremendous potential for future growth and development for the luxury automotive segment,"" said Hendrik von Kuenheim, SVP forAC, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, BMW Group.

Having worked across diverse industry segments, Singh has deep understanding of strategic business techniques that will strengthen BMW Groups operations in India, he said.

BMW group in India comprises BMW India, MINI and BMW Motorrad.

Earlier in August last year, Vikram Pawah then President, BMW Group India was appointed as CEO for BMW group Australia and New Zealand.

Since then, Hans-Christian Baertels, director for finance and administration at BMW Group India had been holding the additional charge of the position.

Rudratej Rudy Singh brings with him more than 25 years of experience and has held multiple leadership positions both in the automotive and non-automotive industry, the release said."
22,2019-06-20,Eicher,"ICICI Securities has given a buy recommendation on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 24,947.

Shares of Eicher Motors closed at Rs 19,794 on 20 June, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 


Investment rationale:

Royal Enfield (RE) remains the most searched motorcycle in India (2.85 crore in FY19; 9 per cent YoY growth), grabs highest mind space with customers. 

However, with nearly 40 lakh bikes on road, the profile of customers today is very different from five years ago. Today, nearly two-third of its customers are upgraders from existing 150cc and below motorcycle segment, while nearly 12 per cent are first time buyers and nearly 8 per cent are existing RE owner cum loyalists. 

""We believe, the focus must be on increasing first-time buyer mix, increasing loyalists mix with products like 650cc twins (50 per cent of twins demand is from existing customers), refresh the base product portfolio in a faster manner to keep creating brand pull for upgraders and improve hyper local customer engagement via focused brand development exercises,"" the brokerage said.

The management has indicated that over the medium term (3-5 years) pure accessories business has the potential to contribute nearly 5 per cent of revenues. 

The company is witnessing nearly 90-95 per cent penetration on accessories for the new 650cc twins across markets. 

The twins are the first model on the online accessories configurator and all the models launched hence, would be a part of the same. 

Accessories are coming with a 2-year warranty and the product is designed and tested through the whole product development cycle of the base model. 

At present, they have nearly 100 offerings which are likely to expand multifold in coming years, the rise in revenue contribution of accessories is a positive margin lever.

RE has been working on the rural expansion strategy for nearly a year, the depth of the exercise and the intent of outreach surprised us positively. 

Ranging from the deep economic viability analysis (breakeven at nearly 10vehicles/month) of these unique smaller studio stores (1/6th scale vis-à-vis normal stores) to brand/sales penetration to customers on a vernacular basis (currently, most digital content and outreach happens in English), FY20 store addition target is 430 (350 studio, 80 regular stores).

""We believe RE’s management focus and bandwidth is placed to strengthen the gaps that went ignored in the last few years and it can gain from the resumption of premiumisation in two-wheelers space in India while targeting the exports markets with credible global quality products,"" said the brokerage."
21,2019-06-20,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Jain Irrigation with over 0.29 crore shares changing hands was leading among the most traded stocks on NSE on Thursday.

Shares of JP Associates (number of shares traded: 0.14 crore), YES Bank (number of shares traded: 0.14 crore), Suzlon Energy (number of shares traded: 0.08 crore), Reliance Capital (number of shares traded: 0.07 crore), Ashok Leyland (number of shares traded: 0.07 crore), Vodafone Idea (number of shares traded: 0.06 crore), Reliance Infra (number of shares traded: 0.06 crore), Indiabulls Housing Finance (number of shares traded: 0.06 crore) and Jet Airways (number of shares traded: 0.05 crore) also featured among the most traded stocks on the NSE.

HDFC (Rs 33.30 crore) was leading the pack of most active stocks in value terms.

It was followed by TCS (Rs 31.35 crore), Indiabulls Housing Finance (Rs 31.28 crore), RIL (Rs 25.43 crore), Apollo Hospital (Rs 20.32 crore), YES Bank (Rs 13.99 crore), SBI (Rs 11.98 crore), ITC (Rs 11.68 crore), Infosys (Rs 11.64 crore) and Maruti Suzuki (Rs 10.06 crore).

The NSE Nifty index was trading 22.60 points down at 11,668.85 while the BSE Sensex was down 69.67 points at 39,043.07 around 09:17 am. 

In the Nifty index, Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (up 0.54 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (up 0.53 per cent), Power Grid Corporation of India (up 0.47 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (up 0.42 per cent) and Eicher Motors (up 0.39 per cent) were among the top gainers. 

While Wipro (down 3.62 per cent), UPL (down 2.22 per cent), Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone (down 2.02 per cent), Tech Mahindra (down 1.71 per cent) and YES Bank (down 1.65 per cent) were the top losers in the index."
23,2019-06-21,Eicher,"While the domestic equity market is looking intact optically at the benchmark level, a selloff below the surface has nudged 75 per cent of the NSE-listed stocks below their 200-day moving averages; meaning they have entered a bearish phase. 

The 50-share Nifty is up over 7 per cent this year at 11,691 till June 19, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap250 indices have declined up to 5 per cent in the same period. 

On Friday, as much as 42 per cent of Nifty components traded below their 200-day moving averages (DMAs). The list included Britannia Industries, Cipla, Eicher Motors, Gail India, Hindalco, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, ITC, YES Bank, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel and Tata Motors.



“A stock trading below 200 DMA means it is in the corrective zone. The benchmark index looks well placed currently, but individual stocks have been beaten down badly. Ideally, one should focus on stocks that are sustaining above their 50-DMAs,” said Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher.

“I do not see Nifty going down below 11,550,” she said, adding that market participants can consider pharma and capital goods stocks at this point. 

Even in the Nifty500 pack, 60 per cent or 300 stocks are trading below 200-DMAs in clear signs of selling pressure across sectors. 





Stocks trading below this crucial support line included 3M India, ACC, Adani Green, Avenue Supermarts, Bank of Baroda, Deepak Fertilisers, Crisil, Cochin Shipyard, ICICI Securities, Jaiprakash Associates, Jain Irrigation, among others. 

Moving averages (MA) are a tool for analysing trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance levels. 

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major MAs, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is considered a continuous uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks test 50-DMAs or 100-DMAs, while serious corrections may cause a stock slip below 200-DMA. 

The 200-day average, also known as a long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for an index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. The 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks. 

On Thursday, stocks like Wipro, Voltas, UPL, Va Tech Wabag, Symphony, Sunteck Realty, SRF and Sonata Software traded above their 200-DMA, while SAIL, Sterling Tools, Tata Chemicals, Tata Motors, Videocon Industries, VIP Industries and Wonderla Holidays are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs. 

Around 300 stocks, including Aarti Industries, DCM Shriram, BPCL, Bata India, Info Edge, Infosys, Inox Leisure, HDFC, Redington and PNC Infratech, were above all the three DMAs, signalling a bullish trend. 

“Available data clearly shows the market has begun a sideways secondary trend after a long primary uptrend. In the secondary phase, the market first consolidates and takes a fresh call either on the upside or downside depending on the technical setup at that point of time. PSE and infrastructure stocks, including L&T and NCC, should remain resilient in the coming days,” said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst for Technicals and Derivatives at Angel Broking, said the primary uptrend is expected to resume soon.

“However till then traders are advised to keep positions light and avoid bottom fishing in stocks that have run into the abyss through this volatile period,” Chavan said."

f growth is there, liquidity will come back but without growth, liquidity is going to shy away, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.


There are some pockets in the market where growth has been slightly lower. Would you go ahead and buy in these pockets despite the marginal disappointment because these are good companies with good balance sheet?I have been a proponent of being a contrarian in terms of going out and buying for say auto sector. We know there are problems in the sector, but it also has a Bajaj Auto which continues to deliver double digit volume growth month after month. Yes, it is growing only at 15% and not 25% but Hero is not doing that even. It has a minus 15% volume growth. Eicher or TVS are also not seeing any growth. So Bajaj relatively is better. It has a very strong balance sheet and continues to deliver positive volume growth. Maruti again has a problem on the growth side but may be in the next couple of quarters, growth will return! 

I would certainly be a contrarian. I would not mind sticking my neck out with the slightly extended time horizon from a two to three year perspective and buy some of these stocks whether it is a Hero, Bajaj or a Maruti in the auto space and across sectors I could pick at least a few names where growth from a two to three year horizon is not a problem. May be the next quarter is a horizon.


Which companies within auto?Within auto, as I mentioned, it is Maruti, Bajaj Auto, Hero. Next two quarters we probably will see challenges but over a two-three-year period, I do not see challenges. Similarly, in every sector, I can find at least a few names where one can stick the neck out take a slightly longer term view simply because valuations have corrected significantly.


The market has somewhat stabilised despite global uncertainties and slowdown blues. What do you make of this?Well we just hope this is the calm before the next storm.


Next storm?.So allow me to explain. I mean...


Storm before the calm, is what you mean?Well let us hope so. There is a lot of expectations from the first budget of NDA-2 and the government is also fully aware of the problems. We just hope that it is a growth-oriented budget. I would say damn to your fiscal prudence. For a couple of years, just pump in and get growth and liquidity back in the system because growth and liquidity is like a vicious cycle. If growth is there, liquidity will come back but without growth, liquidity is going to shy away. It is not that the money is not waiting in the sidelines, there is enough domestic money as well as even overseas capital waiting to come into the markets. If the volatility subsides, if there are signs of growth returning, a lot of that liquidity can flow in. Liquidity itself could solve a lot of the problems that a large number corporates have. We just hope that the liquidity does not become a solvency issue. 

Two, you said markets have somewhat stabilised, but if we look at the broad markets, a few hundred stocks are trading less than or below the levels of 200-day moving average which is a sign of a bear market for the individual stocks. So the broad markets and the indices clearly are two worlds apart and most portfolios whether it is institutional, individual portfolios, trading or investment portfolios nobody trades in only the top five stocks in the Nifty. Everybody has got portfolios which are broad-based with stocks across the caps.


When we just look at the markets only two or three top names in every sector are doing well. It feels that mutual funds and FIIs are only buying them?Probably there is a reason. If FIIs and institutional holding is heavy in HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank there is a reason why they are not buying a Bandhan Bank, for obvious reasons. 

In NBFCs, if they are heavy on Bajaj Finance, there is a reason why they are not buying a Piramal or any other NBFC. so to say in that sense. So money is crowding around the sectoral leaders across the board but 99% of the investors and traders will not necessarily have only the leaders. You are going to have a broad portfolio across the larger market and that is where the pain point is. That’s why if growth were to return, a lot of that pain can be addressed. Then you would not mind that even a Shriram Transport Finance will start performing hopefully or a Sundaram Finance which has been a laggard or a Mahindra Finance which has not declined as much but certainly not been a top performer among the NBFCs, will also start performing. 


How would you approach auto ancillaries? Basically auto ancillaries bear the brunt of the negative sentiment because of auto. I continue to be very bullish on a JK Tyre for example or a Swaraj Engines which supplies tractor engines to Mahindra for the North India operations. I continue to be positive on that. 

JK Tyres performance for the fourth quarter and the annual year ended march 2019 across all segments -- truck and bus radials, truck and bus bias styles, passenger cars, two-wheelers, tractor tyres -- have beaten the tyre sector growth by very wide margins. They had a positive volume growth in a supposedly difficult year. So obviously, they are gaining market share and they have reached peak debt on account of the acquisitions and expansions. From current year onwards, we will see deleveraging. Volume growth again continues to be higher than the sector as is expansion of margins.

Across segments, there will be pockets where the negative sentiment on account of auto rubs off on the ancillaries as well. With all the talk of electric vehicles and the new disruptive technologies, whatever be the shape of auto, 5-10 years down the line it will still need to have wheels and they still need to have tyres. 

So everything under the bonnet may be a question mark -- engine components, carburettor, radiators. You do not know whether those will be required five years later but paint and tyres is something that you cannot do without. 


What is your view on some of the sectors that are exposed to the global markets?Global is largely about the commodities -- a) metal commodities and b) the chemicals and speciality chemicals.We have seen a fairly large bull market over the last three, four years for some of the chemical names. Again it is largely about China factor because the rally also came about because of some clamp down on pollution control norms in China, creating some deficit in global supply which led to chemical prices going. All these resulted in Indian companies benefitting. 

Now globally, the trade wars largely are going to be about the global growth and global fund flows. From a growth point of view, it is going to affect practically most sectors and from an Indian perspective, most domestic consumer-oriented sectors probably will be relatively insulated but anything which is exposed to the international markets is going to have some sort of an impact.

One just hopes that technology does not have as much impact but metals certainly are going to have-- because if the metal prices continue to remain soft, then it is going to be difficult for metal companies to be able to deliver on earnings. There is only so much that they can make up on volumes the larger factor in their earnings is the international price of the metals so whether we are talking of aluminium or zinc or copper or any of those. The most vulnerable seems to be Sterlite because Sterlite is has an exposure to most metal commodities that one can think of. 


Anything you like to leave us with today?One has to be cautious. As far as this market is concerned, although all of us are positive and optimistic about the budget coming up next week, it is going to set the tone in terms of the sentiment at least. Otherwise post budget within a week or so, the first quarter results season will also start and given what the Q4 numbers were, this time at least the results expectations are pretty muted.

I will look for some positive surprises coming up. Otherwise, the broader market will remain range- bound. The broader markets will continue to drift for a while now."
29,2019-06-27,Eicher,"There is a stark divergence between Nifty constituents on both performance and valuations with one segment trading at a substantial premium and the other at a huge discount to the long-term average, said domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, adding that there is limited headroom for valuation re-rating at index level given the continued downside risks.

Some of the stocks where valuations are at a substantial discount to long period average are Eicher Motors, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Coal India and ONGC, said the brokerage.

Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries, Titan Company, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever and UltraTech Cement are trading at a substantial premium to their respective five or ten-year average price-to-earnings or price-tobook multiples, said Motilal Oswal.

Predicting the timing of fortune reversal for these names is always fraught with risks, more so in the current underlying economic scenario, the brokerage said.

“This polarisation on performance and valuations clearly underscores two things: one, investors taking continued refuge in the quality/earnings predictability theme in an environment of economic slowdown and two, there is a lack of pick-up in broader market’s earnings growth,” said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage said that the revival in Nifty earnings in FY20 is predicated on normalisation of credit costs in the banking sector. The banking, financial services and insurance space is expected to account for 70% of incremental earnings for the Nifty in FY20, the brokerage said.

“At 19.5x FY20E P/E, we do not see material room for further valuation re-rate,” said Motilal Oswal.

ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, Titan, L&T, Coal India, Infosys, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki India are top large-cap ideas of Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage’s mid-cap picks include Federal Bank, DCB Bank, Indian Hotels, Crompton Consumer, KEC International, Ashoka Buildcon, Aditya Birla Fashion and Zensar."

31,2019-06-28,Eicher,"I do not expect the investment narrative to suddenly shift from consumption, financials and quality oriented stocks to value picks or investment oriented sectors, says Gautam Duggad, HoR, Motilal Oswal Securities. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.


How are you telling your clients to keep calm and not lose their nerve?These are times where the underlying uncertainty has gone up significantly both on domestic as well as global fronts and at the same time, volatility is very elevated especially in midcap and smallcaps. Nifty is hiding the real pain in the broader markets. Our stance since last year-year and a half has been very simple -- stay close to stocks with higher earnings visibility. 

Fundamentally, midcaps are now offering relatively better risk reward especially on valuations but I recognise the fact that midcaps need a better investment climate as well as sentiments in the market. Now they are trading at a 14-15% discount to the largecaps which was not the case in entire 2017 and large part of 2018. Otherwise, the market remains heavily polarised in favour of 10-12 stocks. 

If you look at Nifty from December 2017 till now, there has been a 30% return in top 15 stocks. If you construct the index of only those 15 stocks, the rest 35 stocks’ index declined by 11%. Same is the case in midcaps also. We have seen top 15 stocks’ index going up 8% while the rest 85 stocks are down more than 21%. It makes sense to stay very cautious as the valuation is not offering you any respite, especially Nifty at 20 times one year forward and elevated risk for earnings downgrade in auto and consumption sectors. Banking is the only sector which is pointing some relief to the earnings next year and that too on a low base.


We may argue and say okay you are being charitable when you say 30 stocks are moving higher. I would say only 15 stocks are moving higher. But if those 15 stocks are moving higher, I would say that is an easy market to predict. We should not worry about anything and stay put in just those 15 stocks and go for a holiday!I wish that kind of approach would work in markets over a long period of time. It does work for a couple of years and it has been working for the last two years though. The problem, however, is the lack of earnings pick up in the broader sector of the economy. For example, if you dissect Nifty for FY20, out of Rs 600 of EPS (from Rs 418 in FY19) , 70% of the incremental earnings growth is coming from BFSIs and rest 10% is coming from auto on a low base which I think will get cut as we move closer towards FY20. 

The problem really is sectors where there is earnings growth. Those stocks are supremely expensive and sectors which are offering some sort of comfort on valuations are not getting earnings growth. For example, ITC is trading at 21-22 times now, almost at a 40% of valuation of HUL. We have had a very moderate neutral call on ITC for last four years. But even now, when you look at earnings growth projections for ITC, it is at around 10-11% which is okay but the market is terrified of any potential tax hikes that could come either in GST Council or outside of GST Council. 

Therefore, the stock refuses to budge despite 8%-10% earnings growth. We might see the market consolidate in this range and few sectors will keep trading at a premium till we see a slightly broad-based earnings recovery in the market on return of confidence in midcaps and small caps.


 What are the midcap bets? There are a number of stocks that you guys are bullish on -- Federal Bank, RBL Bank, Indian Hotels. Can you run us through some of the top picks within the midcap universe?The midcap index is now trading at a discount. However, if you stretch back last 10 years, this kind of spread between midcap and largecaps prevailed only once in June 2013. Today if you just take a rolling return of last 12 months when midcaps have underperformed by 15% and small caps by somewhere around 26%. We see a similar situation in June 2013. The only difference was the absolute valuations were even more beaten down at that point of time and you could afford to take a slightly higher risk. Today you cannot do that. You still have to be very stock specific and bottoms up. So, from that point of view, our preference is still tilted towards financials and consumption.

What we like in financials as you just mentioned are Federal Bank, RBL Bank, even AU Small Finance Bank and DCB. We are still not very gung-ho on NBFCs. Even after the recent fall, we still prefer to err on the side of caution. On the consumption side, we are more bullish towards slightly discretionary stocks like ABFRL and Trent.

Then there is a wide mix of stocks belonging to real estate and even auto midcaps. In fact, auto largecap itself is trading at such a big discount now that their five year average PEs is looking quite attractive. While we know that the next three-four months’ numbers may not show anything positive, we have just published a note today talking about June numbers channel checks. June is also looking like a washout month for autos. 

Among the other midcaps we are still positive on the IT sector where we currently like Zensar, given their strong execution delivery in FY19 and expectations of another strong year in FY20. Rstate continues to look quite interesting after a long period of being out of favour. There has been incrementally bad news flow, especially in Bangalore, where government authorities are talking about clamping down on construction given the water scarcity. Otherwise, we like Oberoi, we like Brigade and those are the mix of midcap stocks which we like.


Considering the slowdown within autos, what do you do with Eicher given that it has been beaten down and is at a 52-week low. Do you add some more positions at these low levels or do you just exit the stock and get into two-wheeler stories? Is Hero MotoCorp the preferred choice?As far as the two-wheeler space is concerned, in the last seven, eight years, every stock has struggled after three-four years of good period. Now Eicher has fallen into that kind of a zone. Bajaj Auto, Hero are going through extended period of low returns for the last seven, eight years. As far as auto is concerned, our preference is still more towards four-wheelers, given that their expected recovery is slightly better and they will be least impacted within the current spaces from the BS-VI transition plus competitive intensity relatively remains slightly better in that space so we like Maruti there. As far as two-wheeler is concerned, yes Eicher does trade now at a 30% discount to the five-year average PE. The problem is the number which we keep getting on a monthly basis keeps getting one notch lower. So, the new normal seems to be somewhere between Rs 55,000 and Rs 60,000 for Eicher. We are expecting a double digit decline even this month for Eicher. 

I recognise that the valuations are cheap there but I do not expect any immediate upside in that space. We will prefer to side with four-wheelers. Even M&M is now trading at a substantial discount to its five-year averages. Those are the two stocks currently that we prefer in the four-wheeler domain.


Fast forward to let us say 29th of June 2020. In the next one year we would have seen two budgets; we would have got a complete handle of what US Fed will do in terms of a rate policy and we would have got a complete handle of which way the trade war is headed and how the world would react to it. Where do you think the markets would be after a year?I do not expect any meaningful triggers from the budget whether this year or the next year. While we are all excited about the budget because it is the most hyped up event, what is more important at least from a near- term point of view is the Jalan Committee Report and how much leeway the government gets to spend the money and where do they deploy that capital. 

From a next 12 months’ viewpoint, a lot of things hinge on where the earnings settle finally. Let us assume that we settle somewhere around Rs 575-580 instead of Rs 600 for FY20 and we get around 15% upside from there for FY21. We are talking about an EPS or somewhere around Rs 700 for FY21 and if current valuations were to prevail in a band of 18 to 20 times, then the market range should be somewhere between 12,500 and 13,500 which is a decent upside.

But the problem right now is your earnings visibility is getting lower and lower for a lot of sectors. In automobiles, despite a sharp earnings cut for the last six quarters, we are continuing to see another round of cut in this quarter. 

Pharma does not show any respite, we have a negative view on metals and oil and gas. So the entire earnings recovery is hinging on financials. I would expect more of the same for the next one year with sectors like financials and some segment of consumption doing well. 

At the margin, I expect slightly better performance from telecom because ARPUs have bottomed out now and Bharti has gone for deleveraging in multiple ways. Telecom is something where I expect some positive performance coming through. As an investment/capex oriented sector, cement could offer a better opportunity but it remains very small part from the point of view of index and roads which have been doing well under NDA-1 and should continue to do well given that the execution track record has been good. I do not expect the investment narrative to suddenly shift from consumption, financials and quality oriented stocks to value picks or investment oriented sectors.


Are there any specific midcap names where the selling has been intense and the franchise is available at a deep discount to its true intrinsic value?One of the stocks that comes immediately to my mind is Emami. It has seen a substantial correction on the back of promoter pledge but it is a consumer stock at the end of the day and the core business does not have much debt. The only problem is there has been a slowdown in earnings even in the core business over there. It is a stock we have liked historically. The stock is available at 20-21 times and the stock is vulnerable to a lot of climate related issues. 

When 50% of the portfolio is dependent on winter and summer, those issues impact a lot. Plus they have a higher share of wholesale and rural markets where we have seen a slowdown in the last two years. Besides that, across sectors, we have seen stocks where promoter pledge, higher leverage or any dodgy corporate governance kind of a perception, have led those stocks to taking a huge beating. While midcaps as an index is now trading at a discount to the largecap one, but unlike June 2013, you still cannot take liberal risks there because the environment has changed a lot and a premium is attached to companies with better balance sheets and better perception of corporate governance."
32,2019-06-29,Eicher,"Position not built up, markets will remain lacklustre going into the budget, says Kunal Bothra, independent market analyst. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.


In less than a week, we will have the Budget. Are the positions being built indicate any heightened expectations or is it going to be just another day?It should be just another day for the markets. Earlier, before a big event like Budget, we used to see heightened volatility and some trend building up and sectoral moves happening. 

There used to be pre-budget rallies into some sectors. We have not seen that happening at all. The best sector performing right now is the Nifty IT and probably the PSU banking names. Infra, real estate stocks have seen individual pockets of rallies but it is not a collective sector moving overall. That is why it is very difficult to anticipate that the expectations of budget rally is not built up in the markets as of now. This indicates that the positions are not there, even though some expectations may be there. This indicates the markets will probably remain lacklustre going into the budget.


How would you look at the infra space? You only had pointed out that every time going into the elections and out of the elections infrastructure stocks do well? So at least there is expectation in those stocks?Yes, there are expectations in the largecap names, like L&T. It has been doing phenomenally well. The other PSU names or the ones in the infra space have also managed to pick up pace. There are pockets of open interest built up into many of these pockets as well on the infra stocks but it is not collective as I was indicating earlier. There are pockets of stocks which look fairly attractive and L&T is one of the largecap names. It also has a very high correlation on the Nifty. 


Is there opportunity within auto stocks or do you think they will continue to feel the heat for some more time?There is some opportunity for many of the investors to try and latch on to these auto stocks. There have been many stocks which have gone through a nine-month range. Eicher Motors, Maruti have stopped falling in terms of price correction. These stocks are in a range where there is more of a grind happening. These stocks are also forming some technical patterns in terms of bullish RSI diversions which is a very good setup on a longer term basis as well. 

These stocks correcting 25-30% from their one-year, two-year peaks and then going through a seven-month, eight-month, nine-month kind of consolidation is a very good sign. The best focus here should not be to try and pick the right levels to try and enter the stock names like Maruti, M&M and then try and average out further if these stocks provide you any 5%-7% kind of a dip.


What are your stock ideas ex the auto pack?There are two stocks which I would want to highlight; one of them is from the auto space and that is M&M. I believe that stock looks extremely attractive; Rs 630 is a base for the stock price. It has been holding on to that support level for almost the last four, five months and it has formed a bullish RSI divergence setup that remains to be a buy targets of Rs 720 on M&M and stop loss at Rs 625. 

The second is Torrent Power. The stock came back to life in the last expiry when you saw a big price uptick of 10-12% and then a follow through price upmove in subsequent days. I believe the stock has now confirmed a lot of breakouts on the upside. Torrent Power is also a buy at targets of Rs 310 and stop loss at Rs 265."
0,2019-07-01,Eicher,"MUMBAI: Royal Enfield, the cultbike brand from Eicher Motors, is considering a new 250 cc variant to arrest a slide in volumes and market share, and as part of a broader push to make it more accessible to buyers.

The Royal Enfield brand had gone off the radar of aspiring youth looking for an upgrade, as enthusiasm dampened somewhat due to an increase in prices of about 8-10% over the last couple of years on account of a transition to BS IV emission norms, a spike in insurance cost and the introduction of a mandatory anti-lock braking system.

A slowing economy and about a dozen product launches in the Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh price band also added to the company’s woes.

From strong double-digit growth over the last five to six years, Royal Enfield has slipped into a doubledigit decline in the last four months.

Under new CEO Vinod Dasari, however, the bike maker has rolled out a plan to set up 350 small outlets in the hinterland, apart from considering a new 250 cc bike variant. The 250 cc study is being carried out by the Indian R&D centre, even as the UK Technical Centre moots new, bigger displacement bikes for the global markets.

RE is also planning to debut a no-frills bike for all its brands, giving a prospective buyer the choice of personalisation and accessorisation.

RE will be able to address the value and premium segment, giving power to prospective buyers, according to the idea pushed by Dasari.

If a prospective buyer does not require all the bells and whistles, he/ she can buy a no-frills version, and if the customer wants to spruce up the motorcycle, he/she has the option of adding hosts of accessories to make the vehicle stand out.

According to people in the know, the brand’s prominence and consumer interest remains high. Yet, it is not translating into sales, and factors such as price and features have become critical, which the company needs to address immediately.

When contacted, a company spokesperson declined to comment on future product plans, but said that accessibility had always been important for Royal Enfield in product development and experience.

“We will continue to focus our efforts on bringing classic, evocative and fun-to-ride motorcycles for our customers. We have persistently worked on keeping our motorcycles accessible, from the perspective of availability, ride experience, as well as ownership experience,” the spokesperson said. On the role of customisation, the spokesperson added, “We have a range of genuine motorcycle accessories that allow buyers to customise and personalise their motorcycles. We believe it is a core aspect of self-expression for our riders. We will continue to work towards making this experience more seamless for the customer.”

The company has enjoyed one the highest operating profits among automakers, thanks to its ability to pass on higher costs to customers with ease. However, the moderation in volumes over the past one year suggests that customers’ ability to buy at any price point is gradually waning and rising product prices is emerging as a deterrent to convert enquires into sales. The company’s volumes grew a measly 0.6% in the last fiscal year, its lowest volume growth since 2010.

With a double digit decline in sales for four consecutive months, Royal Enfield is staring at the first year of de-growth in almost a decade and the company is unlikely to meet its production guidance of 9.5 lakh units.

The company admitted that the current dip in volumes is largely related to an economic slowdown rather than brand fatigue. Over last five years, it has been a case of both volume and realisation, where the brand enjoyed a strong pricing power. Experts, however, differ to say that the impact of price increases on volumes in the last nine months indicates brand fatigue is setting in."

4,2019-07-02,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Passenger car sales shrank by double digits for the third straight month in June as buyers continued to be put off by higher interest costs following the nonbank lending crisis and by rising automobile prices.

The end of election uncertainty in May did not revive Motown’s spirits and the numbers could increase pressure on the Narendra Modi-led NDA government to open the purse strings in this week’s budget to spur lending and growth. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her first budget and the Modi government’s seventh on Friday amid a sharp consumption slowdown.

The motor industry estimates that passenger vehicle sales fell by about 19% to 222,000 units in June, the third straight month of double-digit declines. Vehicle sales had fallen 17% in April and 20.5% in May.


Others
Market leaders Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor India led the drop, with wholesale volumes declining by 17% to 111,014 units and by 7.3% to 42,007 units, respectively.

“The elections got over towards the end of May. Demand cannot revive overnight. The budget, new policies are yet to be announced by the government,” Maruti Suzuki chairman RC Bhargava told ET. “That said, wholesale numbers do not reflect the demand on ground. If we look at retail data on a month-on-month basis, it will give a better picture of consumer sentiments.”

Data with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) shows retail sales of passenger vehicles declined by 1.28% to 264,035 units in April and by 1.46% to 270,048 units in May. The retail data for June is yet to be announced.


‘No Trigger to Boost Sales’
Automakers in India report wholesale dispatches to dealers and not actual sales to customers.

“There has not been any specific trigger after elections to boost sales. The revival is taking longer than expected,” said Vikas Jain, national sales head at Hyundai Motor India.

Bhargava added that automobile sales “normally” tend to pick up around the festive season of September-October. Maruti Suzuki has indicated that sales will grow 4-8% in FY20, with demand picking up in the second half of the year.

Maruti Suzuki reported a slide in wholesale volumes across most categories in June. While sales of mini cars (Alto and old WagonR) fell 36.2% to 18,733 units, compacts (Baleno, Ignis, Celerio, Swift, New WagonR, DZire) declined 12.1% to 62,897 units. Wholesale volumes of utility vehicles decreased 7.9% to 17,797 units last month. Sales of vans dropped 24% to 9,265 units. It is only in the midsize sedan segment that the company registered a 47.1% rise in volumes at 2,322 units.

At Toyota, sales fell 19% to 10,603 units. N Raja, deputy managing director at Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said the company has consciously lowered the volume of vehicles sold to dealers to minimise their burden.

“We look forward to the upcoming budget to address the need for positive growth in the economy, which would result in better sentiment in the auto industry,” Raja said.

“There has not been any significant trigger so far to turn around auto sales,” said VG Ramakrishnan, managing partner at Avanteum Partners. “If some stimulus is outlined in the budget, that coupled with festive demand and pre-buying ahead of implementation of BS VI emission standards will push up demand in the next 3-4 months.”

Domestic auto manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra was the only company to buck the trend and report a 4% growth in passenger vehicle sales at 18,826 units in June.

“The market sentiment continued to remain subdued, especially in the passenger vehicles segment,” said Veejay Ram Nakra, chief (sales and marketing), automotive division, at M&M. “We are happy to register a growth of 4% in the passenger vehicles segment and 8% in the utility vehicles segment on the back of our three recent product launches.”

In commercial vehicles, too, a revision in axle load norms that increased freight-carrying capacity, slowing economic conditions and a liquidity crunch in the market hit sales. At Ashok Leyland, sales dropped 14% to 12,085 units. Mahindra registered a 15% decrease in sales at 16,394 units. VE Commercial Vehicles, the joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors, saw volumes crash by 24.6% to 4,203 units.

In the two-wheeler segment, Pune-based Bajaj Auto registered a 4% increase in motorcycle sales (domestic and exports) at 351,291 units in June. Two-wheeler sales at TVS Motor Company dropped 5.9% to 283,461 units."

12,2019-07-03,Eicher,"The Indian economy is showing clear signs of a major slowdown and any effort to revive the same in the Union Budget will not be complete, unless the issues in the hinterland are resolved. 

With indirect taxes out of the ambit of the Union Budget, the government’s annual fiscal roadmap has largely ceased to be material for stock investors. They now only look for policies and schemes that can have trickle-down effect on any sector or stock.

And the rural theme, with implications for a number of sectors, is in focus this time around.

The agriculture sector contributes about 17 per cent of India’s GDP but employs over 50 per cent of the total workforce, and thus has a key place in the demand-supply equation.

Economists point out that despite various efforts by the government, gross value addition of the agriculture (agri-GVA) sector has been declining in recent times and the share of investment to agri-GVA has been falling consistently (See chart).

Therefore, there is a need to make some structural changes in agriculture starting from marketing to exports to double farmers’ income by 2022.

An over 30 per cent slump in BSE Auto index since the Union Budget, unveiled on February 1, 2018 against a 10 per cent rise in benchmark Sensex has been partially attributed to a rural distress, which has also dented demand for FMCG goods. The BSE FMCG Index is up just 5 per cent. 

The gap between rural and urban growth came down to 10 per cent in FY19 from the historical median of 30 per cent.

Addressing rural distress and boosting consumption in the economy are expected to be a key focus of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s full Budget on July 5, and should that happen, it may give FMCG and consumer sector stocks an easy lift. 


Agencies
The rural economy is facing the heat of the slowdown due to a heady mix of lower realisations for farm output and slowing demand, says Mayuresh Joshi, Portfolio Manager Angel Broking.

“Management commentaries of consumer staples/FMCG specifically hinted at moderation and sluggishness in rural consumption,” he said. 

The agriculture sector has been one of the focus areas since the first tenure of the NDA government. Some of the steps taken by the government included introduction of a crop insurance scheme, a mission to improve farm productivity, a scheme to plug holes in the procurement system and hiking of minimum support prices for crops to 1.5 times the cost of production besides a revolutionary income support scheme. 

There are hopes that the forthcoming Budget will have a plethora of measures for the agriculture sector which can boost consumption-linked stocks. 

Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities, believes the government may look at providing interest-free credit cards to farmers, as mentioned in its election manifesto, for short-term new agriculture loans up to Rs 1 lakh at 0 per cent interest rate with tenures of 1-5 years on the condition of prompt repayment of the principal amount. He expects the Budget to have schemes that would benefit pharma, banking, FMCG and housing finance stocks.

SBI ‘Ecowrap’ report said financial institutions and the government should lend their helping hands to farmers by providing market support right from cultivation to sales.

The report also highlighted that capital formation in the agriculture sector has stagnated significantly. A trend reversal there can help achieve the objective of doubling farm income by 2022. 

“This can be achieved by providing an incentive to agri-term loans for investment purpose through an enabling mechanism of either interest subvention or credit guarantee fund,” it said.

At present, the crop insurance scheme called PM’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) covers three types of crops, namely food crops (cereals, millets, and pulses), oilseeds, annual commercial or horticulture crops, which account for only 30 per cent of the total crop loans of banks. 

“Government should cover all types of crops under PMFBY, which will help banks manage risks and also make a statement of intent in the Budget to increase income support from Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 over next five years. This will create a feel-good factor and boost consumer sentiments,” the SBI Economic Research said.

Consumption-related stocks like Emami, LT Foods, Bajaj Hindusthan, Vadilal Industries, Prataap Snacks and Future Consumer are down over 20 per cent since Union Budget, 2018. However, stocks like Nestle, HUL, Marico, Britannia and Dabur are up between 12 per cent and 60 per cent in the same period.

None of the stocks in the BSE Auto index has delivered positive return to investors since February last year. Tata Motors, TVS Motor, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland and M&M are down between 20 per cent and 60 per cent.

“Two factors can help improve rural demand. First, the monsoon and schemes or measures that the government is expected to announce in Budget to stem deteriorating rural demand. Any revival in rural sector will boost stocks like Colgate and ITC,” said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.

The two stocks have delivered a meagre 1 per cent return to investors since February 1, 2018.

17,2019-07-06,Eicher,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget may have attempted newer ideas to address some of the existing ailments of Indian industry, but it failed to provide near-term life support to the auto industry, which has been going through its worst slump in over a decade.

Indian auto firms have been witnessing sales drop in double-digits percentages in recent months. It was 21 per cent in May, the steepest decline in nearly 18 years. In June, largest carmaker Maruti reported another 17 per cent drop.

Barring Bajaj Auto (up 4.17 per cent), none of the stocks in the BSE Auto index have delivered positive return to investors on a year-to-date basis till July 5. The index is down 15 per cent year to date with TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland and Maruti Suzuki falling between 14.50 per cent and 25 per cent. Tata Motors is down 7.75 per cent YTD. 

Indirect taxes have gone out of the ambit of the Budget, and thus it was not the right occasion to meet the industry demand for a cut in GST levy on cars. But the industry was expecting some hint from the Finance Minister in this regard, which was missed in her Budge speech.

The industry says cars are treated a ‘sin’ good and are clubbed with tobacco and luxury goods in the 28 per cent GST tax bracket with 0-22 per cent compensation. The industry has also been looking for a reduction in GST levy on two-wheelers, which did not come about in the budget. 

The Budget did have some good news for the industry, but they were mainly for electric vehicles, which the industry is yet to bring into the market.

The Finance Minister proposed a GST cut from 12 per cent to 5 per cent on electric vehicles and a complete customs duty waiver on e-drive assembly, onboard charger, e-compressor and charging systems.

The FM also announced tax deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh on interest paid on loans taken between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2023 for purchase of electric vehicle. This will provide an impetus to the electric vehicle market in India.

Besides, there was an increase in customs duty from 25 per cent to 30 per cent on completely built units (CBUs) and some components will encourage local manufacturing and protect the domestic auto component industry, but analysts said this may also create hindrance to industry's capability.

Among others, a rescue package was announced for the troubled NBFC sector, which may help improve lending to car buyers, especially in the commercial vehicle segment. Tightness in lending by liquidity-stressed NBFCs or shadow bankers has been cited as one of the key reasons behind the slowdown in the auto sector.

The Budget also had a proposal for 2 per cent interest subventions for MSMEs, which analysts said may help auto dealers and small component manufacturers. The enhancing of turnover limit for lower corporate tax bracket at 25 per cent to Rs 400 crore is also expected to benefit 80 per cent of auto component makers and automobile dealers. Even the dedicated portal for prompt credit to MSMEs is seen as a positive announcement for the industry. 

The government also announced plans to build 125,000 km of rural roads with investment of over Rs 80,250 crore in next five years, which should create demand for last-mile mobility, boosting LCV and entire CV segments.

The industry was expecting more money in the pockets of consumers through reduction in income-tax to boost demand, which did not come about. There was also demand for a scrappage policy in order to fuel latent demand, but there was no such announcement in the Budget. 

Meanwhile, an additional Re 1 cess on motor fuel besides the Re 1 additional road and infrastructure cess will increase petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 a litre, which will only add to the industry’s woes.

Industry watchers said the government is clearly in a hurry to usher in electric vehicles, especially in the lower segments, which is why there was no attempt to boost sales of existing petrol and diesel cars. This means the industry’s pain is not going to go away anytime soon, but players that are able to make a quick shift to the EV segment stand to benefit hugely from the tax bonanza being doles out to early buyers."
18,2019-07-08,Eicher,"MUMBAI: It has been a fairly tough year for the Indian automotive industry and for Eicher Motors and the short term looks challenging, concedes Siddhartha Lal, managing director of Eicher Motors Limited. However, Lal remains upbeat about the long term as the maker of Royal Enfield motorcycles and Eicher trucks bets on global expansion.

“After several years of double-digit sales growth, we recorded flat sales volumes at Royal Enfield (RE) as slowing economic growth along with price increases brought on by regulatory changes affected demand,” Lal said in his address to shareholders in Eicher Motors’ annual report. “VECV was also affected by the economic slowdown, liquidity crisis and an all-time high discounting across the commercial vehicles industry.”

RE sold 8,22,700 motorcycles in FY19, a negligible increase over 8,20,100 motorcycles in FY18. Meanwhile, VECV, a joint venture between the Volvo Group and Eicher, sold 73,000 trucks and buses in the year, an increase of 11% from 65,900 units in the previous year.

RE’s monthly sale declined 17% from 72,510 units at the end of May 2018 to 60,211 units at the end of May 2019. Consequently, its two-wheeler market share dipped from 3.9% to 3.5%.

The man credited with turning the fortunes of Royal Enfield, however, remains upbeat about the brand's prospects in the future. “I believe the trend for premiumisation of most product categories, including motorcycles, in India and developing markets will continue for the next few decades; and we are very well positioned for that,” Lal said. In the developed markets, there is a trend towards down-sizing and simplification from big litre-class motorcycles, he said, and RE is again positioned to benefit there.

The company aims to transform Royal Enfield into a ""premium global consumer brand"" by 2030 that sells not just motorcycles but other “symbiotic products” and experiences, Lal said.

At VECV, the company will be focussing on sustainably growing its market share in the domestic market during FY20 and also explore the potential in the Indonesian and South African markets where the company recently entered with the UD brand.

RE reported a 12% increase in net profit during FY19 to Rs 2203 crore while VECV’s net profit remained flat at Rs 475 crore. During the same period, Lal’s compensation increased 28% to Rs 12.2 crore."
24,2019-07-09,Eicher,"By Nupur Acharya

A slowdown in economic growth amid the trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies has put Indian corporate earnings at risk, analysts say.

“It’s the confluence of headwinds -- weak global demand, fading impact of rupee depreciation, non-bank finance company crisis and scale-back of government spending -- which is deepening the slowdown,” Edelweiss Securities Ltd. analysts led by Prateek Parekh said in a note.

The country’s economic growth slumped to a five-year low of 5.8 per cent in January-March. The absence of any substantial fiscal stimulus for companies in the federal budget last week puts the onus back on the government to spur growth. The Reserve Bank of India has already cut interest rates three times this year and signaled more easing to come.

Edelweiss expects profits for companies in the NSE Nifty 50 Index rose 7 per cent year-on-year in the April-June period. The broker sees profit expansion concentrated in just a few sectors, namely financials, airlines, pharmaceuticals and cement.

Here’s what analysts expect from the results season that kicks off Tuesday with Asia’s top software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.


Reliance Securities (Naveen Kulkarni)



Expect “uninspiring” 1Q earnings. Nifty company profits are likely to grow by just 6 per cent, led by banks and financial services stocks.
Autos will be the major drag on earnings.
Inventory losses at oil marketing companies will hurt profits for the oil and gas sector.
Consumer sector will see growth challenges. Price growth is critical as volume growth tapers. Titan Co. Ltd., ITC Ltd., Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and Marico Ltd. top picks.
Building materials, infrastructure and capital goods will see healthy earnings. Top results picks are Ultratech, JK Cement, KEC International and Larsen & Toubro.


Dolat Capital



Agrochemicals and specialty chemicals are potential winners.
Auto companies are expected to report sharp drops in profits. Bajaj Auto Ltd. and TVS Motor Co Ltd are likely to report relatively better performance.
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd are likely to perform above par, but improvement in net interest margins is expected to remain marginal as funding costs are unlikely to taper materially.
Expect revenue growth to remain muted for consumer companies due to the liquidity crunch in the first half of the quarter.
Expect revenue momentum to continue for software exporters due to strong deal signings in 4Q. Cross-currency movement will have a negative impact of 10-50 bps on the dollar revenue of Indian IT vendors.


Edelweiss Securities (Prateek Parekh)



Auto margins are expected to be range-bound due to poor volumes. The benefits of relatively lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by company efforts to reduce inventories. Ashok Leyland, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Eicher Motors are top picks.
Tight liquidity, risk aversion and slower growth dent the earnings outlook for shadow lenders. Their overall assets under management likely grew 2.1 per cent q/q and 12.8 per cent y/y.
Among banks, those with robust deposits, pricing flexibility and ability to aggressively raise deposits have an edge. Edelweiss prefers ICICI Bank, SBI and Kotak Mahindra Bank; among NBFCs, the picks are Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Frinancial Services Ltd.
Sharp price hikes and easing fuel costs will offset impact of low demand for cement companies. Top picks are Shree Cement and JK Cement Ltd.
Consumer goods companies will post weak volume growth overall. Sees Britannia and Marico posting strongest growth, at over 6 per cent.
Positive on software exporters on basis of demand; prefer large caps due to execution capabilities, investment ability and better valuations. Buy on Infosys Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd. and HCL Technologies Ltd., Hold on Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Wipro Ltd.


Kotak Institutional Equities (Sanjeev Prasad)


The outlook is positive for corporate banks ICICI Bank and SBI given their inexpensive valuations and visibility of steady progress toward RoE “normalization.” Yes Bank will face one of its most challenging quarters. There is more focus on asset quality for IndusInd Bank Ltd. and RBL Bank Ltd.
Expect sharp improvement in profits for Indigo on higher yields and after Jet Airways stopped functioning.
Reliance Industries is likely to report a marginal q/q increase in standalone Ebitda led by higher refining margins, an increase in crude throughput and petchem volumes."

Auto stocks have been beaten down badly over the past one year. Maruti Suzuki is down some 38 per cent year to date to trade at Rs 5,952 on Thursday, while Eicher Motors has slipped 33.6 per cent to Rs 18,859, M&M 33 per cent to Rs 627 and Tata Motors 45 per cent to Rs 151. Among two-wheeler makers, Hero MotoCorp has declined 33 per cent year to date to Rs 2,451 while Bajaj Auto is down 11.2 per cent at Rs 2,676.

While revenues may decline in single-digit percentage points, profits may fall drastically for some. Nomura expects June quarter be the weakest one in recent times for the auto sector.

For its coverage universe, excluding JLR, Nomura forecasts around 5 per cent year-on-year drop in revenue growth while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) and profit after tax (PAT) are likely to fall around 23 per cent and 34 per cent year on year (YoY) respectively.

Nomura expects India’s economic growth to disappoint in fiscal year 2020 at 6.5 per cent compared with 7 per cent projected by the government. 

“Given this outlook, we expect further risk to our volume estimates,” Nomura analysts said, pointing out that demand indicators like freight rates are depressed and delayed monsoon rainfall can also put rural demand at risk. Demand may start to look up again in the second half of the financial year, they said.

“Recent actions by the government and the RBI to improve liquidity for NBFCs should support demand. With a lower base, we expect volume growth to improve from Q1 of FY20F levels and possibly turn positive in H2 of FY20F,” Nomura analysts said.

Motilal Oswal said all auto segments continued to face demand headwinds in June quarter, continuing the trend since the previous quarter. Retail demand further deteriorated due to liquidity issues, weak consumer sentiment and slowdown amidst the general elections.

Consequently, inventories are at record levels across segments and highest at 60-70 days for in the two-wheeler segment despite production cuts.

The brokerage has lowered EPS estimates for FY20 and FY21 for all auto companies under its coverage, with the highest FY20 EPS cut happening for Ashok Leyland at 18 per cent, Maruti Suzuki India at 13.5 per cent and Mahindra & Mahindra at 12 per cent.

Motilal Oswal expects adjusted PAT for Maruti Suzuki to decline by 31 per cent YoY, and that of M&M to fall by 20 per cent YoY.

It sees Tata Motors’ consolidated revenues to decline 15 per cent YoY resulting in a net loss of around Rs 1,180 crore.

Reliance Securities expects auto companies under its coverage universe to report a 7.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) decline in revenue in June quarter. 

It expects profit after tax (PAT) of its auto universe, excluding Tata Motors, to decline by 25 per cent YoY, where the quantum of decline would vary from 2 per cent to 48 per cent. It expects PAT to decline 20 per cent sequentially.

Including Tata Motors, the PAT of its coverage universe is expected to fall by 30 per cent YoY and 55 per cent quarter on quarter (QoQ).

“Considering higher input cost, negative operating leverage and higher expenses due to discounts/ incentives, we expect the margin to contract on YoY as well as QoQ basis,” the brokerage said.

According to Nomura, Ebitda margins are likely to come off by around 250 basis points YoY mainly on lower operating leverage.

In a July 9 note, ICICI Securities said it would be another forgettable quarter for the auto sector. “The demand slump was witnessed in all segments across premium urban to mass market rural,” the ICICI Securities analyst said.

In the near term, ICICI Securities is worried about weakening consumer sentiment amidst a rise in competitive intensity via new product launches is likely to push customer acquisition costs further upwards, while rising dealer delinquencies is leading to constrained financing and, thus, current cycle could remain protracted.

He expressed concerns over renewed electrification push from policy makers, as industry grapples with existing new technology costs. 

“Thus, FY20 could be a trickier year amidst weak consumer sentiment coupled with the BS-VI production planning conundrum. Even a modest inventory glut post next festive season could trigger another fire sale in Q3FY20,” the ICICI Securities analyst said in the note."
30,2019-07-15,Eicher,"MUMBAI: A total of 26 deviations were committed by close to a fourth of the Nifty-50 companies, 11 to be exact, for the year 2018-19, according to the first ‘secretarial compliance report’ that captures adherence to Sebi regulations, which kicked in this year.

Following recommendations from the Uday Kotak-led committee on corporate governance, Sebi has mandated that all listed companies disclose their ‘secretarial compliance status’, intended to ensure efficient board functioning and an in-depth check specific to the regulator’s norms.

The 11 companies are SBI, Larsen & Toubro, IndianOil, NTPC, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, GAIL, Adani Ports, Bharat Petroleum, Eicher Motors and ONGC, according to CimplyFive, a tech solution provider for compliance standards, which analysed information filed by Nifty-50 companies with the stock exchanges.

Inadequate representation of independent directors on the board tops the list with six companies, closely followed by five companies that did not conduct an evaluation for their independent directors — both being areas of concern, according to industry experts.

Of the six companies that reported non-compliance with board composition, penal action is reported only in the case of four — IndianOil, NTPC, Power Grid and Adani Ports. A penalty of nearly Rs 19 lakh was imposed on Adani Ports. In the other two companies — Bharat Petroleum and SBI — penal action is either not taken or, if taken, not reported to exchanges.

Further, for the five companies that had not undertaken evaluation of independent directors, no penal action is reported by auditors. In all these companies, penal action is either not taken or, if taken, not been reported, the analysis said.

A questionnaire emailed to Sebi went unanswered till the time of going to press.

Of the 26 deviations, stock exchanges took penal action against five companies for six lapses. The Companies Act, 2013 requires every listed company to have a minimum onethird of their total number of directors as independent and at least one woman director on their board.

Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head (CFO advisory) at KPMG India, said, “Independent directors have a very significant role to play in ensuring good corporate governance. Similarly, board evaluation is an important step. Therefore, not having the requisite number of independent directors or board evaluation not being done periodically should be areas of concern.”

Shankar Jaganathan, founder and CEO of CimplyFive, said, “Our analysis of the applicable LODR regulations indicates that there are over 150 compliances that an equity listed company needs to undertake every year. Even among the cream of the corporate sector, 26 deviations are reported by 22 per cent of the population. We believe annual secretarial compliance report does not pass the test of cost-benefit analysis. Further, by adding a superfluous reporting requirement, it also could be a deterrent to ease of doing business in India.”"

Separately, CLSA downgraded the M&M stock on Tuesday to ‘sell’ from underperform and lowered the price target to Rs 590 from Rs 690, citing concerns over regulatory cost push and rising competition.

“The auto downcycle has completed its second (tractors, light commercial vehicles), third (medium and heavy commercial vehicles, two-wheelers) and fourth (passenger vehicles) quarter across segments. Historically, downcycles last an average of 7-11quarters but significant variation around these averages, with a range of 4-22 quarters, makes predicting timing of a recovery tricky,” Jefferies said.

The brokerage said channel checks across multiple two-wheeler dealers indicate that retail demand continues to be weak, with no signs of a revival yet.

The BSE auto index has declined 28 per cent over the past year, while the benchmark Sensex advanced 7.7 per cent.

Jefferies said earnings estimate cuts are likely to continue in the sector. The initial phase of “auto stock correction” between September-December 2017 and May-November 2018 was led by “valuation de-rating” but since then earnings downgrades have been the key driver, it said.

“We expect earnings cuts to continue — our estimates are 1-17 per cent below consensus over FY20-21,” said Jefferies.

Jefferies highlighted disappointment in the FY20 Union budget in terms of lack of a fiscal boost to consumption.


It said there are upside factors to the sector in the form of reduction in the GST rate for mass-market two-wheelers to 18 per cent from 28 per cent and a more aggressive vehicle scrappage policy, which targets vehicles older than 10-15 years. However, these factors are not the base case expectations of Jefferies."

35,2019-07-18,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: One of the thumb rules of investing is to buy a stock when it turns cheaper than its logical value. 

If you believe in this rule, the space to look for contrarian bets will be auto sector, say analysts. The sector looks listless at this point, with a gloomy outlook and reeling under mounting challenges.

The BSE Auto index is down 17 per cent year-to-date against a nearly 9 per cent rise in Sensex. The auto pack was down 0.16 per cent at 17,413 around 11 am on Thursday, with nine components trading in the red and seven in the green. Maruti, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland were among the top drags on the index. 

That leaves no bright spot on the canvas. Piling inventories, a major shift to tougher emission norms ahead, the government push for electric mobility, liquidity crunch in the financial system and a slowdown in the economy are taking a heavy toll on the sector, prompting investors to believe the sector is in for a painful phase. The global shift towards shared mobility is another major risk to the industry.

“We are negative on the entire auto pack,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

The auto pack should be looked at not just from a medium-term perspective, but also from a structural perspective. Softer demand and growing inventories pose a medium-term challenge, which has been compounded by the NBFC crisis.

Structurally, the sector is going through a huge transformation. “There are structural challenges for most auto OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). There is a global shift towards shared mobility, which will prune the growth rate that people would have anticipated earlier,"" Pandey said.

The auto industry needs to intensify capex for a transition towards electric and autonomous vehicles. It will put pressure on margins. 

Global brokerage Jefferies recently cut target prices of some auto stocks, as the downcycle continued in this space and retail demand turned weak. 

The brokerage, however, has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 7,100, down from Rs 8,000 earlier. It has an ‘underperform’ rating on Bajaj Auto with a target price to Rs 2,430, down from Rs 2,620.

The brokerage has downgraded Eicher Motors to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ and reduced the price target to Rs 19,300 from Rs 23,400. M&M was the only auto major that saw an upgrade from ‘hold’ to ‘buy’, but the price target was trimmed to Rs 720 from Rs 780.

Contrarians see a silver lining in this space and believe the industry will see a turnaround soon. “The worst is priced in. The overall scenario is not as dismal as it has been made out,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets & Corporate Affairs at IIFL

“In the next three months, we should start seeing an uptick as retail lending of PSU banks is growing and one-off negatives like insurance cost and transition to BS-VI wear off. A large part of the inventory is already getting distributed and Maruti's inventory level should be much lower by August-end, Bhasin said.

He advised investors to look at auto as a contrarian play. “As a contrarian play, this is a very good discretionary consumption opportunity. In the next six months, we could see stock prices react much better as macros turn favourable,” he said.

Bhasin suggested 12-week SIPs on Maruti and Eicher Motors."

Uninspiring quarterly numbers, weak global cues, rising crude oil prices, a geopolitical flareup in West Asia and the rupee's weakness further deteriorated investor sentiment. 

""Market entered into a bearish phase as investors turned sellers due to concerns over the extension of economic slowdown while weak corporate earnings hurt the sentiment further. This correction has expanded to largecaps which until now were attracting FII inflows. Concerns over tax and muted Q1 results will continue to impact,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

We walk you through the highlights of Monday's session:

Investors lose Rs 4.37 lakh crore in 3 daysThe last three days' selloff in the market dragged the cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,44,76,204.02 crore from Rs 1,49,13,806.42 crore on Wednesday, making investors poorer by Rs 4.37 lakh crore. 


YES Bank surges 9%Shares of YES Bank jumped 9.49 per cent to close at Rs 91.15 amid reports that DHFL is likely to announce a deal with special situations investor AION Capital for a majority stake in the housing finance company. The deal would lead to an infusion of $1.5 billion into the debt-ridden firm. With this, DHFL promoters’ family stake is likely to come down to 10 per cent. No big haircut to lenders is likely. SBI, YES Bank, Union Bank and Bank of Maharashtra are among key lenders to the NBFC. 


RBL Bank extends lossesShares of RBL Bank finished 4.46 per cent down at Rs 478.05, extending the losses into the third consecutive session. In the three sessions, the stock has come off 19 per cent. The bank expects the gross non-performing assets ratio to shoot up to 2.5 per cent during the remainder of the year from 1.38 per cent in the June quarter, due to the exposure to some distressed companies, according to PTI.


OBC falls 2% despite reporting profit in Q1State-owned Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) reported a profit of Rs 112.68 crore for the quarter ended June 30. It had posted a loss of Rs 393.21 crore in the same quarter of 2018-19 financial year. However, the numbers failed to excite investors as the stock ended the day with a loss of 2 per cent at Rs 80.35.


HMVL shares surge 10%Shares of Hindustan Media Ventures (HMVL) closed 10.42 per cent up at Rs 90.60 after the company reported over a threefold jump in net profit to Rs 39.67 crore for the quarter ended June 30.

45,2019-07-23,Eicher,"Increasing uncertainty over recovery in demand has raised questions of an imminent slowdown. In such a situation, stability of a portfolio is more important than supernormal returns. Because in times of a slowdown volatility is minimal which indicates low expectations in markets. This means that in present market conditions stable returns would be a new ‘normal.’ This justifies investments in large-cap schemes, which fulfil this criterion.

For those investors who are extremely conservative and are more concerned about their principal investments, Mirae Asset Large Cap is a clear winner. The scheme’s fund managers Neelesh Surana, Harshad Borawake and Gaurav Misra have shown unwavering commitment to the fund house’s investment philosophy. There are three core principles to this philosophy. First, businesses, which are scalable and promise good returns on capital employed. Second, management, which has good capital efficiency and high cash generation. Third, valuation of the company.

These three core principles have ensured that the scheme has been ahead not only of its benchmark index but also its peers in terms of returns. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 13% and 13.3% returns, respectively, while its peers have given an average return of 11.3% and 9.6% in the same period, respectively.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers have shown high interest in private sector banks and in companies which are temporarily going through bad times but have sound and time-tested business and financial performance.

47,2019-07-24,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Demand for compressed natural gas (CNG) has expanded by 50% in four years due to a combination of the Modi government’s thrust on popularising the less-polluting fuel, expansion of filling stations, lower gas prices and multiple CNG vehicle launches by automakers.

CNG sales rose to 3,076 thousand metric tonnes in 2018-19 from 2,037 thousand metric tonnes in 2014-15. Consumption of petrol and diesel, which have much larger market, rose 48% and 20%, respectively, in the same period.

“The government’s strong commitment to the natural gas sector has been the biggest demand driver. This has helped expand fuel supply and boosted automakers’ confidence in CNG vehicles,” said ES Ranganathan, managing director of Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL), a gas utility active in Delhi and its suburbs. “Automakers have launched CNG variants of several passenger and commercial models in the past few years, increasing vehicle sales and fuel demand.”

Ford, Honda, Mahindra and Eicher have in recent years launched CNG variants of passenger cars and commercial trucks joining Maruti and Hyundai, which had mostly dominated the factory-fitted CNG vehicles category for years. As automakers spent more resources on manufacturing CNG vehicles, they also pushed their dealerships to drive up sales. The share of factory-fitted CNG vehicles has rapidly expanded in the past few years. Previously, vehicle owners would mostly retrofit their cars after their warranties had expired.

Unavailability of land for setting up filling stations had hampered expansion for years but oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan prompted state-run oil companies to provide space for CNG dispensers at their petrol pumps, helping boost the number of CNG stations by 71% in 4 years to 1,730."

57,2019-07-28,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Come week will be data-heavy as far as earnings, high frequency data and regulatory decisions are concerned. So far, the sentiment on Dalal Street has been fragile, as suggested by the third straight week of fall for benchmark indices, thanks to a less-than-expected set of earnings and cues suggesting slowdown globally.

For the week, Sensex fell 454 points, or 1.18 per cent to 37,883. Nifty fell 135 points, or 1.18 per cent to 11,284. 


Here are a couple of factors which may sway the market direction next week:


US Fed policy: If we go by a Reuters poll of economists, the US central bank is all set to cut policy rate in its two-day policy review starting Tuesday. This would be the first time in over a decade when the Fed will reduce policy rates. As per the poll, a 25 basis points Federal Reserve interest rate cut is almost a done deal. The Reuters poll anticipates another rate cut later in the year amid rising economic risks from the ongoing US-China trade war. 


Q1 results of a dozen Nifty firms: Dr Reddy’s Labs will announce its June quarter results on Monday; Axis Bank, Hero Motocorp and Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday; UPL, IOC and Eicher Motors on Wednesday while SBI, ITC, HDFC, Bharti Airtel and Power Grid will release June quarter earnings on Friday. NMDC, Ashok Leyland, DHFL will be other firms announcing their quarterly results this week.


US-China negotiators to meet in Shanghai: Lead negotiators for China and the United States will meet in Shanghai on Tuesday for two days in the next round of trade talks, China’s commerce ministry confirmed this week

It would mark the first face-to-face meeting between US and Chinese trade teams since presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed at a G20 summit in Japan to revive talks to end their year-long trade war, Reuters reported.


High frequency data releases:  Next week will see release of trade data. Readings such as manufacturing and service PMIs, auto sales numbers, core sector output and July GST collections will also be keenly followed. The numbers may hold the key when the RBI's monetary policy committee meeton August 5-7.


GST council meet outcome: The council in its meet on Saturday brought down the GST on electric vehicles (EVs) to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. It also slashed the GST on EV Chargers from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. The new rates will be effective from 1st August 2019. Besides, it approved exemption from GST on hiring of Electric Buses by local authorities. The move will influence shares of auto and auto component makers."

61,2019-07-29,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Friday’s gains in equities proved to be shortlived as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty on Monday resumed their downward movement, falling up to 0.84 per cent.

Weak Asian markets combined with continuous outflow of foreign funds weighed on investor sentiment. “The market started the week on the feeble note and lost nearly one per cent. Weak Asian markets combined with continuous outflow of the foreign funds are weighing on sentiment. The market is largely focusing on weak domestic sentiment while global cues remain mixed,” said Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking.

Investors stayed away from riskier equities, awaiting anxiously for the Fed outcome on Wednesday. Uninspiring earnings and lack of positive triggers continued to keep risk appetite low. 

Here is a breakdown of the key highlights of Monday's session. Take a look:


400 stocks plumb 52-week lowsAs many as 405 stocks, including Bajaj Auto, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland and EID Parry (India), plumb 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, Asian Paints, Adhunik Industries, Banas Finance, Kratos Energy & Infrastructure, Mac Hotels and Procter & Gamble Health were among the 26 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


Upper & lower circuitsIndiabulls Integrated Services, Cox & Kings, Unitech, Essar Shipping, 5paisa Capital and SORIL Infra Resources were among the 242 stocks that hit their lower circuits. On the other hand, 118 stocks, including Jubilant Industries, Astec Lifesciences, Mangalam Drugs & Organics, 63 Moons Technologies, Electrotherm (India), HOV Services and Manaksia Steels, hit upper circuits.


Rs 1.36 lakh crore gone in a dayMonday's losses in equities dragged the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,42,45,433.92 crore from Rs 1,43,82,243.21 crore on Friday, making investors poorer by Rs 1.36 lakh crore in a single day!


Above & below 200-DMAsLarsen & Toubro, NTPC, Voltamp Transformers, NIIT Technologies, Mahindra Lifespace Developers, India Cements, Bank of Maharashtra, Adani Transmission and Max Financial Services were among the stocks that witnessed negative breakouts and traded below their 200-DMAs. However, JSW Energy, Grindwell Norto and Jubilant Industries were among those who traded above 200-DMAs.


74 stocks show potential for riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 74 counters on BSE, signalling these stocks may witness gains in the coming sessions. Among those stocks were Suzlon Energy, TCS, Mindtree, GHCL, HCL Technologies, Deepak Fertilisers, Binani Industries and Varun Beverages. On the other hand, Vedanta, HDFC Life Insurance, Power Grid Corporation, Ambuja Cements, Hindustan Unilever and PVR were among the 56 stocks that showed bearish crossovers.


140 stocks now oversold Momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 140 stocks, including Ballarpur Industries, Vodafone Idea, Tejas Networks, RBL Bank, HCC, Marksans Pharma and Tata Elxsi, in the oversold zone on BSE. On the other hand, VR Films & Studios, Goenka Business, Yashraj Containeurs, EIS and Mandhana Industries were among the 18 stocks that entered the overbought zone.


Auto top sectoral loserBSE Auto, with a loss of 3.55 per cent, finished as the top loser among the sectoral indices on BSE after the government proposed to hike registration cost on new vehicles. The index ended with all components in the red, with Tata Motors (down 6.52 per cent), Apollo Tyres (down 6 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 4.99 per cent), Eicher Motors (down 4.81 per cent) and Motherson Sumi Systems (down 4.34 per cent) as the top losers. Maruti's poor Q1 numbers also aggravated a selloff in shares of auto companies which have been grappling to cope with a slump in demand in the wake of liquidity crunch in the financial space, weak monsoon and changes in emission and safety norms. 


Vodafone Idea plunges 27%Shares of Vodafone Idea plunged 26.81 per cent to close the day at Rs 6.77 after weak results for the fiscal first quarter, which prompted analysts to fear that the telco could rapidly be relegated to a regional player if it fails to grow revenue in the coming quarters. 


Maruti shares down 4%Shares of Maruti Suzuki closed 4.26 per cent down at Rs 5,558.05 today. India’s largest carmaker on Friday reported a 27.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit at Rs 1,435.50 crore for June quarter on weak volumes and higher depreciation expenses. While the company’s slump in profit was broadly on the expected lines, projected near-term pressure on volumes and demand has prompted analysts to turn cautious on the stock. 


ICICI Bank climbs 3%Shares of ICICI Bank ended 3.32 per cent higher at Rs 429.30 after the lender’s June quarter earnings impressed investors on Dalal Street. Brokerages say the scrip has potential to rally 25-50 per cent in next one year, as incremental stress at the second-largest private bank moderates with the shrinkage of the pool of low-rated corporate exposure. 


DRL declines ahead of earningsShares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) closed 1.92 per cent down at Rs 2,652.55 ahead of its June quarter numbers. Post the market hours, the company said its consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for the June quarter climbed 45 per cent on year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 662.80 crore compared with Rs 456.10 crore in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, the profit surged 53 per cent."
62,2019-07-29,Eicher,"Auto stocks tumbled up to 6.5 per cent on Monday as investor sentiment were hit after decision to reduce tax rate on electric vehicles and proposal to hike registration fees for old and new vehicles. 

 Shares of Tata Motors plunged 6.52 per cent, Apollo Tyres 6 per cent, Bajaj Auto 4.99 per cent, Eicher Motors 4.56 per cent, Motherson Sumi Systems 4.34 per cent, TVS Motor Company 4.27 per cent, Maruti Suzuki India 4.26 per cent, Ashok Leyland 3.50 per cent, Hero MotoCorp Limited 2.61 per cent and M&M 2.07 per cent on the BSE. 

 The BSE auto index dropped 3.55 per cent to close at 15,610.93. 

 ""Auto index corrected following the news that government proposes to hike registration fees on new vehicles,"" said Vishal Wagh, head of research, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd. 

 The government on Friday proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles. 

 ""The ministry has issued a draft notification for amendments to the CMVR (Central Motor Vehicles Rules) for providing a boost to electric vehicles, ensuring divyang friendly features in buses, and providing an enabling mechanism for scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years,"" Road Transport and Highways Ministry said in a statement. 

 For conducting test and the grant and renewal of fitness certificate for motor vehicles older than 15 years, the fee has also been increased. 

 Under this category, the draft notification proposes certificate renewal charges of Rs 1,200 for manual, and Rs 2,000 for automated vehicles under medium or heavy motor vehicle. 

 Meanwhile, the high-powered GST Council on Saturday decided to reduce the tax rate on electric vehicles (EVs) to 5 per cent from the existing 12 per cent, a move aimed at accelerating the adoption of eco-friendly mobility solutions. SUM SHW SHW"
64,2019-07-30,Eicher,"There is a bit of hope trade in the pharma sector but there are good chances that some of the marquee names could deliver reasonable returns over the next six months, says Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


After ICICI Bank’s stupendous performance, can Axis Bank match up today?The expectations even from Axis Bank are quite high. The NII growth is expected to be in the range of around 17-18% and profit in the range of around Rs 1,700 crore and that is what we are expecting. Slippages should be similar to what they were in the previous quarter but that is the key number to look at in this quarter. We have had some bit of downgrades that happened during the quarter and that will be the number that the market will be very much focussed upon -- the slippage number and the asset quality challenges that the industry is facing. Whether Axis can deliver something similar to ICICI Bank is something which the market will be very very watchful about.


In case you are tracking Strides Pharma, it is up about 10% in trade today. The pharma story has been incredibly stock specific. Where would you look to invest in pharma -- more domestic oriented names or specific midcaps?If we look at pharma as a pack, the companies which have a higher exposure to domestic businesses, are a safe bet. That has been the investment theme for the last one year. The likes of let us say an Alchem or a Torrent have been much better investment candidates than the companies which have a much greater US exposure, but having said that what is happening now is that the base has become favourable for a lot of companies like Sun Pharma.

There are factors which should start working for the Indian pharma industry, especially in the specialty space. Those are the factors that the market is starting to focus upon and of course there are challenges with regards to options. There is a bit of hope trade in the pharma sector but there are good chances that some of the marquee names could deliver reasonable returns over the next six months.


What is your view on the overall fund flow given that we have seen a massive FII exodus? We have been talking about not just the FPI taxation issue but also slowing growth. Is this going to remain a lingering concern? Are the FIIs going to search for better havens within the emerging market basket?Yes. One is the taxation issue. That taxation issue is not going to go away so easily, unless and until some change is made by the government. This aspect is quite tricky in terms of where the foreign institutional investors will start finding comfort in terms of valuation and the growth which will essentially offset the increase in the burden of taxation. So, that is one aspect. There is no clear cut answer to the amount of FIIs selling which can take place. Apart from that, growth is definitely a concern now. There is of course a bit of challenge which we are clearly witnessing in terms of base effect also because the previous two years, the base has gotten normalised and now with the base being quite elevated, the growth numbers have started to look optically weaker. So, that is another challenge that we are witnessing. 

But the base effect also starts receding in forthcoming quarters like Q3 and Q4 in some of the sectors like auto. It is going to be a mixed bag in terms of the growth challenges that we are going to witness from here on, but the next three months clearly look to be challenging both from an FII outflow perspective as well as economic growth perspective. These are the two challenges which are very evident and they are going to put a lot of pressure on the markets.


Hero result will be out today. We have not seen anything encouraging coming out of Bajaj. We have seen that pressure continue. What are you anticipating from Hero or from some of the remaining auto names that we are still expecting to deliver?From Hero we are not expecting anything great. The volume numbers are down by almost 11% for this quarter. There has been 4-4.5% improvement in pricing. But revenues are still going to be down for Hero Motors because of negative operating leverage. The EBITDA numbers are going to be further down. We are looking at 18-19% decline in EBITDA and 16-17% decline in earnings. So we are not expecting anything great from Hero. 

Sequentially we are looking at 3% to 4% improvement in earnings for Hero Motors. So we will have to wait and watch about what the management commentary will be in terms of inventory levels, what they are seeing in the market and whether things could improve maybe three months from now. Those are the aspects the market will be focussed upon but as of now from this quarter numbers I think it is still going to be a wash out quarter.


About Eicher given that we are also going to be expecting those numbers tomorrow?We do not track Eicher Motors that closely but considering the way the auto numbers have been, I do not think any of the auto companies are reporting any great set of numbers. The auto pack has been quite weak. Again, volumes numbers are out and the focus tends to be on margin and management commentary on their outlook. We will have to wait and watch on these aspects and those are the more qualitative aspects that the market will be focussed upon.


 When it comes to the oil marketing companies, what is your expectation from the likes of IOC and HPCL? Do you believe that with the volatility in crude oil prices, one would be a little bit cautious here as well?Yes. This quarter, there are inventory losses and the overall numbers may not be encouraging but again we will have to wait and watch on some of the other aspects also for the oil marketing companies in terms of their gross margins.

Those aspects we will have to focus upon as of now but as of now. I do not think the oil marketing companies are going to report any great numbers."

HDFC Securities expects the company to report 23 per cent YoY drop in net profit at Rs 440 crore. Sales are seen falling 10 per cent YoY to Rs 2,280 crore. Volumes are expected to plunge 19 per cent.

69,2019-07-31,Eicher,"Mumbai: Automaker Eicher Motors reported a 21. 6 per cent drop in June quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates, as sales suffered due to low demand across the auto sector.

Total revenue from operations came in at Rs 2,381.9 crore, down 6.5 per cent from 2,547.8 crore a year ago.

The results for auto companies have been muted in line with low demand, due to higher upfront insurance costs and a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC sector.

Last week, the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki reported a 27.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in profit at Rs 1,435.50 crore for the June quarter on weak volumes and higher depreciation expenses. 

Hero MotoCorp reported a 38.28 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit at Rs 1,257 crore, beating ET Now poll estimate of Rs 785 crore by a wide margin, thanks to a one-off exceptional gain of Rs 737.50 crore.

The world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer had reported Rs 909 crore profit in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue from operations for the quarter fell to Rs 8,030 crore compared with Rs 8,810 crore in the year-ago quarter."

Revenue from operations for the company declined 7% to Rs 2382 crore last quarter. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) dropped 24% to Rs 614 crore in the period under review.

2,2019-08-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Eicher Motors were trading lower in Thursday's sesssion after the company on Wednesday reported a 21.52 per cent fall in its consolidated net profit at Rs 452 crore for the quarter ended June 30. 

It had posted a net profit of Rs 576 crore in the same period last year.

The scrip hit an intraday low of Rs 15,800 in early trade on Thursday against the previous close of Rs 16,350.

Total revenue from operations stood at Rs 2,382 crore for the April-June quarter, down 7 per cent compared with Rs 2,548 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. 

Royal Enfield sold 1,81,966 motorcycles in the quarter, registering a decline of 19 per cent from 2,25,286 motorcycles sold over the same period in the last financial year.

""The two-wheeler and the CV industry continue to face headwinds on account of weak consumer demand,"" Eicher Motors Managing Director Siddhartha Lal said.

The company's preparedness for the BS-VI transition continues to be on track and Royal Enfield is on course to meet regulatory timelines, he added.

CLSA cut the target price of Eicher Motors to Rs 19,000 from Rs 21,000 earlier. However, it retained 'outperform' rating on the stock. The global brokerage firm also cut FY20-21 EPS for Eicher Motors by 6-7 per cent.

Credit Suisse also slashed the target price to Rs 15,000 from Rs 19,900 per share earlier. It also cut FY20/21E EPS by around 17 per cent for the Royal Enfied maker.

YES Securities said that Eicher Motors reported a weaker than expected performance with EBIDTA margins for the standalone entity at 25.9 per cent against their expectations of 26.3 per cent."
3,2019-08-01,Eicher,"We are generally positive on banks. Depending on the portfolio, investors could look at gradually increasing their investments in private sector banks, says Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What do you make of the Zee deal? It is good that it has happened but the promoter group still has a sizable Rs 7,000-crore debt on its balance sheet. Also, against market anticipation of a 15-20% premium, the deal has come in at 10% premium. Would you say that the stock price movement today would be restricted but maybe it is going to last only that much?I cannot predict the price movement although intuitively I think the stock price should move up and at the end of the day, it is a good beginning and what I am most pleased about is the fact that there will be no change in management because the Zee management has been exceptionally good. They have built a business from scratch and they clearly understand the challenges and the growth opportunities. I was not in favour of joint management because of the cost confusion and changes of strategy. Getting a financial investor is extremely positive and it sets a base price for further such sales by the promoter group to other financial investors. 

Eventually, this problem will get resolved sooner or later and it will remove a major overhang on the Zee stock and one should keep in mind that Zee’s quarterly performance last two, three times has been exceptionally good and the price has remained depressed only because of this uncertainty about how the promoters are going to unwind the debt which they have taken on. It is a good beginning. Gradually, the stock price should start moving up given the exceptionally good fundamentals that the company has been displaying over last two, three quarters. 


Is the pain anywhere close to done or are bad times going to continue for Eicher?It is anybody’s call. Some of the veterans in the auto industry are perplexed by the kind of downslide we have seen in volume growth. It is something which the industry has not seen for many years, if not decades. There is no clear-cut roadmap as to when this will turn around. There is hope and expectation that the festive season may be good for the auto industry. 

There is hope that when interest rates start moving down and actual transmission takes place and EMIs for cars and two-wheelers start to go down, then you could have a demand pickup. But it is anybody’s guess that it will actually happen. But from a risk reward perspective, Eicher Motors, Maruti and some of the other auto companies are at attractive levels. The stock price almost halved from its peak and profits are down. But at some point of time, we will see a turnaround -- may be this year, next year or so. Valuation wise also, it is at an attractive level. Whenever the turnaround takes place in the volumes and eventually in financial performance also you could see a sharp reversal of the fortunes of the company. 

At the end of the day it is a solid business, great brands and in a country like India where the demographics favour a business like Eicher, with rising aspiration as far as the youth is concerned for the type of bikes that Eicher produces. The scope for the company is fantastic and in terms of strategy, what needs to be highlighted is that they are taking this opportunity created by the slowdown in the domestic market to growth their export business. 

If you look at the kind of communication coming, the investor presentation and the con-call, they are talking more and more about setting up showrooms overseas and pushing their new bikes, especially the 650cc bikes, to markets abroad. That is a very positive trend and the company could not do it up until now because of capacity constraints but now that those issues are resolved, going forward you could see a tepid growth. It would not be the 25-30% type of growth rates which the company had witnessed in the past, but nonetheless at least double digit type of growth rate would be seen once we are done with this particular lean period in the auto industry.

I would not want to sell Eicher at this price but as far as buying is concerned, I would like to wait for a turnaround in the sales volume. 


Axis and IndusInd results have been pretty much in line or mixed. What is your take on some of these banking earnings and which of the banks would be looking better placed right now?There is a lot of choice as far as banks are concerned and depending upon the investors’ risk profile and risk appetite, we can choose a bank. The likes of HDFC, Kotak came with a good set of numbers and provide steady returns with extremely low risk as you go down the line. Then there are ICICI, Axis Bank and then all the way down is a Yes Bank, where there is scope for the price to move up if some of the issues, especially the capital raising plans fructify for the company. 

So, across the board, there is choice and even new generation bank like IDFC First came out with good set of numbers we thought. Apart from the one-time kind of provisioning which was required, the kind of underlying momentum which was there for deposits as well as retail loans was quite impressive. If you want to go for safety, then we have the larger banks, but if you want to go for alpha, then the smaller banks like Yes Bank or IDFC First also can give very decent returns going forward. But then they have associated risk along with it. 

But from our perspective, the best pick in the lot considering the risk and the return would be IndusInd Bank. The stock has been unnecessarily hammered because of one particular exposure to one account and that also has been fully provided for and we do feel that with the merger of Bharat Financial, a new growth opportunity for the company has opened up and the synergies are still to be fully absorbed in terms of the spreads which they can get on the micro finance loans.

 So, we are generally positive on banks, depending on the portfolio whether there is adequate exposure to increase in banks I think investors could look at gradually increasing their investments in private sector banks. 


As for auto, the sort of brands that they have, a decline in the near term is built into the recent correction?At least until the festive season, we should be looking at negative numbers and then four-five months down the line, we would have the benefit of base effect. We could see at least the volumes flattening out on year on year basis for the months. Corrections in the stock price are reflecting very subdued volumes for the auto industry, especially for July which generally is a weak month and may follow through for August and September as well. I would not read too much into the auto numbers which come out for July, irrespective of whether they are positive or negative.


Do you think the optimism with Axis and ICICI will continue?Yes, I think so. Clearly the kind of steps that they have taken as part of their strategy, the kind of provisions they have made and going forward the way they are structuring their business, it does seem that good times are ahead for both ICICI and Axis Bank. 

In the case of Axis Bank, the recent increase in NPAs may be a one-off. It is plaguing the entire banking industry and at some point of time, the NPA cycle will come to an end and benefit a bank like Axis Bank. But all the mistakes and the sort of decisions of the past now are now so much water under the bridge as far as Axis and ICICI are concerned. 

The scenario in banking industry clearly favours strong banks like ICICI and Axis Bank which are very well capitalised as they grow from the space which the NBFCs are vacating, going forward they will have solid and profitable growth at decent margins. Eventually, provision cost will be lower as a percentage of the profits and that should mean that profits for the bank at the net level should gradually move up. 

Valuations are slightly on the higher side but then private sector banks take cue from the valuations that are given to HDFC Bank and some of the other private sector banks which are quoting at very high PE, price to book multiples. So, per se I remain optimistic on both these companies. It gives a great deal of hope that if ICICI and Axis Bank can reverse their fortunes in terms of the problems that were plaguing them, then there is hope for some of the more beleaguered banks like say Yes Bank, RBL or IndusInd which have been grappling with NPA issues and because of which the stock prices have been hammered down to extremely attractive levels. 

So, from a risk-return perspective, these three banks may deliver a slightly higher return going forward with a higher risk perspective as an ICICI or an Axis Bank."

4,2019-08-02,Eicher,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 50.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Tata Global Beverages and revised fair value to Rs 275 from Rs 240. The company's India tea business perfomance in the June quarter was below expectations on account of moderation in volume growth and sharp contraction in GM led by high-cost RM inventory, the brokerage said. Kotak Institutional sees value and promise in the Tata Global Beverages story even as execution lags expectations. The stock ended up 2.7 per cent at Rs 259.05 on Thursday.

CLSA has maintained outperform rating on Eicher Motors and cut target price to Rs 19,000 from Rs 21,000. The brokerage has cut FY20-21 EPS 6-7 per cent on lower margins in Royal Enfield and commercial vehicle business. CLSA said it likes Royal Enfield’s long-term potential but recognises that the continued earnings cut remains a drag and the stock will likely remain range-bound until Royal Enfield volumes pick-up. The stock ended up 1.3 per cent at Rs 16,561.50 on Thursday.


ICICI Securities has maintained sell rating on Blue Dart Express with a target price of Rs 1,767. The declining margins and the unremarkable volume trends at Blue Dart are not transient, said ICICI Securities. The company needs to find alternate businesses and ways to make the organisation leaner and focus more on surface transport, the brokerage said. Courier and document delivery business will perhaps encounter structural decline sooner than later, said ICICI Securities. The stock ended down 3.1 per cent at Rs 2,335.55 on Thursday.

Investec Securities has maintained buy rating on Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company with a target price of Rs 340. June quarter results strengthen conviction on Cholamandalam Investment's’s ability to deliver 20 per cent growth and RoE for FY20, said Investec. Cholamandalam Investment is a beneficiary of the current liquidity situation as it gained market share while preserving profitability. Its loan growth is the highest among vehicle financiers, said Investec.The stock ended up 0.1 per cent at Rs 259.60 on Thursday.

Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on DLF and revised target price to Rs 238 from Rs 233. Improving sales trajectory, an attractive rental portfolio and a lean balance sheet are likely to lead to better cash flows for DLF, which is likely to be key beneficiary of the ongoing consolidation in the sector, said Edelweiss. The rate of liquidation of inventory worth Rs 110 billion will be a key trigger for the stock, said Edelweiss. The stock ended down 3.2 per cent at Rs 172.40 on Thursday."
7,2019-08-02,Eicher,"Yes Securities has given a 'hold' recommendation on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 16,000.

Shares of Eicher Motors traded at Rs 17,025 around 12:45 pm on 2 August, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 


Brokerage's rationale behind the 'hold' call:

Weaker than expected performance
Eicher Motors reported a weaker than expected performance with Ebidta margins for the standalone entity at 25.9 per cent against the brokerage's expectations of 26.3 per cent. 

Ebidta Margins declined by 641bps year-on-year (YoY) and 187bps quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). 

Decline in margins was on the back of a complete pass through of costs pertaining to implementation of ABS on RE bikes and an impact of operating deleverage as volumes declined by 18.5 per cent YoY and 6.4 per cent QoQ. 

Higher depreciation led by capitalization of Vallam Vadagal second phase and Rs 7 crore impact pertaining to adoption of IndAS 116. VECV revenues were ahead of estimates on the back of higher than expected realisations. 

However, Ebidta margins at 5.5 per cent was lower than expectations of 7.5 per cent. ""With weakness in both businesses, consolidated PAT at Rs 450 crore was lower than our estimates of Rs 470 crore,"" said the brokerage.


Volume growth concerns priced in 
Demand for two-wheeler has been weak for the past several months. For RE, the twins and launch of the new studio format stores (widening the reach) will enable it to arrest the decline to some extent. 

However, the brokerage still anticipates a 3 per cent fall in volumes in FY20E and a modest 5 per cent growth in FY21E. 

Margins are expected to be under pressure due to operating deleverage, rising customer acquisition costs and pass through of BS VI costs. 

""For VECV, we expect the demand to be weak considering fleet operators are under severe stress led by economic slowdown, lower freight rates, higher fuel prices and NBFC crisis,"" the brokerage said.

8,2019-08-05,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Rising costs always dent demand — and swish bikes are no exception to that age-old economic maxim Royal Enfield (RE), the sign of success for an Indian biker, is having a rather bumpy ride of late, and so is the stock of its owner Eicher Motors. Rising costs linked to regulatory compliance, including more stringent emission norms, appear to have sapped the enthusiasm of buyers and investors alike.

RE volumes declined 19 per cent to 2.37 lakh units in the first four months of FY20, with monthly run-rate dropping to about 60,000 units from closer to 75,000 a year ago. If the current run-rate continues, RE volumes may fall 13 per cent in FY20, the most significant drop since 2010. Mandatory ABS, higher insurance cost, and higher state taxes pushed up ownership expenses 12-15 per cent in the past few months.


The top-selling model Classic 350 appears to have reached the state of variant maturity — and consequent buyer fatigue. Classic 350 volumes plunged 32 per cent in the June quarter. Consequently, the share of Classic 350 in total volume dropped to 60.2 per cent.

To arrest declines, RE is opening 500 small-format stores by September end, compared with the earlier plan of 350 in the current fiscal year. According to the company, 60 per cent of the market for the RE brand is outside cities. Therefore, small-format stores are helping tap volume latency and provide lastmile connectivity.

RE has maintained its production guidance of 950,000 units for the current fiscal. However, the Street is working with volume estimates up to 7.6 lakh units, or a minimum decline of 8 per cent. Premium bikes (more than 250 cc bike segment) have under-performed the motorcycle industry by 11 per cent in the past six months, and the share of RE in the premium bike segment dropped to 90.3 per cent in June, compared with 95.2 per cent in December 2018.

Margins aren’t expanding in a contractionary market. Gross margins dropped 60 basis points sequentially in the June quarter as the increase in raw material costs was higher than the rise in average selling price. Operating profit margin fell to 25.9 per cent in the June quarter compared with 32.3 per cent in the same quarter last fiscal. Margins dropped to a 17-quarter low, and this is the third quarter in a row where margins remained below 30 per cent.

The stock is trading at 20 times its one-year projected earnings compared with the long-term average of 32.2, according to Bloomberg. The stock is likely to trade below its longterm average."

MUMBAI: Italian motorcycle maker Benelli has scrapped its plans of setting up a manufacturing plant in India after the government mooted a plan to ban two-wheelers with combustion engines up to 150cc capacity by 2025.

The company was planning to set up a global manufacturing hub in India as its plant in China was operating at full capacity. “We were considering making mass-market bikes also from here to export to other markets,” Vikas Jhabakh, managing director of Benelli India told ET. These included motorcycles with engine capacities below 150cc, he added.

The proposed plant would have had a capacity of manufacturing at least 200,000 units annually to make a business case and would have employed about 400 people, the company had found in its initial studies. 

However, following the clear indication from the government to move away from combustion engines, the company did not see viability in selling these products in India in the long run. “And keeping in mind the vision of the government, setting up manufacturing is not a viable option because these are projects that take a really long time to pay back,” the company’s MD said.

The company has instead doubled the capacity at its assembly facility near Hyderabad to 20,000 units annually and has room to double it further to serve demand in the local market in the future, Jhabakh said.

Benelli India plans to take on Royal Enfield and Jawa with the launch of a 400cc cruiser motorcycle in India with a sub-Rs-2-lakh price tag by the end of this year. The domestic market for motorcycles in the 300cc to 500cc segment is about 825,000 units annually and Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield has 93% market share.

The Italian company also plans to launch two 250cc motorcycles during the same period, but these will be on the more expensive side. Selling scooters in India is also under consideration but no decision has been made so far, Jhabakh said.

Benelli is a fully-owned subsidiary of China’s Qjian Jiang Group and in India it has a marketing tie-up with Hyderabad’s Mahavir Group. It had briefly halted operations in India in May 2018 after its previous partner in the country, Pune-based DSK Group, ran into financial trouble.

It resumed sales in January this year and has sold about 1000 units so far. The company sells six models in India in the 300cc to 600cc range, which are imported as knocked-down kits and assembled at a facility near Hyderabad."
14,2019-08-07,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The 35 bps repo rate cut by RBI failed to enthuse the stock market on Wednesday, with equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty showing bouts of volatility after the policy outcome. 

Sensex jumped over 120 points right after the policy announcement but failed to hold the gain and tanked to trade 160 points down within minutes. 

Around 12.15 pm, the BSE Sensex pared the losses and traded 30 points higher at 37,006, while Nifty traded at 10,944, down 4 points.

""A 25 bps rate cut was already priced in and the market was expecting a 50 bps rate cut. Possibly, that is what disappointed Dalal Street. Also, a solid step for the revival of NBFC sector was missing in the policy announcement,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

The six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday cut repo rate by 35 basis points in its third bi-monthly policy review of the financial year.

22,2019-08-17,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the red, following mixed macroeconomic data amid fears of a global economic slowdown. 

The 30-share Sensex shed 231 points, or 0.62 per cent, to end at 37,350 for the week ended August 16. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty lost 61.85 points, or 0.56 per cent, to end at 11,047.

The market kicked off the week on a bleak note on Tuesday as sentiment got hit after government data showed that India’s factory output growth, as measured by IIP, slowed down for the second straight month to 2 per cent in June compared with 7 per cent in June, 2018 and 3.1 per cent in May, 2019. 

However, the market pared some of the losses in the remaining two days of trade amid hope of a stimulus package for the economy from the government. Investors also took comfort as India’s retail inflation based on CPI eased to 3.15 per cent in July, 2019 from 3.18 per cent in June, 2019 and 4.17 per cent in July, 2018. WPI inflation also eased to a multi-year low of 1.08 per cent in the month of July, on account of cheaper fuel and food items. 

Meanwhile, trade deficit, the gap between imports and exports, narrowed to $13.43 billion in July from $18.63 billion a year ago, helped by a lower oil import bill.

26,2019-08-21,Eicher,"Technically we are buying those companies which are double or 2.5 times the size in 2014 but at the same valuation it was in 2014, says Sunil Singhania, Founder, Abakkus Asset Manager. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW.

In one of your notes you are comparing the current market environment with Bollywood movies. So, what does Jo Dar Gaya So Mar Gaya mean?I meet lots of investors as we are raising the second fund which is more midcap and smallcap focussed. It is very difficult even to convince investors. We have tried to use Bollywood because everyone follows it in India and used some famous dialogues to give their perspective to what is happening in India. 


Jo Dar Gaya Woh Mar Gaya means if you are afraid you might as well be dead. I think fear is more now and even in a lot of companies which are now trading at below book, below intrinsic value, below replacement cost largely because the near term outlook is slightly muted, though they still have profits.


So is it time to take risk?It is time to take risk. Unless you do that, how are you going to make money? You can either be an investor who does not want to take risks in terms of profitability, in terms of the economic environment. Then 2017 would have been best for you as the prices then were not worth taking risk for; or you can take risk now when the economy is struggling slightly and the prices of the same stocks have fallen 50-60%.


You picked up an example from Three Idiots to say when others are in trouble, we feel happy?Yes, in Three Idiots there is this dialogue dost fail hota hai to dukh hota hain, but dost first ata hai to jyada dukh hota hai (You feel sad when your friend fails but even sadder when he comes first). We have tried to relate it to the fact that there are some factors in the world which are negative. Trade war issues are impacting some countries; falling oil prices are impacting some countries and then we have countries with negative interest rate scenario. 

If oil prices fall it is positive, if trade wars happen India is the least impacted in terms of their exports but indirectly impacted if we are able to attract those companies to set up facilities in India. Most importantly, India still has a fairly good interest rate with a stable foreign exchange reserves, we have never defaulted ever in our obligations. Our foreign exchange reserves are very stable, we still are net recipients of foreign money. Others’ problems can become a boon for India.


A year from now, can we say the famous punch line of Aamir Khan, “All is well”? We have to all start to convince ourselves that all is not as bad as we are making out to be.


For the economy and for the markets?I would say both will go hand in hand. Markets might as I said precede the economic recovery.


If not a very large permanent bottom, fundamentally we could be reaching a bottom. A 10% selloff could happen because of technical factors, Dow, trade war, Brexit but fundamentally speaking, 10% is there to lose and 30% is what you can gain in the next 12-18 months?I do not know how much to lose or how much to gain. I would say the risk reward is heavily loaded in favour of investments. Your chances of losing are much smaller than the chances of gaining. Another interesting study which we are doing right now is just comparing the conditions of the company in 2014 to 2019. There are so many good companies. I am not talking about companies which are obscure. These are good companies which have market cap similar to what they were in 2014 but the size of those companies in terms of sales, operating profit, debt equity ratio and in terms of net profit is 2-2.5 times of that was in 2014.

Technically you are buying those companies which are double or 2.5 times the size in 2014 and at the same valuation that it was in 2014.


Ultimately when you are buying a stock you are buying future profit. The point that you are making is that if you are buying some good NBFCs and barring consumer durable companies, you are buying them at market cap and profit levels as low as 2013 and 2014?With no business valuation built in, if you buy an NBFC, at one time book, you are giving zero value to the whole franchise.


Gold is suddenly available at the price of silver, to put it very simply?I do not know about that. I do not want to give hopes that prices will go up by 10 times but our competition is now with the alternative opportunities. I do not see real estate is going anywhere. For fixed income, you make 6.5% in fixed deposits and you have 3% as tax. So you are left with 3.5%. The equity from these levels should do significantly better than other asset classes. It is always good to buy when the prices are low rather than when the prices are high.


In a reverse swing segment, this time you are talking about pharmaceuticals. Again this is one of those dusty-rusty sectors. There are genuine concerns at the company level and at the manufacturing level. Why do you stick your neck out and say there is a case to buy pharma structurally and selectively?If you go back in history, the big run in pharma stocks started from 2008 and it lasted till 2016. The genesis of that was the market cap of the whole pharma sector in India was less than that of DLF in 2008. It was a screaming buy with prices very low and there was this huge tailwind because a lot of drugs internationally were going off patent. 

By 2016, you were looking at pharma companies which were trading at 40 times trailing and 50 times trailing and then you had a lot of headwinds; one was the growth slowdown because the generic prices started to fall. There was a big headwind from the US regulatory issues and almost all pharma companies had to go in for import alert or restriction.

As a result of the growth slowdown, PE multiples fell. We are coming to a stage when it is getting interesting. I am not saying that go ahead and buy anything and everything in pharma tomorrow. Pharma has become more individualistic in terms of the companies which you invest in, but the regulatory headwinds are receding because the companies in India have also realised that they cannot use shortcuts.

At the same time, a lot of these plants had issues and two, three years have passed and one by one, they are coming off the issues. Second, the pricing pressure, particularly in the US, is receding. The debt levels of generic companies like Mylan or Teva or some of the other ones have gone crazy and that is the reason for this big deal between Mylan and Pfizer also. 

The ability for them to keep on selling at lower prices is reducing. In fact, prices have started to move up and that should be good for India. We have had a 2-3% fall in rupee which again will be a tailwind for pharma. Valuations are now in your favour. You are getting large companies at 15 PE which was unheard of. 

These are high ROA companies. You do not have concerns of debt being very high in a lot of these pharma companies and so it is becoming interesting. Selectively, it makes tremendous sense to start looking at them and maybe over the next three, six months create some exposure to that sector. 


So buy US facing generic companies?No Indian facing companies are also interesting but they are very expensive. If you look at multinational pharma companies in India, over the last one year, they have moved up 20-25% and they have significantly outperformed the exporting companies which was reverse. There will be some movement again back to this generic companies which are more US facing.


Typically when the slowdown starts, you sell what is expensive. But Asian Paints is sitting at a 52-week high. NBFCs have melted down but Bajaj Finance from the recent low of sub-2000 is at Rs 3500-3600 now. I looked a Trent. The PE multiple has gone north of 80 times. D-Mart is still standing tall. Why good quality stocks which should have corrected have become more expensive? You can always find exception Eicher, Maruti. But those are auto stocks.No, I would say that some of the expensive stocks in other sectors have also taken a beating like Page Industries which were market’s darlings two-three years back. So it has been mixed. One common trait in stocks which have not fallen is that even in such a scenario, they have been able to maintain some growth -- 10%, 12%. Also, remember, the mutual funds money is still coming in. There has been net inflows and obviously portfolio managers do get impacted because they have to show the near term performances on a monthly, daily, weekly basis. There is a natural tendency in these kind of markets where there is so much uncertainty to go into companies or stocks where you are feeling or getting that feeling of safety. 


Is there anything wrong in it because that strategy frankly has made money. Asian Paints was expensive five years ago as was HDFC Bank.There will always be exceptions to those rules but Hindustan Lever for example made zero returns between 2000 to 2008.


ITC it is not giving you returns for the last few years.ITC has not given returns last five-seven years. Obviously, Asian Paints and Hindustan Lever and Nestles are the exceptions but we have seen other companies like Britannia, Page Industries, Eicher and Maruti fall. It has been mixed. As an analyst, there is a concept that the stock prices or the stock valuation should ultimately reflect the future earning potential. 

If there is this case of a company growing at 5-7% and trading at 50 PE, obviously at some point of time, this is going to break down. But if you have companies that are trading at 30-35 PE and still growing at 15-20%, maybe you can justify it. Even in this high PE companies, you will have to distinguish companies which are trading at the levels today because of technical reasons, that is money flowing into those companies. There is no dilution and so the pool of money has to chase a limited availability of stocks. 

You can basically invest in companies which are discounted compared to their future earning potential. We would go in for the second kind of thing. In fact, the second fund which we have launched has three criteria -- 15% or more ROE, 15% or more growth but less than 15 PE. So for us, this basket is untouchable. 



According to your analysis, the reason SIP is doing well is because the millennials in India prefer SIPs. That is a mega trend in making and that is reflective because now markets are cracking but SIPs are slow.I am sure our parents and their parents never even looked at equity as an investment. There were two-three reasons. One, savings were not available. Their whole salary or income used to go in meeting the basic roti, kapda and makaan for their family. Second is awareness was not there and third, at that point of time, equity market was perceived to be like a gamble rather than an investment avenues. 

Over the last 20-30 years, it has changed and a lot of credit is to be given to media, to the mutual fund industry which has popularised this concept of investing regularly and the new generation – one are aware; second, they are making decent salaries even at a young age and therefore they have disposable income to be invested and technology has made it very easy. 

At one click, you can invest. You do not have to fill 20 forms like you had earlier. So, it is a combination of these things and which is very healthy. If we are able to channelise more savings which goes into equity market, the over reliance on foreign flows has already come down and that will come down further. 

This can only go up because now you have this robo advisory and online firms and companies like Alibaba in China are becoming one of the biggest asset management companies in China. Hopefully in India also, we will have two-three-four of those kind of platforms available which will make investing easier and there is now transparency. People trust the mutual fund side or the organised way of investing side.


Alternates are doing poorly . That is also one factor which is at play. Real estate, gold frankly the alternates have not given great returns.I would say that is more cyclical. After four-five years that might change but the investors have realised that they need to have a balanced portfolio. Earlier 90% used to go in real estate, 10%, 15% into fixed deposit and that was it. Now the large investors have created family offices. They know the virtues of having a balanced diversification as far as their savings are concerned. This is also a very positive thing going forward."

33,2019-08-22,Eicher,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."

40,2019-08-27,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: The stock of Nestle India hit a record high on the speculation of being included in the Nifty 50 index in its next reshuffle. However, short-term investors may well book profit in the stock if such an inclusion stands confirmed.

This is because two out of every three companies that have made it to the Nifty in the past five years have posted negative returns in the year after inclusion. As many as 19 out of the 21 stocks underperformed after a year of inclusion against their performance a year before, indicating that the Nifty inclusion comes at the time of peak performance. It is also indicative that much of the positive sentiment surrounding the inclusion gets factored in well before the actual inclusion.

For instance, the Britannia stock was included in the Nifty in March this year. The stock is down 18 per cent since, whereas it had gained 20 per cent in the year before the inclusion. Similarly, JSW Steel, which got added in October 2018, is down 44 per cent till now. It had posted 52 per cent gains in the year preceding its inclusion.

Only two – Eicher Motors and Bajaj Finserv – of the 21 stocks that got included in the Nifty in the past five years performed better a year after their inclusion in the benchmark index. Trading at very high valuation of 71 times of its trailing four quarter earnings, the Nestle stock will be the most expensive FMCG stock in the index, if included.

NSE Nifty failed to extend its winning run and drifted towards the 11,000 level on Wednesday. The index remained highly volatile as it failed to surpass 11,150, but the dips were bought into near 11,000.

The headline index has been finding multiple hurdles in 11,145-11,150 zone from the last four weeks and needs to cross and hold above the same to extend its bounce or else rangebound moves could return.

Now, Nifty has to hold above 11,000 to witness an upmove towards 11,145-11,150 while on the downside support exists at 10,980 and then 10,929.

On the Options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,000 followed by 10,800 strike while maximum Call open interest was at 11,200 followed by 11,100 strike.

We have seen meaningful Call writing at 11,100 followed by 11,200 strike while Put unwinding was seen at all the immediate strike price. Option data suggests a trading range between 10,950 to 11,100 zone.

India VIX surged 5.15 per cent to the 16.83 level.

Bank Nifty failed to extend positive momentum and drifted sharply towards 27,650. The index formed a bearish candle followed by a Doji on the daily scale as selling pressure was seen at higher levels. Major support was seen at 27,600. Now, the index needs to cross and hold 28,000 to witness an upmove towards 28,388 and then 28,500, while on the downside supports are seen at 27,500 and then 27,350.

52,2019-08-30,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Despite big discounts, automakers are likely to report up to 35 per cent drop in volumes in August. Carmakers are seen taking the biggest hit, while two-wheeler makers may report double-digit fall in sales on a yearly basis, brokerages said.

Wholesale volumes should have improved as festive season is starting 10 days earlier this year, but declining retail sales and high inventory levels may have kept wholesale volumes muted in August, said Nomura India.

“For August, we expect passenger vehicle industry volumes to decline sharply by 31 per cent YoY. This would be led by Maruti Suzuki, which we expect could report a 35 per cent dip in domestic volumes, affected by weak retail sales,” the foreign brokerage said.

Motilal Oswal Securities said its channel checks indicates no signs of demand recovery at retail levels, as inquiries-to-sales remains tepid.

“Feedback on prefestive demand is not very encouraging, partly impacted by floods in several parts of the country and demand deferment in anticipation of some sops from the government. Most OEMs continued their inventory cutting efforts through production cuts,” the brokerage said. Personal vehicle space saw weak poor conversion rate for existing models, even as new launches attracted good response,” it said.

The brokerage expects Maruti Suzuki’s volumes to plunge 31 per cent, whereas it sees Mahindra & Mahindra’s utility vehicle (UV) segment falling 18 per cent. Tata Motors volumes are estimated to decline 33 per cent.

Kotak Institutional Equities sees 28 per cent drop in volumes for Maruti, 27.7 per cent drop in passenger vehicle sales for Tata Motors and a 14 per cent drop in UV segment for Mahindra & Mahindra. 

In the two-wheeler space, Kotak Institutional Equities sees 9-13 per cent drop in sales for players such as Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors and Eicher Motors (Royal Enfield).

Motilal expects Bajaj Auto’s sales to fall by 9 per cent, with the domestic business expected to see 14 per cent decline in volumes. Hero MotoCorp’s wholesales are estimated to fall 25 per cent on a yearly basis.

Nomura expects two-wheeler industry’s volumes to decline 22 per cent, the steepest since December 2018.

“Inventory levels remain very high and a retail demand recovery is needed to correct the 6-8 weeks inventory ahead of the BS-IV changeover,” it said.

In case of commercial vehicles, Motilal Oswal Securities said demand from all major end-user segments remains tepid, resulting in further increase in average discounts.

“We expect CV wholesales for Ashok Leyland to decline 36 per cent and for Tata Motors to decline by 42 per cent due to continued inventory correction,” the brokerage said.

Nomura said that the commercial vehicle industry is likely to witness a volume decline of 44 per cent. It expects flat volume for M&M largely led by early festive season this year."
0,2019-09-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd, a Volvo Group and Eicher Motors joint venture, on Sunday reported a 41.7 per cent decline in total sales at 3,538 units in August.

The company had sold 6,069 units in August last year, VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd (VECV) said in a statement.

Eicher branded trucks and buses recorded sales of 3,462 units in August as compared to 5,948 units in the same month last year, a decline of 41.8 per cent, it added.

Volvo Trucks recorded sales of 76 units in last month as against 121 units in August 2018, down 37.2 per cent."
3,2019-09-03,Eicher,"Domestic equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty cracked over 2 per cent on Tuesday amid heavy selling following a set of subdued macroeconomic data. The 30-share Sensex tanked as much as 770 points to 36,563 while NSE Nifty ended at 10,798, down 225 points or 2.04 per cent.

Here are the top domestic factors that have sent the stocks tumbling in early trade.


Subdued Q1 GDP print
Market sentiment got impacted after June quarter GDP data released on Friday showed the country’s growth rate slumped for the fifth straight quarter to hit an over six-year low of 5 per cent. According to an ICICI Bank economist, the lower-than-expected GDP print indicated that the slowdown is more pervasive, underscoring the need for coordinated monetary and fiscal policy actions.


Weak core data & other macros
Official data on Monday showed the growth of eight core industries dropped to 2.1 per cent in July, mainly due to a contraction in coal, crude oil and natural gas production. And a private forecaster’s PMI data showed the country’s manufacturing sector activity declined to its 15-month low in August. The IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) declined to 51.4 in August, its lowest mark since May 2018, from 52.5 in July.


Falling rupee and FII outflows
The rupee tanked by 64 paise to 72 mark against the US dollar in early deals on Tuesday following weak macroeconomic data and sustained outflows by foreign portfolio investors (FPI). Overseas investors offloaded stocks worth a net of Rs 5,920 crore in the domestic market in August even after the government rolled back enhanced tax surcharge on FPIs. In July, they had pulled out a net of Rs 2,985.88 crore from Indian stocks.


Aug auto sales data showed pain
Most of the auto stock traded in the red following subdued auto sales numbers for August. Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland and Maruti Suzuki slipped up to 2.61 per cent. While Maruti reported a 33 per cent drop in August sales at 1,06,413 units, sale of passenger vehicles at Tata Motors fell 58 per cent."

6,2019-09-03,Eicher,"Insurance, AMCs, consumption and infra sectors are likely to see mega structural trends, says Atul Suri, Founder & CEO, Marathon Trends - PMS. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Maruti and Eicher were fantastic stories two years ago. They were the real tall poster boys, great compounders, good company, direct play on consumption. Maruti is down 50% approximately from its all-time high, Eicher from Rs 30,000 has become Rs 15,000. What is going on with autos? In the three-month phase we are talking about, while the index is down 9%, auto sectoe is down 17%. I used to have all these marquee names in my portfolio at one stage but being trend investors, as trends change, earnings change and we exited them. What you really see is that the auto sector has three to five-year trends. They almost double and halve in all these phases. They are very secular in nature the important thing is to be able to some extent even time it. 

Autos also are a very good proxy to the underlying economy. I always think, auto is a very good bellwether sector. The overall economic cycle as we know is struggling and that is why as a precursor, these stocks have corrected. However, the fact is things will turn but we do not know when that happens. It is our job to look at the kind of numbers they report and kind of trends that will play out.


Are you happy to own the mega caps: Do you see more visibility in three months, six months?I think three years, five years because today I am outperforming but when markets revive, you will have a relative period of underperformance because all these small and midcaps spurt up too much. It is for you to have the maturity, it is for you to have a belief in your process so as to also go through those phases because as I said, when the cycle is over you, realise you are better off. You do get tempted to jump out, you do tempted to be that cute guy and play that trade and do a quick pop but it has never really made money because in the top or towards the end of the next cycle, you always find you are stuck with kachra (junk) where you never intended to be and when the tide turned, you are found swimming naked. 

You have to be a survivor of cycles and those stocks which fall less in falling markets, are the first to rise when the markets turn.


 I will divide the market into three parts; first structural trends,where for five years, 10 years, you can buy these trends not for yourself but for your son and for your grandson. Then there are cyclical trends where you could see a 2-3-year trend and then where there is scope for immediate gratification. How would you divide the market in these three components?The first category is where I would like to be positioned. We spoke of insurance companies. It is a very interesting space. AMC companies selectively. again If you are talking about a $5-trillion economy, these become very good places. Consumption selectively. Yes they will go through cycles, they are expensive but you realise that over years, they are the wealth creators. Financials, NBFCs which are of very high quality. Again these are expensive in PE terms but you will have to bite the bullet at some stage. I personally think that these are the spaces which tend to be the mega trends that is where I am positioned and that is where I would like to be positioned. 

As for the pop ups that will happen or the opportunities that can come, I am not positioned in them but I feel that the government will give a push to infrastructure and infrastructure related stocks."
7,2019-09-03,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Slowing economic growth coupled with other bleak macroeconomic numbers, including auto sales and core sectors data, forced benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty to shed over 2 per cent each on Tuesday. 

The 30-share Sensex tanked 769.88 points, or 2.06 per cent, to 36,562.91, while the 50-share Nifty dipped 225.35 points, or 2.04 per cent, to 10,797.90.

Sentiment on Dalal Street remained cautious after data on Friday showed that the country’s GDP growth slipped to an over six-year low of 5 per cent in the June quarter of 2019-20. Besides, manufacturing sector activity also slipped to its 15-month low in August. Growth of eight core industries also dropped to 2.1 per cent in July.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said: “Deceleration in economic growth due to fall in consumption and subdued manufacturing activity diminished the scope for a turnaround in the near-term. Additionally, weak monthly auto sales and outflows by foreign investors added volatility to the rupee.”

1,2019-09-03,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Auto shares were trading in the red in Tuesday's morning session after major auto companies reported dismal sales for August, thanks to depressed consumer sentiment amid higher cost of ownership. 

Analysts said enhanced safety and emission norms and increased insurance cost have hurt buyers’ enthusiasm. While there are expectations of government sops in the days to come, analysts do not see any drastic improvement in volumes anytime soon. 

In the fourwheeler space, demand for small cars took the biggest hit in August. In the case of Maruti, while total volumes dropped 35.9 per cent in August, slightly above analysts’ estimate of 3033 per cent, demand for Alto and old WagonR dropped 71.8 per cent. 

“Consumer sentiment is depressed, but one must note that a lot of vehicles were sold in 20152017, which were the result of the replacement demand that generally happens in 56 years. After three years of strong sales, you can’t expect 2019 or 2020 to play out well. If the forthcoming festive season fails to boost demand, inventories may shoot up drastically and we may see a second leg of discounts in November and December. I am unsure how deep that can go,” said Sameer Kalra of Target Investing.

8,2019-09-04,Eicher,"Mumbai: Stocks slumped the most in nearly a year as a triple whammy of dismal economic data combined with the shock of the decision to merge 10 public sector banks into four rattled investors reeling from the effects of slowing global growth and a trade war.

The rupee fell 99 paise, the most in over a year, weighed down by China’s decision to move the World Trade Organization. Foreign investors continued to dump shares on Tuesday though they kept up purchases in Indian debt.

The Sensex crashed 770 points, or 2.06 per cent, its biggest single-day fall in 11 months. The Nifty fell 225 points, or 2.04 per cent, as investors fretted over last week’s poor economic data and the short-term impact of the merger of PSU banks.

Large-caps fell the most, led by HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries. Mid- and smallcap stocks fared better, falling 1.6 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively. ICICI Bank fell 4.45 per cent while HDFC and RIL slipped 3.5 per cent each.


“A move below 10,740 might force the Nifty to breach the recent low of 10,637. That would be dangerous for the markets,” said Mehul Kothari, technical analyst at India-Nivesh Securities. “On the upside, a move above 10,810 might bring in some relief, but that could be temporary. We continue to advise traders to stay light and avoid aggressive bets.”

The Centre announced the merger of 10 state-run banks into four on Friday, but the move was overshadowed by poor economic data.


Auto stocks witness a sharp selloff

First quarter GDP growth slipped to a six-year low of 5 per cent while core sector data — which captures the growth of eight crucial infrastructure industries — showed just 2.1 per cent expansion in July, down from last year’s 7 per cent. Auto sales had another bad month in August, falling 26.7 per cent, as buyers stayed away owing to high interest rates and slowdown in credit.

“Markets have reacted to the weak auto sales data, (and) lower-thanexpected GDP growth number which indicates the slowdown is more pronounced, thus requiring both monetary and fiscal policy measures,” said Arun Thukral, MD, Axis Securities. “News flow from global markets is not conducive either. The US-China trade conflict has reached a new high, with both the nations continuing to talk but also imposing additional tariffs on goods from each other.”

State-owned banks declined sharply as most banking analysts forecast near-term pain following the mergers.

The Nifty Bank index fell 2.2 per cent while Nifty PSU Bank index plunged 4.87 per cent. The PSU bank index has fallen 28 per cent in the past one year, compared with a 6.77 per cent decline in the Nifty during the period.

Overseas investors have sold shares worth Rs 2,016 crore in August while domestic investors have picked up stocks worth Rs 1,251 crore. Since April, foreign investors have net sold shares worth Rs 8,700 crore while domestic investors have bought Rs 39,000 crore of shares.

“The continuing negative global cues, the raging tariff war between the US and China, and the likely sluggishness in economies around the world have been behind the rot in the markets here as well as elsewhere,” said Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management.

Auto stocks witnessed a sharp selloff following subdued sales numbers for August. The BSE Auto index declined 1.64 per cent. Tata Motors, Motherson Sumi, Eicher Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra fell nearly 3 per cent each. Investors were not enthused by the government’s announcement on Monday that it is considering a duty cut for automobiles.

IDBI Bank rallied 8 per cent to Rs 28.80 after the Cabinet approved a mega fund infusion into the bank.

Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company jumped 3.57 per cent to close at a record high of Rs 2,649.75.

IT shares gained on weak domestic currency. Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies rose a per cent each while Infosys ended flat.

“Given the overall negative news flow, one should take a contrarian call by investing in sound companies with growth potential. These stocks are now available at relatively attractive valuations. As Warren Buffett has time and again emphasised, ‘one must be greedy when the world around you is fearful’,” said Thukral of Axis Securities."

12,2019-09-05,Eicher,"As long as you do not overpay when you are investing over three, five years, you should do reasonably well. And I think in that sense it is a great market, says Prashant Jain, ED & CIO, HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Even though it feels like a bear market in mid and smallcap stocks, your view is that it is not a bear market for the economy and the earnings.What has happened is very simply growth has slowed down. Bear market is not the correct way to describe it. I would say there is a slowdown in the economy; consumer discretionary is particularly impacted; other segments are not impacted. The equity markets are offering good value. When largecaps start offering good value, you are unlikely to get things wrong because these are large businesses with low leverage. Corporate leverage in India has come down. Most of the businesses which were in deep pain have either been sold or they are in a state where it does not really matter. The businesses are doing reasonably well and things are okay.


In last five years, we have seen one event after the other -- demonetisation, GST, election cycle, IBC. The way Indian corporates have done business has changed in the last couple of years and will change. The transition is causing pain. When do you think the pain will get over and real resilience in earnings come?This is a very tough question to answer but we know what is missing in the economy and what needs to be done. What needs to be done is that private capex has to revive and when private capex revives with a six month lag consumption will automatically and sustainably revive. All questions that we need to ask is what can be done to revive private capex which has been so weak for so long. The answers are lower interest rates, resolving the IBC cases ASAP and moderating the supply by the government in primary markets, so that there is room for the private sector to raise capital. 

The supply of primary capital in the economy is limited. It is 20 billion which is 1% of GDP roughly that is not a lot. If that also we start impounding, then how will the capex revive? Please remember the leverage ratio in core sectors in the private sector are much higher than in public sector firms. Who needs to raise primary capital are the private sector core companies. Unless they get that capital, I do not think we will see a sustained revival in private capex.


You have shied away from autos. Maruti was part of your portfolio in 2014-15. I do not see mention of Maruti in your declared portfolio. Did you sell out of autos? Do you think we may not see again the kind of PE multiples autos commanded -- Maruti went to 40 times, Eicher went to some 40-50 times?We sold automobiles or at least I reduced automobiles in my portfolio mainly driven by valuations.


It was not a call on disruption?It was at the back of the mind that it will create challenges but in the passenger vehicle market we think the electric disruption will come in the last. It will happen first in two- wheelers, three-wheelers and public transport. So, it was there at the back of your mind but the primary reason were the valuations. At the peak, some of these companies were trading close to 40 times and we are also aware that a reasonable part of the growth has been sustained due to increased household leverage and that is telling you that when you are borrowing and spending and if income growth is not there, you will hit a roadblock. We were not so optimistic on sustained growth in this space despite the low penetration levels. But valuation is the primary reason.


But now that pain is also reflecting in the stock prices, If you are confident of investment and consumption recovering first, do you think there is merit in revisiting autos?The prices have come down but the multiples have not come down because earnings will also degrow sharply. First investment has to revive, salaries have to go up and then we can make a case for sustained revival in consumer discretionary . There are a lot of factors at play here because if you look at the way the passenger car market is evolving, the UV space is growing much faster. The scooters gained share massively in the two-wheeler market, the sedans are losing share and the market share in the UV space are very different from the SUV space. The UV space is a reasonably open market with three-four players and each have 20-25% share.


You have a large exposure to utilities. Typically utilities do well when interest rates are on their way down. Interest rates have come down, 8.5% has become 6.5%. Why are utility stocks not going high?Value investing works but it does test your patience and that is why it is difficult and challenging. In some places, it took three, five years for stocks to correct and in some cases it took two, three years for them to go up also. Look at what happened to NBFCs, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and auto ancillaries, they did not correct or go up overnight. It took a few years. So in utilities, in India, value is on our side. If you look at the price to book values of these companies, they are at lifetime lows, dividend yields are good. These are good large, dominant businesses. They are not going away anywhere and interest rates are low so the room for price to book value is to go up is actually significant. The challenge here again has been that there has been continuous supply at every price point and we have to wait either for that supply to get absorbed or for it to get curtailed. But in the end, because the business values are not at risk and are growing, lower interest rates means more value for the same profits. What we are debating is when will stock prices go up? It is the nature of the animal that there is uncertainty over that but if value is there, we will realise it one day.


You made this point on this show in 2015 about pharma that prices had come down but PE multiples did not contract. But now PE multiples have also contracted. I have been told that globally generic prices have also bottomed out. You were bearish on pharma. Have you turned bullish now?Pharma is reasonably valued. It is not deep value but risk is also limited and Indian companies are very competitive globally just like in IT and I think profits should grow from here. 

But please remember, two things are happening; one your share in US markets is pretty large and as I said earlier, export growth for a country like India, 80% export growth comes by way of market share gains and not by market gains itself. 

When you are a large part of the market, you can see the Indian business in US generics and IT exports both are growing in single digits. So, you cannot lose sight of that fact. 

Number two, if you look at the local markets for a variety of reasons, the growth rates in local markets in pharmaceutical industry has come down to close to single digits. Earlier, this industry used to grow in mid to high double digits but those times have changed. It could be because of Jan Aushadhi. It could be because of new players, it could be because of one or two new e-commerce websites which are doing business. It could also be because of low inflation. I feel the sector is close to fairly valued.


You have owned largecap IT for a reasonable amount of time. What did trick for largecap IT was the fact that America did much better than what we thought. BFSI businesses have stabilised and the buyback kicker has kicked in. Post budget, the entire romance of a buyback is gone thanks to a tax. What happens to IT stocks then?As shareholders, we are and we should be indifferent to dividends or buybacks.


 You buy the business you do not buy it for...No, whether you share cash by way of dividends or by way of buybacks, we are indifferent but to the extent that buybacks are being taxed, it will not make a difference whether you share cash with by-- but the payout ratios of IT companies are 80-90%. That is a great business which can keep on growing and share 80-90% of profits or free cash flow as dividends or buybacks. It tells you about the fundamental strength of that.


Do you think for a long term investor, the differentiating factor would be patience and time? Equities need more patience than intelligence and that is time tested. Anyone who has held equities for long periods in a reasonably disciplined and diversified way has done well. It should not be different anytime around, if at all there is any correlation between your returns over three, five years and investments it is only with valuations. Forget about the economy, forget everything. As long as you do not overpay when you are investing over three, five years, you should do reasonably well. And I think in that sense it is a great market."

14,2019-09-09,Eicher,"By Swapneel MantriTechnical analyst, Sushil Financial Services

Where we are: The holiday curtailed week goneby saw Nifty largely trading rangebound on back of mixed news of weak GDP numbers and positive US-China tariff talks. Nifty ended the week at 10,946.


What is in store: Expect rangebound trade to continue with some form of short-term bottom in place for Nifty around 10,800-10,850. On levels, 10,990-11,090 immediate target zone. Close above 11,120 levels may see Nifty heading towards 11,220-11,300 zone. Further, advance-decline ratio has been healthy in past few trading sessions indicating improving market breadth and some form of intermediate bottoming can be seen amongst select midcap counters.


What could traders do: The current downturn offers a good opportunity for investors to accumulate quality scrips at low level and bolster the portfolio from long term point of view. Stock-specific frontline banking counters like IndusInd, SBI offer a good entry point at current levels and can be accumulated from short-to-medium term point of view for higher targets of 1,450 and 320-340, respectively. Further, two-wheeler stocks like Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp showing intermediate bottoming signs and expect to head towards 18,500 and 2,990 levels, respectively, in the short-to-medium term. Among the metal counters, Tata Steel, Hindalco arelooking good for short-to-medium term targets of 390 and 210 levels, respectively."
15,2019-09-09,Eicher,"Auto companies could see another round of earnings cuts as the asking monthly run-rates for the remaining months of FY20, given the current projections, appear rather tall.

Projected EPS of auto companies have been slashed 15-35 per cent for FY20. Still, the risk of negative earnings growth is mounting for several auto companies, such as Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, Maruti and Eicher Motors, according to IIFL.

Despite the sharp fall in volumes in the first five months, the Street is penciling in volume decline of 8-15 per cent for FY20. This suggests the Street is building in a pickup in volume growth of 10-70 per cent for the second half.

On the face of it, such run-rates appear optimistic.




First, the second quarter volume growth has been mainly driven by inventory filling to stock up dealer’s inventory ahead of the festival season. However, in the current scenario due to elevated inventory at the dealer end, off-take by the dealers has remained muted. Some dealers told ET on the sideline of the ET Auto retail summit that the turnaround time for trucks carrying vehicles has become too long as yards are stocked full due to low retail offtake.

Second, expectations of lower prices for BS-4 vehicles from the beginning of next year and the likelihood of a GST rate cut are prompting buyers to defer their purchases even though discounts hit a record.

Expectations of a recovery in the second half can be gauged from the fact that Maruti’s volume growth in the first five months dropped 24 per cent. Yet, the Street is factoring in a 10 per cent decline, implying growth of 27-30 per cent in the second half of the year, which appears to be a hard task given the challenging environment. In simple terms, the current five monthly volume run-rate is 124,000, while the implied volume for the second half is 158,000-160,000 units based on the projected volume growth for the current fiscal.

Ashok Leyland’s heavy commercial business volume is estimated to increase 60 per cent in the remaining seven months of FY20 to achieve the current volume guidance. Ashok Leyland’s MHCV monthly run-rate is about 8,000 units in the first five months, and it must reach 12,000 units to meet the existing full-year volume forecast.

Volumes of two-wheelers, passenger cars and trucks fell 20-50 per cent YoY between April and August. The decline in volumes has been accentuated in the past two months due to the rising cost of ownership, stringent lending terms by the banks, and a muted macro environment.

The passenger car segment witnessed the highest ever monthly drop in August in more than two decades, and volume growth remains negative for 12 months in a row. In the past 25 years, passenger vehicle monthly growth remained negative for such a long period only on five occasions.

Separately, inventories of two-wheelers and heavy commercial vehicles continued to be nearly double the average."

29,2019-09-12,Eicher,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Auto stocks were, once top wealth creators on Dalal Street, continue to languish amid prolonged sales slump. But analysts say the sector will soon be past its worst, and festive season may bring back in the much-awaited rebound.

Since the global financial crisis, auto stocks were the second-best wealth creators among all sectors for around a decade, with the BSE Auto index registering a whopping 752 per cent rise between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2018.

Ever since, they have been become the second-worst wealth destroyers in terms of the performance of the sectoral index. BSE Auto index has eroded 23 per cent value since the end of 2018.

“I think it is time to buy auto stocks. Some sort of green shoots after the recent meltdown should revive interest in these stocks,” said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent analyst.

Baliga said auto sales numbers have continuously plunged over the past 8-9 months, leading to their worst show in August.

“Expectation is that the government will take some further remedial action to ease the pain. The festive season should give some impetus to demand. It will still be less than a year ago, but better on a month-on-month basis,” he said.

Baliga also hoped the production cuts that carmakers have resorted to over the past few months would help ease the inventory buildup.

“An additional push by the government will lead to some sort of demand pickup. A scrappage policy, if it happens, would provide a major booster to the sector,” he said.

Domestic car sales witnessed the highest decline of 31.57 per cent to 196,524 units in August, with passenger cars recording the steepest decline of 41% at 1,15,957.

For the first time in over a decade, the downfall in the passenger vehicle segment has continued for over a year despite the stimulus provided by the government.

Many believe the festive season could kick in demand for the sector. “This season could be a trendsetter,” Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice-President, IIFL Securities, told ETNOW

“Fundamentals may take another two quarters for balance sheets to start showing the numbers, but we think going into 2020, this could be the best sector to be in,” Bhasin said.

Stocks like Eicher Motors, Balkrishna Industries, TVS Motor Company , MRF, Motherson Sumi Systems, Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge, Apollo Tyres, Mahindra & Mahindra have multiplied wealth more than 10 times between 2008 and 2018.

All components of BSE Auto index, with the exception of Bajaj Auto, have corrected 13-40 per cent since the start of this year.

Some analysts still have a pessimistic view, and say the best phase of auto sector is behind us.

““When you have such a sharp slowdown in sales, clearly there is a structural slowdown, and not a cyclical one. We made a mistake in auto and now we are looking for exit,” Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities, told ETNOW.

“Look back at the high growth industries like telecom, IT or pharma, when they were going through structural changes. They used to have high growth phase of 20-25 per cent expansion and then suddenly earnings would collapse and when they recover, they would be in high single digits to low double digits and never in those big growth phase,” he said.

Mehta said something similar will play out in automobiles as well, where after a period of very high earnings growth and volume growth. “I think the best years for auto are behind us,” said he."

37,2019-09-17,Eicher,"India’s economic slowdown is threatening to derail one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet projects.

As slowing demand begins to hurt consumer sectors, triggering painful job cuts in some and creating income uncertainty in others, industry watchers are fearing a direct hit on the affordable housing segment, a key focus area of the Modi government, where is demand is drying up fast.

Some estimates show India’s real estate developers are sitting on 4.12 lakh units of unsold apartments priced up to Rs 45 lakh. Half of that inventory is lying in cities with direct exposure to the automobile industry, where a prolonged slump in sales is forcing carmakers to announce shutdowns, lay off temporary workers and freeze hiring.

The real estate sector has already been going through a difficult phase amid a liquidity crunch, dearth of demand as well as regulatory challenges. The BSE Realty Index is down 4 per cent for last one year and 55 per cent in last 10 years till September 9.

The delay in government measures to address the economic slowdown may work as salt to the wounds.

“The government has already announced several steps to make affordable housing attractive, both for buyers and developers. But lack of employment growth in a slow economy and absence of job security are hurting home buyers’ sentiment. When there is income uncertainty, people get into cash-conservation mode. A home loan is a prolonged financial commitment and requires confidence in one’s job situation,” Anuj Puri, Chairman of Mumbai-based Anarock Property Consultants, told ETMarkets.com.


Auto check with real(i)ty
Stating with Pune, home to auto majors like Bajaj Auto, Volkswagen, Mahindra and Mahindra and 750 other big and small auto and auto ancillary players, has 98,378 unsold affordable housing units, showed one estimate. India’s top auto export hub Chennai has 18,709 units.

Data from real estate portal Proptiger showed that Gurgaon and Noida – the region home to carmakers like Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp and Honda – together have around 58,000 affordable housing units in the unsold inventory.

Ahmedabad, another fast growing auto export hub, has 45,000 unsold affordable housing units.

Jobs cuts in auto or any other industry will impact the demand for affordable housing, says Sameer Kalra, Founder & President (Research), Target Investing. “The ongoing slowdown forced auto majors to cut production by 15-20 per cent during April-July. They have slashed production by 33 per cent in last 2 months,” he said.

Bleak cement volume growth is already telling a story of further slowdown in housing. June quarter volume growth of domestic cement firms plunged to their lowest level in many quarters.

Commercial vehicle major Ashok Leyland on September 9 said it would suspend work at various manufacturing facilities across the country this month to adjust production to market demand.

Shares of Ashok Leyland have cracked nearly 40 per cent year to date. Almost every other stock in the index has wiped out investor wealth.

Shares of Motherson Sumi, M&M, Exide Industries, Cummins India, TVS Motor, Eicher Motor, Tata Motors, Bosch and Apollo Tyres have retreated in excess of 25 per cent.

In August, Indian auto firms reported the steepest drop in sales ever since industry lobby Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) started recording wholesale vehicle sales data in 1997-98.

Vehicle sales across categories, including passenger vehicles (PVs) and two-wheelers and commercial vehicles (CVs), fell 23.55 per cent (YoY) to 18,21,490 units in August from 23,82,436 units in the same month last year.


Two-sided story

All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council on Monday said the industry was witnessing a ‘recession’ and skilled artisans are staring at possible job losses.

Soap majors have already slashed prices following lower palm oil prices to tackle muted growth. FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) last month cut prices of its popular soap brands Lux and Lifebuoy. Data analytics firm Nielsen, in a report, said last month that sales of FMCG items, including soaps, slowed down in April-June quarter. FMCG is usually considered immune to temporary economic slowdown.

The slowdown has started pinching government tax kitty too. The county’s GST collections dropped to Rs 98,202 crore in August from over Rs 1.02 lakh crore in July, marking the second month this year when revenue collection has slipped below the Rs 1 lakh crore mark.

“The government is very serious about its Housing for All by 2022 mission. To meet the deadline for affordable housing, the government will have to take decisive steps to revive the economy. Creation of affordable housing units is just one side of the story – people will also have to be able to buy them,” Puri said."

50,2019-09-20,Eicher,"Mumbai: The GST Council on Friday announced rate cuts for the hospitality industry, but didn’t announce any major relief for auto and cement sectors.

GST Council, however, recommended lower 12 per cent cess on 1,500cc diesel and 1,200cc petrol vehicles with capacity to carry up to 13 people.

Analysts were of the opinion that after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman slashed corporate tax early on Friday, hopes of further GST cuts for auto and cement sectors had came down.

The GST Council in its meeting on Friday, approved the proposal to cut rates on hotel tariffs. The tax on room tariff of up to Rs 7,500 has been slashed to 12 per cent from the existing 28 per cent. There will be no GST on room tariffs of below Rs 1,000 per night

This will come as a boost to the sector, which has been reeling under the pressure of an economic slowdown. The move is expected to serve a dual purpose of boosting tourism and generate more employment.

Earlier in the week, hotel stocks had rallied on hopes of the rate cut. 

In a bid to boost exports, rate on precious and semi-precious stones were also reduced.

On the other hand, GST rate on caffeinated products has been increased to 28 per cent from 18 per cent, plus there will be an additional cess of 12 per cent. GST on railway wagons was also raised from 5 per cent to 12 per cent.

The GST council didn’t announce any major relief for the auto sector, which was widely expected.

Over the last one month, auto stocks including Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Hero Motocorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Atul Auto, Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, Hindustan Motors had railed 6-25 per cent on hopes of a cut in GST rates and after the FM slashed corporate tax rates.

Similarly, shares of cement companies such as The Ramco Cement, J K Cements, UltraTech Cements, ACC, Keerthi Industries, NCL Industries, Orient Cement, Kakatiya Cement, India Cements, Shiva Cement and Andhra Cements rose 5-73 per cent.

Earlier in the day, the government slashed corporate tax for domestic and new local manufacturing companies. The effective rate will be 25.17 per cent, including surcharges and cess. The measures will be implemented through an ordinance, she said."
51,2019-09-21,Eicher,"A cut in the corporate tax is expected to result in the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006. The growth in the Nifty 50’s earnings per share (EPS) may be upgraded by 7-8%. This will be a significant improvement given that the index’s 12-month expected EPS had fallen by 5% to Rs 645 after the June 2019 quarter results – the highest earnings downgrade among the top global equity markets.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded the estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25% for FY20 from 13% earlier.

Kotak Institutional Equities revised upwards its earnings growth for Nifty 50 to 25% from 15% buoyed by the sharp cut in corporate tax rate. According to Kotak estimate, automobiles, banks, capital goods, consumer staples, diversified financials and oil, gas & consumable fuels will be key beneficiaries of the cut while electric utilities, IT and pharmaceuticals will see little or no impact.



 At present, there are twenty companies in the Nifty 50 with tax rate higher than 25%. They have a cumulative weight of 39% in the index. The prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30% in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty 50 soon, will be another big beneficiary considering its tax rate of 34% in FY19.

The average tax rate for the broader BSE 500 index was 31-34% in the past two fiscals with tax outgo of Rs 2.3 lakh crore. It accounted of 34% of the total corporate tax collection, according to Credit Suisse.

The lower corporate tax may also help in improving valuations of Indian equities given the possible improvement in the return on equity. They trade at 40% premium to the MSCI Emerging Market Index, which is close to the 10-year average of 41%. A year ago, it was over 70%. A possibility of superior earnings should help in widening the current premium."

This sector cements gainsStocks such as Ambuja Cements, ACC, JK Cement and Ultratech Cement gained 5.8-7.1 per cent for the week.

IT stocks fail to join the partyTCS fell 3.5 per cent for the week, Infosys 2.9 per cent and HCL Technologies 1.8 per cent. IT firms are not expected to gain much from the reduction in taxes.

Here is a lowdown on key movers and shakers of Monday’s session:

Nifty Bank on a rollThe index continued its dominant performance on Monday as Nifty Bank surged 5.4 per cent or 1,566 points to close above 30,500. In the last two days, the index has surged about 3,800 points or 14 per cent. The rally on Monday was led by Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, both of which soared more than 7 per cent. IndusInd Bank followed closely with 6.8 per cent jump.


IT and pharma slideIT pack continued to be the laggard amid a stupendous rise in the overall market. Analysts said over-ownership was responsible for the underperformance in the IT stocks. Pharma index also closed in the red. Nifty IT index closed with a loss of about 3 per cent and Nifty Pharma ended the day 2.2 per cent down. Gautam Shah of JM Financial advised traders to avoid both sectors. However, Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets, IIFL, said pharma earnings can surprise positively.

Biggest losers among IT sector were Infosys (down 5 per cent), Wipro, TCS and HCL Tech (each down over 2 per cent). In the pharma sector, Dr Reddy’s (down 4 per cent), Cipla and Lupin (each down about 3.5 per cent) were top losers. 


Top Sensex gainersTop Sensex gainers included financials and consumption names. Bajaj Finance topped the 30-share pack, rising 8.7 per cent. L&T followed with 8 per cent gain, Asian Paint was up 7.9 per cent and ITC was up 7 per cent.

HDFC twins were the two biggest contributors towards Sensex’s 1,075 point gains. Both contributed a total of 420 points. They were followed by ICICI Bank (173 points) and ITC (137 points).


Minting moneyInvestors got richer by Rs 3.5 lakh crore on Monday, taking the two-day gain in BSE market cap to over Rs 10 lakh crore. Total market cap of BSE-listed companies was 145 lakh crore on Friday that shot to Rs 148.9 lakh crore on Monday. 


India VIX surgesDue to the sudden spike in equities, the volatility index India VIX surged 10.74 per cent to cross the 17 level. The index is also called fear index, surging of which signifies that volatility could increase. 

“The market is trading near its peak valuations, so we would remain cautious and expect it to consolidate in the near term. However, the recent announcements made by the FM are definitely positive for the economy from a long-term perspective. Hence, investors should focus on accumulating fundamentally sound stocks,” said Ajit Mishra Vice President, Research, Religare Broking.


Smallcap outperformsNifty Smallcap index outperformed its largecap and midcap peers soaring more than 3 per cent. Rain Industries led the rally, rising 3.5 per cent. It was followed by Infibeam (up 2.2 per cent) and Reliance Communication (up 1.77 per cent). PVR was the biggest loser in the index, sliding 1 per cent. 


266 stocks hit lower circuitsOn a day when all guns were blazing, 266 securities touched their 52-week low on the BSE. Prominent among which included Coffee Day Enterprises, Balkrishna Paper Mills, Reliance Home Finance, Provogue and Adlabs Entertainment. 


66 stocks above MACD SignalSixty-six stocks crossed above the MACD Signal line generating buy signals. This included United Spirits, Bharti Airtel, Bata India, Reliance Industries, Pidilite Industries and Kansai Nerolac Paints among others."
56,2019-09-23,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: The government’s move to lower corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent is likely to ensure Rs 72,000 crore savings for about 300-odd companies in the BSE500 basket. This would improve cash flows and earnings, and may help a few companies boost demand by passing on the tax benefits to end users.

In value terms, banks and financials, oil & gas, metals and mining, consumption and capital goods companies would gain the most, analysts said. Sectors such as IT, pharmaceuticals and electric utilities may see only limited gains, they said.

Stocks such as HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finserv and State Bank of India, among others, may lead the BFSI space with Rs 27,994 crore in savings in FY21, suggests a study by KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Stocks like ONGC, IOC and Reliance Industries could add Rs 12,459 crore to profits. Metals and mining firms such as Vedanta, Coal India and Tata Steel may add Rs 8,820 crore to aggregate bottom line. Consumption stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints and Nestle India, among others, and capital goods companies L&T, Siemens and others may together see over Rs 11,000 crore addition to their profits.



Having said that, the stocks may not go on a relentless rally. Edelweiss Securities said after Friday’s big rally, upsides may be more modest from here on.

The brokerage projects Nifty at 11,600 by September, 2020. That said, the brokerage sees more opportunities to take on risk at stock as well as portfolio levels.

Goldman Sachs on Friday reasserted its positive view on India, and raised its 12-month Nifty target to 13,200 from 12,500 earlier, saying recent pro-growth measures, a boost to already the highest earnings growth in the region and a likely revival in sentiment further strengthen the positive investment case for India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said companies currently availing exemptions can opt for paying the new tax rates, only once the exemption periods get over. On the other hand, companies which will avail the lower tax rate will not be able to avail any of the exemptions.

Domestic equity indices saw their second-biggest intraday rally of the year on Friday, as the Rs 1.45 lakh crore tax relief brought down effective tax rate for domestic companies to 25.6 per cent from 34.9 per cent. Sensex galloped 1,921 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 38,014, while Nifty zoomed 569 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 11,274.

Meanwhile, MAT or minimum alternate 
tax which applies to ‘zero 
tax companies’ has been reduced to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent earlier.

“Looking at the PAT boost due to lower taxes and keeping the current Street expectations and valuations in mind, we could see a 23 per cent upside in the overall market in next 2- 3 years,” KR Choksey said in a note.

For benchmark Nifty, analysts now expect a profit growth of 24-26 per cent compared with 13-15 per cent earlier.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded its estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25 per cent for FY20 from 13 per cent earlier. Kotak Securities expects net profits of Nifty firms to grow at 25 per cent for FY2020 against 15 per cent projected earlier.

This assumes that companies will retain bulk of the tax cuts. In reality, some of them will pass on some of the benefits to consumers. If this happens, it would be the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006.

Among Nifty stocks, 20 companies with tax rates higher than 25 per cent have a cumulative weightage of 39 per cent in the index.

Prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut would include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30 per cent in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty50 soon, will be another big beneficiary, considering it had a tax rate of 34 per cent in FY19.

Meanwhile, apart from recurring earnings benefit, there will also be one-time gains on deferred tax liabilities for companies such as RIL, Ultratech, among others, and one-time loss on deferred tax assets for corporate banks, Edelweiss Securities said."

65,2019-09-24,Eicher,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax cut proved a shot in the arm for domestic equities, as aggregate market capitalistion of BSE-listed firms spiked by over Rs 10 lakh crore in just two sessions.

Analysts say the corporate tax cut and a supportive monetary policy should boost the sagging investment cycle. Brokerage Motilal Oswal said the measures announced are substantive and have the potential to kickstart the moribund investment cycle over time.

“Consumption stocks have been doing pretty well over the past four-five years. Consumption as a share of GDP has peaked and investment as a share of GDP is at the bottom. It will be going up from here on,” Mahesh Nandurkar, India Strategist, CLSA, told ETNOW.

Declining savings rate has been hurting investments in India. But a likely rise in corporate savings after the latest tax cut should help nudge the private capex cycle, analysts say.

The government on September 20 announced a Rs 1.45 lakh crore fiscal stimulus by slashing of corporate tax to 22 per cent from 30 per cent and lowering minimum alternate tax (MAT) to 15 per cent for companies putting fresh capital into manufacturing.

The reduced corporate tax rate of 22 per cent would apply on domestic entities that don't avail any other exemption and tax incentives. Also, these companies will not be required to pay any MAT. The effective tax rate, in this case, would be 25.17 per cent, including cess and surcharge.

“The sentiment booster provided by these measures, coupled with the transmission of the 110 basis points of rate cut already done by RBI, can at the margin provide a push to consumption in the midst of an all-important festive season. A significant recovery in monsoon should also aid rural consumption, albeit with a lag,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

The brokerage is bullish on ICICI Bank, SBI, L&T, UltraTech, Titan Company, Eicher Motors, ICICI Prudential and Bharti Airtel in the largecap space. On the other hand, it is positive on Indian Hotels, Federal Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Ashok Leyland, PI Industries, Aditya Birla Fashion, Trent, JK Cement and Oberoi Realty among the midcaps.

There are hopes that foreign institutional investors may respond positively to these announcements. Goldman Sachs is bullish on Indian equity market and has set a year-end target of 13,200 for Nifty, citing a mild cyclical recovery driven by supportive fiscal and monetary policy. The foreign brokerage likes domestic cyclical sectors like banks, industrials and autos.

Market capitalistion of BSE-listed firms zoomed to nearly Rs 149 lakh crore on September 23 from Rs 138 lakh crore on September 19.

“I would like my portfolio to be skewed more in favour of the investment cycle, a theme I would like to play through the capital goods names, some of the infra names and private sector corporate banks. One can take a selective bet on the state-owned banks as well. I would also like to take a look at the four-wheeler space, because this has got battered,” said Nandurkar."

70,2019-09-25,Eicher,"If earnings show green shoots, then confidence will be back and participation level should start going up, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Everybody is contemplating whether, this market will hit a new high and stay there or is the best behind us in the short term and markets will consolidate or fall? What is your view?What happened last week was definitely tectonic.This was the hard bullet that nobody expected the government to bite! It was done so quickly, going even against the DTC recommendations of 25%, we have actually brought it down to 22%. So it is a great move. 

Now, in the last three days, the so-called animal spirits were definitely unleashed. Today corporate India thinks that yes the government will act and the government is serious about ensuring that the economy is back on the growth track. So those are very big positives. But having said that, we do not see that there is a lot of commitment on part of the FIIs. Even in terms of recent stock movements, wherever the effective tax rate differential has been large, even within sectors like auto. For example, Eicher Motors was at 35% tax rate whereas M&M was at 25%. Therefore, the pronounced move that you have seen in the last three days in both these stocks has been very different

The market has clearly made a differential that once the tax rate has come down, it is for good and hence there has been stock-wise movements within sectors. Now does this lead to increase in capex? That is a function of what is my current capacity and the estimation of demand that I see here on. The monsoon has definitely been good. In fact, India has probably seen an excess monsoon for the first time after almost six years. 

So even though the rainfall distribution may not be great and you may not get a very big kharif output, at least the outlook on rabi crop is positive and that is a big sentiment booster. But look at it this way. In July, after the first quarter numbers were out, everybody bought the earnings down to 8-10%; today because of that tax cut, you are back to the expectation of 25% for FY20 on Nifty earnings. That is why the market is back where it is. But from here onwards, the big mover is the September quarter is earnings. If somehow this shows green shoots, then confidence will be back and participation level should start going up.


Are you betting on the consumption theme then? Given that some of those factors will see a revival in growth, will that positively impact these companies?Apart from consumption which is fairly well owned and well valued, the government is the big mover here. Today when you see the bills that were pending for long have started getting cleared, money is back into the system and orders are being given out. You will probably see the domestic cyclicals more in favour than perhaps consumption or FMCG. Apart from that, even where there has been a massive drawdown in terms of prices like in cases of PSU banks or where the tax rate was very high, those themes are likely to play out far better.


Are you betting on the consumption theme then or being positive on the outlook that given some of those factors we will see a revival in growth and that will positively impact these companies?Apart from consumption, which is fairly well-owned and well-valued, the government is the big mover here. So today when you see the bills that were pending for long have been starting to get cleared, money is back into the system and orders are being given out, I think you will probably see the economy facing, the domestic cyclicals probably more in favour than perhaps the consumption or the FMCG and I think apart from that even where there has been a massive draw down in terms of prices like some of the state owned banks or where the tax rate was very high -- those themes are likely to play out far better.


We saw IT, pharma the defensive plays so to speak, completely lag when the markets were on fire. Yesterday they were back in play. What does one make of it?Most of the tech space has been at 25% effective tax rate and to that extent, there will not be any immediate benefit because of the change in taxation. Also, they have not seen any upgrades and that is where the positive news is not forthcoming. Therefore, the optimism was not there on Friday and Monday. Yesterday, there were some sort of tempering and people realised a lot of catch-up has to be done. 

In case of a demand revival, it is likely to show up in these sectors as well because IT is a large employment generator. The other thing that plays out is that tax cut will definitely give some sort of positive sentiment on a capex outline which is a larger long term decision for a corporate. The next thing that probably needs to be looked at in terms of a followup is personal tax reduction, which will lead to a direct demand stimulus.

If you do both of these, then there is likely to be some amount of fiscal strain and because of that, one should definitely hear some positive action on the divestment front. Since only a few months are left for the fiscal to get over, the space for piecemeal steps like CPSE ETF probably will not move the needle much. One needs to look at real strategic divestments to get in big money. In case the government moves on that, it will set the market on the right track.


Do you believe that one is safer sticking to private corporate names?From here onwards, one has to look at the improvement in margins. Private banks have been fairly valued and so the asset improvement is likely to be visible in case the economy picks up in banks which have not been priced. Public sector banks would be a larger beneficiary of the incremental flow and the improvement in business due to a revival in economy.


Within consumption where is the opportunity to buy afresh? From Titan to D-Mart to Asian Paints, all are trading at exuberant valuations?The incremental flow will perhaps be not that high. Bigger returns are likely to be made where ownership is low and the delta is likely to be bigger. 


Why do you say that? Sometimes you need to buy simple compounding stories; over ownership, under ownership are important factors but they cannot be the only factor. Just because HDFC Bank is owned, why should you not buy it?You have a point there. But HDFC Bank, Titan, all these are franchise companies. Now franchise value is a very different connotation from the classic valuations that an investor would look at. You can make a SIP on them on a monthly basis.. Even on an individual case, you can keep buying them and these will compound because demand will be there. They will be able to run an efficient business model and there will be returns for the investors to make. 

But I thought the question was where will be the larger flow from here onwards for investors to look at in terms of allocating capital? I think one should make a case of allocation to these franchise companies which will continue on their growth path but don’t expect a large change in them because of the tax cut as perhaps in some other cases where the tax rates were far higher. That is the only limited point I am trying to make because the tax rate reduction is a profit opportunity that is available on a permanent ongoing basis for any corporate. That is where for a company with a 35% effective tax rate coming down to 25% effectively means a 10% secular earnings growth.


Which names would you pick up?Coal India and Eicher Motors are companies where there is some element of franchise value and an element of competitiveness, a monopolistic situation and these are places where one is likely to see a good pick up in revenue if the sentiment and the economy pick up.


Will you buy BPCL with this view or for that matter any PSU, thinking that tomorrow will be better for these PSUs?Our view on OMCs has always been good because they are fantastically run businesses, available at great value. These are also great assets for somebody to chase them. If BPCL and HPCL see the light of divestment some day, the amount of windfall they can unlock for the government is tremendous. Also, there would be a re-rating. For example, HP is available at 6 times EV EBITDA. These companies are fantastic cash machines. The petrol price deregulation mechanism is seamless. In the recent week also, the prices have been marked up appreciably. There is no reason for somebody not to go in for them especially when the entire auto sector, auto fuel retailing story in India is just about to be unleashed.

There is a strong chance of cash flow and appetite of investors for PSUs as a basket. The chances of a strategic divestment before the financial year runs out is far higher than what it was a month back. These are great stocks available at great value and a trigger of divestment also is a good tailwind. These can be prime stocks for long. 


What is your view on Zee?The business is in good shape. It is just that today there is a short-term overhang over how the promoters settle their debt and the stake sale and the discussions with the MFs etc. If there is clarity, the stock can perhaps retrace earlier levels because at Rs 30,000 crore, it is not a bad business in case the economy was to pick up from here.

Will you buy the Zee stock?At this price, it is a fairly good risk reward equation.


How are you mapping the price? Why is it good, why is it bad? Just because this has fallen or you think it has become cheap? Their OTT platform, Zee5, is losing money.Yes but the fact is it was not expected to make money from day one any way. When businesses and verticals are in investment mode, there is a certain amount of runway that is given them for them to play out in terms of accretion, content creation, etc. There is enough for us to give them some time and this overhang has perhaps seen a very disproportionate amount of price impact on the stock price. That is why I said that Rs 30,000 crore it is not a very bad risk reward equation given the fact that the business does not seem to have completely fallen off the cliff."
71,2019-09-25,Eicher,"Companies which have a moat around them will have the ability to retain the tax cut and will benefit but in sectors where there is too much competition, companies will have to pass on the tax benefits and would not gain much, says Samit Vartak, Founding Partner & CIO, SageOne Investment Advisors. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW’s Nikunj Dalmia.


We are calling it the big reset, is it a big reset?Definitely. It is one of the biggest fundamental changes for India. Now, the question is whether it is a big reset for all the companies or if it is a big reset for selective companies. It is very important to understand that from the investment perspective. If it is a competitive industry with too many players at a similar level, it is going to be very difficult for them to retain profits. If their ROE goes up by 15% because of earnings going up by 15%, in a very short period of time, they will price each other out and then the ROE will come down to the same levels as they were before. 

But there are many industries where competition has been decimated and you will find it across various sectors -- be it capital goods, specialty chemicals or alloys. That is where the pricing power will be retained because such companies have built up the capacity over the last four-five years and the valuations are at multi-year lows or even at historical lows. That is where the opportunity is.

There are dominant players which everyone is aware of -- be it the top banks or the top NBFCs. They will definitely benefit. But the question is how much of that is already priced in. This is a rare opportunity where there is a real fundamental change but still people are very sceptical about the changes, especially the ones where the stocks are beaten down. But that is where the big opportunity will be and you need to dig through and understand the competitive environment in that specific industry and bet on the players where they are so dominant that it is almost impossible for the new competition to come in. Whether it is the offshore or domestic competition, it will be very difficult to build the kind of competitive advantages they have and these are very basic industries which are not going to be disrupted by any high-tech developments. 

If you talk to the PE or the venture capital guys, they are excited about a lot of disruptions that are going to come through in India. For them, many of the consumer-oriented distribution channels are very important. One does not know whether five years down the line and when distribution channels get disrupted, big moats of consumer oriented companies can be disrupted. So you need to be very careful on those aspects because if you are paying 70, 80, 90 times for earnings growth of 10% to 15% and if there is a big disruption which comes through in the next 5-10 years, the derating which can start can be a big hit on your portfolio.


So you are saying that yes, there is a big fundamental change in the economy but not every company or every sector will benefit in the same manner. Companies with a moat around them will have the ability to retain the tax cut; but companies who are just one more in the crowd, will have to pass on the tax benefits. Markets have gone up like in a rising tide on the hope every company would benefit.Yes, that is the general risk. When things change at an industry level or a complete macro level it is very difficult to retain the profits. Again I have always been talking about the theme of market share gain. Market share gains happen only if there is one dominant player and there are other weaker players. The difference between the competitiveness of these players is huge. All the dominant players across the sectors are the players who have grown at a significantly higher rate compared to the rest of the competition.

So, that kind of theme is going to accelerate and this theme anyway works across the up and the down cycles and this is a complete fillip that the government has given such companies and the profitable ones will get even more dominant. So you got to find companies where valuation is in your favour.


Are you fully invested in this market?Yes, we were not raising money until 2018. We have stopped taking funds.


Your view was that midcaps were reaching a bubble level. After that, reality has dawned and you raised capital after that. That was a great call. What is your call now?No, I think in this kind of market you need to be completely invested.


So one should not be biased. Just because midcaps have suffered in the past, they would continue to suffer and just because largecaps have made money, they would continue to make money?For me, the dominant player can be the largest player in that industry but if the industry is small, you know he may not be a largecap, but he would have as big a competitive advantages as many of the largecap players. That is where the opportunity is because even the best of such players have taken a hit because it is part of the midcaps. Suddenly, in the last two years, markets are differentiating midcaps and largecaps which generally does not happen and you got to differentiate by looking at the competitive advantages.


Differentiate between the businesses rather than the market capitalisation.Exactly and that is what the market has done and that is where the opportunity is.


Give me an example. You have identified themes or companies which are dominant and very good quality companies with higher return ratios though the size of the market may not be large? One such example is steel pipes. You know the steel pipes which are used in building factories, building airports, all kind of infra projects or even affordable housing where you use it for door frames. Steel pipes is a very basic industry but over the last five-six years, the number of players have shrunk. There are only two or three dominant players.


PSL used to be one, Man used to be one, some of those companies do not even exist now.Right. And I am talking about a cross section where they manufacture these square or rectangular pipes. The industry has been decimated and there are only a couple of players left who have built up the capacity. The return on capital is upwards of 25%. 

If this theme of attracting new capex and especially foreign money also comes in, India will go through a huge construction boom at least in terms of factories and the guys who have the capacity are going to benefit the most. It is a small industry; probably a $10-billion industry. But the biggest beneficiary of the capex build up will be top guy in this field. I find people are just not giving any valuation to such companies. I would say that their growth rate going forward as well as their dominance will be bigger than some of the consumer-oriented companies.

Many of the consumer oriented companies do not even manufacture those products, they just brand it. When you look at guys like Amazon with all of their private level products available on the website which are available at 20-30% discount and all of these companies now trading at 50-60-60 times multiple, I am not sure if their dominance is going to last for too long. It is an extremely competitive industry. 

Anyone can come in, get the product manufactured by outsourcing it and put its own stamp and sell it in the market. There is no real differentiation between the products. The competitive advantage is that some of these basic steel manufacturing companies are at various levels of dominance -- be it sourcing the raw material, working capital lines, the kind of rates they get, their manufacturing as well as distribution abilities. It is very difficult to build all those four aspects of the business. Dominance is going to last much more than many of the haloed consumer oriented companies.


There is one sector where the disruption is real and where disruption will change the way how future business would be conducted. It is the auto sector. EV is eventually going to cap the PE upside for a Maruti, Bajaj Auto and auto ancillary companies. Do you own auto or auto ancillary stocks?I am very careful about the auto or auto ancillary companies, especially the ones geared towards passenger vehicles side because there are huge headwinds. It is not just in India, globally also, all the passenger vehicle players are going through a huge structural change even in China, Europe and the US. 

So you cannot bet on themes where anyway there is a big disruption which may or may not happen in the next two to five years but definitely in the next 10 years. At the same time, consumer behaviour is also changing with the Ola, Ubers of the world. If I do not see 20% growth, I just avoid that kind of a sector and auto is one of those. 


Great compounders like Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance have always been expensive and the quest for a fund manager like you is to avoid the haloed, overcrowded stocks. Is there a learning for all of us when we look at some of these classic businesses but avoid buying them because they look expensive or are over-owned?During the last two years, one has seen the benefit of owning those quality stocks but two years is not a long period. You got to look over a cycle. Most of these companies barring maybe like a Bajaj Finance, typically grows at much lesser than 20% and especially the consumer oriented companies. So, if your returns expectations are in the range of 10 to 15%, there is no reason for you to go hunting for anything else. Just hold on to these companies and the valuations do not matter, if you are going to hold on to them for at least 15-20 years. So, it is a no-brainer for a passive investor. 

For a fund manager, if your return expectations cross 20%, you cannot hope for rerating perpetually in these stocks. They are already trading at such valuations that going forward, you can see only the earnings growth as your return. If the earnings growth is going to be 10-12% and if you are happy with those returns, then it is great for you. So that is my problem. But yes, there are certain companies like Bajaj Finance which I am happy to hold and I am fine overpaying for higher growth. But if it falls, like in the case of Page Industries. I held it for multiple years but by 2016, the growth rate fell below 20%.

As soon as the growth rate stops and comes back to the normalised growth rate, these companies lose their PE multiple and you would never know which company will go through that kind of a cycle. There will be only two or three such companies which will sustain it for the next 20 years or 25 years, but I do not know whether you have the ability because you would have said the same thing about Eicher or a Page and you may have the same kind of losses which a lot of midcaps have gone through if you have bought them at the highs. 

Now, in which part of the market is the risk reward in your favour? I would say it is not in your favour if you are buying at such valuations and if your time horizon is five or seven years. You can imagine that at a 10-11% growth, it takes seven years to double the earnings and 80 times PE multiple goes down to 40 times PE multiples. It can happen because historically they have never traded at such valuations. You end up making zero returns. 

Whether you want to take that kind of a risk, especially given that India can go through with this incentive -- once the higher growth rate phase starts and there are more alternatives available for investors to get into such companies. People will start to get out of those because in the last seven years, the rest of the universe had stopped growing and these were the only companies which consistently grew and that is where a lot of foreign investors as well as Indian investors flocked into these companies. If it reverses, I am not sure these companies will maintain such high PE multiples. 


There is a big if over when corporate India will start spending and when the earning cycles will pick up. Corporate capex was supposed to pick up in 2016. We are staring at the ugly reality where the government had to give a tax cut to kick start the investment cycle. What if it does not pick up? It is possible because it is not that companies will flock into the country just because of one incentive. Coming into the country has to become easy and starting a business also has to become easy. For that, the government has to go for the land reforms and then labour reforms. Given the conviction of this government, I think they will get it done. 

If that is done, you can look at the interest rate at lowest levels. Commodity prices including steel are at extremely low levels. The tax rates are at the lowest levels. I feel the tax cut move would not have been as valuable if it was done under any normal circumstances. 

The US-China trade war is giving you an opportunity where many American companies may shift to some other geographies, away from China. So you get this window and you got to grab it. If you do not grab it now, those companies are not going to shift their plants once they are already set up in Indonesia or Thailand or Vietnam. So the timing is extremely important. 


Can India survive in manufacturing? Made in India ended up becoming only a slogan by the NDA-1 government. Frankly in the last six years, with the exception of two or three large big ticket investments, nothing has come.Look at the chemical belt. After China, India probably is the dominant chemical producer. A belt was formed, right incentives were given and the ecosystem was there. That is what needs to be created. It does not need to happen across the nation. You find certain pockets where the land prices are really low, where the ecosystem is there, where you have the right skill sets. If it is planned well, I do not think we lack anything which any other country may have and if the government plans it right and has the right intention, it can be done. 


Would you say that you need a different strategy for every pitch? Sometimes go on the front foot and sometimes go on the back foot? In 2019, those who played a defensive strategy in the stock market, have benefitted. Do you think now it is the time to take a leap of faith and start buying risk in the portfolio? I am not in favour of buying risk. Obviously you can take a tactical call on that but it is betting too much on luck. I feel you find dominant players available at cheaper prices compared to historical valuations and they will definitely be more dominant three, four, five years down the line. Go after B2B players which are geared towards capital goods. 

Look at these steel pipes, electrical cable manufacturer because whether this theme plays out or not, they are dominant and highly profitable. They will benefit from it and they are exposed to the real estate sector. They are exposed to factories, all kinds of construction as well as the consumer-oriented retail business. 

There are certain niche businesses like alloys which are used in steel manufacturing and there are such industries where there are just one or two players, extremely dominant, almost impossible to get into those businesses because most of them have burnt their fingers and got out of such businesses. If India grows at a higher rate, their growth rate also can be significantly higher. 

If this theme works out and the commodity growth is higher like steel industry, these companies are trading at two, three, four times multiples with over 30% return on capital, sitting on huge cash, no issue of debt or balance sheet and promoter holding of 75%. Such companies can go through a huge re-rating as well as huge growth over the next five years. That is where the opportunity is.


How have you managed to convince your clients to keep calm? All midcap stocks have got beaten. Price damage and collateral damage has been there. What are you telling your clients? How should they keep the calm when the entire sector has got de-rated?No, it is extremely difficult because whatever you tell them, if they see damage in their portfolio, people get concerned. It is human nature because a fund manager may see visibility in certain companies but as a passive investor, you may not have the same conviction or visibility in those names."

75,2019-09-30,Eicher,"By Ronojoy Mazumdar

Poor demand from Indian consumers could dampen the mood during festivals next month, especially for automobile makers and retailers that count on the season for a sales boost, analysts predict.

Indians typically buy everything from new cars to shoes for themselves and as gifts during celebrations steeped in religion and tradition. Yet the slowest economic growth in six years, unemployment at a 45-year high and tepid private consumption may see sales fall short of recent years, even after the government’s $20 billion tax break to companies earlier this month.

“You can make the product 50 per cent cheaper, but there has to be income to spend,” said Nitin Gupta, an analyst at SBICAP Securities in Mumbai. “In the short-term, I don’t see any kind of an income boost. Rather than giving cash to individuals, they have given it to companies.”

Car sales in August fell the most on record and Maruti Suzuki India Friday reduced the price on its Baleno RS model by 100,000 rupees ($1,420) to pass on the benefit from the tax cut. Market researcher Nielsen has lowered its 2019 growth estimate for fast-moving goods to 9 per cent-10 per cent from 11 per cent-12 per cent, while a stock gauge of consumer discretionary firms is set for its first annual back-to-back losses since at least 2005.



Even so, the industry’s fortunes beyond the approaching festival season are poised to improve, according to BNP Paribas SA. Plentiful rainfall seen this monsoon season and cash handouts to farmers will help lift rural incomes, helping sales of staples recover in the second half of the year that began April 1, the brokerage said in a recent report.

Here’s what other analysts say:


SBICAP Securities’ Gupta



The festive season is likely to be dull. Consumption is hit and household income has to increase for there to be better demand for companies selling fast-moving consumer goods.
Corporate tax cuts are a long-term phenomena and won’t help in the short term. It’s uncertain how much companies could pass on the benefit in terms of lower prices.

Aditya Soman and Aditya Gupta, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc



Don’t expect a significant change in underlying demand trends across categories and geographies in 2Q
“We would look for color on festive demand outlook especially given the normal monsoon which could have a positive impact on demand,” in 2Q earnings calls
Recommends buying shares in ITC, Britannia Industries Ltd., and Page Industries Ltd., selling shares in Dabur, Hindustan Unilever and Marico.


Harshit Kapadia, an analyst at Elara Securities India



I’m not expecting a blockbuster festive season. It won’t be muted either, but will be decent. Even last year demand was largely flat, that’s why double-digit growth in demand on the lower end is possible.
Distributors are preparing for the Navratri and Diwali season, but nobody is stocking up heavily. They are following the normal trend of keeping 15-20 days of inventory, whereas in past years they would keep 30-35 days ahead of the festival season

The best case scenario for automobiles is for demand to remain flattish on a year-on-year basis as last festival season was bad for demand. Things have gotten worse since then.
Investors should avoid commercial vehicles and producers of lower-cost two wheelers, which face a bigger inventory pileup.

Demand is there, it’s only the size of the wallet that’s come down. In difficult times, people don’t stop buying the product. If someone was buying a large pack before, maybe they’ll buy a small pack now.
In the festive season people tend to forget the bad times.

76,2019-09-30,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Investors expecting positive signals from September auto sales could be in for some disappointment as passenger vehicle (PV) volumes may fall by over 20 per cent amid high inventory levels.

Growth slowdown, inauspicious Shraddh period and floods in select regions are likely to impact wholesales, said analysts. The festive season, which kicked off on Sunday, could see some demand improvement in the runup to Diwali, they added.

September sales momentum has not seen much improvement, said Nomura India.

“However, for PVs, with heavy discounts on offer, the footfalls have improved, which should translate into much improved retail sales, as the festive season begins on September 29,” it added.

Brokerage Sharekhan said that inventories in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment stood at 4-6 weeks and at two-wheeler segment at 5-7 weeks, which have led to sustained weakness in demand. Commercial vehicles (CV) segment is likely to be the worst impacted segment with volumes likely to drop by 40 per cent, it said.

Higher base effect and financing issues may play a spoilsport in September, said Emkay Global, which expects auto sale cycle to see a gradual recovery due to the confluence of factors such as increasing discounts, better rural sentiment, lower interest rates, higher government spending and a possible introduction of the scrappage policy.

For the month gone by, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities is expecting Maruti Suzuki to log a 32.4 per cent YoY drop in sales on a high base.

“For Mahindra and Mahindra, we expect tractor sales to decline by 41.5 per cent on a high base. Tata Motors is most likely to continue to underperform the market in the PV segment with ongoing inventory correction and slowdown in retail sales. We expect its commercial vehicle sales to continue to be affected by increased fleet capacity and slowdown in the economy. Similarly, we expect Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors’ CV sales to also decline in high double digits YoY,” the brokerage said. 

In the two-wheeler space, it expects Bajaj Auto sales to decline over a high base, although MoM may grow, driven by new model launches.

“Hero MotoCorp dealers already had high inventories at the start of the month and hence there seems to be very little scope for stocking up. Hence, we expect its sales to decline by 25 per cent YoY. TVS Motor’s sales are expected to decline by 29.4 per cent YoY on a high base. Its 3Ws continue to garner strong demand in export markets,” Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said.

On net-net basis, Nomura India expects PV industry volumes to decline by 20 per cent on YoY basis, with sales fort Maruti Suzuki falling 24 per cent in domestic volumes.

For two-wheelers, it expects industry volumes to decline 17 per cent as inventory levels remain very high, and a retail demand recovery is needed to correct the 6-8 weeks’ inventory ahead of the BS-6 changeover.

The MHCV industry is likely to have a volume decline of 49 per cent."
0,2019-10-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Auto shares were trading on a mixed note in Tuesday's session as major auto companies announced their sales for September.

According to analysts, the inauspicious Shraddh period and floods in some regions impacted auto sales. But inquiries and footfalls rose towards end of September after heavy discounts and promotional offers by companies which lead to some increase in sales as compared to the previous month, brokerages said.

4,2019-10-01,Eicher,"Panic selling in bank and other financial stocks and continued slump in auto sales weighed on market sentiment on Tuesday, which caused the Sensex to dive over 700 points at one point before paring the losses to close 361 points, or 0.94 per cent, down at 38,305. Nifty fell 1 per cent, or 114 points, to end at 11,360.

Auto sales continued to contract in September. Barring Maruti, Eicher Motors and M&M, other auto stocks closed in the red. 

""A contraction in core sector and concern over the government plan to stick with its 3.3% fiscal target in spite of huge tax cut raised concern over spending. Investors are not expecting a meaningful recovery this festival season due to continued weakness in auto sales. Volatility in bank stocks and a fall in the rupee triggered profit booking,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. 

Here is a lowdown on key movers and shakers of Tuesday’s session:


YES Bank continues to tankYES Bank continued its downhill journey, as stock crashed 23 per cent on BSE to close at Rs 32. The scrip tumbled after founder Rana Kapoor and associated promoter entities sold a large stake in the bank. YES Capital (India), Morgan Credits Private and Rana Kapoor together sold 552 lakh shares, or 2.16 per cent stake, in the open market during September 26-27.


Mysterious plunge in RBL BankShares of RBL Bank plunged as much as 22 per cent in intraday trade, but recovered at the end to close about 9 per cent down at Rs 800. Vishwavir Ahuja, MD and CEO, RBL Bank, said selling is looking highly speculative and misplaced. Ahuja said the bank continues to grow and remains profitable. ""You will see this in our earnings, which are little over two weeks from now. Nothing has changed fundamentally in the bank,"" he said.


Panic selling in PSU banks Public sector banks also came under pressure after Jefferies warned that bad loans could rise in the banking system. In a note, the global brokerage suggested that there was a divergence between ratings and debt repayment ability of companies. The Nifty PSU Bank index dived about 4 per cent for the day. Bank of Baroda and SBI in the PSU Bank pack are most prone to high risk emanating from defaulting companies, it said.


Little hope from auto sales Auto sales continued to slide in September. M&M’s volume declined 21 per cent, while SML Isuzu (26 per cent), Eicher Motors (30 per cent), Maruti Suzuki (24 per cent) and Ashok Leyland (27 per cent) all report drop in sales. Only Escorts (up 2.2 per cent) and Atul Auto (4 per cent) registered growth in monthly sales. Most of the auto stocks ended in the red. However, M&M, Eicher Motors and Maruti registered gains. Overall, Nifty Auto index dropped 0.4 per cent. 


All sectoral indices in the redAll sectoral indices on NSE ended in the red, with Nifty Realty and Nifty Media indices plunging over 4 per cent. Bank, pharma and metal indices were other big losers. 


Key Sensex moversReliance Industries and bank stocks on the index were the biggest drags on Sensex. RIL dragged Sensex by 85 points, followed by ICICI Bank (55 points), SBI (55 points) and IndusInd Bank (51 points). HDFC twins provided some support, lifting it over 120 points. 


Investors lose Rs 1.85 lakh croreDomestic equity investors lost some Rs 1.85 lakh crore in Tuesday turmoil, as the market-cap of all BSE-listed companies shrank to Rs 145 lakh crore from Rs 147 lakh crore on Monday. 


Spike in volatilityIndia VIX, a measure of volatility in the market, jumped 5 per cent to 16.7. Increased volatility usually means pain for investors, as it is a symbol of instability and the market could move either way very swiftly. 


Over 190 stocks blink ‘sell’ signalsOver 190 stocks crossed below the MACD Signal line on Tuesday. They included SBI, RBL Bank, Bank of Baroda, PNB , Motherson Sumi, Adani Power, Rail Vikas Nigam, Bharti Infratel, etc. The MACD is one of the technical indicators used to spot trends, though it is seldom used as a standalone indicator.


Most active stocksYES Bank and Vodafone Idea were the most traded stocks in terms of trading volume on NSE. They were followed by Indiabulls Housing, SBI and IDFC First Bank. In value terms, Axis Bank, YES Bank, Indiabulls Housing, SBI and HDFC topped the list."
3,2019-10-01,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Domestic benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty succumbed to fears of more distress in the banking sector only to end Tuesday's session 1 per cent lower after meandering through losses and gains in intraday trade.

Weak auto sales figures and macro data numbers that signalled acute economic pain added to the worries on Dalal Street.

BSE flagship index Sensex ended 362 points or 0.94 per cent lower at 38,305. It tanked over 700 points during the day only to recover a bit. NSE barometer Nifty settled at 11,360, down 115 points or 1 per cent lower. India VIX surged 5.22 per cent.

In the Sensex pack of stocks, only seven ended in the positive zone. HDFC Bank, M&M, Maruti and HDFC were among the top gainers. Meanwhile, YES Bank, IndusInd Bank, SBI, Bharti Airtel and ONGC were the top drags.

Bank stocks cracked as the rumour mill on Dalal Street hinted at more distressed names coming out thus pushing the NPAs higher. Buzz over the exposure of banks of Indiabulls group was another reason behind the fall. BSE Bankex dropped 1.55 per cent.

A Jefferies report said that bad loans could rise in the banking system. In a note Jefferies suggested that there is a divergence between the ratings and the debt repayment ability of companies.

Shares of YES Bank cracked 22.80 per cent amid fears of exposure to IB Housing and stake sale by promoters Rana Kapoor, YES Capital and Morgan Credits.

RBL Bank tanked 8.7 per cent. Its CEO and MD Vishwavir Ahuja in an interaction with ET NOW blamed the selling to speculations doing rounds in the market.

HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank proved resilient to this selloff in banking names.

Besides the poor Auto sales figures for the month of September was another dampener for Dalal Street. Sales for M&M declined 21 per cent, SML Isuzu (26 per cent), Eicher Motors (30 per cent), Ashok Leyland (27 per cent). BSE Auto ended 0.41 per cent lower.

In the sectoral space, telecom and realty fell the most. BSE Telecom shut shop 4.53 per cent down while BSE Realty ended 3.88 per cent lower. Consumer Durables index ended flat.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap dropped 1.54 per cent and 1.61 per cent.

Weak macro data remained another cause of worry for investors. India’s core infrastructure industries’ output declined for the first time in more than four years in August, reflecting weak demand in the economy. The index of eight core infrastructure industries, which comprises output of coal, crude oil, cement and electricity among others, fell 0.5 per cent in August. It had last declined in April 2015.


Expert Take

""Contraction in core sector and concern on government’s plan to stick with original fiscal target of 3.3% in spite of huge cut in tax raised concern overspending. Investors are not expecting a meaningful recovery in the festival season due to continued weakness in auto sales. Volatility in banks and fall in rupee also influenced profit-booking tendency in the market"" -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"
2,2019-10-01,Eicher,"The domestic stock market continued to bleed on Tuesday with Sensex and Nifty falling nearly 2 per cent each. Rumours of more debt distress, muted auto sales and weak macro data weighed on the stocks.

Sensex plunged as much as 737.44 points during the session to 37,929.89, while Nifty tanked up to 226.55 points to 11,247.90. 

However, benchmark indices recouped losses with the 30-share Sensex ending the day at 38,305.41, down 362 points or 0.94 per cent. Its NSE counterpart Nifty settled the day at 11,365.70, down 109 points or 0.95 per cent.

Yes Bank was the biggest index loser, tumbling over 22 per cent after its promoter entities sold a part of their stake in the company.

The rupee was also weak amid heavy selling in equity market, down 0.28 per cent or 20 paise at 71.06. The volatility index, India VIX surged 11.54 per cent in the afternoon trade to hit 17.7 level.

Later in the day, data showed that GST collection dropped below the Rs 1 lakh crore mark to Rs 91,916 crore in September, a 19-month low.

Here are the key factors that weighed on Dalal Street today:


Banks bleed
Banking names crashed on Tuesday as Nifty Bank came down by 2.44 per cent led by YES Bank that plummeted over 22 per cent. RBL Bank also tumbled 18 per cent on NSE. Except HDFC Bank, all constituents of the index were trading in the red.

Rumours of more distressed names coming out weighed on the banks. Banking stocks fell on Monday as well on buzz of their exposure to Indiabulls Group.

A Jefferies report said that bad loans could rise in the banking system. In a note Jefferies suggested that there is a divergence between the ratings and the debt repayment ability of companies.

YES Bank, Bank of Baroda, SBI, IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank are amongst the banks that are most prone to high risk emanating from Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), Cox & Kings, CG Power, DHFL and Essar Shipping, it said.

RBI said the banking system is safe and stable and asked bank customers not to panic on the rumours doing the rounds.

""There are rumours in some locations about certain banks including cooperative banks, resulting in anxiety among the depositors. RBI would like to assure the general public that Indian banking system is safe and stable and there is no need to panic on the basis of such rumours,"" the central bank posted on its Twitter handle.

Weak macro dataIndia’s core infrastructure industries’ output declined for the first time in more than four years in August, reflecting weak demand in the economy. The index of eight core infrastructure industries, which comprises output of coal, crude oil, cement and electricity among others, fell 0.5 per cent in August. It had last declined in April 2015.



The core infrastructure sector constitutes two-fifths of total industrial production and the weakness will have negative impact on factory output, data for which is due next week.


Auto sales stay sluggishAuto sales continued to slide in September. Sales for M&M declined 21 per cent, SML Isuzu (26 per cent), Eicher Motors (30 per cent), Ashok Leyland (27 per cent). This dampened the mood dragging Nifty Auto 0.7 per cent.

However, a couple of companies registered a growth in monthly sales, including Escorts (up 2.2 per cent) Atul Auto (4 per cent).

Maruti Suzuki stock price climbed 0.4 per cent to Rs 6,745 despite the company reporting 24 per cent fall in sales.


Fitch forecasts more gloomThe sentiment on D-Street also took a hit after Fitch said global GDP growth will hit eight-year low in 2019. Fitch said the outlook for the global economy deteriorated significantly due to escalation in the US-China trade war. The rating agency said lower growth in China will prolong the slump in global trade and manufacturing, which will, in turn, continue to pressure eurozone expansion."
6,2019-10-04,Eicher,"Auto stocks nudged higher after the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut policy rates on Friday. The MPC cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.15 per cent.

The lower repo rates mean a lower interest rate on auto loans that may boost the vehicle sales. The auto industry has been going through a slowdown and traders celebrated the rate cut by buying auto stocks. 

Ashok Leyland was up 2.8 per cent and M&M up 1 per cent on NSE in the afternoon trade. 

Hero Moto, MRF, Apollo Tyres, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki were other gainers. Overall Nifty Auto was up 0.22 per cent. 

Bharat Forge, Amara Raja Batteries, Exide Industries and Tata Motors were trading 1-2 pert cent lower. 

MPC however showed concern over a “staggered and incomplete” transmission of the rate cuts. “As against the cumulative policy repo rate reduction of 110 bps during February-August 2019, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 29 bps” it said.

If the real interest rates do not go down in tandem with the repo rate cut, auto industry may not benefit much from it"
5,2019-10-04,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Majority of interest-rate-sensitive counters from auto, banking and realty sectors were trading in the green in Friday's session ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decision.

The BSE Auto index was trading 0.29 per cent higher at 16,804 at around 9.20 am with Hero MotoCorp gaining the most at 1 per cent. It was followed by Maruti Suzuki (up 0.81 per cent), TVS Motor (0.91 per cent) and Eicher Motors (0.65 per cent).

Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra and Ashok Leyland were down between 0.25 per cent and 1 per cent.

The BSE Bankex index was up 0.93 per cent at around the same time. YES Bank, RBL Bank, IndusInd Bank and State Bank of India were up 7 per cent, 2.55 per cent, 2.26 per cent and 1.53 per cent. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank was trading higher between 0.30 per cent and 1 per cent.

YES Bank extended its gain to the second straight session after the lender said its financials are strong and liquidity is well in excess of regulatory requirements.

On the other hand, the benchmark BSE Sensex was up 0.69 per cent, or 264 points, at 38,370.

Real estate majors also advanced up to 2 per cent in the early trade. The BSE Realty index was trading 0.57 per cent up at 1934. Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty, DLF, Indiabulls Real Estate and Prestige were up over 0.40 per cent. On the other hand, Sobha and Sunteck were down up to 2 per cent.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) expects the RBI MPC to follow RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das into another ‘out-of-the-box’ 35 basis points repo rate cut on October 4. This should send a strong signal for bank lending rate cuts with the ‘busy’ industrial season round the corner. “With the 2018 liquidity crunch still hurting growth, our India Activity Indicator points to continued slowdown,” said BofAML.

There are expectations that RBI may deliver a fifth straight interest rate cut, although economists are unsure of the quantum following an unconventional 35 basis-point easing last time.

While all 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect a reduction, their forecasts range from 20 basis points to 40 basis points. The RBI has lowered borrowing costs to a nine-year low of 5.4 per cent through 110 basis points of easing so far in 2019."

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Kotak Securities has maintained buy rating on 
Talbros Automotive Components with a target price of Rs 177. In FY20, the brokerage expects the company’s performance to be weak amid significant slowdown in automobile demand. From April-August 2019, two wheeler, passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle YoY production is down by 11 per cent, 16 per cent, and 23 per cent respectively, said Kotak Securities. Currently the stock is trading at a PE of 6.6 times on FY20 estimated earnings and 4.7 times on FY21 estimated earnings. The stock ended up 1.1 per cent at Rs 107.35 on Monday.

• SBICAP Securities has retained sell rating on 
Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 13,170. Industry checks indicate supplies of Jawa motorcycles have been significantly ramped-up to 200/day, said SBICAP Securities. Eicher Motors' Royal Enfield's franchise is consistently deteriorating with growing ‘brand fatigue’ as evident from sharply declining same-store sales growth and steep share loss across markets, said SBICAP Securities. The stock ended flat Rs 17,999.20 on Monday.


• Nomura has maintained buy rating on 
Glenmark Pharmaceuticals with a target price of Rs 653 after the drug maker announced that the US FDA has issued a warning letter for the Baddi formulation site after the inspection in April 2019. The issues highlighted in the inspection were primarily related to product specific quality, it said. So far, Glenmark had a good track record with respect to USFDA inspection and this is the first case of a facility coming under warning letter, said Nomura. The stock ended down 9.3 per cent at Rs 286.30 on Monday.

• Citigroup has maintained buy rating on 
JSW Energy with a target price of Rs 85 after the company disclosed that it has entered into exclusive discussions with GMR Energy for potential acquisition of its subsidiary, GMR Kamalanga Energy, which owns and operates a 1050 MW thermal power plant in Odisha. The potential acquisition valuation is not disclosed yet but is likely to be reasonable, said Citi. The stock nded up 1.3 per cent at Rs 60.10 on Monday.

• Centrum has a reduce on 
Bharat Petroleum Corporation with a target price of Rs 450. Despite the structural implications of around 13 per cent of Indian refining and around 25 per cent of Indian marketing capacity potentially being owned by a private player, the stock already prices in close to a bull case scenario for BPCL, leaving little on the table for investors, said Centrum. Given that valuations have run ahead of fundamentals investors would do well to book profits, it said. The stock ended down 4.8 per cent at Rs 490.45 on Monday."

Some of the big names that plan to miss the February 2020 event — it’s held every two years — include Honda Cars, Hero MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland and BMW. The muted enthusiasm is in keeping with the slump in auto sales. For the public, there are few surprises to be had, with many new models already launched or displayed in detail online.

However, new entrants such as Kia and MG Motor, are attending. Then there’s the return of Volkswagen, Skoda and Great Wall Motors, China’s biggest maker of SUVs and pickup trucks. They will occupy about 3,500 sq ft each, similar to the area that Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest car maker, will use for its displays. Hyundai Motor India will also be attending.

Others that won’t be attending include Ford and Fiat Chrysler. 


Top Truck Cos Staying Away
Nissan is said to be deliberating its options. In the luxury car space, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus are the only participants in the coming edition.

At this time of the year, almost all of the space is typically booked up, but not this time. A sluggish market, migration to Bharat Stage VI emission norms, lack of exciting product launches and high ownership costs are among the key factors keeping brands away. BMW India managing director Rudratej Singh said the company has already launched its products and there’s no major offering to showcase.



“Our focus is more on targeted marketing and using our money more appropriately to ensure product launches are executed well,” he said. “It’s not to say that we are not going to look at the Auto Expo again. With the right products and timing, we may come back.”

A Honda Cars India spokesperson said the company’s release schedule wasn’t in sync with the Auto Expo timeline.

The top five two-wheeler makers are unlikely to attend. Suzuki and Piaggio will do so. Apart from Hero, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Royal Enfield and Yamaha aren’t participating, sources said, adding that Honda Motorcycle may join them.

“In keeping with our prioritised objectives, we have decided after much deliberation to skip the upcoming Auto Expo,” a Hero Moto-Corp spokesperson said. “At a time such as this (transition to BS VI emission norms), it is prudent for us to prioritise our resources towards meeting business objectives for the benefit of our customers and stakeholders.”

Yamaha, Nissan, Honda Motorcycle and FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) Group didn’t respond to queries.

Top truck brands are also staying away. Only Tata Motors and Mahindra have pavilions since Ashok Leyland, Eicher and Bharat Benz have decided not to attend.

More than 90% slots are usually booked by October for the expo, but this year Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) is still trying to get companies to confirm attendance.

The Hero MotoCorp spokesperson said participation would require months of preparation and allocation of resources — in terms of money and manpower — which is a challenge.

The last edition of the week-long event recorded a marginal rise in footfalls to 605,000. Over 500 products were showcased by 119 exhibitors, with 22 product launches, 81 product unveilings and 18 concepts. As many as 11 startups showed up. Audi, Ford, FCA, JLR, Nissan, Volkswagen, Bajaj Auto, Royal Enfield and Harley-Davidson missed Auto Expo 2018. Green machines ruled the show in the previous edition, with 25 electric vehicles displayed.

MG Motor, though, is upbeat about the Delhi Auto Expo. “It is a great engagement platform for the company to interact with all the stakeholders, including prospective customers, and get feedback,” said marketing head Gaurav Gupta."

21,2019-10-16,Eicher,"Every time the stock market goes up, we need to take a shorter position than go long in auto because industry dynamics are becoming akin to something like telecom. It is going to be a dog-eat-dog world for market share, says Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.



While winter has arrived in Delhi and Gurgaon, is the winter getting over for Indian stock markets?It is already over for a few select stocks. The rest are going to face a freezing winter. They will be kept out of the party for a long time to come. Nothing has changed in two-three years. Everything remains the same. I am sorry to say this, but it is going to get accentuated in the smaller cap stocks. It is going to be a long time before they come back into favour. 

As far as we are concerned, for the larger stocks -- MNC stocks and some of the PSU stocks -- will be fine but 70% of the Indian stock market will remain out in the Tundra cold for this winter at least. You can imagine what happens to midcaps who remain out in the cold.


What gives you the confidence that the winter is over for some? What makes you believe that the worst is now behind us?It has nothing to do with the current economic scenario. The institutional framework of a stock market has changed over the last two-three years and now it is dramatically different from what it was before. One of the things is that the holding with individuals for at least the good quality stocks is now at its historical low at this point of time.

Even individuals who hold them are not selling those shares. If you look at the top 10-15 stocks, the MNC stocks for instance, you will find that dwindling supply of stocks in the market and with the new F&O rules, we are talking of physical delivery versus the older model of settlement on your trade.

You will find that it will be more and more difficult to short these stocks as time goes by. For instance, nobody wants to sell a Lever, nobody wants to sell a Nestle, nobody wants to sell the Astrazeneca Pharma. Whatever you have, you are buying and you are holding. 

Gradually you are seeing that the private holding is about 10% to 11%, out of that maybe 2% to 3% actually comes for trading in the market. Wait for another year or two and if this economic situation of low growth continues, more and more people who have not bought it, will keep buying these stocks defying the gravity of 60 PEs and 70 PEs because now it does not matter what the PE is, you want those stocks and you want to hold it irrespective of what result comes in the quarter. So even if you have a bad result, I doubt any of the diehards are going to sell those stocks, maybe a few thousand shares for a day or two but rest will come and buy the stocks. 

We are clearly seeing lack of supply in the market of good quality stocks, people who are holding are holding it firm and institutional holding is now 80-85% plus for most stocks of top 20 names, leaving very little credence to a market trading in terms of delivery and insurance companies will keep adding up. The corpus is going up. So, where will the delivery come from from these shares.


 It seems there is a rush towards the government papers. Maybe, Saudi Aramco is looking at buying a government stake in BPCL though the talks may be at a very nascent stage. IRCTC papers made a stellar debut. Do these prized government possessions make for a wise, prudent investment call?Of course, during the last budget, we spoke about PSU stocks. Earlier, it was a case of choice to sell or not to sell. Given our current scenario there is no choice, the government has to sell and it is doing whatever it takes to find a way to sell them. Look at what has happened to Air India. They are going to warehouse Rs 45,000 crore debt and pay it from whatever resources they got to hand over a clean airline. The market and investors have to realise that it is now no more a question of if; it is a question of when will they do it.

The last gambit of tax cut has played out in a very different way. Hindustan Lever increased the dividend and that money is not going to come back into the system for capex or any further growth of the economy. The only way to plug this gap and to build some corpus for development of infrastructure is sell the PSUs and these are dirt cheap. These are dirt cheap stocks. Resource companies like Nalco and NMDC are available dirt cheap. Even oil companies, given the infrastructure, they are not so expensive. 

Maybe BPCL has run up a little bit further but it is in the zone where the buyer will pay much higher than what the price is today. By and large, it is so cheap that you really cannot go wrong if these companies are sold. Number two, they have exhausted their ability to pay dividends and the government’s old model of taking dividend is not going to be valid anymore. Most of them are down to bare minimum in terms of cash reserves and profitability. The only option is to sell and if you sell them they are very valuable stocks. 

It is a very safe bet, it may take a little longer but you are comfortably placed in the all the PSU shares, at least the profit-making ones.


What are you making of earnings so far -- IT names in particular? Wipro was surprising while Infy looked better than TCS. Consumption is the other theme where HUL has set the tone and it is pretty decent?The earnings have disappointed and the biggest disappointment has been TCS. Among all the companies so far, Infosys has done okay. The stock may not have done well after the announcement but it is doing decently well. TCS has been a disappointment and may disappoint further, I am not too sure. I believe that next year, the result would be remarkably better because if you look at the forward premiums, they must have taken something between Rs 73-75 to a dollar next year on their sales, which augurs well as even their volumes remain constant and the currency benefit is going to be pretty steep in the next 12 months.

But there is no reason to sell, just keep TCS. A huge dividend is coming your way because that is the only way they can compensate. By and large, good dividend, good placement, low risk, less worries, keep going it is not bad for the next year. 


Another interesting development is promoter pledged share reduction. In Bajaj Consumer, Kushagra Bajaj has offloaded 29% stake in the last seven months. We have seen that with Emamiwhere about 19.5% was offloaded in two tranches; Zee sold 11% to Oppenheimer. Sterlite Technologies and Apollo Hospitals also reduced pledged shares. Is there any investment opportunity amongst any of these high debt companies?We have a large holding in Apollo Hospital, but I think, it is not a good sign because the whole idea of an entrepreneur is to take risk to risk capital and increase the wealth of the country and grow the economy. When a promoters start to shrink themselves and sell the assets and cut debt, that is not a good sign as far as the economy is concerned. 

It may be good for the companies per se so that the stock is doing well but broadly as an indicator of what they see in the future, it is not a good sign. But since everyone wants to deleverage that means they do not want to take more economic risk in this country.

My personal view is yes it is positive for the stock in the short term but not necessarily good for the economy because if all the entrepreneurs shun risk, then who is going to take new projects forward and where is the new capital going to come from? Will it be only institutional capital from abroad which will dictate India in the future? That is one way to look at it but will it mean that the entire Indian diaspora of entrepreneurs are going to vacate new project space? That is not a good sign for an economy by and large. 

So I do not get a great feeling when everybody including Reliance is deleveraging. It is not good because the idea is to take some risk, get some new projects going, get growth going and that will make sense as an entrepreneur. 


Would your view remain a little cautious on auto?We are cautious because we have just gone short again. The optimism on auto is perhaps a little misplaced even at today’s levels and let us see how the quarter’s results come out because the discount would start to play out and it is not that the festive season is going that great.

We need to relook at auto in a fundamental way because of two reasons. One is demand has compressed and look at the competition. Three years back, Hero was the sole maker in 100 cc, 125 cc market. Look at what is happening today. Look at Eicher in the larger categories. Now there is Java, Enfield, Indian, just name the brands just sitting there; look at the car companies and watch the competition.

We need to fundamentally re-rate the automobile sector from a monopolistic situation of the last three years to a very competitive, low-return industry in the near future. Our view is that every time the stock market goes up, we need to take a shorter position than go long because industry dynamics are becoming akin to something like telecom. It is going to be a dog-eat-dog world for market share and that is not good news. Yes Maruti with Rs 36,000 crore of cash need to use it at some place, but they are losing their market standing as well at this point of time. So, I am not so gung ho on autos even if sales revive now. Most companies are pretty expensive even at the current prices."

This augurs well for the global economy. If the US- China trade deal also happens, that will be very good news for the global economy.

24,2019-10-17,Eicher,"The only pocket left is tier one private sector banks and/or select midcap banks which are doing fine from asset quality perspective plus NII growth and bottom line perspective. Stay away from metal stocks for noew, says Pankaj Pandey, Head, Research, ICICIdirect.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Should investors use this strength in the market to cash out or hold on and buy more?There are selective pockets which are doing well in terms of price performance and earnings performance within sectors and this is why one needs to be selective -- be it largecap, midcap or smallcaps. That’s why we have been selectively suggesting our clients to look at stocks where the growth visibility is decent. If one needs to segregate between ordinary and quality businesses. The latter are still getting premium. I would not expect that trend to change going forward.


The picture continues to be bleak in metal names. Would you still look at any entries at lower levels or stay away altogether?Metals and auto are going to be having one of the worst quarters. For the entire metal pack, we expect the top line to decline about 17% odd and the bottom line would decline by about 50%. The impact is going to be felt more in ferrous metals or steel stocks. With continuing global volatility, we do not expect this sector to do much, but there are certain measures, for example anti-dumping duty, which the government is proposing on steel products.

That might help the industry and with the kind of corporate tax cuts which have happened, we would expect the free cash flows to be slightly better, going forward. That might improve their debt equity profile but from lower levels, some bit of bounce can happen in some of these stocks, especially the metal ones. One should not still be chasing till stability returns in prices globally.


With HCL Tech results yet to come, how are you positioning yourself amongst the top tier IT names?In case of HCL Tech, if you exclude the acquisition. then organic growth is still going to be muted. In the tier one pack, TCS is trading at about 21-22 times and Infosys at 16 odd times. We have turned buyers in Wipro. We have given a target price of Rs 300 because the stock is trading at about 12 times. 

HCL Tech is trading at a similar multiple but our view is till organic growth picks up, we would not be chasing the stock. Within tier one names, Wipro looks better compared to the rest of the pack, followed by Infosys where growth or the dealings have been pretty good.

You would expect that that should translate into better revenue growth going forward. Most of the stocks are fairly priced. You do not expect big kickers from any of the tier 1 names.


What are you expecting from some of the key earnings from the banking space? Which are the names that you are going to be watching out for?I cannot comment on Federal Bank because it is in restricted list but for the banking sector, we are expecting private banks NII growth of about 18% odd and bottom line growth of about 44% driven by tax cut. 

Private banks are expected to deliver good advances growth in teens whereas SBI might deliver 9-10% advance growth. The PSUs are not expected to do much. For example, in this particular quarter, we are expecting BoB to do about 2% advance growth. The only pocket left is tier one private sector banks and/or select midcap banks which are doing fine from asset quality perspective plus NII growth and bottom line perspective.

Some of them are trading slightly expensive but that is the space in banking one can look at.


Do you believe that for Zee earnings would be immaterial and the bigger worry is about the future of the group?
In media space, for PVR, we are expecting ad revenue growth to decline from about 18% normal run rate to about 12% odd, largely because of the slower spend by clients. Same is the case with Zee, wherein we are expecting ad revenue growth to come down to about 3% odd ,while the other segments are expected to do well. But for Zee to perform till the time this overhang of promoters remains, I do not think price performance can be expected on the stock front. 

We are expecting a good set of numbers from PVR and INOX, especially on the box office collection side. In the media space, that is generally a pocket one can look at because even print media is expected to deliver anaemic set of numbers. 


What is going on with RBL? During its peak period, it was trading at a price to book higher than HDFC Bank’s. Now, it is trading at a price to book which is less than ICICI Bank’s. Where should RBL actually settle?We do not have coverage on RBL. At one pint, the bank talked about its pristine asset quality. From that perspective. if you are jumping to nearly 3% gross NPA level, that turned out to be a big surprise for the markets overall and which is why the derating has started. 

Till the time, confidence comes back, I would not expect much to happen in the stock. Somewhere down the line, tier one banks have been doing a far better job of maintaining asset quality. But any surprise on that front and markets are going to ignore a lot more positives. That’s why a lot of derating has happened in stocks and RBL is no exception to that.


Which two-wheeler stock is looking attractive at these valuations?Two-wheelers have seen a decent amount of decline in volume numbers. In terms of pecking order, we like Hero MotoCorp the most because we expect some revival on the rural side, which is where the maximum exposure of this company has been. It has been trading at fairly attractive multiples of about 13-14 times, compared to the rest of the pack. 

We do not have confidence in Eicher in terms of growth going forward because the numbers have not yet shown up. Bajaj Auto is fairly priced and has been one of the better performing stocks, given the fact that their overseas exposure or exports form a fairly decent basket. From negative, we have turned neutral on auto as a pack. If we get a scrappage policy, that could be very attractive for CV players but we have to see how things pan out. Till that time, we are not chasing auto stocks in general.


If someone is looking at making a fresh investment, would you pick out INOX as opposed to PVR, purely because of the discount it still trades at versus PVR?We like both the stocks, but relatively we like INOX more given the fact that it is trading nearly about 30% discount to PVR. In addition, what we have seen in INOX is that their ad revenue growth has been faring better compared to PVR. In the entire media space, these are the only two stocks which one can sort of look at, despite ad revenue growth being relatively softer in this particular quarter for most of the players. 


You are not worried about first-day-first-show from Reliance?We are not worried on that front considering that people go to multiplexes for experience and with the kind of box office collections or the kind of content which is flowing in, and with F&B as a lever, multiplex companies have been playing out well and even the ad numbers, which are looking softer at this point in time, we would expect that with increasing footfalls, that number should remain stable or witness a stable growth."

35,2019-10-18,Eicher,"Markets are trying to factor in that the government is going to do everything possible to revive the economy and the sentiment seems to be on an up move, says Nischal Maheshwari, CEO, Centrum Broking. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What is your view on the earnings numbers that have come out and how have the markets reacted to the Brexit news? How are markets trying to factor in?There has been some respite as far as the market is concerned. Markets are trying to factor in that the government is going to do everything possible to revive the economy. That will take some time but the sentiment seems to be on an up move. 


SBI had a strong move yesterday, Some positive commentary is starting to come in on the banking major, ahead of the earnings announcement. What is your view on the PSU giant?Most PSU banks should be avoided except for a few like Bank of Baroda and SBI. We have a buy on SBI.


At these levels, what would you buy among the private banks? We are looking at corporate banks as well as the retail banks. Among corporate banks, we like all three -- SBI, Axis and ICICI, not necessarily in that order. We are also looking at IndusInd Bank, given that the stock has corrected and this quarter’s numbers are also good. Most of the corporate banks seem to be in a good position at the moment. 


What did you make of TVS numbers?Yes TVS numbers were good,better than the expected. Margins were also higher. Volumes were a bit disappointing but they have said in their conference call that volumes will pick up because some of the states where they are big, were flooded during the last quarter and that is why they have lost some volume/ They are quite hopeful that come Diwali, the numbers once again will be good for them. Overall, two-wheelers seem to be in a good space to start nibbling at. Our top pick in two-wheelers remains Bajaj Auto.


Overall on the auto pack, do you think valuations are factoring in discount? You mentioned Bajaj Auto. Yesterday, there was a big brokerage upgrade on Eicher as well. What are these auto companies factoring in?Most of the auto companies are talking about high single digit to double digit de-growth for FY20 and flat to 5% kind of growth in FY21. Most of the analysts from the Street are factoring in those numbers as far as volumes are concerned. Bajaj seems to be in a better position because almost 40% of their numbers comes from exports and we believe that Bajaj will do a plus 5% kind of volume growth in FY21. 

I am pretty hopeful that given that there has been a good monsoon, the rural sales numbers should also start coming up. So, I remain pretty hopeful on two- wheeler space. Even Maruti should be bought on corrections. But at the moment, you can avoid CVs, that is my broad take on the whole auto pack. 


Earlier, one would focus on any private bank which is growing at 20% plus with a decent asset quality. Do you think within the private bank also there will be niches,select few banks which investors would want to buy at any price?Only the top two or three banks -- HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are the two banks which people are looking to buy at any price. Everything else will now become calibrated. In the largecap banks, there is Kotak and HDFC at the top and then the corporate banks like ICICI. Axis comes in between and then there is the third category of retail banks like RBL, IndusInd and all. Then there are banks with huge asset concerns, like YES Bank. PSUs like SBI and all should come into the second category of corporate banks. This is the way I would look at the whole banking space especially on the private side."

“We are adding auto to our portfolio,” Jinesh Gopani, head of equity for Axis Asset Management Co., overseeing about 570 billion rupees ($8 billion) of assets, said in an interview on Friday. “In another two years, the sector could come back.”



The S&P BSE Auto Index has declined 14 per cent so far this year. That’s the second-worst performance among 19 sector sub-indexes compiled by BSE Ltd. Passenger car sales plunged 33 per cent in September from a year earlier, down for an 11th consecutive month, industry data showed earlier this month.

Axis prides itself on investing for the longer term, and its biggest fund, Axis Long Term Equity Fund, offered a return of 20 per cent over the past year, beating 92 percentile of its peers. Over five years, the returns are 14 per cent, higher than 96 percentile.

The fund, with assets of 204 billion rupees under management, added shares in the nation’s largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Eicher Motors Ltd. and auto component maker Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd., data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“The idea is to pick leaders in large, mid and small caps from each sector and just be with them over their business cycle,” Gopani said. “We don’t want to be a rock star in one year and a pop star in another.”

Excerpts from the interview:



Sectors like financials, auto and consumption are classic GDP multiplier stories.
“If private capex picks up in next 12-18 months, capital goods sector will provide opportunities for earnings growth.”
“We are seeing too much flux in mid, small cap sectors. With system clean up on, it is not wise to diversify beyond a point as one doesn’t know who gets hit where.”
Holding on to sector leaders has helped performance; these companies have performed despite the slowdown in economic growth.
More bullish now than six months back; expect demand to start picking up from December as economic growth is near bottom."

55,2019-10-27,Eicher,"Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty lost more than half a per cent during the week ended October 25 as the market witnessed some selling pressure, mainly due to weakness on the IT counter amid mixed earnings and the Infosys whistleblower crisis.

The 30-share Sensex lost 240 points to settle the week at 39,058 against 39,298 on October 18, while the 50-share Nifty fell 78 points to 11,583.

“The market remained volatile in the holiday-shortened week. The Q2 earnings numbers showed hits and misses but expectation for an earnings improvement from next quarter based on corporate tax cuts held investor nerves steady. Concerns over the Infosys whistleblower crisis impacted the stock and the overall IT sector,” Geojit Financial Services said in a note.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the week.


State Bank of India
Shares of State Bank of India shares climbed 7.19 per cent on Friday after the company reported a nearly six-fold jump in consolidated net profit for September quarter. Consolidated profit zoomed to Rs 3,375.40 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 576.46 crore in the year-ago period. Shares of the PSU lender gained 4.43 per cent for the week.

Telecom index tanked
Sector-wise, BSE Telecom index retreated the most at 7 per cent during the week. It was followed by Teck (down 5.93 per cent), IT (down 5.69 per cent) and Metal (down 2 per cent) indices. However, BSE Healthcare index, Bankex and Consumer Durables and Realty indices gained between 0.88 and 2.08 per cent. The telecom counter took a hit after the Supreme Court allowed the Centre’s plea to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about Rs 92,000 crore from the telecom service providers.


Infy, Bharti Infra Nifty top losers
Bharti Infratel and Infosys tanked nearly 17 per cent each during the week. It was followed by Tata Motors (down 7.3 per cent), Adani Ports (down 5.36 per cent), IndusInd Bank (down 5.26 per cent) and GAIL (down 5 per cent).

57,2019-10-29,Eicher,"There is a case for a significant re-rating for Reliance Industries because historically we have seen that when Reliance demerges some of the entities, it creates a big win-win situation for all the stakeholders, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


In Tata Motors, are you in line with the view that perhaps the worst is over for the JLR business? Or would you still remain a little cautious?Typically what happens is when the sector with most of the weak players start reporting better than expected numbers, that is when people start getting a broader comfort. The entire auto pack, right from Maruti to Eicher to Hero Motors to Tata Motors was at the bottom of the pack and now we have seen that it has come out with a much better JLR margins at 13.8% plus there is going to be fund infusion. 

People will take a larger comfort in terms of what can really happen over the next few months. The revival may not be very sharp but still will draw comfort from positive news flow. As a house, our view on Tata Motors has been cautious and we would wait for a couple of months to look at the numbers and then form our overall view. But the Street has already sensed that we are in for a big revival for the auto numbers starting from 1st of November. 


ICICI Bank or Reliance are both heavyweights. What do you want to start with?We can start with Reliance because the entire exercise of demerging the Rel Jio and eventually the retail component of the business is going to be extremely positive. The market had its own concerns about the high gross debt and over how the company would be in a position to demerge value for unlocking the value for the shareholders. But now it seems that this entire exercise of setting up the subsidiary and moving the debt to that particular company is a precursor to the demerger exercise and given the strong performances coming through from Rel Jio in terms of subscriber addition and overall operating performance, market is getting excited about what could be the possible value. 

There is a case for a significant re-rating for Reliance Industries because historically we have seen that when Reliance demerges some of the entities, it creates a big win-win situation for all the stakeholders. 


Would you buy PSU stocks with the assumption that this time government is serious about divesting them and if yes, which ones?Post the tax cut proposal, the way in which the government has gone about announcing the divestment plan means that they are very serious about bridging the gap which is going to be there in terms of the fiscal deficit and the selection of the stocks at least for now looks to be quite good. Companies like BPCL or Container Corporation have a fair amount of strength on their core business and the balance sheets are in good place. 

The investors would be quite keen to get into some of these companies given the fact that the government was not proactive in the last two to three years as the entire economy was down and the PSU space was underperforming. Though we may all say that some of the stocks have really run up, but over the last three years, the appreciation is not that much. You would see re-rating for companies like BPCL, Container Corporation and a bunch of other good quality PSU stocks.

We are extremely positive on BPCL and expect a re-rating of the stock. Some of the other oil marketing companies like IOC or HPCL could also catch up. It is time to re-look at PSUs on a selective basis. 


What is your pecking order within the auto space?Starting from November, the auto numbers are going to be announced. There is going to be a delta change because in the past many months, we have seen a downtick in auto sales numbers and the market was keenly looking out for some kind of reversal. The reversal percentage may not be very significant but it means that we are going to see revival over a period of time and the market has already sensed it and we have already seen some stocks going up by about 25-30-40%. 

As a house, we have been cautious about the auto pack. We will have to look at monthly numbers and come up with our own update on that. I definitely think there is going to be a decent amount of turnaround in the auto sales over a period of time.


Can Nifty touch 12,000 before December-end?It could happen very easily because largecap stocks are in momentum and even stocks like Reliance, etc, we are getting positive news flow. 


Auto sales have increased but discounts were high. Consumer durable companies are indicating that sales have been decent but that is largely because of credit card offers. What does this mean?Typically, in the beginning of a revival cycle, that is the typical pattern. I do not think we should really worry too much about it. What we first need is that consumer should come back into the market and we want them to start purchasing. There may be credit card offers or discounts. Discounts are sometimes very manipulative and can be seen in old models where the inventories are high. All these discounts are being announced and finance schemes are always cleverly packaged. We should not really read too much into that. Are we going to see any kind of delta change in the auto numbers or consumer durables? Numbers have been pretty decent for the past few months. That is what matters and once you see those numbers come through, confidence would return both at the company level as well as at the market level."

64,2019-10-31,Eicher,"The surprise leaders or gainers which have taken the market up in last 20 days are metal stocks and some of the pharma and newer banking stocks, says Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Let us talk about OMCs because IOC is in focus today. What is the overall trend, keeping aside specific factors for BPCL?It has always been a challenge to monitor the OMC stocks, specifically the oil refining and marketing stocks on a quarterly basis. As an analyst and as a fund manager, expectations on refining margins, profitability, government subsidy receipt all are built in, but the numbers sometimes tend to digress quite significantly from the expectation, especially on a quarterly basis. So, it is very difficult to take a call on a quarterly basis. As I said, the medium term performance of all these public sector companies will depend on the government’s privatisation move.


The outlook for auto is quite dismal but Eicher, Bajaj and even Maruti stocks are up between 15-20% and 40% from the recent lows. What are the markets telling you?After the corporate tax cut announcement by the government in October, the market went down from 11,500 to 11,100 and then from here, almost one way they have risen to close to 11900 -- a 7-8% revival. Now this particular run of the market has been led by a completely new set of stocks. It is not the standard stocks which we used to have earlier -- HDFC, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and a few others. 

In fact, the surprise leaders or gainers which have taken the market in the last 7-8% rally in 20 days are metal stocks and surprisingly, some of the pharma and the newer banking stocks. Quite a big gainer has been Yes Bank and ICICI Bank and also SBI a little bit. 

Some of the pharma and FMCG names and of course auto have done well. Eicher has moved up 20% or so in the last 20 day and Maruti has gone up 10-12%. Tata Motors again was another surprise with 40-50% return in the last 20-25 days. The stock market movement tells us that smart money is looking at a recovery in the auto sector. Now, it is possible that it is a false signal and the stocks could come down again, but as of now, it is showing the recovery signs not only in OEMs but even auto ancillaries. 

There have been news reports of sales picking up in three-four days closer to the Diwali, although on a YoY basis, they could possibly continue to remain lower. I think all the negative news is in the price, is in the valuation. The EV threat which was looming very large, seems to have subsided for now and as a result, contra investors for a medium term wanting to take a position have got interested. 

Somebody who has been looking for valuation can take a yes call in the short term because of the rise that we have seen. For traders, it could be a negative surprise also.


Do you own any insurance stock? If yes, which one?Yes, we do own HDFC Life in some of our client portfolios. I personally own some of the life as well as general insurance companies from their IPOs about two to three years back. If you want to know the reason and the question on the valuation, then I can talk about that also.


Now that you have kept these stocks for two years, they are up 50% to 100%!Yes. There has been a pattern, especially the life insurance companies after the IPOs initially did not perform for one to one-and-a-half-year period. General insurance companies continue to perform. Last 6-9 months, nearly the whole sector has performed has got rerated. Thankfully, the sector has supported it by delivering the performance. If we look at the growth number of the insurance companies, both life as well as general insurance have continued to report growth rates. In terms of value of new business, in terms of APE, the growth is in the range of 20 to 40%. We still say that India is under penetrated in insurance. Despite LIC, GIC having been here for the last 50-60 years, the Indian market remained largely uncovered. That is where the private insurance companies have really been able to make a dent. They have been able to cover the market, increase the coverage and that is how they have been able to achieve these kinds of growth rates with profitability.

The important part is that it is not resulting in too much strain or drain on their financial if we look at a reasonably decent movement towards the improved financials which have already come and which will come over the years. Also let us keep in mind that this is a relatively new sector in the market for the last two-and-a-half to three years. There were no listed stocks available in the insurance sector and any new sector always has a novelty value and therefore attracts extra buying because the institutional as well as individual investors are yet to come to own the sector.


Now that government ownership in IOC or NTPC has come below 55%, do you think there is scope for these stocks to rally?Unfortunately, no. I will of course, divulge the details and you can possibly call my negative bias towards public sector stocks also, but let me try to justify it with some numbers. Leave aside the last one and a half or two years, the period in which the government has sold stake in public sector stocks through the CPSE ETFs and some other measures. Even if you put on a screen a five-year or a 10-year or since listing, NTPC chart for a long-term investor who bought it in the IPO till date, has not got any return in this stock except for the dividends which have come. 

That makes me question what is happening here and it is not that over the last so many years, the company has not grown in terms of top line, bottom line, profitability, cash generation and so many other things. It comes back to the fact that probably the ownership is something that is causing the problem. 

While the government ownership has comes down to below 55%, will the stock start getting rerated? Probably not. In my view they will get rerated when the management gets transferred, when the ownership gets transferred and free hand is given. 

There are only two examples of public sector stocks getting completely privatised. One was IPCL which was sold off to Reliance and subsequently merged into it and VSNL which was sold off to Tata with complete management control. In the case of VSNL, the land issues are lingering till today. 

Other than these examples, there has has always been stake sale and the ownership as well as management control and the authority to appoint senior management have continued to remain with the government. Until that changes. I do not think stake being brought down by the government is going to help. What is going to help in terms of rerating is management control being shifted to another party. That may not be panacea and there have been multiple cases of failures and the private sector has not come out with flying colours in all the cases. That is where I have slight discomfort with the public sector investing for the medium and long term investors. Some of these stocks are great dividend yield stories and quite a lot of them are very good trading bets, excellent for the traders who understand trading. 


Let us touch upon BHEL, given the kind of move we saw in that counter yesterday. What is the scope in some of these PSU names?Let us also keep in mind that this kind of sharp up move also came on the back of sharp down move as recently as a week to ten days ago. For the last three-four-five years, the stock has been falling continuously. In fact, if we look at its last five year’s performance, the stock is probably down some 80 odd per cent. So to that extent, for any long-term investor, it has not added anything. If some short term traders could take a position at those lower levels, they might have benefited but that happens very rarely. 

Stocks like these have to be seen in two perspectives – one on the basis of the financials and the fundamentals of the company; and two, on the basis of news flow and expected development. 

As you rightly said, there is a lot of talk about divestment. The public sector stocks are going up because this time market is hoping for divestment leading to privatisation, specifically with at least one or two few stocks. 

Government stake being sold from one public sector company to the other like in case of HPCL and ONG has happened, does not add anything. It further leads to deterioration and working of both the public sector companies. 

If the government is really able to take the idea of privatisation forward, then we will see the re-rating of the public sector space but within that again, after an initial euphoria gets over, focus will be only on those 1-3 specific names where the actual privatisation takes place. As of now, I do not think financials or fundamentals or results are something which are playing on these stocks. It is the development of privatisation that has to be watched."
65,2019-10-31,Eicher,"Auto stocks were in a fast lane in October series, as nearly all of the ones that trade in the futures and options (F&O) segment recorded solid gains during the series. Tata Motors was the biggest gainer, rising 41 per cent, while its DVR followed with 38 per cent gains.

Tata Motors last week delivered better-than-expected numbers for September quarter, sending the stock soaring. Kotak Institutional Equities raised fair value of the stock to Rs 200 from Rs 190, retaining a ‘buy’ recommendation. CLSA upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ after almost three years of 'sell' rating. The brokerage raised its target to Rs 190 from Rs 120.

Among other automakers, Eicher Motors (up 26 per cent), Maruti Suzuki (up 10 per cent) and Motherson Sumi Systems (up 12 per cent) were other major gainers. Hero MotoCorps was the only loser in the series, sliding 2.8 per cent.



“After the gloom-doom scenario, recovery started as credit supply came back in the system. Sales recovery is getting visible. A large part of the problem was credit supply,” said Vikas Khemani, Founder of Carnelian Capital Advisors. He is positive on auto stocks for the short term.

AK Prabhakar, Head of Research at IDBI Capital, however, doesn’t attach much importance to this rally. “The auto sector is not something I am gung-ho about. After five years of rally, auto started to correct. So it will have some recovery here and there, but I will not attach much importance to it at this point. The rally is done. So, the upside is limited. I will not buy auto at current levels, but I will not sell either,” he said.

Nifty Auto index rallied 10 per cent in the October series. In comparison, Nifty edged merely 2.35 per cent and 30-share Sensex added 2.72 per cent.

“October series has by far seen some 3-odd percentage gains. If we add September gains, we are already up around 9-odd per cent in last two months. In November, we expect the market to consolidate. It is less likely to show any runaway move. We will see the market trade with some positive bias, but broadly speaking, it is more likely to consolidate in a broad range,” said Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services.

Vaishnav expects auto stocks to be resilient going forward. “They may not move as sharply as they did in October series, but we will still see some relative outperformance,” he said.

Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak Securities, feels the market will consolidate going ahead. “Nifty remains in a structural uptrend and is expected to test 12,200-12,300 levels in the next few weeks. Since we witnessed a rally in the recent past, some consolidation is expected in the 11,650-11,950 range. Accumulation on dips is advisable, as we await the next momentum trade to get triggered. Metals and select banking stocks traded with a positive bias. Selective buying is advised in the midcap space,” he said.

As many as 98 stocks that trade in the F&O segment gained in October series. Apart from Tata Motors, Adani Enterprises (up 28 per cent), NMDC (22 per cent), GMR Infra (21.5 per cent) and Tata Elxsi (20 per cent) were among 29 F&O stocks that gained in double digits in October series.

Among the biggest losers were Century Textiles (down 55 per cent), Dish TV (49 per cent), Indiabulls Housing (48 per cent), Bharti Infratel (29 per cent) and Vodafone Idea (27 per cent). In total, 61 F&O stocks are on course to end the October series in the red.

Interestingly, a number of private bank stocks have given negative returns, with RBL Bank and IndusInd Bank down 25 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. Federal Bank (down 12 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (down 3 per cent) were also among losers. YES Bank, on the other hand, was the biggest gainer among F&O banking stocks, up 11 per cent. Nifty Bank was flat during the period.

Khemani said subdued performance from select banks was due to bank-specific issues. He said there were some short-term trade in PSU banks, but otherwise he prefers private banks.

Prabhakar is positive on bank stocks. “I like ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and SBI. I will be a buyer on the bank counter. They are the major beneficiaries of the new tax regime, and most of the companies have provided for that. From next quarter onwards, the new tax rate will benefit them,” he said."
66,2019-10-31,Eicher,"We are at the cusp of a huge rally where growth capital and risk capital both would be back in India, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Your call is playing out very well. What do you see the road from here on for the markets?I was one of the few who was telling buy the fear and these 12 weeks will see a huge upside over a period of time. I am being proved correct. Sensex has hit a new high and it is just a matter of time that Nifty goes to a new high. But that is not the key. The key is participation and buying the fear.

During this downturn, the government was trying to do what they could and we saw stock prices at decimated values. I still think the midcaps are extremely attractive. If you have a longer term view, then there is no holds barred. Whether the index has moved or not, you should be looking to invest.
We are in a very sweet spot now, given our macros are starting to improve and given the government initiative on corporate tax and the proposed strategic disinvestments. The next 18 months belong to India. 

I also feel that there will be a huge global rally from January 2020 which will set the cat amongst the pigeons. It is a good time to start buying stocks. Two months back, the worst sector was auto. From Rs 5,500, Maruti is now at Rs 7,700. Eicher Motor has gone up from Rs 16,000 to Rs 22,500-23,000. That tells you how much of pessimism was built into it and how this festive season and certain government initiatives have helped shore up a lot of value.


 In the last six months, the biggest area of outperformance is banks, financials and Reliance Industries. What are your thoughts on these two spaces? 
Markets are forward looking. They price in the worst and move ahead. Now you are talking of a huge base effect from where earnings could be flat for a quarter or so. But the impetus of Rs 1.5 lakh crore, the strategic disinvestment, all will make a lot of pillars for a large part of the broader market to outperform. 

We are in an interest rate scenario where rates are at four-year lows and here, the fiasco of certain NBFCs have seen mistrust and credit withdrawing. Once that starts to expand, like we saw this festive season, we will be headed for very good times. 

I am slightly more optimistic than most and I can actually stick my neck out that it is not going to be the same 20 stocks which will lead the index. Maybe, it is going to be the broader market of thousands of stocks or sectors where we will see a huge uptick. 

Just to tell you, YES Bank from Rs 30 is up to Rs 60 and so on. PSUs are really the jewels in the crown, if one of the strategic disinvestments happens, you will have to ignore the rhetoric and put your money where your mouth is. This is the time for huge money to be made. Two, three times is what I can see select midcap stocks do over the next two years. Like I said, you will never get the perfect storm where earnings and macros match the market. If those things were matching, we would have been at 14000. 

So I think that India is in a sweet spot and the two years from here on, the equity market looks extremely positive for me.


What are your thoughts on YES Bank?Well that should allay a lot of fears that banks are going to close down. I think that tier-1, tier-2 capital is okay and what was needed was growth capital. In a sinking ship, it is the rats are that run first. It is now the real bellwethers who are holding it and this is an incredible brand and franchise which you have. I do not rule out Rs 85 where the QIP took place coming back and if you are a patient investor, then these are times when you can make real pickings. 

I have five banks under my coverage which I am tracking very actively at these prices. RBL would fit the bill perfectly along with a DCB Bank, Federal Bank, PNB and Bank of Baroda. I think this is just the starting of a cusp of a huge rally where growth capital and risk capital both would be back in India in a huge hurry."

IndianOil slipsThe refining and oil marketing stock continued its downward journey, falling 2.83 per cent to Rs 142.65. It reported a disappointing numbers for September quarter as profit tanked 83 per cent. However, most global brokerages are bullish on the stock and have ‘buy’ ratings.

Among IT stocks, Just Dial (down 5.3 per cent) and TCS (down 2.76 per cent) were the major drags. Nifty It shed 0.5 per cent to 15,483.


Most active stocksYES Bank was the most active stock on NSE in terms of value. It was followed by Zee Entertainment, SBI, Indiabulls Housing Finance and IndusInd Bank. In terms of volume, Vodafone Idea was the most traded security on NSE. YES Bank, Dish TV, Zee Entertainment and Indiabulls Housing Finance completed the top five list.

When a stock crosses above 50-EMA, it is usually considered a bullish signal and vice versa."
1,2019-11-04,Eicher,"Cool HeadTVS Group scion Sudarshan Venu is emerging as a corporate leader in his own right, having helped broker a peace deal between the conglomerate and Bajaj Auto. The son of illustrious parents—TVS Motor chairman Venu Srinivasan and Tafe chairman Mallika Srinivasan—played a pivotal role for the Chennai-based group in resolving the legal wrangle that’s more than a decade old. Those who observed him at close quarters say Sudarshan Venu’s maturity and ability to negotiate with a cool head helped. Both companies can now concentrate on the business of making vehicles, a welcome development for investors in the face of various existential threats.


Billionaires and BashesYou thought only Mumbai parties full Bollywood-style with the Bachchans and the Ambanis throwing must-attend bashes for the jet set? Well the Hindujas of London would be quite offended if you told them that. GP’s annual soiree was equally impressive with a guest list that boasted of heavyweights from business, glamour and politics. Where else would you rub shoulders with LN Mittal and Karan Billimoria along with NRI representatives in parliament Jitesh Gadhia and Raj Loomba among others. And why would Delhi be left behind in the Diwali party stakes? From Ajay Bijli to the Lals of Eicher and Kashmir royals Vikramaditya and Chitrangada Singh, the list of standout Diwali bashes was long. And you were moaning about pollution?


Golden GuardWhen the builders of Bombay are hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons, this little nugget of information dropped.

Apparently, a realty tycoon has been paying his Israeli bodyguard an eight-figure sum, surpassing even the CFO’s salary. Now that he’s been quizzed by the authorities, we wonder if the exercise was worth all the zeroes attached.


Team TransferThe best way to keep talent together is to entice them with stock options. But what happens when a stock sale doesn’t take place? We hear a leading first-generation energy entrepreneur is facing an exodus as his top team is leaving to join a new venture backed by two wealthy investors. Such a move might just take the wind out of the company’s sails, at least for now.


Transient TelecomsStock broker Shankar Sharma is known for telling it like it is. So when he took to social media to applaud the foresight of Li Kashing for reading the tea leaves early on and exiting the India telecom market at its height, many asked him if he saw a duopoly in the making and the chances of cartelisation.

Shankar said he actually sees a one-company cartel.


Power GamesThe well heeled of Mumbai were surprised to get a teaser from brokers with a golden investment opportunity. A blue chip NBFC was eyeing a private placement after listing plans got a jolt. But there was a rider — only those who supported the incumbent chairman staying five more years would get a buy-in. That would keep the voluble top boss in play for a longer tenure, much to the chagrin of his peers, exmentors and colleagues.


Dinner in the DesertOther than the jaw-dropping Aramco IPO splash, what do you think was the highlight at the recent Davos in the Desert event?

Masayoshi Son’s speech on AI to an empty auditorium or the political pow-wows with the various heads of states and governments, including our own? Neither, as per the chatter of the delegates to Riyadh, but a side event that seems to have got everyone guessing. It seems MBS hosted MDA for a private dinner. The crown prince and the oil-to-telecoms titan are both tech geeks, so they had a lot to bond over."

3,2019-11-04,Eicher,"In case there is a lot of momentum based on sentiments and liquidity, one should be careful because this is a time where even some of those which are not going to benefit from some of the fundamental drivers, will likely move up, says Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The economy is incrementally improving and liquidity has improved substantially. What does this mean for long-term investors because while the sentiment has improved the economy is not going to get well in a hurry. Are stocks running ahead of themselves once again?I agree with some of your observations. Sentiments have improved and the liquidity has also improved post the tax rate cut announcements. Having said that, the fundamentals will take time to start showing better numbers. It is going to be a consolidation phase. In case there is a lot of momentum based on sentiments and liquidity, one should be careful because this is a time where even some of those which are not going to benefit from some of the fundamental drivers, will likely move up. One needs to be cautious that it will take time for fundamentals to improve and hence look at it as more of an investment phase, rather than trying to take more risk and look for short-term gains.


Markets are no longer beaten down and bombed out, good individual stocks like Maruti or Eicher are up 35% to 40% from the recent lows. Do you think markets are now fully priced and any incremental uptick will only be function of data and economic evidence rather than hope, hype, liquidity or momentum?I would tend to agree on those for at least the largecap basket. But mid and smallcap basket is clearly giving more relative valuation comfort and that is where you will end up making more money than the largecap over the medium to long term. We have been suggesting that investors should increase a little bit of allocation towards mid and smallcap stocks and even within our portfolios, wherever the investment mandate allows, we have been buying mid and smallcap stocks across sectors. 

It is not that a particular theme or a particular sector is doing well in the midcap basket but there are companies across sectors, where the fundamentals have been steady and also we have seen a good valuation correction over the last two years. That is where one needs to increase allocation to.


What is the takeaway from autos because the sales trajectory is one story but what the stocks have done and the way they have lifted off from their low is a completely different story?If you look at the sales, the wholesale sales have been slightly better or lower than already subdued expectations across the street. But what is hurting is the kind of retail sales numbers that we have seen across segments which shows that inventory in the pipeline or inventory at the distribution level is going to be a lot lesser, post the festive season which augurs well for the industry. 

Having said that, most of these stocks have already seen a sharp pullback from the lower levels that we had witnessed a couple of months back. To that extent, one has to be cautious in terms of at what valuations some of these stocks are trading and whether the improvement in retail sales numbers that we saw will continue into the next few quarters or not. We would rather be more positive on the two-wheelers than commercial vehicles or passenger vehicles at this point of time because of the relative valuation comfort.


As an investor would you be tempted to buy telecom? The only name there is Bharti but without getting into Bharti specifically, you cannot have a situation where the Indian telecom sector will be dominated by just one player. The government will never allow monopoly. If that is the case, then the incumbent players either would be given some dole-out or benefits so that they can survive and revive their balance sheets. If you think that the telecom sector in India will not be a monopoly, then that means good news is coming for incumbents. Would you use that logic to buy into telecom stocks?
 Harsha Upadhyaya: As you said, this may be a question of survival for some of the players and hence there may be some dole-outs but it does not mean that they are going to earn a lot more than their cost of capital on a sustained basis. Whether it is a telecom player or any other business, only if the companies on a sustainable basis are going to earn more than the cost of capital, then we will evaluate it, but otherwise we will let it go.


When will the overhang for some of the NBFCs get lifted? Will it be a resolution of DHFL, Yes Bank or Piramal kind of issues or will NBFCs remain under pressure? Would 2-4 NBFCs do well but rest look weak?The leaders will continue to do well. It has been the best of both worlds for them; they have got ample liquidity and also they have got benefit of lower interest rate at this point of time. Also in terms of the growth trajectory, the entire runway is empty and they can cash in on that. For the rest of the NBFC pack, it is going to be a slow grind. They need either some large asset sale or some a strategic investor coming and putting in more money. 

Along with that, we also need to see a reduced number of negative news flow for the sector. Maybe over the next couple of quarters, the negative news flow that we have been seeing for the last one year will start to reduce and that should give a little more confidence to everybody, including investors and the NBFC themselves.


What is the right way to look at the surge in insurance companies? Is it a new sector which has got created and everyone is drawn to it or is there merit in buying life and non-life companies both? Do you own insurance companies?We do own insurance companies. At a point of time where some of the lending businesses have got completed disrupted to make up for the weight of financials in the overall portfolio, a lot of investors have moved towards insurance -- be it life or nonlife. From a penetration perspective, there is no debate over what kind of growth trajectory can be there for some of these companies. 

The valuations have been high, given the fact that some of the money that was getting invested into NBFCs or some of the PSU banks, has moved towards these companies. One needs to be a little cautious about the valuations, but otherwise, these are very good businesses to be invested into.


What has been your reading of the earnings so far and what has stood out for you?Clearly, this quarter earnings have been slightly better than expected. Mostly it has been because of the tax rate cut impact that we have seen across many of the companies. Barring that, the business performance has not really improved that much. I think it is status quo for the business performance, we will have to wait and see how that unfolds over the next couple of quarters but clearly the tax rate cut has given a boost to earnings in many companies.


What about metals, given the kind of spark that we are starting to see across the board there? A little bit of momentum is building up. Would you look at some of these names at lower levels as you feel they have bottomed out?We have bought into some select metal names in the recent past. While the fundamental issues will take time to resolve, we thought that the valuations have more or less discounted some of those negatives. And from that perspective, we have built some small position in metals. We will continue to hold on to that. 

Any recovery in price will definitely improve the stock performance going forward. At this point of time, at least the domestic demand has been quite steady. We have been facing issues in terms of the prices which are lead by global factors for most metals which have been on the downtrend but once that starts to stabilise I think the stock performance can be much better. 


The only challenge is that everybody has gone wrong is in their view on the economic recovery. Recovery was supposed to happen in 2016 or 2017, where metals, cement, industrials, cyclicals were supposed to make a comeback. That got delayed. What convinces you that the cycle will turn at the capex level and which will stroke the demand for steel and cement? I am assuming you would be betting on a recovery and that’s why you are buying metals?The recent demand numbers for steel and cement sectors, leaving out the last couple of quarters, have been really steady. There has been growth in domestic demand for both these segments and that is on the back of lacklustre capex numbers. The lacklustre investment cycle has already impacted some of these sectors in terms of the demand.

What we are envisaging going forward is that private capex should also come up, though not immediately. Till the capacity utilisation levels move towards 80% which may take 24 to 36 months, there is enough economic activity in the country backed by government capex and that is going to drive some of those demand numbers for core sectors in our opinion.


When we look at broader markets, newer themes as well as insurance is something that we have talked about. Niche themes like chemicals and other financial names in the midcap basket that are standing out what would be some of the newer themes that you would be looking at?We have invested quite a bit of portfolio corpus into chemicals over the last year or so and continue to remain very positive in this space, It is one of those industry segments where the ongoing US-China trade dispute is going to benefit from a longer term perspective. 

There are lots of multinational chemical companies which are sourcing intermediately from China alone at this point of time. They have clearly identified this risk and have started to move out of China in a meaningful way, If India can capture some of that and which we believe will happen in the chemical space, that will be a large export-oriented growth that will come into the sector and as of now they are all running at full capacity utilisation rates. Demand has been fairly strong and we continue to see similar trend going forward even in the medium to long term for this sector.


Apart from global risks, what could go wrong? What do you think could go wrong in assumptions of economic recovery, demand, capex because when you are buying stocks?Clearly valuation is one risk which is a very dominant factor. In case of largecaps, at least at this point of time and otherwise also, if there is pressure on our fiscal situation coming from say crude oil, that is going to put a lot of questions marks in terms of the government’s ability to kick-start economic activity or continuation of economic activity which means that you will have to wait for the recovery that we have all been waiting for the last couple of years. Furthermore, that is something that is not priced in at this point of time because crude oil has been hovering in a narrow range and has been quite benign."

6,2019-11-05,Eicher,"Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, has a buy on Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Hero and Bajaj Auto among the two-wheelers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Markets maybe going higher but institutional investors want to sell. What is happening?It is a perfect storm. The largest selling was by the foreign institutions at 10,700. We are at new highs and now they have turned buyers and it is routine that mutual funds will go for occasional profit, but the real money is that you had to bell the cat when fear was at its highest and generally the adage holds. FIIs generally sell low and buy high. That is the nature of the beast. So, flows will only get stronger. There is some consolidation at 12,000 but I am very optimistic now on the broader market. It is just a matter of time that we get to new highs today or tomorrow and we start to overcome the hump of 12,000. 

Let us talk of 2020 and that is where the real impetus lies. Midcaps will be the star, like in 2017. Flows is a matter of just one or two days’ aberration. Like I said, the largest selling took place close to 10,700 and now the largest buying will come closer to 11,700 and beyond. 


Why do you say that FIIs always sell low and buy high? In last 15-20 years, FIIs have only been buying and large part of the free floating blue chip stocks is actually owned by foreign institutional investors. Best performing stocks like Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Infosys, HDFC Limited have been owned by FIIs.Yes, that's the way it works. What about the likes of YES Bank and DHFL and Indiabulls? They are also very well owned by FIIs. I am not challenging the nature of the animal. It is the way the fund flows flow. Take out the data and you will see FII selling is maximum at a time when the markets have bottomed and generally at a high they are buying. I am not challenging their consistency. 

ETF flows are generally traders of an uptick and downtick. So all I am saying is that the smart money has made money but we were one of the few who were recommending and now at 12,000 there will be some occasional profit booking by mutual funds but the undertone remains, equities are in a very-very strong bull market and that is now global case. I am extremely positive with an 18-month view. Short term, the earnings and some development on macros will play a little bit of a dampener over here. 


M&M is recalling a batch of XUV300 units to fix faulty suspension components. Sales figures were anyway not encouraging. In any case, with the transition going forward to BS-VI, etc, diesel is going to be phased out. We have had some positive commentary coming in from the management.I would trust the management, one of the oldest automakers which has kept its identity right from the original Sensex. In M&M, all declines are buying opportunity. Their tractor sale numbers have beaten estimate and there is no BS-IV to BS-VI in tractors. 

So, this small recall will give you an opportunity to buy the stock. I think it is just an aberration. We are very optimistic on M&M and select autos now. The best thing is that the worst performing sector in the last two months has seen the best gains. Maruti from Rs 5,500 has touched Rs 7,700 and Eicher has risen from Rs 16,000 to Rs 23,000. Let the diehard pessimists wait for declines. We still think autos will see a huge uptick in 2020 and we are not investing with a three-month view. I have a buy on Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Maruti, Eicher Motors and among the two-wheelers it is Hero and Bajaj Auto.


A lot of market men now seem to be sounding off warning signals and how some of these high PE quality names may not give you as much return in the next decade or so. Would you say there is reason to worry about the high PE multiple stocks, that what they have done in the last five years may not be replicated going forward?

You have a positive view on auto going forward in 2020, while rating agencies are mostly behind the curb. Moody’s has cut Motherson Sumi outlook to negative. How would you position yourself amongst auto ancillaries?We have been positive on Motherson when it was in that double digit and around 100 levels. We still think they will garner more market share in the European business. Their China foray will do well but it would be Exide, Motherson and Apollo Tyre. Now as a caveat, these stocks have moved 25% from where we have been calling to buy these stocks. So take it with a pinch of salt. They have already moved up. You will look for decline but please do a SIP for the next three months. You will be handsomely rewarded in early 2020. 

As for Motherson Sumi, we think credit is going to expand stronger and they do not seem to have too much leverage. It is a very pertinent brand and they have reduced their overall dependence on the Volkswagen model and spread their basket well. This should relatively be a much better performer in the near future.


YES Bank has got binding bids of $1.2 billion and some more interest has come from a clutch of investors and family offices.It appears the risk of survival for YES Bank is over. Would you chance your arm and would you buy YES Bank at current levels of 65-66?Well it is definitely a contrarian trade. The who’s who of foreign institutional investors owned this stock at Rs 300 plus and now the who’s who is bearish at Rs 50. There is a fair chance that by January, you could see at least triple digit on this stock. The worst seems to be over. How fast they raise money is a matter of time. 

They have got a binding bid till the end of this month, but I can see five other banks. Earlier, I had suggested five midcap banks where I see a lot of value the likes of Federal, DCB, IDFC First, PNB and Bank of Baroda. If you took those five, there is more visibility, there is more transparency and there are no issues of backlog. I would suggest make a basket of stocks and include YES Bank if you are a little bit of risk taker. But please include the other five banks where the risk reward is very favourable for at least a 30% to 40% upside by next Diwali.


What is the size of the universe you are bullish on?I mentioned those five banks. Largecaps like GAIL, ITC, IndusInd, Hero MotoCorp and L&T seem very well poised. I am also extremely positive on both Lupin and Sun in the pharma space. I think that is a dark horse. And if I want to put my money on some riskier assets, it is going to be the award of the L1 contracts now, there is a 7.5 lakh infrastructure contracts which are going to go, out of which 1.5 lakh goes onstream now which will include the likes of Dilip Buildcon, NBCC, NCC where inherently order inflows will start now. Execution will be a matter of time and we know the past because of the elections and so on there has been a hiatus on government order inflows and so on so that should be a very good traction play where valuations are extremely comforting over here."

8,2019-11-05,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Stocks with little say in benchmark Nifty saw strong buying interest from mutual funds (MFs) in September quarter, as the hunt for value intensified on Dalal Street.

These DIIs hiked stakes in 17 Nifty companies by at least 100 basis points this past quarter, even when 14 of these stocks have failed to match the index’s 10 per cent return so far in Calendar 2019. These stocks mostly included Nifty non-heavyweights. 

This suggests fund managers are expecting non-performing largecaps to play catchup from here on as index heavyweights become crowded trades.

As many as 21 Nifty stocks are down so far this year. And data shows 20 of them have not much say in Nifty movement. In contrast, only three index heavyweights – RIL, TCS and HDFC Bank – have added half of the rise in Nifty market capitalisation this year. This might have made the non-performers look attractive.

“If you exclude the top 10 Nifty heavyweights, other index constituents have been a drag this year. Post corporate tax cuts, a lot of funds are looking to create alpha by investing in index non-heavyweights and non-index stocks,” said Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Domestic fund managers looked less sanguine about the basket of next-50 stocks (Nifty Next 50). Midcaps, too, failed to attract much mutual fund buying during the quarter.

Sunil Jain of Nirmal Bang Securities said MF money has been chasing only a few largecap stocks that are deemed safe bets. “But initial signs suggest risk appetite is coming back. If it sustains for the next couple of months, we may see fresh money going into index non-heavyweights and even into select midcaps,” Jain said.

Data showed MFs increased stake in Ultratech Cement by 400 basis points in Q2 to 8.1 per cent from 4.1 per cent even while the stock has risen just 4 per cent year to date.

The stock is not among the Nifty heavyweights that comprised HDFC Bank (11.25 per cent), Reliance Industries (9.68 per cent), HDFC (7.23 per cent), Infosys (6.26 per cent) and ICICI Bank (5.94 per cent). Top 10 Nifty stocks accounted for 61 per cent of Nifty weight as of September 30.

In IndusInd Bank, another minnow in Nifty, mutual fund holding jumped to 12.6 per cent at the end of second quarter from 9.2 per cent at the end of first. This stock is down 17 per cent for so far in Calendar 2019.

YES Bank saw MF stake rise to 9.3 per cent from 6.6 per cent, sequentially. This stock is down 61 per cent year to date. Coal India, NTPC, Cipla, Eicher Motors, GAIL and Dr Reddy’s Labs are a few other stocks which have delivered negative returns and yet mutual funds have raised their stakes in it by 100-200 basis points.

Meanwhile, BPCL has seen an increase in MF holdings by 250 basis points and Axis Bank by 240 basis points. The two stocks are up 45 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, so far this year.

In the case of Nifty Next 50, which comprises the next 50 largecaps after Nifty constituents, only five stocks saw MF holding go up by more than 100 basis points during the quarter.

The stocks included ICICI Lombard General Insurance (up 410 bps QoQ), HPCL (200 bps), Power Finance Corporation (170 bps), Motherson Sumi Systems (160 bps) and Avenue Supermarts (100 bps).

In the case of 100 Nifty Midcap stocks, only 14 saw over 1 percentage points rise in MF holding.

Mahanagar Gas, LIC Housing Finance, Alkem Laboratories, The Federal Bank, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, TVS Motor Company, Oil India and Jubilant FoodWorks were a few of them that saw MF holding rise by 180-420 bps during the quarter gone by."
9,2019-11-05,Eicher,"Sunil Singhania, Founder, Abakkus Asset Manager LLP in conversation with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW on markets and more. The combined profit of HUL and Nestle is about Rs 7,600 crore and their current market cap is about Rs 6 lakh crore. For that money, you are getting the entire steel, metal and cement sectors, whose combined profit is Rs 70,000 crore plus, says Singhania. Excerpts:


Why are markets rallying despite poor economic data?We have seen a very challenging environment for both the economy as well as liquidity. However, one thing which has changed is there is now a confidence that the government means business. Whether it is the FDI tweaks, the big corporate tax rate cut and other significant announcements, it gives confidence that the government will do whatever is needed to bring the economy back on track. 

There have been major announcements like strategic sale in PSUs where there have been multiple advertisements inviting consultants and bids for a few PSUs. There has been a confidence that there is a move towards pushing whatever it takes to bring the economy back on track and it has coincided with a fairly robust international environment. If you see, most of the global markets are at 52-week highs. The year-to-date returns for Dow, NASDAQ, the German index and for some of the other Brazilian index are all giving 25%-27% year-to-date returns. That has also helped the market. 

The most important thing is the spate of negative news flows which you were seeing continuously, has got settled. In fact, we are now seeing news flows about resolution in some of the suspect companies. All in all, a feel-good factor is coming back into the markets to some extent.


From its recent August lows, the BSE500 is up about 12%. Eicher Motors, Maruti, Chola are up 30% to 40%. Are markets already pricing in, not an incremental recovery but a good recovery? Are markets running ahead of themselves?It is not fair to take a point-to-point return and say that from the lows, the stocks have moved up this much. But it has to some extent been a beta trade, particularly over the last two-three weeks. Investors who had not been invested, suddenly started to see the merits in investing and jumped into companies which had fallen a lot. 

I would say, selectively some companies have warranted a price rise and we have to be careful but in a lot of other companies, the prices had fallen disproportionately low, compared to their valuations. We continue to be quite optimistic on this space.


Your big call is your firm belief that quality companies will give no low or negative returns for the next five to 10 years. What you are saying is that there is a bubble in the market and it is about to get pricked?I will just put a disclaimer. It is not that all quality stocks will have this or that the overall market is in a bubble, what we are trying to say is that it makes sense to have quality stocks in your portfolio. These are companies which have high ROEs but as all of us have been taught and as it has been proven in the world of investing, ultimately a good stock is a stock which will give you returns. It is not a company which is the best but which might not give you returns.

Also, how do you classify whether a stock is good or not? There are various methodologies to it. You can give a premium to quality but that premium cannot be an infinite premium. A company which can trade at 30 PE, starts to trade at 40 and then 50 and then 60 and then 70! There has to be some place, where you start to say that now you have reached a scenario, a valuation metrics from where you cannot make returns. This report is just highlighting those few stocks where PEs have moved up like 70-80 times on a trailing basis and we are just trying to use various analysis tools to justify that if they continue to grow at the rates which they have grown over the last 5-10 years, it is going to be very tough to make any money. If you have a view that some of these companies might grow really fast, then it is a separate thing, but if they continue to grow at the same rate, then it is going to be very tough to make money in this.


We are in a very differentiated global environment. Interest rates are low, growth is not very great, the hunt for yield is very high. What makes you convinced that the trend will not extend for another two-three years?The risk will always be there, I would again go back for people who have been investing in the equity markets in may be two-three decades. We have had many such instances even during the dot-com bubble. The bubble lasted for may be a year or two and Warren Buffett very publicly said that he did not understand it and he did underperform for two-three years. 

The same thing happened in the power and infra side in India where from 2006 to 2008, you are almost in a bubble territory, where the moment you announced the power plant, your market cap is to go up by a couple of billion dollars. Recently, we had this kind of phenomena even in the pharma sector in 2016, where companies targeted to trade at 40-50 PE multiples on a forward basis. We have seen what has happened and so these risks will always be there. 

As an investor what we are basically looking at is whether you have reached a stage where the risk reward is definitely not in your favour. Now you can go wrong for three months, six months, one year... that can always happen because there are a lot of factors other than fundamentals which drive equity prices. These could be technical factors, presence of flows and so on. The risk is always there and the idea of the study is to make people aware that you have to keep this in the back of your mind, before you take a big call.


One of the reasons why some of these staples or engineering companies or the quality companies have done well is because growth has been very volatile for those who made a case of economic recovery in 2015-16-17-18 even 2019 and got it wrong. High frequency data indicates that the economy is not going to revive in a hurry. If the economy is not supportive, shouldn’t one be better off buying a 15% compounder rather than buying a multibagger?There are two-three aspects to it; one is any equity investor who has to be optimistic and positive about the economy. If the view is that the economy is not going to come back to a 6-7-8% growth rate, than anyway India’s PE multiple will deflate. 

Second, you talked about these companies growing at 15% plus very consistently but that is exactly where the surprise is. If you go back the last nine years where the nominal GDP growth in India has been 13% because inflation was almost 6-7%, these companies have grown below the nominal GDP growth rate. 

Now with inflation at 3%, it is very hard to believe that the nominal GDP growth in India over the next 5-10 years is going to be over 10%. In that kind of a scenario, these companies are logically not going to grow higher than the nominal GDP growth. Some companies might do it but as a basket it looks very tough. 

Third, we believe the economy will rebound. It might take two-three months, but we are very optimistic that the economy should come back on its growth trail and once that happens, other companies and sectors will start to demonstrate some stable and faster growth. This is where the investors would start to move from some defensives to companies which are growing faster. This happens all the time in markets.

The most important thing is we have done an analysis globally and there have been no instances in the world where so many companies have traded at more than 50 PE for more than five years. In the US, over the last 15 years there have been only three companies which have traded more than 50 times PE for more than five years and these are companies like Amazon and some of biochem companies. It looks very tough that this outperformance can continue for a long, long time. 


I was reading a report from Howard Marks a couple of days ago and he said that bubbles happen in quality companies also. In the 1960s and 1970s, US blue chip stocks reached a disproportionate territory where they did not make money. It is not that just because it is a quality business, it will always make money for investors.If that would have been the case, portfolio managers would not be needed. You just buy the top 10 best quality companies and just forget about it. I think it works, but even in India, we get carried away by a few of these companies but there have been multiple examples where some of these quality names have disappointed big time. 

The largest pharma company Sun Pharma, from 2016 till now, is down 60%. There have been other companies across sectors — on the FMCG side and also companies like Schneider and Alstom on the engineering side. There have been FMCG companies where the moment you have two-three quarters of slowdown, you had the massive pull-down as far as prices were concerned. In auto the same thing has happened. So once the growth comes, you start to extrapolate that this is going to be there forever and in a lot of these companies, you have one or two or three quarters of disappointment. That is when the investor start to realise that you are paying too high a premium for so called faster growth.

We have understood where the valuations are. Now let us understand what is available. According to your 
analysis, the combined profit of HUL and Nestle is available. The peak profit is about Rs 7,600 crore. The current market cap is about Rs 6 lakh crore. In Rs 6 lakh crore, currently you are getting the entire steel, metal the cement sectors. The combined profit for the metal, cement and steel sectors was Rs 70,000 crore plus. What are you indicating here?It is just to reflect that what can you buy. If Hindustan Lever were to stop operations in India, you would have to shift to some other soaps or some other detergents or some other shampoos but it is not going to be the end of life. But for one Hindustan Lever, you are able to buy almost the entire core sector in India."
13,2019-11-06,Eicher,"The momentum is coming because the worst is getting over for many of the companies and especially the good quality companies, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Prices have come back, but the economy is not yet back. Are markets running ahead of themselves?What we are witnessing is the phenomena of what is classically termed as the worst is over as far as the markets are concerned. That means, even if the economy is painting a little bleak picture or even if some of the corporate earnings are missing their estimates (volume numbers of automobiles are still de-growing and cement is still not so good), the markets are saying that a suitable base has been formed in terms of earnings and in terms of profitability. The market starts moving up, saying the worst is over. That is what we are classically witnessing right now. We are reaching back to the all- time highs. In fact, Sensex has already crossed the all-time high of the recent months. We believe that the worst is over for most of the companies. There will be good growth ahead for a lot of them.


Have you had a chance to look at Cipla earnings? The stock has cooled off but it was a decent set of numbers. We have been looking at a whole host of pharma names on the back of earnings today.I would not look at the Cipla numbers but some of the pharma companies have reported strong numbers and this is coming on the back of the fact that we have the corporate rate reduction flowing in at the net profit level, not necessarily the PBT level. But for many of the pharma companies, the domestic environment has been relatively stronger and somewhere the US market is depending on which therapeuticals side you are in. It is a mixed bag. Some are doing well, some are not, but the common theme is that most of the pharma companies have enjoyed the tax benefit in full and that is visible in the way, some of the stocks have moved up.


Eicher is up 30%, Maruti is up 35%, State Bank of India has moved from Rs 255 to Rs 310, ICICI Bank is sitting at an all time high. If a client now asks you whether you should chase the momentum now or wait for a meaningful 10-15% decline, what will you advise?No, I do not think we can look at a meaningful decline of 10-15%. Those days are now gone for the market in the near term. If at all, you have to play the momentum game. You cannot miss out the market by sitting on cash. The momentum is coming because the worst is getting over for many of the companies and especially the good quality companies. If a Maruti for example is showing a 25% volume decline in the first half of the month and is guiding for the year to be at a negative growth rate, it tells you that this year is gone is factored in. But the next year is going to be even better and many of these companies have a built-in hope because from an operational standpoint, they have not missed margins. Their margins are not low. 

In fact, if at all, they are guiding for better margins ahead. Financial services companies are guiding for lower slippages, lower NPAs and so on. The guidance that is coming out from some of the large companies is very strong and one has to reiterate that it is a worst is over kind of a market.


What was your takeaway from the Infy conference call?It was very clear that there is no proof behind the allegations that have come from the whistleblower. That was one event which caused the stock to tank and people had the previous episode in mind when the stock tanked when you had similar allegations coming out at the time of the Panaya buy. 

Then, at least a certain proof was submitted, there was a whole lot of investigation and after the churn that Infosys saw in terms of corporate governance, a lot of senior management was changed. Nandan Nilekani came back again.

The track record of Infosys since those days has been pretty strong, both from its business point of view and even from a corporate governance standpoint I would say because this whistleblower complaint was really speaking of a meaningless kind of complaint backed by no proof. 

The entire loss that Infosys suffered in terms of the stock price fall will be recovered. That recovery has not happened still, even at the current price of Rs 710 or 712. We expect Infosys to recover quite strongly.


What is one of your high-risk-high-return ideas where there could be a 10% downside or maybe a 15% volatility, but your analysis is indicating that 30-40% even 50% gains are coming in the next 12 to 18 months?There is clearly one sector where we see something which you did mention is likely to happen and it is in the auto ancillary space. A lot of auto ancillary names have fallen quite sharply. The distinction we are making is that some of the auto ancillaries are global in nature and some domestic. One should look at only those which are domestic kind of auto ancillary companies that have sharply fallen down. 

With a large volatility and perhaps a small downside, they have the promise of delivering very good returns as we move forward. If we take a one-year or a two- year view. Many of these auto ancillaries are suppliers to the large OEMs including Maruti. You can pick names within that. We already have coverage on a small auto ancillaries like PPAP Industries which can likely do well. So this is one space. 

We have some other stocks where one can potentially get great numbers and this is the housing space. More houses built means more cement, more cement possibly means that you will require more coal. Right now, they are dependent on domestic coal but you will have Coal India upping its production after a phase of de-growth. When coal production goes up, there is the requirement of a certain kind of explosives. We recently met a company called Solar Industries which make explosives used by the mining companies. 

So, these are companies which will have solid volume growth. We are looking at companies which can have solid volume growth delivery in the next one or two years, because of a low base effect. With operating leverage coming in and margins improving, probably these companies can deliver great returns in the years ahead."

10,2019-11-06,Eicher,"The rally in auto stocks may hit a speed bump after the recent rally in the last one month in anticipation of strong festival season sales. Analysts say they will watch out for the November and December volumes to discern the sustainability of demand.

The BSE Auto index has gained 13 per cent in the last one month. However, the rally is losing steam, with the index ending in the red in four out of the last five sessions. The BSE Auto index ended down 0.35 per cent at 18495 on Tuesday.

“Auto stocks have run up substantially in the past one or two months in anticipation of improvement on a month-on-month basis in the whoelsale as well as retail volumes which in a way has materialised but the volumes are lower on a YoY basis. The next 6-12 months will be challenging as companies need to prepare for BS-6 norms,” said Jigar Shah, CEO, Maybank Kim Eng Securities India.

Analysts said auto makers will have to sell all BS-4 inventories by the end of FY20 and in FY21, as they launch BS-6, the prices of vehicles will go up which will lead to some slowdown in diesel vehicles, and to some extent in petrol vehicles. One cannot say that demand situation will become normal as it used to be the case in the last four-five years, they said. Companies have got volumes in October because of festival season and heavy promotion or discounting, said analysts.

“Most of the auto stocks are trading above average valuations which is not justified as no major recovery is expected in the next few quarters,” said Shah.

Ashok Leyland is trading at 12.3 times on a trailing basis, higher than last five years’ average PE of 10.3 times. M&M, Motherson Sumi Systems, Apollo Tyres, TVS Motor, Balkrishna Industries, Maruti Suzuki India and MRF are trading above their last 5-year average PEs. All auto index constituents are sharply off their all-time highs. M&M, Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Tata Motors and Hero Moto-Corp are down 7-39 per cent from their lifetime high levels.



The market has been anticipating a revival in demand which is reflected in the upmove in stocks, but for it to reflect in actual sales may take some time, said Rajeev Thakkar, CIO at PPFAS Mutual Fund.

According to Citi, October auto volumes saw a common trend of weak wholesale sales and high retail sales, though the extent of disparity varied. This was due to a seasonal uptick in festival season demand as well as inventory clearing.

The auto space has been out of favour with investors for better part of the year due to liquidity crisis in the shadow banking industry and tough regulatory framework.

“Stocks have gone up on expectation of better sales during the Diwali period. October sales were better on a month-on-month basis but the only positive news for passenger car and two-wheeler companies is inventory levels have come down to 18-20 days from 40-45 days earlier,” said Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Joindre Capital.

“We are not going to see any major improvement in December or the March quarter. It will take some time for sentiment to improve,” said Gorakshakar."
14,2019-11-07,Eicher,"Mumbai: Royal Enfield, the maker of the iconic Bullet motorcycle, has registered record retail sales in October as “accessibility"" initiatives undertaken by new CEO Vinod Dasari helped the company reach hitherto untapped geographies.

According to people in the know, Royal Enfield delivered close to 95,000 motorcycles in the month of October, 50 per cent more than the recent monthly production rate of about 60,000 units.

The wholesales domestic volume of Royal Enfield fell 3.6 per cent to 67,538 units in October, the lowest pace of decline in the last 11 months. Domestic volumes fell 16 per cent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year owing to some discernible sign of brand fatigue, slowing market and intensifying competition.

Vinod Dasari, CEO, Royal Enfield, told ET that as the slowdown began, Royal Enfield persistently worked on bringing in innovation to product and processes. The company introduced new variants to the timeless Bullet and the popular Classic 350, and also spread the network across India by adding 250 new ‘studio stores’.

“During October 2019, with festive demand kicking in, our efforts at building wider accessibility for products and services helped register improved sales volumes. Moreover, we have reached out to more intenders through various media platforms and in-store activities,” added Dasari.

The company witnessed demand across smaller towns and cities, which are showing a “tremendous potential” for growth, said Dasari. These may soon become a huge market for the middle-weight motorcycles.

A sales rebound in the festive season by leading brands such as Royal Enfield, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai points to pent-up demand, although discretionary purchases will still take some time to stabilize.

“We continue to monitor industry trends and consumer sentiment closely and expect that demand will see gradual and consistent improvement over the coming months,"" added Dasari.

Recovery in the retail volumes, and the bottoming out of wholesale volumes have been well received by Dalal Street. The stock of Eicher Motors, which owns Royal Enfield, rose 28 per cent in the past three months, nearly three times the benchmark Sensex. It is trading at 26.6 times its projected 12-month earnings, one of the most expensive auto stocks.

Retail sales in the festive period rose 5 per cent for Royal Enfield as benefits from small-format stores began accruing, and the company was able to strike better financing deals with banks.

The company is gradually rolling small format stores which are nearly a fifth in size compared with full size store of 1,500 square feet."

16,2019-11-07,Eicher,"If you are a conservative investor, invest 60-70% in multicap funds because most multicap funds are 70-80% in largecaps. At least 20-30% should be in midcaps and by midcap, I mean companies with half billion to three billion in m-cap, says Aashish Sommaiyaa, MD & CEO, Motilal Oswal AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


When we met last, about three-and-a-half months ago, things were looking up. There was optimism. Despite market volatility, flows were looking robust. What is the update at your end, both at PMS and mutual fund level?I will start with the mutual fund first. September was a month of huge bounce-back and while October numbers are not out yet, what I understand by observing the market and by talking to people is that the flows are muted. So, if September was close to Rs 9,000 crore net flow, my estimate for October is anywhere in the range of Rs 3,000-4,000 crore net.


 It is half of what we had in September.My sense is that there was a significant decline in October because there was a huge bounce back in September. All these largecaps, midcaps bounced back by 9-10%. When Rs 100 becomes Rs 90 and then comes back to Rs 100, a lot of people who came in 2018 would call it a relief redemption on a lighter note, but that does happen.


This is the net picture right?Yes, this is net.


The most important number is that the SIP trend got shaken. So, the schemes which you manage, even though you are not a large player in SIP market, but you still have a reasonable presence. Has the SIP investor panicked? Are you getting panic cancellation?
No, there is no panic cancellation. The number of people whose SIPs were expiring or number of people who are cancelling SIPs has remained flat for the industry. Fresh registration of SIPs has seen some kind of headwind, there is no doubt about that. The other thing to keep in mind is that we see are net numbers, but the point is there is a different guy who is giving the inflow and there is a different bunch of guys who are giving the redemptions. 

There is no way of knowing whether the guys who stop the SIP or people whose SIP instalments are over, are redeeming or not. We get a total redemption number and there is no way to know whether it is the SIP guy who is redeeming or it is somebody else who is redeeming. I think the behaviour for SIP guys would be slightly better than the guys who are cutting cheques. 

If somebody’s SIP stops, is he redeeming or not, there is no way to know. This whole thing of seeing the net flow tends to be a bit misleading. We have to see how many people are cutting cheques, how many SIPs are going through and how many people are giving redemptions. Why am I bringing this up is because the number of people who are cutting cheques every month, that is discretionary investment, has fallen dramatically. 

In December 2017, at the peak, the gross inflow was Rs 45,000 crore when SIP input was only Rs 6,000 crore which means Rs 39,000 crore worth of cheques were being cut. Now we are at a gross inflow of Rs 22,000 crore and SIP is about Rs 8,000. The fall in inflow is the big issue. It is not so much just about redemption. 

If you have people’s money, at a certain rate you will get attrition every month because it is their money and they will want to take it out and liquidity is a feature of mutual funds. I think the big issue is the fall in inflows.


But what is keeping people away? Is it because they have badly burnt their fingers in the small and midcap carnage?There are different strategies out there but even in mutual funds about 10% to 15% of the entire industry’s assets is in small and midcaps. My sense is everybody would have had that in their portfolio and that is down. Inflow going down partly is because of that because when your recent investment does not show a great result, then you feel worried about committing more. So, that is definitely one thing.

Now the naysayers are saying you do not make money when you buy stocks at PE multiples of 70 or 80 times; you do not make money if you keep Bajaj Finance at a price book of 8 times. How would you defend this criticism?I will just say one disclaimer, whatever I am speaking I may own only through my mutual fund. I do not own any of these stocks that we are discussing regarding the mutual funds or the PMS whatever.


We are discussing a concept.So like you were saying about Bajaj Finance or Eicher in the past, there are notes which are being made about HUL or Bata and quality is in a trap and those kinds of things.


Have you seen that show or have you read that note?I read the note and there are many notes. First, there is a response. Because we are one of the torch-bearers and we have our own execution challenges at times, no running around that but because we are one of the guys who have been professing quality, the first thing in this whole conundrum I find is that nobody is defining what is quality? My humble submission is that if B2C consumer facing companies are not the last word in quality. Second point in this whole conundrum is that the time horizon of investing has not been taken into consideration at all. What happens is that there are some people who believe that they will always be at the frontier of the next cycle of the market. So, they think that when quality is out of fashion and deep discount will start flying, then I will be positioned at the frontier end and I will get it right. It does not work that way. 

Our belief is that and we will always stick to our philosophy, and customers will ensure style diversity in their portfolios — the whole thing is about long term and short term. But I would go back to the original point. I do not think quality starts and ends with a few consumer facing companies. Look at it this way. A year back, a lot of insurance companies were available at half the price they are going for now. Our biggest success, in the last one, one-and-a-half years, have come from owning disproportionate insurance compared to where the benchmarks are. That is one area of success and quality has always been perceived to be expensive and the last point is that we ourselves do not own most of the stocks which are listed out there by the way. 


You own a lot of autos.Yes.


As a house, do you think auto is something which is going through a cyclical pain and all these things about EV, Uberisation, will all settle down?Sometimes. the narrative tracks the price. That is the whole issue. We all say that the price will track the narrative but a lot of time, our narrative starts tracking the price also which is a bit of a challenge when you are managing public money explaining to people. 

But on auto, in hindsight, when we made a lot of money, maybe we could have taken some off the table. When we were in the thick of things, we were pretty sure that this is all cyclical in nature and that is where the narrative changes with price We have stuck through it and we are looking smarter than what we were looking in October last year.


Tactically, what is a prudent strategy if someone has to deploy fresh money by way of SIPs for the next three years? Are you better off putting a larger allocation to small and midcaps because finally they will begin to outperform or would you stick to largecaps?We must define what is quality before we start a debate. What is happening is that the whole small and midcap space is gigantic. It is being all muddled up. I will give you examples. The largest luggage maker in India has a Rs 5,500-crore market cap. Are you going to say that we adjust because it is a smallcap company? The answer is no. Most domestic pharma companies, which are inward looking, domestic businesses are all midcap companies. A lot of financial services NBFCs, mortgage finance companies which have nothing to do with the whole developer funding mess, are all small and midcap companies. A lot of the auto ancillaries are small and midcap companies. So, I do not think that we can jettison all of this. 

I would say, definitely one should invest in midcaps but as long as we are going to paint everything with the same brush, investors would not get clarity. That is the big challenge because when the space has declined, everything has declined 30-40% and people are not willing to be discerning to understand that what should have fallen and what should not also have fallen.


What does one do with NBFCs? What is the way forward given the pain the sector has been through and given the kind of commentary coming in from the government?We are very actively looking at mortgage finance. Just because of what happened last year, one should not think the sector is either not needed or to be excluded. There are very good companies which actually have no issues with liability franchise. They have had no issues with wholesale real estate funding, but they are being treated pretty much in the same way and you can clearly see some of them are returning — not to the previous highs but at least they are showing an improvement in trajectory. There is no reason to believe that they are out.


 I have learnt very late in my life the importance of right asset allocation. What to your mind currently is the valuation entry point for mid and smallcap stocks? When did we last see these entry points and what happened subsequently after that?I do not think we are back to 2011-2012 and 2013 and those kind of things, but definitely we are close to 2014-2015 kind of a scenario because the big return came in 2016 and 2017 right but at the same time, in 2014-2015. a lot of stocks had started to show. 

I will not try to say that everything is a screaming buy but you have to be a discerning investor in this whole melee, when a few things deserved to be corrected but everything got smashed and there are so many technical things like last year’s rotating mutual funds portfolios. The exchange is putting so many things into additional surveillance mechanism and so many things happened altogether.


When the midcap cycle got tricked was in 2008 and the bull market in mid and small cap stocks started in 2014 and 2016. It took six long years. If I am assuming 2018 is when post LTCG, the mid and smallcap stocks started reversing, then this is just the second year of correction. So, it may be another year or two before these stocks bottom out and the real bull market could be four-five years away?I think so. Last year, when the smallcap index fell, we also fell as much as the index. What is giving me confidence is that this year, many of our stocks have started to outperform the index by a mile! If you are a discerning stock picker and if you are able to understand that everything we have also had execution issues, there are a couple of stocks which I know will not bounce back and we got out of them. But by and large, out of 20, 17-18 stocks have started to bounceback.


Coming to asset allocation or rather portfolio allocation for the next three years. percentage wise how much into largecaps, how much into multicap, balanced, fixed income separately and small and midcaps for a conservative investor?If you are conservative, then may be 60-70% in multicaps because most multicap funds do 70-80% largecap. At least 20-30% should be in midcaps and when I say midcaps I am basically not going by any textbook definition. Before the definition came, we used to think half billion to three billion is midcap and I would stick to that."

TRADE SETUP

Singapore trading sets stage for gap-down startNifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded 52 points, or 0.43 per cent, lower at 12,006.50, indicating a gap-down start for Dalal Street.


Tech view: Nifty forms Dragonfly Doji candleNifty50 on Thursday broke above the psychologically important 12,000 mark on a closing basis. But the index formed a Dragonfly Doji candle on the daily chart and a close below 11,946 level can bring the bears back into the game. The index has more or less witnessed indecisive formations for the last six sessions.


Moody’s cuts India’s outlook to negative
Moody's changed India's outlook to negative from stable while affirming India’s Baa2 ratings. Moody's says decision to change India's outlook partly reflects lower government, policy effectiveness at addressing economic, institutional weaknesses.

Funding for single housing project cappedFunding from the Rs 25,000-crore special window for stalled housing will be capped at Rs 400 crore for a single project, the government said on Thursday, urging home buyers to pay their remaining dues to enable early completion. The government clarified the “positive net worth” condition for projects to be eligible for support from the alternate investment debt fund in a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that it issued on Thursday. The fund won’t provide assistance to projects that are in the Supreme Court and high courts but will take up those being heard by NCLT, it said.


US, China agree on Phase I tariff rollbackChina and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others’ goods in a “phase one” trade deal if it is completed, officials from both sides said on Thursday, sparking division among some advisers to President Donald Trump. The Chinese commerce ministry, without laying out a timetable, said the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the rollback would be part of the first phase of a trade agreement that is still being put to paper for Trump and President Xi Jinping to sign.


AGR dues may rise 10%, delay spectrum saleIndia’s mobile phone companies may be liable to pay around 10% more in dues to the government than previously estimated, following the Supreme Court verdict on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), said government officials with knowledge of the matter. The total dues, pegged at Rs 1.3 lakh crore by the telecom department, could rise further on account of changes to the definition of AGR and the levies having to be calculated for the entire period till date. That could delay auctions of spectrum even further, considering the precarious financial situation of the sector,


Window for NBFCs likely under insolvency lawThe government is mulling a special window to address debt woes of stressed non-banking financial companies under the insolvency law, reports PTI.

Anti-subsidy duty on copper wire rods likelyIndia may impose anti-subsidy duty for a period of five years on copper wire rods from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam after concluding a probe that these imports have impacted domestic players. The commerce ministry's investigating arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in September last year started a probe into an alleged subsidisation of exports of 'continuous cast copper wire rods' by these four countries.


Farm Ministry aims for ‘zero edible oil import’The commerce ministry has asked the agriculture ministry to prepare a road map for India to attain self-sufficiency in edible oil production. The need for a “zero edible oil import” plan was discussed by commerce minister Piyush Goyal at an inter-ministerial meeting on Tuesday.

23,2019-11-09,Eicher,"For an index trade, I believe betting on Bank Nifty could be good and especially if the index corrects by another 500 or 600 points over the next week, said Kunal Bothra, an independent analyst. Excerpts from his interview with ETNow:

ET NOW: What do you make of the last week? what happened and how is the setup looking for the next week?

I think the last week was a bit up and down for the index but there were a couple of data points which I think come out as a reflection of what transpired during the week and what could be happening say over the next week and the week after that.

So the first one is that the market internals were a bit mixed last week and that generally happens when you expect that the index to go through a bit of a consolidation. Sectors that led up the price uptick so whether it is the Nifty IT or Nifty Auto, I think these indices have taken a bit of a breather. So, when you are into that kind of a scenario where leading sectors correct and the laggard sectors tend to pick up pace, it is a sign that the index is going through a range bound action.

The other two important data points which I believe a trader has to take note of is the 12,000 strike on the options has one of the highest amounts of Call open interest, which is generally acting as a resistance for the Nifty so it is going to be a bit of a hurdle for the index to try and scale past that bit of psychological mark.

The second and the most important point that I believe is the event of a golden crossover where the 50-day moving average on the Nifty daily charts crosses the 200-day moving average on the upside. That generally has very strong positive repercussions on the indices and also leads into multi-month uptrend.

So, I believe if you try and put all these together, short term charts indicate you might go through a bit of weakness on the Nifty but the medium term chart indicates that you are in for a very strong upside on the index going forward.


ET NOW: What do you make of the Bank Nifty’s recent move? What is your sense on the broader market space?

First, on the Bank Nifty I believe that the index is trying to catch up with its underperformance with respect to Nifty. On the one hand when the Nifty is just 1-1.5 per cent from its lifetime high, Bank Nifty is still substantially lower from those levels. For an index trade I believe betting on Bank Nifty could be good and especially if the index corrects by another 500 or 600 points over the next week.

Now coming to the small and midcap space, I believe that they will also pickup pace. They are lagging significantly behind the benchmark Nifty and the large cap indices but when you have a market which is going through a full throttle upside led by largecaps, midcaps tend to play a bit of a lagging price behaviour. So, if assuming that this is a full-fledged rally on the indices then the midcaps should participate sooner or later.


ET NOW: What is your take on the auto pack as most of the companies have come out with their numbers?

Well I think it is going to be very stock specific but many of these auto stocks have gone through a very strong recovery. Now there could be two cases; one is that on the longer term charts this could be probably a dead cat bounce for many of these stocks. If the stocks stay below the resistance, for example, Maruti at Rs 7,700, Eicher Motors closer to Rs 21,500 or 22,500, then there could be a chance of sharp reversal.


ET NOW: What could also transpire is that many of these other laggards, the ones like Tata Motors, could try and play catch up at the time when the sector consolidates.

So, I believe that the rally, if any, is going to be very stock specific but I would be very bullish on the likes of Tata Motors even from current levels. I strongly believe that as a positional play or more of a medium term play, the stock can also break the 200 mark, say over the next three to six months.


ET NOW: Any ideas you have for our viewers?

The first one would be a buy on IndusInd Bank. I think the stock has managed to show some very good recovery in the last week, especially on Friday, on the back of some price and volume data. I think the stock also broke the psychological Rs 1,400 mark that was acting as a bit of a hurdle for the lender. So, I think that could be a good buy at the current levels. My target would be Rs 1,485-1,500 and stop loss would be at 1390.

The second would be a buy on Max Financial Services. I think that stock also did exceptionally well on Thursday and Friday of last week. Volumes were higher and the stock managed to give a very big breakout on the daily as well as some of the hourly charts. So I believe Max Financial Services could be a good positional buy from the current levels of Rs 480 plus. I think the stock can head towards Rs 515 so buy with a target of Rs 515 and stop loss to be kept at Rs 465."
24,2019-11-11,Eicher,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 13.50 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Ambit Capital has maintained buy rating on Magma Fincorp and lowered target price to Rs 59 from Rs 68. Poor track record of execution, deteriorating asset quality and lack of pricing power expose Magma to vagaries of market liquidity crunch, said Ambit. Shrinking margin profile with poor levers around growth would continue to keep RoA/ RoE muted. But Magma’s seasoned retail book doesn’t warrant deep discount valuation to 3-year rolling crosscycle average. Shares of Magma Fincorp ended down 5.4 per cent at Rs 46.6 on Friday.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained sell rating on Eicher Motors and revised target price to Rs 17,000 from Rs 15,000. Eicher Motors reported 24 per cent YoY decline in consolidated Ebitda in Q2 of FY20 led by weak volume growth and margin pressures in VECV and Royal Enfield businesses. Kotak Institutional expects volume pressure to persist in FY21 due to (1) shift towards BS-VI engines and (2) increase in competitive intensity. Shares of Eicher Motors ended up 1.3 per cent at Rs 21700.85 on Friday.


• Emkay Global has maintained buy rating on Amara Raja Batteries and revised target price to Rs 781 from Rs 760. Despite the steep fall in OEM revenues and lower realizations, Amara Raja’s second quarter revenues declined only marginally by 3 per cent YoY, said Emkay. The brokerage expects revenue/earnings CAGRs at 8 per cent/16 per cent for FY19-22. Average ROE/ROCE will likely to be strong at 17 per cent/22 per cent over FY20-22, it said. In addition, free cash flow generation should remain healthy at an average of Rs 4.2 billion/year over this period. Shares of Amara Raja Batteries ended down 1.2 per cent at Rs 654 on Friday.

• Edelweiss has retained buy rating on Power Grid Corporation of India with a target price of Rs 233. Power Grid's Q2 profit was along expected lines, said Edelweiss. Importantly, capitalisation of assets picked up pace and jumped 2 times sequentially, it said. The management is confident of commissioning the Raipur-–Pugalur line which is critical to meet its FY20 capitalisation guidance, said Edelweiss. Apart from new project wins, any development on asset monetisation through the investment trust (InvIT) platform is a key monitorable. Power Grid offers 13 per cent earnings growth visibility over FY19–21, said Edelweiss. This, along with its inexpensive valuation and 4 per cent dividend yield, is comforting, said Edelweiss. Shares of Power Grid ended down 1.3 per cent at Rs 191.70 on Friday.

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Dr Lal Pathlabs and increased target price to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,330. The company's Q2 results were ahead of estimates, with another quarter of strong volume growth. Overall, volume remains the point of focus, helping the company expand into the rest of India and reducing dependence on its home market of Delhi/National Capital Region (NCR), it said. The brokerage has raised FY20-22 EPS estimates by 8-12 per cent to reflect recent tax cuts. Shares of Dr Lal Path-Labs ended down 2.9 per cent at Rs 1451.80 on Friday."

The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 564.39 crore in latest quarter. 


Investment Rationale
Eicher Motors reported 24% YoY decline in consolidated Ebitda in Q2 of FY20 led by weak volume growth and margin pressures in VECV and Royal Enfield businesses. Kotak Institutional expects volume pressure to persist in FY21 due to (1) shift towards BS-VI engines and (2) increase in competitive intensity."
28,2019-11-13,Eicher,"Mumbai: Is investor money finally moving out of the top-10 Nifty stocks, which have been drivers of the rally in the benchmark index to near record levels? If the decline in weights of these stocks in the Nifty are anything to go by, investors may have started shifting money from the recent winners to other stocks in the index, said analysts.

For the first time since January 2018, the weight of the top-10 stocks in the Nifty has dropped from 62 per cent to 58 per cent over the last two months. Brokers said this could be because the incremental allocation of mutual funds and foreign portfolio investors over last few months could be happening in stocks that have lower weights, according to Elara Capital. A drop in stock prices is a factor that contributes to a stock’s weight in the index “Finally, we are seeing some early signs of markets entering into depolarisation mode” said Sunil Jain, analyst, Elara Capital. “The process of depolarisation could also indicate that market participants have slowly started gaining back the confidence after remaining concerned on growth over the last 18-months.”



Mutual funds’ allocation to the top-10 Nifty stocks has declined from 60 per cent in Aug’19 to 57 per cent October. Similarly, FPIs too have reduced their allocations to top-10 Nifty weights after hitting a peak of 59-61 per cent.

Fund managers chased the top-10 stocks such as such as HDFC, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever and Reliance Industries among others between December 2018 and August 2019 because a downturn and further drop in broader corporate earnings growth resulted in investors opting for companies with higher profitability. But, their outperformance resulted in their valuations shooting through the roof.

“The extreme narrow rally since January 2018 due to investors’ risk aversion seems to be receding with incremental money moving into wider set of stocks,” said Ajay Bodke, CEO (PMS), Prabhudas Lilladher. “Investors are now getting confidence after the valuation gap between the mega large-cap stocks and others widened tremendously.”

In the September quarter, mutual funds have increased stake in Ultra-Tech IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank and BPCL between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent. Coal India, NTPC, Cipla, Eicher Motors, TechM and GAIL are among the other stocks in which funds have raised their stakes by 100 to 200 basis points.

“Post corporate rate tax cut, large investors are expecting underperforming large-caps to outperform and money may move out from index heavyweights to other stocks,” said Kush Katakia, chief executive officer, Beanstalk Advisory.

Nifty gained 5.63 per cent between January 2018 and August 2019 while Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap 100 declined 15 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. Since 1 September, Nifty, Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midacp 100 gained about 8 per cent each."
29,2019-11-13,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Eicher Motors’ stock has gained over 17 per cent in the past month following recovery in sales volume of its bikes. A closer look at its financials however reveals that the company has achieved higher volume at the expense of margins. The stock’s upside from the current level will depend on how well the company balances between volume and profitability.

Eicher’s volume reported growth in October for the first time in 12 months. This was a surprise amid slowing demand – the company’s volume growth had dropped by 18 per cent in the first nine months of 2019.

In addition, the inventory of Royal Enfield (RE), the company’s flagship bike brand, dropped to three weeks and dealers in some urban areas were stock out during the festive season.

The volume growth can be attributed to several factors. First, Eicher has started focusing on the remote areas in the country by opening small stores which are a fifth the size of stores in urban areas. It has opened 500 small stores till October and plans to add 200-300 stores by the end of the current fiscal.


Second, the company launched a lowerpriced variant of Bullet and Classic 350 in some states, which found traction in some states including Kerala, one of its biggest markets.

Third, export volume growth picked up after the launch of the 650cc twins. Export volume grew by 149 per cent and the share of export in total volume reached 6.5 per cent in the first seven months of FY20 compared with 2.1 per cent in the year-ago period.

However, the company’s operating margin before depreciation (EBITDA margin) dropped to an 18-quarter low. It fell by 560 basis points to 25 per cent in the September quarter. It may continue to face pressure given the rising share of lowpriced models.

A major headwind in the coming months could be the rising cost of production due to regulatory changes such as the implementation of disk brakes and anti-braking system in bikes over 125cc. RE’s average selling price increased to Rs 1,30,973 in the September quarter compared with Rs 1,14,423 a year ago.

According to Bloomberg consensus estimate, projected EBITDA margin was 26.7 per cent and 26 per cent for FY20 and FY21 respectively.

At Monday’s closing price of Rs 21,363, the stock was traded at 25.5 times its projected one-year forward earnings, a discount of 17 per cent compared with its five-year average valuation."
30,2019-11-13,Eicher,"You may credit it to experience, skill, timing or sheer luck, but the fact is India’s top money managers for high net worth individuals (HNIs) managed to generate robust alpha in last one year despite strong market volatility.

Emkay Lead PMS, a multicap strategy run by Emkay Investment Managers, stands out on top, having delivered 33.40 per cent return between November 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

With an equal weight of 6.70 per cent each, Bajaj Finance, Astral Poly Technik, Aarti Industries, Maruti Suzuki and Britannia Industries were among the top holdings of the Emkay Lead PMS.

Sectorwise, the fund had 33.50 weightage to BFSI and 26.80 per cent and 20.10 per cent to FMCG and building materials. It generated 3.90 per cent return in October against 3.95 per cent gain registered by BSE200 index.

Sameeksha Capital’s Equity Fund Strategy delivered 29.90 per cent to emerge second best for the calendar year to date, data compiled by PMSbazaar showed. The fund house had 43.10 per cent exposure to financials and 25.60 per cent to industrials.

“Our strategy is multi cap and bottom up,” says Bhavin Shah, Founder of Sameeksha Capital. “We try to understand the intrinsic value of companies based on long-term forecast of free cash flow in case of a non-financial company or excess return on equity in case of a financial company. We only buy when a company is available below its intrinsic value. We particularly find opportunity, when sell-side may not understand the dynamics and maybe a lot of mutual funds have not caught up with the story,” he said.

Aviation, IT and consumer discretionary had 9.10 per cent, 7.80 per cent and 4.90 per cent weightage, respectively, in the fund. However, Sameeksha’s Equity Fund declined marginally by 0.13 per cent in October, but generated more than 12 per cent in last three months.

Sanctum Wealth’s Indian Olympians (up 28.20 per cent), Motilal Oswal’s BOP (up 28.07 per cent), Varanium Capital Advisors (up 28 per cent) and Ambit Capital’s Coffee Can (up 27.80 per cent) were among other top gainers of last one year.

Sanctum's Indian Olympians is a largecap-focused, concentrated PMS strategy. It says the objective is to generate long-term capital growth by investing in a concentrated portfolio of largecap companies having sustainable performance.

“We are predominately invested in financials and consumers in our strategy. Reducing overweight position in consumer discretionary last year and adding exposure in information technology sector worked really well, while, we had very low to nil exposure to utilities, industrials, commodities and communication services which helped us save on any significant drawdown,” said Hemang Kapasi, Portfolio Manager, Equity Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth Management.

Motilal Oswal’s BOP is based on four themes, which are related to PM Narendra Modi’s reformist measures including affordable housing, doubling of farm income, GST opportunity and migration of value happening away from public sector banks to private sector banks and NBFCs.

“Of course, it has to fulfil our additional criteria of structural businesses having good and capable management which can double profits in 3-4 years with a decent margin of safety. We suggest investors to invest for at least three years in this product,” said Manish Sonthalia, Fund Manager.

As of October 30, the fund had 66.21 per cent exposure to companies from FMCG, retail, banks, insurance and agriculture.

Ambit’s Coffee Can, which delivered 4.90 per cent return in October, had Page Industries, Asian Paints, Berger paints and HDFC Bank among its top holdings with maximum 31 per cent exposure to the building material space.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced nearly 17 per cent between November 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019, while the BSE Midcap index stood almost flat and Smallcap index dipped 5.60 per cent.

“It’s no brainer for largecaps right now,” said Sonthalia. There is far bigger value in midcaps and smallcaps . Funds flow is choked in midcaps and smallcaps because of regulations, etc. Prices are undershooting fundamentals in this space,” he said.

IIFL’s Multicap PMS (27.27 per cent), Sundaram AMC’s SISOP (27.10 per cent), ASK’s India Select (25.50 per cent) and Nippon India (25.10 per cent) also gained over 25 per cent in the past 12 months.

Sundaram’s SISOP is a multicap portfolio. The fund’s factsheet says it holds companies that maintain over 12 per cent RoCE/ self-funded models, led by high visionary leadership.

The fund had over 50 per cent exposure to Bajaj Finance, Titan, HDFC Bank, AU Small Finance Bank and Eicher Motors as of October 31.

IIFL’s Multicap holds 15-20 companies which are business leaders, have strong managements, lower leverage with large margin of safety. The fund generated 3.27 per cent return in October and 10.47 per cent in last three months.

Newly formed Marcellus’s Consistent Compounders gave 22.50 per cent in just six months. The fund was formed in December last year.

“Marcellus remains bullish on HDFC Banks, Kotak Bank, the Asian Paints and Pidilite,” Saurabh Mukherjea, founder and chief investment officer, Marcellus Investment, said in his latest interaction with ETNow.

“It looks conservative to buy these companies, but I have seen in India over the last 10 years that if you consistently and sensibly invest in these franchises, you make anywhere between high teens to low 20s returns consistently. For someone like me managing other people’s money, that is a perfectly acceptable outcome,” he said."

33,2019-11-18,Eicher,"A very interesting opportunity may be that the whole EM trade will reverse and that can lead to disproportionate flows to India. That is where the benefit lies, says Atul Suri, CEO & CIO, Marathon Trend – PMS. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW.

Markets have not changed at all, the look is still the same, 15-20 stocks and that is about it.No harm, really there is no harm. I know there is a lot of angst that the market is very narrow but let us take a bigger view of the markets. I look at the MSCI All-World index. It is like the mother index of the word. It has 49 countries in it. I know we have a lot of negative news. Whatsapp is full of end of the world scenario, but markets are doing their own thing. They are saying a different story. The MSCI All-World index has broken out into life-time high a few weeks ago! Now you may say that it is a function of the US. So let us go and see the US. It is true that the Dow, S&P, the Dow Transportation has started coming up. Utilities are coming down. So this is inverse. Risk-on trade is on in the US. When I look at the charts and I look at a lot of triggers in the US in the year -- elections, trade wars, corporate earnings and most important bond yields -- I personally see a 20% upside in the US markets from here.


20% upside in the US market after 11-year bull run in the market that has been called as the longest economic expansion?Right.


That means Dow could go to 35,000.I think so and what I feel is that this is not just going to be the US. Let us go a step further. We looked at the All-World Index, we took out its biggest component Dow, which is 50%. 


All-World Index is what?So the All-World Index is a composite index of 49 different markets of the world and out of that, they pick out various components. It is the most broad-based equity index in the world and it is the ETF available. You can actually trade it. If I say, I am bullish on global markets, I can actually buy the world indexes in one ETF. Then I go to the next level. I look at this All-World Index Ex-US. So I take out US. I think that okay US is the only propulsion point, rest is gloom and doom. The other big component is the European markets which have been dead and nobody talks about but even there you will start seeing that the Dax or the CAC of Germany and France, UK market with its own problems, all nudging 52-week highs! Nobody talks about them. They are not headline news. 

Let us go to the next level. Let us look at Japan Nikkei, again a forgotten market. Even that is pushing at 52-week highs. So what you really see is a very broad-based global equity bull market, very contrary to the kind of Whatsapp and tweets that we get.


Dow has been making a new high for almost three years in a row now. Indian markets also have managed to outperform. At least the Nifty has managed to outperform and it is making a new high on a consistent basis. So what is the new trend Atul Suri is talking about?What actually happens is that equity markets have been very good in 2019 but 2018 was a very difficult year. I 2018 December, we were in debt and the biggest trigger for that was US bond yields. Exactly a year ago, if we were sitting here, the talk was that the bond yields which have been declining for 20-30 years has turned and as bond yields go up, money will move away from equity to debt. Just a year later, people are talking of negative interest rates. That shows our ability to predict and the ways and means of markets to surprise us. 

I think the biggest elephant in the room is bond yields. They drive all other asset classes. Last year, we thought a 30-year-old trend had changed and this year we are talking about negative yields!


We got a headline 10 days ago that there has been a big spike in the US 10 year rate.There has been.


That tells you that the inverted yield curve which took the markets higher is equalising. If your bullishness is based around US 10-year paper, guess that is reversing?What will happen is that not just the pop-up is going to reverse. Even if it remains within a range, even two negative inverted yield curves, etc, is not good for the market. But most important thing about currencies and bond yields is their range boundness. The good part is that the collapse has stopped but I feel that we will go into a period of range boundness. This is again coming back to our earlier reading that the big trigger for global markets will be a muted or a range-bound US bond market. If that remains, what will happen is that there is a very big TINA (there is no alternative) factor which is also happening out in India. 

Going ahead in 2020, we will have a good market thanks to the global bull run in spite of all negative headline news. But for us to turn from good to great is going to be a function of what happens in Indian markets and 2020 is going to be very exciting.-Atul Suri

I feel that money will move to equities and let me take that whole deduction thing ahead. I had mentioned about Japan being another great bull market. The next step I would look at is the EM space and the only place of big concern or underperformance big time is the emerging market index and guess what? We are a subset of it.


 It is also believed and documented that emerging markets will do well when developed markets are not doing that well.Right.


They both are a mirror image of each other. There is an inverse correlation. If one goes down, the other goes higher. What you are saying is forget the blackboard theories. What have worked in the past will not work in the future. We are in a rising tide phenomenon where everything will go up in a synchronised manner. Why is that?
As I said, the EMs index is not looking that pretty! When you speak to investors, they say that why should we come in? In 2018 the EM index was down 25% and in 2019 when there is a big bull market, at best we have done 10%. We are nowhere near lifetime highs where the EM basket is good. So, the compulsion to be in EMs is not there yet. Yes, the potential is that this trade could reverse and disproportionately benefit India because whatever the FIIs are buying, how come they are buying in tw-three days. 

The direct correlation is that there is a very large passive ETF, EMs trade that goes out and India gets its share of allocation. We tend to over emphasise the local factors but the big EM money that comes is more a function of this trade. Let me shock you with the number. Last year, the total FII negative flows are around Rs 53,000 crore or thereabouts. In 2019, we may sound passive but we are already positive Rs 58,000 crore. The buying this year has been more than the selling last year, though that was headline news. The thing is EMs which fell very sharply in 2018 at 25%, have consolidated in 2019 and are 10% higher. But they are nowhere near what the developed markets are doing. 

For me, a very interesting opportunity may be this whole EM trade reverses and that can lead to disproportionate flows to India. I feel that is where the benefit lies and for India also, you have to accept the headline news is not good.


 It is like a situation where markets will climb the wall of worry. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala says that markets always climb the wall of worry and come down the ray of hope. Right now, there is no hope but there is a wall of worry which markets have managed to climb.Right. So, we have a very good global scenario now and we will get our share. We got it last year without doing anything spectacular. In 2019, there has been no great news. In 2020, starting from the budget, can we do something great -- may be divestments, direct taxes or just general economic improvement -- all related to government policies. In case that happens, India can get a bigger share than what is due to it and that for me can be the big space. 

Going ahead in 2020, we will have a good market thanks to the global bull run in spite of all negative headline news. But for us to go out and turn from good to great is going to be a function of what happens in Indian markets and 2020 is going to be very exciting.


 Let’s talk about long-term trends. If markets continue to extend themselves, will the horses also be the same or do you need to jump off the horses? Jumping of the horses is intellectually a great concept but I am a trend investor and investing styles are not an intellectual function. It is a function of risk return profile. As a trend investor, I do not believe in being the first to buy a stock or buying a stock at the bottom. I feel that money is made in trends. If a stock goes from 100 to 1000, it is not that I have to buy it at 100. I can buy it at 200 and 300, The more important part is my ability to ride the trend. So yes I know there is this talk that there is a bubble in some space and some spaces are cheap, but the fact is when the market or earnings change, I may be not being buying at the bottom. I may buy it a little late but it is okay because that suits my risk return profile. As an investor you have to allow your thought process to evolve.


Are you an investor or a trader?I am an investor.


I thought you were a trader.What are investors? What are traders? What is midcap, what is largecap, what is quality, what is not quality, these are all related manmade terms. The fact is that ultimately each investor style has to gel with his personality. That makes your style of investing and this has to sync with your investor expectations. That is the crucial part about my evolution as a trend investor. 

Coming to your question, are all these stocks a top made or is it a bubble? I do not think so. Nothing in the market tells me that there is a bubble, Yes the other story can also play out but the fact is that if you let the earnings come and let them play out, we may not buy a 100 to 1000 journey at 100, we may buy it at 200-300, I want to buy it at a point where the risk is low. I am not one of those kinds who will buy a stock at 100 wait for two years and at 50 get disappointed. I would rather buy it at 200 and 300 and see it go to 400-500. That story is panning out in this space. That is where the trends are and being a trend investor I am quite happy to be there.


If I look at the five or seven-year chart, Eicher has still given a phenomenal return but if I just squeeze in the last two years, Eicher performance has been a nightmare for a trader. It has seen a 40% decline from the top and a 40% recovery from the lows. In the last three years, it is flat. Let us look at three-month or four-month chart for Eicher and it is like one of the scary, volatile charts. 
How do you deal with this kind of volatility in a zero-debt company, which is also a classic compounder. This is the beauty of numbers and statistics based on what view you wantm you can splice data. That is how reports are made. The thing is your projection and all these things are academic discussion. The important part is what is your style and what fits? I really do not need to look at Eicher at three months, one year, two years etc. The important part is, as a trend investor, I am trying to look to invest for three, five years. 

If I am playing that kind of a strategy, then I have to give that stock that kind of leeway. Let us not speak about Eicher specifically. The fact is what data you splice, you can make it a bull and bear case based on data.


 All I am saying is that a classic compounder like Eicher also has given you these nervous moments. It has given these bouts of gut wrenching volatility. An auto company which has no debt in it falling 40% will shake you up. It cannot be compared to a power company or a PSU bank. Yet the stock has fallen?The smoothest stock in Indian markets today, and widely owned, is HDFC Bank. This stock also showed 20-30% volatility. A bank that is growing at 20-25% year-on-year with no blemishes, how can the stock fall 20-30%? But in markets, that is the function of multiple variants. As I said, the important thing is as a trend investor, my objective is about having portfolios with low draw-downs. I would like a portfolio that doubles, goes up 100% every year but the fact is if I look for a stock or a portfolio that goes up 100% every year, can I withstand a 50% drawdown because risk and reward go hand in hand? As an investor, it is important for you to be able to define what is your area which fits into your psyche.


How does stop loss come in now? You said stop loss is sacrosanct?Stop loss is sacrosanct because what happens is that when trends change, you will see that same price trend change. I will give you this case of Eicher so it may just be a bit of a story telling; I rode this stock for a long, long phase.


Not the bike, the stock?I do not know how to ride a bike.


That is a good disclosure.It is beautiful. Actually that is where the story goes to. I love the stock and Eicher -- Royal Enfield had opened these stores and there was one that opened in Bandra where I live. I went there and I said this stock has been kind to me, let me go and see what the hell the bike is all about. It is was a very fancy store with leather jackets and things like that. So I went in and I saw some and I said since I cannot buy the bike, maybe I can buy a t-shirt or something. So, I went and saw a keychain and thought I would buy it but I stopped myself. I did not buy the keychain because that is where emotion comes in and I checked myself from making that emotional decision. 

Again, when stocks do well or when trends happen, we fall in love with them. And the exit decision what we spoke about stop losses is not an intellectual decision, it is emotion. Selling is the most difficult thing to do in the market because that is where emotion comes in. 

If you sell in profit, you are definitely in love with the stock because you have made money; selling at loss is where your ego comes in. The decision what to buy or where is the trend is not difficult. Sitting on the trend is more difficult and the most difficult part is exiting the trend. The reason that happens is not because we have failed intellectually, it is an emotional issue."

41,2019-11-22,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Automobile companies may report moderation in volumes in the remaining two months of the calendar year after a busy festive season. But that may not affect their stock performance going by the historical trend. The Nifty Auto index has outperformed the benchmark Nifty 50 in November and December in eight out of the past 10 years, according to data compiled by IDFC. Considering the combined performance in these two months, the Auto index has outperformed the broader index by an average 2 per cent return in the past 10 years.

This suggests the cyclicality factor gains higher prominence in the last two months despite lean volume. Neeraj Agarwal, vice president for alternative research, IDFC Securities, believes that due to positive cyclicality effect any decline in the Auto index should be used as an opportunity to take long positions for a target of 9050-9100 levels.


“We expect renewed buying interest to prevail in HeroMotocorp, TVS Motors, Eicher Motors and Maruti,” said Agarwal. The Nifty Auto index closed at 8004 on Thursday.

Over the past decade, the maximum return in the last two months of the year was 17.4 per cent in 2009 and minimum was -14 per cent in 2011.

The Auto index has outperformed the Nifty 50 by 4 per cent and closed in the positive territory for the past three months in a row. The monthly returns of the Nifty Auto index since 2011 shows only once the consecutive gain for three months was followed by profit booking. Profit booking was usually observed after either four months or eight months of consecutive gains."

44,2019-11-22,Eicher,"The ability to generate alpha in times of distress shows the capability of fund managers. And market veteran Sunil Singhania (50) is obsessed with it.

Singhania floated his portfolio management service firm, Abakkus Asset Management, in August 2018. And the first midcap-focused fund he launched delivered around 7-8 per cent return to investors till October 2019. That stood out because midcaps were down in the dumps through this period, with the BSE Midcap Index declining 7 per cent.

Singhania’s firm manages close to Rs 2,000 crore now.

Before floating Abakkus, Singhania also proved his mettle earlier as CIO of Reliance Mutual Fund. Under Singhania, Reliance Growth Fund delivered a 21 per cent return CAGR from 2004 through 2017, outperforming the S&P BSE100’s 14 per cent CAGR returns. Ambit Capital named him in its report on ‘Mastery in Indian Equities’.


Investment strategy
A humble Singhania says he has no fixed formula to discover a stock. “It is not mathematics. It is the combination of a lot of things,” says he.

But Singhania does follow a framework, he calls MEETS, an acronym for management, earnings, events, timing and structure. “That’s our core philosophy in stock selection,” he said.

The Mumbai-based investor said his team does also go through past history of a company and runs various models for stock selection. “We continuously meet companies. And then also, we do secondary research. So it is a combination of a lot of these things put together,” he said.

That approach helped Singhania spot big opportunities Bajaj Finance and Eicher Motors early.


When to sell a stock?
The market veteran asks investors not to sell a stock as long as the company continues to grow and add value. “You should not sell a stock just because the stock price has moved up. I do not think that is the right way of managing a portfolio,” he said.

At the same time, he says when one goes wrong with an investment decision, one should not make any delay in selling a stock. “Investors should also offload a stock if it have moved up too much beyond fair value. Lastly, one can also exit a stock if there is better opportunity elsewhere,” he said.

The right stock price, Singhania says, is a reflection of a lot of different things. “Remember, buying a stock is like becoming a partner in a company,” he insists.

“One should buy a stock if the value of the business is justified at that point of time. It is a must to check management track record and growth prospects before taking any position,” he said.


Tips to investors
According to him an equity investor should invest in stocks only when she is positive on the economy. “In the near term, she might end up making a lot of mistakes and find that the market is rewarding her sufficiently. But ultimately, investing in equity is like investing in a growing asset. In a growing economy, a growing asset class will always give you more returns than any other,” he said.


Why equity market as career?
Singhania says he has always been a voracious reader and did not hide his love for reading balance sheets in his early days. A chartered accountant by profession, he later did CFA.

“I used to practice, but my heart was always in the balance sheet. So, the interest grew and from there on in the mid-90s when the economy started to open up, I got the opportunity to move full time into the equity market,” he said.

Views on the current market
The market veteran finds the current market very challenging, considering the bleak picture of the economy. “Too much money is flowing into so-called quality names and they are trading at 70-75 price-to-earnings and whereas others are trading at significantly lower valuations,” he pointed out. 

“With the Sebi reclassification of stock categories for mutual funds and a general apathy towards midcaps and smallcaps, no one wants to buy smaller companies and, therefore, their valuations are now at significant discount to their largecap peers,” said Singhania.

The value investor said he is currently looking for opportunities in companies that are below Rs 7,000 crore in market capitalisation. “Valuations are in our favour from a longer-term perspective. We are not looking at a particular sector, but the aim is more towards trying to see if we can invest in companies where valuations are in our favour just because technically no one is looking at them,” he said."

NSE Nifty opened on a flat note on Friday, but soon reversed course and extended losses, as the session progressed. The index fell sharply in the first half of the day, but due to some pullback in the later half, it managed to close a tad above the 11,900 level.

The headline index made a lower high and lower Low and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. For the second straight week, Nifty has traded in a narrow range of 171 points, which is the narrowest weekly range in the last six months. It formed a Doji candle on the weekly scale for the third week in a row, which clearly shows lack of momentum in either direction.

Now, the index has to hold above 11,850 levels to witness an upmove towards 12,000-12,103, while on the downside, major support remains at 11,850 and then 11,780 levels.

On the monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest was at 11,900 followed by 11,800 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,100 strike. We have seen meaningful Call writing at 12,000 and then 11,950 strike while minor Put writing was at 11,850 and 11,800 strike. Option data suggests a trading range between 11,800 and 12,100 levels.

India VIX fell 0.72 per cent to 14.87. VIX needs to continue to hold below 15 to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty corrected by 0.76 per cent and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. The index, which concluded the week with a marginal gain of 0.33 per cent, formed a Doji candle on the weekly scale. It continued to make higher highs and higher lows for the sixth consecutive week, and thus the overall trend remains positive. Till the time, it sustains above 30,800, we maintain positive stance for an upside momentum towards 31,500–31,800, while next support is below 30,800 is placed at 30,350.

Nifty futures fell 0.51 per cent to 11,913 level. Builtup of long positions were seen in Zee Entertainment, Equitas, Eicher Motors, Bosch and HDFC, while shorts were seen in Infosys, Hexaware, Wipro, Ambuja Cement and TCS.

46,2019-11-23,Eicher,"I would avoid RBL from the current prices but IndusInd could be a good trading bet to go long from the current levels., says Rahul Shah, VP, Group Leader-Equity Advisory Group, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 


ET Now: What do you make of the markets in the last few weeks?
Rahul Shah: The markets have been obviously in the grip of bulls and we have seen that participation coming across-the-board rather than being skewed towards one or two sectors. Earlier, only financials used to be performers but now, there is a broader participation. It looks like whenever we see a broader base participation, the rally lasts for some more time. 

We saw pharma, autos, NBFCs and a few select pockets bouncing back. Auto and financials also outperformed. The broad-based rally is likely to continue for a while.


ET Now: What do you make of the Zee news?
Rahul Shah: The hangover about promoters defaults go on. This saga has been going on for quite some time. Obviously post this, we saw a good bounceback in the stock. Now, the biggest challenge for the company is corporate governance and how they are going to manage going forward. But in the near term, the stock has rallied as far as it could. I would not buy it at this point of time. In case I have it, I would just ride it .


ET Now: What is your view on the way the telecom names have turned around? Do you think telecom as a pack including Reliance would be a part of your core holding?

Rahul Shah: If you look at the entire play, there is value at some price. That is what we saw in the entire telecom pack last week, post momentum building up in a lot of stocks. Obviously, the top of the mind is Bharti. It looks quite convincing. If I need to play telecom business, then I would definitely bet on Bharti from current levels vis-à-vis others. Reliance also looks good but my sense is that Bharti would be outperformer, if I have to play pure telecom.

ET Now: What do you make of the comeback in names like RBL? Could you include IndusInd Bank in that? Some of the banking and NBFC names that had people worried are slowly and steadily, seeing some interest in the market?
Rahul Shah: Last one year has been very eventful and especially in NBFCs and a few private banking stocks. IndusInd Bank looks quite interesting in terms of valuations and way they have performed in the last two quarters. IndusInd can see some more of upside from current levels. Obviously, the stock has underperformed big time vis-à-vis other private sector banks. 

Again in case of RBL, I feel the way the stock has performed, the upside is quite limited. So, I would avoid RBL from the current prices but IndusInd could be a good bet to go long from the current levels.


ET Now: Any ideas that you would like to share?

Rahul Shah: The financials and a few corporate banks look interesting. Among PSU banks, the State Bank of India looks very attractive at current levels. 

Secondly, insurance as a theme has played very well and there could be some more upsides in select insurance players like SBI Life from the current levels. The stock has corrected from recent highs. We have been liking SBI Life and in auto pack, Eicher could be a good bet from the current levels. We have been recommending these two-three names to our clients."
47,2019-11-24,Eicher,"Benchmark equity indices settled the week flat on US-China trade concerns, premium valuations and lack of fresh triggers after the Q2 results season. The 30-share BSE Sensex added just 2.71 points to end at 40,359 for the week ended November 22. The 50-share Nifty gained 19 points to 11,914.

Here are the top stocks and sectors that created all the buzz during the week gone by.

Top gainers of the week
As many as 22 stocks in the BSE500 index delivered over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week. They included Vodafone Idea (up 78 per cent), UCO Bank (43 per cent), Tejas Networks (38 per cent), Corporation Bank (27 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (24 per cent). Aditya Birla Capital, ITD Cementation, DishTV, IRB Infra, eClerx Services and Coffee Day Enterprises advanced between 15 and 25 per cent.


Top losers of the week
As many as eight stocks on the BSE500 plunged in double digits. Gayatri Projects lost 36 per cent, followed by Reliance Capital (23 per cent), Reliance Infra (22 per cent), Indiabulls Integrated Services (18 per cent) and Time Technoplast (15 per cent). Caplin Point, Reliance Power and Jain Irrigation were among other stocks that fell over 10 per cent.


IPO update: CSB Bank sails on Day 1
Kerala-based CSB Bank’s IPO got fully subscribed on the first day of bidding on Friday. The initial public offering (IPO) received bids for 1,20,87,450 shares against the total issue size of 1,15,54,987 shares, reflecting 1.05 times subscription, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange. The quota reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed 10 per cent, while that for retail investors was subscribed 5.60 times.
In another development from the IPO-mart, realty firm Puranik Builders has filed fresh papers with markets regulator Sebi to raise an estimated Rs 1,000 crore through its initial share-sale.


Telecom stocks ring louder
With a 7.85 per cent rally, the BSE Telecom index emerged the biggest gainer on the exchange. It was followed by Healthcare (up 3.06 per cent), Power (up 0.97 per cent), Metal (up 0.82 per cent) and Bankex (up 0.16 per cent). On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”


Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.
Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team. However, on the other side it added that net cash in the balance sheet fell to Rs 1,480 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 3,240 crore in Q4FY18.


Other Nifty’s top gainers/ losers
With a gain of nearly 9 per cent, Sun Pharma emerged second biggest gainer in the Nifty pack for the week. Bharti Airtel (up 7 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 6.82 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 6 per cent) were among other major gainers in the 50-share pack. On the other hand, Mahindra & Mahindra, YES Bank, Britannia Industries, TCS, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp declined between 4-6 per cent during the week.


Scrips at fresh 52-week highs/lows
In the BSE500 index, Polycab India, Adani Green Energy, Persistent Systems, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and HDFC Asset Management were among 40 firms that hit new 52-week highs. On the other hand, Time Technoplast, Sobha, Gayatri Projects, Blue Dart, Omaxe and Caplin Point hit new 52-week lows.

YES Bank slips
Rana Kapoor sold remaining 0.8 per cent stake in YES Bank during the week, keeping a token 900 shares he once famously said were his “diamonds”. The scrip fell 5.68 per cent to Rs 64.80 during the week.


RIL nears Rs 10 lakh cr valuation
The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark helped by the continuous rise in its share price. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike. With a market value of Rs 9.80 lakh crore, share of the company signed off the week with gains of over 5 per cent at Rs 1,546."

Major trend of the Nifty is positive as declines are being bought into, but Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035, and then a lifetime high of 12103, according to technical analysts. They are bullish on HDFC, RBL Bank, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE, Maruti Suzuki and L&T.


Where are we: Nifty has been consolidating in a range of 250 points in between 11800 and 12038 zones from last 16 trading sessions. It witnessed some profit booking from higher levels in last two sessions but forming Doji candles for third consecutive week, indicating a tug of war between Bulls and Bears. However major trend of the index is positive as declines are being bought into but requires a decisive range breakout with follow up action to commence the next leg of rally.


What is in store: Now Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035 then life time high of 12103 while on the downside major support exists at 11800-11780 zones. Bank Nifty is outperforming from last couple of weeks and till the time it sustains above 30800 mark, we maintain our positive stance for an upside momentum towards 31500 then 31783 zones while next support below 30800 is placed at 30500-30300 zones.

What traders can do: Nifty has got stuck in a range where declines are bought but follow up is missing so better to use Bull Call Spread or Call Ladder Spread with the view that positive to range bound bias could continue. Aggressive option traders can do the short strangle or Call writing to get the benefit of time decay. On stocks, we have a positive view on HDFC, Bosch, Eicher Motors, RBL Bank, Exide Industries, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE while weakness is likely in Infosys, TCS, Petronet and Havells."

The domestic stock market on Tuesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 19 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.


• HSBC has maintained buy rating on 
Reliance Industries and raised target price to Rs 1700 from Rs 1565. The brokerage has rraised target price to factor in expectations of higher earnings for both Jio and Retail business. The stock is trading at an FY22 estmated EV/EBITDA of 8 times, similar to its 10-year historical average, said HSBC. Steady earnings momentum with emerging signs of a strong outlook for both the telecom and retail businesses and an inexpensive valuation drive the buy rating, said HSBC. The stock ended up 0.9 per cent at Rs 1560.70 on Monday.

• Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on 
Dilip Buildcon and lowered target price to Rs 504 from Rs 772. Interest remains low in road EPC stocks as NHAI ordering has been slow, but risk reward is attractive, said Morgan Stanley. Dilip Buildcon is focussed on improving execution in the second half and reducing debt, said Morgan Stanley. Given its diversified and large order book, Dilip Buildcon has reasonable earnings visibility, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.3 per cent at Rs 410.95 on Monday.


• Kotak Securities has retained add rating on 
Greenply Industries and lowered target price to Rs 172 from Rs 187. Greenply reported healthy earnings growth on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter led by expansion in operating margins and benefit of low tax rate, said Kotak Securities. Plywood volume growth in the quarter was low at 2 per cent, said Kotak Securities. Management expects revenue in 2HFY20 to grow by 8-10 per cent YoY, translating into FY20 revenue growth of 7-8 per cent, the brokerage said. The stock ended down 0.5 per cent at Rs 160.30 on Monday.

• CLSA has maintained outperform rating on 
Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 24000. Meeting the BS6 emission norms remains a key nearterm product focus, but Royal Enfield intends to intensify launches subsequently, said CLSA. A big network expansion is underway in India, and Royal Enfield is looking to build on the recent traction in exports, it said. The stock ended up 2.1 per cent at Rs 23267.60 on Monday.

• Credit Suisse has maintained neutral rating on 
Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of Rs 500. Unit IV will likely require a re-inspection to resolve Form 483 observations and, therefore, approvals from Unit IV may be stuck for at least one year, said Credit Suisse. Unit IV accounts for 30 per cent of the pending ANDAs, which typically have higher margins, it said. Almost half of pending ANDAs could now be stuck with a warning letter on Unit XI and Form 483 on Units VII and IV. Next key catalyst is completion of the Sandoz deal, it said. The stock ended up 2.7 per cent at Rs 440.45 on Monday."
51,2019-11-26,Eicher,"CLSA has maintained outperform rating on Eicher Motors in the long term with a target price of Rs 24,000. The stock ended up 2.1% at Rs 23267.60 on Monday while the BSE Sensex closed 529.82 points up at 40,889.23.


Company Financials

 For the quarter ended 30-09-2019, the company has reported consolidated sales of Rs 2171.54 crore, down -8.03% from last quarter sales of Rs 2361.24 crore and down -9.34% from last year same quarter sales of Rs 2395.22 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 564.39 crore in the latest quarter. 


Investment Rationale 

Meeting the BS6 emission norms remains a key nearterm product focus, but Royal Enfield intends to intensify launches subsequently, said CLSA. A big network expansion is underway in India, and Royal Enfield is looking to build on the recent traction in exports, it said."
54,2019-11-27,Eicher,"This time, sectors which were underperforming have also given good gains like metals from recent lows of 20% or auto ancillaries, select NBFC names as well as telecom. Among auto, two-wheelers are more promising and Eicher and Bajaj Auto are the two picks, says Rahul Shah, VP, Broking & Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 


Nifty at an all-time high, economic indicators are at an all-time low. What are you telling your clients – focus on the economy and book profits or focus on the market and start buying more because momentum is strong? Momentum versus economy or momentum versus data points, which data points are you focussing on?
As you said, economic data have been disappointing but that was forecast a quarter ago. We had anticipated a slowdown and there could be more pain in the economy. Post that, the government has made announcements for the economy. We believe the downturn is going to be behind us in the next couple of months or so.

We would continue going with the markets and this time, the participation has been broad-based and it is not just about sticking to a few select names which we have seen earlier. The sectors which were underperforming have also given good gains like metals from recent lows of 20% or auto ancillaries, select NBFC names as well as telecom. All these sectors have made good gains from lower levels. 

It is a broad-based market and it is going to continue and quality which is performing will still keep on performing. There could be some more upside on the markets from the current levels.


From market standpoint, now Zee problem is solved and Yes Bank, hopefully. will be able to raise capital. These are the hanging swords. Do you think these issues have been sorted out? What does it mean for the rest of the sector?Definitely, it looks like things have been sorted out. We saw Zee do it. Most probably, even YES Bank will be able to do it and because of that, we have seen the upside also. The stock has rallied also from the lower levels. I do not see much major upside in the stock.

Secondly, a very important aspect is corporate governance for these companies. I still do not have any better view on the entire pack. There could be a bounce back in the stock. But I would really exit the stock in this kind of rally. 


What is your call on auto? Would it still be a little cautious or would you be looking at value buys?We would definitely be looking at a value buy. We saw the first round of runup as most auto stocks ran up 15% to 20% from their recent lows. Now, only the stocks which have value and have good fundamentals in terms of valuation, would go up. Two-wheelers look more promising in that space. Eicher is the one what we have been liking. Second is Bajaj Auto. In terms of the valuation, these look very attractive. These two stocks could see some more upside from the current level.


As a firm, you track RBL very closely. If one works with the assumption that they will be able to raise capital, what happens next?If I look at the valuations, then it is all done at this point of time. If they are able to, then we will see some kind of runup in the stock. There could be a good run up for another 10-15% or so. But that is it. I do not think so major upside is coming in RBL Bank from the current level. I would avoid building any positions in RBL from current prices."

55,2019-11-28,Eicher,"We are allocating 30-40% in trend/momentum/higher valuation stocks; 20-25% odd on contra bets and about 25-30% in historically good performing stocks facing growth pressures, says Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The massive move in ICICI Bank following the increase in MSCI weightage is now finally over, but the stock is up 40% this year. How much further can it go up in the near term?One way is to look at some other stocks from some other sectors. FMCG is the top of the mind. If we look at the performance of the stocks from those sectors, beginning 2019, there were lots of discussion on how the FMCG sector has had 3-4 years of outperformance and that 2019 will probably not be the year for FMCG. But today, at the end of the year, we see 2019 again was the year of FMCGs along with some others. 

About 12-14 months ago, ICICI Bank was at a stage wherein all the negative news had been built into its price and valuations, its financial performance. The stock price by then underperformed for almost two and a half years, based on various developments. It has come out from there, so that is one part. 

The other part is, today we are in a market where over the last one-and-a-half-year, corporate governance issues have been coming more and more in focus. As a result, for any investor -- be it global or domestic -- who is cautious about these issues, the investible universe is continuing to shrink.


Your life should be easy if the universe of investing is reducing! All you need to do is bother about 15 stocks. It has never been great for fund managers this year. Where would you go if you want to get out of those 15 stocks?Let me also now throw in my spanner. Over the last two months, Nifty rose 10% but none of the traditionally performing stocks have contributed to business.


Reliance has added.Reliance is an exception.


HDFC Bank has added. ICICI Bank has added.Let me give you some numbers.Some of the stock names that I am taking are with the disclosure and are not investment recommendations. Sun Pharma and Cipla have roughly moved 20% in the last two months. Reliance has been one outperformer. Auto stocks rose 30%. Tata Motors is one of the underdogs. Within banking, we have completely different set of stocks. YES Bank, ICICI and SBI are historical laggards. So, life is not that easy. Last two months have been difficult but over the medium term, it could probably come back to being easy.


What do you do at Rs 500 plus levels on ICICI Bank?I am still positive. We have not bought recently but we have been holding it in some of our clients portfolios.


You are not taking profits anywhere?Not right now.


It does not matter whether it is momentum or liquidity, if prices are going higher, NAVs will go higher. How do you invest in this market when growth is bad and the economy is not recovering, flows are strong and markets are at an all-time high? If you take a view on the economy, you cannot be bullish but if you take a view on the flows, you cannot be bearish!That is a very big dilemma that we face as money managers. I am sure everybody else faces it including retail investors. Sometimes you have to take the trend as an indicator. The market is telling that at the end of the day, there is one way of looking at the market and that price is God. If you take that as a hypothesis and try to analyse the July, August, September data (I have not got October data), the government expenditure has gone up. July was roughly 25% up over last year July; August was 30% up and September 35% -- both capex and opex. That probably is indicating something. 


On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence. It is difficult to justify. That makes it difficult to make money in the market.-Kunj Bansal
If the government has continued a similar expenditure in October and November, it is a matter of time that the secondary effect -- the cyclical effect of that money flow will come into the economy and things will start easing out. So that is one way to look at it. 

The second way is smart money is always ahead. The market moves at least six months ahead of what developments we are able to see as analysts or fund managers or when actual numbers come. As an investment strategy, what I am doing or what we are doing is nothing particular; but very broadly speaking, 30-40% are plays in trend/momentum/higher valuations; 20-25% odd are contra bets, say into auto and auto ancillaries. About 25-30% we are trying to play in historically good performing stocks which have faced growth pressures in the last five-six quarters because of the environment but as a result valuations are relatively cheaper. On an absolute basis you have to take a medium to long-term call.


TVS and Hero MotoCorp and Eicher in last two years would have given terrible returns. It is 36% lower for TVS Motor and 24% lower for Eicher.Let me throw in some additional numbers. Coincidentally, it was not in auto but related to it -- auto ancillaries, more specifically tyres. A similar divergence has been there if we look at five-year numbers. On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence to add to your OEM manufacturers numbers. It is difficult to justify. That makes investing very difficult and makes it difficult to make money in the market. 

Having said that, obviously some of the factors which have worked and what works for Bajaj Auto is export. Also the fact that management was very clear that at the expense of margin, at the expense of doing some discounting sales, they would focus on top line, on volumes. I do not know about the exact market share they have gained but very clearly, it worked in their favour.


Should one subscribe to the SBI Card IPO?I have not looked at the numbers in detail. Let us look at the two other IPOs. CSB Bank IPO closed recently and it was 87 times subscribed.


For a Rs 400-crore, they got Rs 4,000 crore.Where is the risk averse mindset and where is the lack of liquidity? We are going to have the Ujjivan Small Finance IPO. I am not sure if that will attract a similar kind of subscription, interest or over subscription. The reason being that today anybody -- whether a consumer who is buying goods or services in the market or an investor -- is telling me give me a good deal and my money is here. Quality should be there and value should be there. Price offering, valuations should be there. Now, that was not exactly the case with CSB Bank whose financials are not as great, but the brand name of the promoters, partly the valuation got it that kind of subscription. 

Coming to the SBI Card IPO, I still have to look at the numbers in detail but if the financial numbers are reasonably good and valuation offered is cheaper, the market is desperate for opportunities to invest. So, we should see that kind of investment.


What do you do with YES Bank? They are all set for a mega fund raising of about $1.2 billion.Something should come out now. It is high time. Because we have had the names of the sundry Tom, Dick and Harry but nothing has come till now, which is unfortunate. It should not become a story of crying wolf too many times because then the market will really be disappointed. Market has given YES Bank a benefit of doubt and has brought the share up from Rs 25-30 to almost Rs 70 today. Without any concrete development, the stock will be brought down equally fast. So let us see. 

But if we have some concrete names, some actual action on money coming in, around the current levels, YES Bank will have its floor price. From here to go up, we will continue to need developments and announcements in terms of the next one, two, three, four quarters’ financial numbers, some improvement in business, some reduction in divergence with RBI’s audit, NPA control and all those things. But the basic requirement is that capital should come in."

56,2019-11-29,Eicher,"ET Intelligence Group: Boards of Indian companies are slightly bigger and more independent than they were five years ago. However, they lag the global trend on independence.

The median number of directors on boards of 87 of the BSE 100 Index companies stood at 11, with 53.3% members being independent, data from Bloomberg show.

Five years ago, the median number of directors stood at ten, with 50% members being independent. Ten was found to be the most common board size for India Inc, with 50% being the most common proportion of independent directors on board.

India Inc is in line with America Inc on the board size but not on independence. As per the Spencer Stuart 2018 S&P 500 Board Index, the average S&P 500 board had 10.8 directors, with 85% of the boards being independent. The range of board size is wider in India — from four to 22 — whereas S&P 500 boards range in size from five to 18 members. In 2018-19, L&T had the biggest board with 22 members, half of whom are independent. The company had a 14-member board in 2014-15.



Incidentally, five of the top ten companies having the biggest boards are public sector undertakings (PSUs), with power generation company NTPC having the biggest board with 18 members.

Most PSUs have seen a significant increase in the board size, but not necessarily accompanied with a corresponding increase in their independence. While the Companies Act 2013 provides for a maximum limit of 15 directors on board of a company, a company may appoint a higher number by passing a special resolution.

Incidentally, for majority of the companies the size of the board doesn’t have much relation to its independence. While L&T, with its biggest board, has half of its members as independent directors, Eicher Motors, with the smallest board size of four directors in FY19 had three-fourths of its board independent.

The Companies Act mandates one-third of the board to be independent. Both Dr Reddy’s Labs and Maruti Suzuki have 12 members each on their respective boards, but the former has the most independent board with 83% of its directors being independent and the latter (along with Petronet LNG) has the least independent board with one-third (the mandatory limit) of its members being independent.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries figures among the list of BSE100 companies with the smallest boards, with eight directors, as well as being among the least independent one, with 37.5% independent directors.

Analysts are divided on whether the board size and independence influence a company’s performance. While the agency theory (directors as agents of shareholders on the board) and the resource dependency theory (directors providing direct or indirect access to resources) suggest a positive relation between board size and firm’s performance, the stewardship theory (directors act as stewards maximising shareholder interest) hints at a negative relation between the two and favours a smaller board. The optimum size of a board has been pegged at 8-10 directors."

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meet kicks off today. With GDP at a six-year low, is it a given that RBI would be cutting rates sixth time in a row?They will be cutting rates. I hope they cut by 25 bps rather than 15 bps. But given the fiscal situation and how high government borrowing has become, we should also recognise that rate transmission is going to be muted. But it will be astonishing if given the economic weakness all around us, the MPC does not cut rates.


But if the rate transmission is not going to happen, the RBI can continue cutting rates but that is not really going to reflect in the real economy!Yes, that is right. So what we need is for the government to continue pushing reforms from Delhi. I remain very hopeful of land and labour reforms. It was extremely encouraging to see the beginnings of labour reform process last week. The government proposed and tabled in parliament last week a bill which allows companies to employee people for fixed terms and if this labour reform process continues through the winter and is accompanied by land reforms in the budget session of parliament, that is as good a tonic as we can get, after the 15% tax rate. 

The budget should contain middle class tax cuts. Once you have cut corporate tax rates, a cut in middle class taxes would also make sense. A combination of tax cuts, land reforms, labour reforms should help. It is difficult to see what more the government can do on the reforms front. If we can get that, it will be far more tangible as a kicker to the economy than RBI rate cuts.


Are you expecting the government to tweak the income tax slabs and provide any stimulus?From fiscal arithmetic and economic stimulus perspectives, it makes sense to give people lower down the income spectrum greater tax relief. Whether you do that by cutting the tax rates or by increasing the slabs is a matter of detail that the government will be on top of. But I think giving people at the 5 lakh, 10 lakh, 15 lakh income levels greater tax relief is a far more potent economic stimulus than trying to give the richer people tax breaks. 

So my recurring theme is there will be tax breaks for the middle class, lower middle class coming through in the budget. The only question is the extent and how much of a fiscal hit the government is willing to take. Whether that would be accompanied by GST cuts is a big question. I do not have answers to that. There is talk that there might be rationalisation of GST. I hope it is done because the GST structure is a little too complicated out there. 

If we can rationalise GST, bring down direct taxes for individuals alongside the already announced corporate tax rates, that will probably be the biggest scale back in Indian taxes for a long time but that obviously will have fiscal costs. This is where we go back to privatisation. If the BPCL privatisation goes through even in the next six months, that will be the biggest privatisation in nearly 20 years. There is lots happening for the market to mull even as the economy struggles.


What do you make of fundraising activity of RBL Bank and YES Bank? How circumspect has the market been on who the investor is who is putting in money?I am not so sure that the fundraising activities are signalling a turn in the cost of capital cycle for our lenders. The last year and a half has been very circumspect on both private banks and NBFCs, especially the private banks with weaker CASA franchises. 

I am not sure the market is yet signalling great deal of enthusiasm in injecting money into banks whose CASA franchise is weak and whose credit selection has been pretty questionable. Perhaps another six months of economic reforms will see a much healthier fund raising climate for our private sector lenders.


What are you making of the unfolding of news in the telecom space? Do you feel that they will manage to get themselves out of the current mess or is it still looking bearish for the next few years?In a way, telecom is a classic example of what the rest of our economy and the rest of our stock market is going through. 

I am not sure the market is yet signalling great deal of enthusiasm in injecting money into banks whose CASA franchise is weak and whose credit selection has been pretty questionable.-Saurabh Mukherjea

We are ending up concentrating every sector into the hands of one or two players. Telecom is heading towards a duopoly type situation. Similarly, in the case of private sector banking, there are two very strong banks; in NBFCs, there one or two very strong NBFCs/HFCs. This concentration of economic power into the hands of one or two champions, whilst the rest of the sector is struggling is becoming the defining hallmark of our economy and therefore our stock market. 

I used to believe that this was limited to sectors like FMCG -- in paints, cooking oil or biscuits. But it now seems to be spreading towards the broader economy and that means we will end up with one or two massive winners where you can make lots of money and then lots of small companies who fall by the wayside to the detriment of their shareholders and employees. It is a very new phase of capitalism in our country where one or two people take away the riches from the sector and the rest of the people are left holding very little.


An interesting note by JP Morgan is saying take profits in the ongoing resolution trade. They are saying the key challenge for the financial sector is credit growth and earnings as well as ROE visibility. Having said that, they continue to be bullish on the top brass of the financials. Do you believe that time has come to be a little more selective within financials? For the 11 years I have lived in India, I have always believed it is worthwhile being selective in Indian financials. We have a very few cautious conservative lenders who use their shareholders’ and depositors’ money wisely for better or for worse. We have more cowboys than cautious lenders in our financial services sector. What has happened is because of the tightening of capital markets, the concentration of market share in the hands of the cautious lenders is increasing rapidly. So, it is Bajaj Finance and HDFC on the non-bank lender side and HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank on the private sector bank side. 

When capital market conditions are tight, the concentration of lending activity in the hands of a few lenders becomes more pronounced. This has very profound ramifications if you assume that in the next 10 years, credit growth in our country would be 10% as opposed to 13% in the preceding decade. Assume that HDFC Bank’s market share goes from the current 7% to say 10% at decade end, that tells us there is a pretty high degree of probability of HDFC Bank becoming 10 times larger than it is today in 10 years; a lender which will be significantly larger than a bank like JP Morgan, which is the world’s most valuable bank, and which lends significantly more than what JP Morgan does today. 

If you take the changes in our country and see the longer picture, it gives you a very clear picture of a few giants who makes lots of money for their employees, for their shareholders, for their stakeholders and then lots of smaller companies who are not able to deal with this far more difficult phase of capitalism we are undergoing in our country.


Do you see some kind of status quo continuing until and unless we hear something from the Budget or do you expect to see signs of a turnaround as early as next year?The status quo is going to be hard to maintain whichever way we look at it, given how stressed the economy is. I reckon the government will keep its foot firmly on the reform pedal. There is no elections in the next 15-16 months. There is no reason why the government will take its foot off the reform pedal. 

If the government keeps its foot on the reform pedal, on land reforms, labour reforms and on tax cuts, I reckon we should see an economic recovery next year because the stock markets are already beginning to discount that. 

It is discounting it a little bit indiscriminately in all sorts of weaker companies. Some of the weaker companies were rallying once again with no apparent justification but as the reform process bears out, the stock market will discount a recovery and my reckoning is it will discount the recovery in terms of saying here are the best franchises to play if we see a leaner, meaner, more efficient Indian economy over the next five to 10 years.


Anything new that is catching your eye or that you are observing from a near term perspective?My view is increasingly getting stronger that it does make sense to play the best auto OEMs in terms of the best ROCEs, cash generation capability, franchise strength ahead of the numbers kicking in. I do not think the auto numbers are yet showing any significant recovery -- whether it is for trucks, cars or motorbikes. I reckon two-wheelers will come back quicker than trucks because of the sheer ticket size.

It makes sense for people to look at the two-wheeler OEMs and choose one where they think the probability of a decisive recovery is greatest. For some of our clients’ portfolios, we have bought some Eicher Motors over the last month or so given the strength of the Royal Enfield franchise. We will be looking for more bargains in the sector looking at the OEMs as well to see amongst the OEMs which have strong, high quality franchises and great relationships with the dealer distributor community. Given their valuations, there is at going to be one or two bargains in the auto OEMs that will come through quite strongly in the next couple of years."
9,2019-12-03,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Nifty50 has failed to extend the rally the way it was expected to, after it breached the crucial 12,000-12,050 range.

But analysts believe the broader market trend is intact and the index would head for the 12,400 level sooner than later after a brief consolidation.

A few dozen stocks from the broader market are already showing buildup of momentum, suggests moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator formed a bullish crossover on 45 counters on NSE, hinting at possible upsides. Strong trading volumes on many of these counters are lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Coal India, JSW Energy, Havells India, Pidilite Industries, SREI Infra, LT Foods and Radico Khaitan besides Trent, ABB India, Lovable Lingerie and JK Lakshmi Cement.




The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data also showed 53 stocks are showing bearish trends. They included Dish TV, ICICI Bank, Suven Life Sciences, Central Bank, SPARC, IRB Infra and Eicher Motors, among others.




Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

As for Nifty outlook, Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking believes there is no sign of weakness in the market so far. “We remain optimistic and expect the index to surpass the 12,150 mark and go beyond in the near term. Traders are advised to keep a positive bias and use dips as a buying opportunity. The 12,000-11,883 range is likely to offer good support to the index,” he said.

“The trend may become bullish, once Nifty crosses above the 12,150 level,” said Amit Shah of Indiabulls Ventures. “In such a case, Nifty can move swiftly to the 12,400 level,” he said.

Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of Pidilite Industries shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown an upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.02 per cent higher at Rs 1,320 on NSE in a depressed market."
12,2019-12-04,Eicher,"Ambit Capital has retained buy rating on Eicher Motors and raised target price in the long term to Rs 24,673 against Rs 23,059 earlier. The stock ended down 1.7% at Rs 21359.65 on Tuesday while BSE Sensex closed 126.72 points down at 40,675.45.


Company Financials

 For the quarter ended 30-09-2019, the company has reported consolidated sales of Rs 2171.54 crore, down -8.03% from last quarter sales of Rs 2361.24 crore and down -9.34 % from last year same quarter sales of Rs 2395.22 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 564.39 crore in latest quarter. 

 The company’s top management includes Mr.Inder Mohan Singh, Mr.S Sandilya, Mr.Siddhartha Lal, Mr.Vinod Aggarwal, Mr.Vinod K Dasari, Ms.Manvi Sinha. Company has S R Batliboi & Co. LLP as its auditors. As on 30-09-2019, the company has a total of 27,289,722 shares outstanding. 

Investment Rationale

After wholesales declined around 22% over February-September 2019, Royal Enfield has around 17 days inventory and clocking flat to mid-single digit yearon-year decline in retails, said Ambit. Interaction with dealers suggests around 20% rise in monthly retails vs pre-festive demand, even without help of lower priced Bullet-X/Classic-S, the brokerage said. Royal Enfield would deliver around 12% volume CAGR in FY20-22, post around 11% decline in FY20, said Ambit."
14,2019-12-04,Eicher,"We are likely to see more downward revisions to the already lowered earnings estimates for both FY20 and FY21, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

If you were to stick your neck out, which is the stock that we are going to be talking about?There are trends that one would need to pick up like insurance and asset management companies. But, the price is also important. 


Santa seems to have come early this year. What is the setup looking like for the rest of the month?The data points that have emerged of late are giving investors a bit of concern vis-a-vis the price movement being matched by the underlying reality. There are some green shoots but those green shoots need to be further endorsed. Auto sales were decent in October but was bad again in November. That is getting people worried. Obviously, there are sector specific issues. An emission norm shift is happening. There is a calendar year shift for vehicles but having said that, the overall manufacturing data raises concerns about growth because A) that will take time to mend; and B) the amount of rate cut and excess liquidity that you have seen in the system plus the way the government has been extending credit to MSMEs, through the PSB outreach programme. All that will probably take more time to show up in growth numbers. 

Till that time, on an immediate term, you are likely to see more downward revisions to the already lowered earnings estimates for both FY20 and FY21. What is disturbing is that even as we roll forward to FY21, there is not much optimism in terms of actual earnings estimates.


JP Morgan has come out with a headline called Tactical Research Idea. We believe the share fall in State Bank of India will be less and there is time to revisit State Bank of India purely based on the valuations.As you said, it is a tactical name. Maybe they are trying to forecast near term price movements, but having said that, there is enough news flow to justify that GST revenues have picked up and crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time in recent past, That is definitely a boost. SBI ownership is not as high as perhaps the private financials which has been the trade for pretty much the whole of last couple of years. 

So, as the IBC process starts happening, more cases are settled and the credit growth in the system picks up, SBI will start showing more confidence. Plus, obviously there is liquidity, even in terms of them getting selling stake in their cards business. From a valuation basis, it is a good franchise and from a two- to three-year perspective, if one were to take a call on which way the Indian banking system is likely to go for, we think it would be PSU banks and perhaps SBI as the torch- bearer would be the preferred bet amongst all the others. 


Does it make sense to buy ICICI Bank afresh even at these levels?Well, between ICICI Bank and SBI, I would be more comfortable with SBI because there you are likely to see the government talking of some sort of relaxation on the GST slabs, you are looking at the IPO liquidity and the fact that in case of rate cut, the transmission is more seamless in a PSU bank rather than a private franchise. I would probably be better off looking at SBI even on a shorter-term basis.


The overhang for Zee is over but the overhang for the stock is not over yet?We are getting these reports about directors mentioning corporate governance lapses and the management clarifying on that. There is too much news flow leading to abrupt price gyrations. But the underlying business is there; subscriber growth is there while advertising growth is not as strong as one would have liked. But the business is available at Rs 28,000-29,000 crore, There is enough merit for one to take a slightly long-term view, assuming that once we come out of this downturn, things will come back to normal. You are getting almost one-third eyeball share of the India market. So, is the franchise valuable? The answer is yes. 

People would tend to take a view that if all these things are behind us and now with Punit Goenka being firmly established as the person to take the company forward with the backing of the investors. If that is a settled deal, people would want to take a slightly longer term view as to how the franchise would shape up.


I never thought Eicher would be a 30x. It may be an exception but the number three player, TVS, has given 10x returns?In Eicher, when the yearly sales of 60,000 Royal Enfields suddenly becomes your monthly sales, obviously there is a 10-12x kind of a revenue impact. In case of TVS, what changed was their entry into scooters. They captured the entire scooter segment for a fairly long period of time. And to that extent, it was a virtual monopoly. 

People who have participated in the TVS story, clearly were playing the scooter shift rather than the discretionary motorbike because Royal Enfield was a very high priced bike, whereas in the scooter segment, the TVS’s Jupiter was a Rs 40,000 scooter and that saw the numbers come in at a fast clip for TVS. That is clearly reflected in the stock price as well.

There are concerns today that even today it is perhaps an auto major which is available at a single digit margin. So the margin story has still not played out but the capture of the scooter market growth is completely a TVS story. 


A sector like auto is not like centred around startup or AI or big data. It has bikes. Royal Enfield is the oldest platform in India. The same bike has made a come back and that stock has given 30x returns, That just means stock picking made a lot of difference.It is actually a function of the way customer preference and consumer demand shapes up. For example, in a market like India, on one end, the sub Rs 50,000 scooter market is doing well and at the same time, a Rs 1,50,000 Royal Enfield is also growing at almost 12x the volume. 

Eicher used to sell about 60,000 vehicles per annum about eight years back. Today, they sell that in a month."

11,2019-12-04,Eicher,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Wednesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 36 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Ambit Capital has retained buy rating on 
Eicher Motors and raised target price to Rs 24,673 against Rs 23,059 earlier. After wholesales declined around 22 per cent over February-September 2019, Royal Enfield has around 17 days inventory and clocking flat to mid-single digit yearon-year decline in retails, said Ambit. Interaction with dealers suggests around 20 per cent rise in monthly retails vs pre-festive demand, even without help of lower priced Bullet-X/Classic-S, the brokerage said. Royal Enfield would deliver around 12 per cent volume CAGR in FY20-22, post around 11 per cent decline in FY20, said Ambit. The stock ended down 1.7 per cent at Rs 21359.65 on Tuesday.

• Edelweiss has upgraded 
Bajaj Auto to buy from hold and raised target price to Rs 3651 from Rs 3162. The brokerage believes Bajaj Auto is better positioned than peers to handle the BS-VI transition as around 40 per cent of its exports will be immune to the change and domestic three-wheeler cargo segment will also benefit. The brokerage also sees perceptible change in management's approach with focus on sales, after sales etc rrather than just products. The stock ended up 3.2 per cent at Rs 3261.35 on Tuesday.


• CLSA has retained buy rating on 
Bharti Airtel and raised target price to Rs 560 from Rs 515. Bharti Airtel has raised prepaid tariffs by 15-40 per cent and has factored in around 40 per cent hikes by FY22 versus 35 per cent factored earlier, said CLSA. Given Bharti Airtel’s higher-than-expected tariff hikes and forecasts upgrade CLSA expects it to deliver a 24 per cent compounded growth in EBITDA over FY21-22. Bharti Airtel’s aggressive network rollouts and superior execution could drive upsides to market-share forecast of 30 per cent by FY22, said CLSA. The stock ended up 0.1 per cent at Rs 58.95 on Tuesday.

• Citigroup has buy rating on 
Biocon with a target price of Rs 350 after the company and Mylan announced launch of Ogivri in the US. This ticks off another box in Biocon’s biosimilars journey in developed markets — it was the first to market with biosimilar PegFilgrastim and the first to launch both strengths of biosimilar Trastuzumab, the brokerage said. The stock ended flat at Rs 285.90 on Tuesday.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has an add rating on 
HDFC Life Insurance Company with a fair value of Rs 605. HDFC Life will remain at the cusp of innovation and hence a bellwether for the life insurance industry, said Kotak Institutional. Other large players have not forayed much into non-par business , following a deferred annuity policy launched last year and Sachay Plus early this year, said Kotak Institutional. The stock ended up 2.7 per cent at Rs 584.85 on Tuesday."
19,2019-12-05,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Rate sensitive auto, realty and bank stocks slipped in Thursday's session after the RBI Governor Shaktikanta Dasheaded monetary policy committee (MPC) maintained status quo on policy rates in its fifth bimonthly monetary policy review of the financial year.

This halt came after five consecutive cuts. The shortterm lending rate, or repo rate, was unchanged at 5.15 per cent.

The decision was made even as GDP fell to a 6year low of 4.5 per cent in the September quarter. A few economists said that an aggressive rate cut was unlikely as the headline inflation now stands at around 4.6 per cent, above the RBI’s target, mainly on account of higher food inflation.

The Nifty Auto index was trading 0.49 per cent down at 7957.25 while the Nifty Bank index was trading 0.53 per cent down at 31,808.95 around 11:51 am. Also, the Nifty Realty index fell 0.16 per cent to 284.90.

Shares of Motherson Sumi Systems (down 1.96 per cent) , Tata Motors (down 1.42 per cent), Bharat Forge (down 1.27 per cent) , Ashok Leyland (down 0.97 per cent) , Amara Raja Batteries (down 0.97 per cent) , Bosch (down 0.81 per cent) , MRF (down 0.51 per cent) , Exide Industries (down 0.45 per cent) , Maruti Suzuki (down 0.38 per cent) , Mahindra & Mahindra (down 0.35 per cent) , Hero MotoCorp (down 0.32 per cent) , Eicher Motors (down 0.18 per cent) and Bajaj Auto (down 0.04 per cent) were the top losers in the auto index.

18,2019-12-05,Eicher,"Ujjivan has been oversubscribed phenomenally over 100 odd times but it is trading at the valuation band of the IPO. It is still trading at a huge discount to Bandhan Bank or Credit Gramin. It is a good 30-40% discount, says Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC.

The recent spate of issues have seen fairly enthusiastic appetite, even if they have been smaller sized issues in the financial space. Nonetheless, markets seem to have snapped them up. Have you been following that as well?Yes, indeed and CSB has had a very good listing. Even after the listing, the 50% pop in prices probably would be trading at about 2.6 times book. This is a bank which is on a turnaround and where its GNPAs are coming down, net NPAs are coming down, it’s mix is improving towards retail and so the case is building up. The valuation can sustain even at the 2.6-2.7 times. From that perspective, as long as it continues to turnaround, the valuation will hold up.

 Second, Ujjivan has been oversubscribed phenomenally over 100 odd times but it is trading at the valuation band of the IPO. It is still trading at a huge discount to Bandhan Bank or Credit Gramin. It is a good 30-40% discount. It is trading at two times book and whereas these companies are trading at about four times plus book. So against that backdrop, on listing, if the overall market holds up, you will see an extremely strong uptick in Ujjivan on the listing day and find support thereafter. 

One stock which is showing relative strength and is sitting at a multi-week high is Bajaj Auto. Autos are in almost a doomsday situation but most of the auto stocks are back from the recent lows and Bajaj Auto is outperforming. Chakri Lokapriya: Bajaj Auto valuations still look fine. It has outperformed M&M as well as the others. Hero MotoCorp is still negative. Against this backdrop, they have made the right moves in terms of the future which is launching of the EV scooters. The existing bunch of vehicles have found the right price points. So, you are seeing a demand pickup at the low end of the bikes which was down in the previous quarter. Against this backdrop, momentum will continue with the BS-VI coming up in a couple of months. 


Would Bharti Airtel prospects be a little more hopeful after the fund raising?After this fund raise, Bharti’s leverage will come down quite decently -- from about 4 times to about 3 times. Plus, the tariff increases are going on. We will expect to see some more tariff increases. A combination of both these things will improve the balance sheet fairly strongly. Yes it will still be a high debt company at over three times debt, but it is improving. Against this backdrop, the fundamentals are improving. With a combination of tariff hikes and capital raise, I would be a buyer at the current levels in Bharti.


How should one look at aviation, especially in the light of the news on IndiGo?Aviation is still a trading sector. SpiceJet is adding capacity at a far higher rate, expanding far faster and expanding into business class which IndiGo has not and that will probably protect IndiGo’s margins to some extent. But SpiceJet needs to grab market share and this is the time for them to do that. 

So, aviation is good for trading, Stay away if you are a long-term investor. 


If oil is refusing to go above $70 and if that is one third of the total cost for any airline, why should one be bearish on airlines?That would be because airlines have always been subject to the vagaries of oil price movements. On the other hand, there is the aviation industry’s inability to raise tariffs and the air ticket prices beyond a certain level. And then the regulator ensures that the price points do not move beyond a point. Against this backdrop, the airlines have historically not been good in their ATF purchases. 

A combination of all these three factors make airlines stocks, not just in India, but globally good positional trades and not long-term investments. 


What is the impact of UTI listing on SBI or BOB? Both are looking to monetise whatever they can. SBI is planning to take the credit card business public. They have taken their life insurance business public. They have plans to also take the general insurance business public also. It looks like banks are doing whatever it takes, to raise capital or monetise the market.
Yes, in fact, all the banks require capital. SBI does not need capital but all PSU banks do need capital. They need over Rs 50,000 crore in the coming year. Against that backdrop, SBI is a very strong bank within the terms of capital. 

Among all the AMCs, the valuations of HDFC as well as Reliance Nippon are fairly high. So, offloading its mutual fund business stake would help it gain good valuations. On the other hand, credit card is a brand new growth sector in India. Post demonetisation, millennials are using more credit cards versus cash, etc. So that is a growth path and therefore that will also command good valuations. 

Against this backdrop, insurance is a growing space. All these three areas will be good for the valuation of SBI in particular and the space in general will see good response from the IPO market.


 Eicher has been one of the outperformers of the decade. So have been City Union Bank and HDFC Bank. Which one would you bet on, not for the next 10 years, but the next three years? Where you would say I will buy that stock and not sell it for three to four years?We might as well stick with one of the largest companies in India -- Reliance Industries. It has all the things going for it. Jio will be more profitable, earlier than expected because of all the tariff rise. Its retail business is doing great and its traditional refining and E&P business is chugging along. Against that backdrop, the stock can return safely about 20-25% CAGR over the next three years. So it will double over the next four years."
17,2019-12-05,Eicher,"Midcaps and smallcaps should ideally rally once the economy comes back on track but largecaps or quality is where people are starting to hide in and we are seeing in the last 15-30 days trade as well, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


We have been looking at range-bound trading in the market which seems to be waiting for the RBI policy which will come out today. Do you think rate cut is imminent and what will you be focussing on in light of that?Clearly there is a slowdown, but I think slowdown is an understatement. There are many issues in the market right now. If you are in largecap stocks, you would feel at the top of the world looking at the Nifty or Sensex. You would feel that you have done something relatively great and you are in a bull market and a booming economy. But if you look at midcap and smallcap stocks, it looks like there is a slowdown or a recession.

So, rate cuts seem to be quite imminent at this point but after may be six consecutive cuts, the economy is still not coming back on track. A combination of fiscal and monetary policies could do the trick, if at all. The government has been trying to take a lot of measures but markets are anticipating a lot from the Budget so that the demand side is spurred. So, yes, rate cut seems imminent. Midcaps and smallcaps should ideally rally once the economy comes back on track but largecaps or quality is where people are starting to hide in and we are seeing in the last 15-30 days trade as well.


Maruti announced price hikes a little earlier in the week. Tata Motors also announced price hike and there was a big bump up in the stock yesterday. We are seeing decent moves in select names like Eicher or Bajaj at least on the technicals. What is your view on auto stocks?Too much of negativity was priced in two-three months ago, when there was a talk about how the shift to BS-VI would take place coupled with the NBFC crisis. There was one-one and a-half-year of sluggish sales. Since October, we have seen a decent bounce back from not only the stocks but also the sales numbers, indicating that the slowdown was a little more temporary. 

Of course it is too easy to call shorts right now and buy these companies but for people who have been holding auto companies like Maruti, Eicher, the next three-six months are extremely crucial as the migration to BS-VI would take place. The market is not worried much. It is not the time to sell; ideally it is the time to hold and to buy, we would want to have evident data for the next two or three months.


Where are you telling your clients -- should they book some profits now?We have been advising clients to book partial profits. We know that wealth has only been created in the top 15 stocks and again it would sound very cliché if I start repeating the names of such. So just citing certain examples like Bajaj twins or may be little bit of even HDFC twins and somewhere down the line, even some largecap market leaders which we had bought earlier. In these stocks we are advising clients to book partial profits. We do not want to get out of them as soon and book full profits because a big, big rally in midcap and smallcaps is far off. When that comes, one will need to shift from largecap market leaders to may be even midcap market leaders.

But right nowm we are advising to book at least 20-25% profits in stocks which have given 30%, 40%, 50% in the last 3-9 months. We have been asking them to book profits in a couple of NBFCs even certain banks, a bit of building material stocks and some MNC pharma companies where we have seen stocks doubling in the last one-one and a half year."

15,2019-12-05,Eicher,"MUMBAI: As part of its ambition to make Royal Enfield a global consumer brand, Eicher Motors is looking at expanding manufacturing and dealership footprint for the company across the world with a big focus on Southeast Asia and Latin America.

An assembly plant in Thailand is likely to go on stream in the next six months, while the company is exploring a facility for the Latin American market. The idea is to bring the cost down in countries where the import tariffs are high. It is looking at partners who could share the investment and offer local expertise in such markets.

Under its vision RE 2.0, newly appointed chief executive Vinod Dasari expects international markets to account for 20% of total revenue. It is targeting another 20% from apparels, accessories and other services, and 60% from the domestic market. This is an attempt to spread risk and eye new business avenues to grow business, Dasari said.

More than 90% of Enfield’s sales are from India by selling one type of motorcycle, Dasari said, adding that his emphasis would be on diversifying the revenue base and tapping into new opportunities.

“We will continue to bring in many more products. But I want to have faster growth on solutions and I want to have faster growth internationally. So, we’re going to invest a lot in both these things,” he told ET.

The company has classified global markets into three categories — India-like markets, mature markets and long-shot markets — and devised strategies that cater specifically to each category in terms of products, sales and business models. It plans to launch one new product, including variants, every quarter for the coming three to four years.



For example, for popular tourist destinations, like Morocco, it has a tie-up with rental companies to develop ridership among travellers and create an aspiration for the brand in the long run. There will be markets where the 350cc Classic motorcycle may be the core offering, and the evolved markets of Europe and the US where it will be the Twins.

As against a footprint of 900 stores in India, Enfield has already expanded its global presence to 600 stores over the past five years.



Led by higher acceptability of 650cc models — Interceptor and Continental GT — its exports have grown 125% to 26,621 units in the first eight months (April-November) of fiscal 2020. The share of exports in the overall business increased to 5.51% from 2.06% in this period. Almost half the Twin 650cc models produced by the company are shipped abroad. Encouraging response to the Twins has resulted in a waiting time of 3-4 months in most markets. In the UK, the Interceptor 650 has emerged the highest selling motorcycle in the ‘Naked Street’ category.

According to CLSA, the company’s export volume was expected to grow at 35.2% annually between FY17 and FY22 and the share of export was likely to reach 7.25%.

20,2019-12-07,Eicher,"The domestic equity market was volatile last week as it saw numerous events from auto sales numbers to RBI policy decision, and OPEC meet unfold. At the same time, a lack of clarity on the trade front was another major reason behind the to-and-fro market movement.

Auto sales numbers were disappointing for another month as demand was subdued. On the other hand, market participants turned cautious after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slashed the GDP forecast for FY20 and kept the interest rates constant. Meanwhile, oil producing countries resolved to cut production to support crude oil prices.

BSE barometer Sensex lost 348.66 points or 0.85 per cent to 40,445 for the week ended December 6. Banking stocks in the index saw some of the biggest movement the week, as RBI decided to keep its policy rates unchanged. 

The biggest losers in the 30-share pack were YES Bank (down 18 per cent), SBI (6.96 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (6.72 per cent). Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank gained 3.75 per cent, TCS 3.42 per cent and its peer Infosys 2.72 per cent.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS and Infosys were top gainers on this index as well, with similar gains as on BSE.



Broader market indices too ended the week in losses largely due to deep cuts on Friday. The BSE Midcap closed 1.26 per cent down at 14,667. BSE Smallcap slipped 0.86 per cent to 13,339.4.




Biggest gainers from mid and small cap indices were JP Power that gained 37.07 per cent to Rs 1.58 while JP Infra added 32.14 per cent at Rs 1.85. Asian Oilfield gained 28.95 per cent to Rs 111.50 during the period.

This would have turned an investment of just Rs 10,000 in Symphony into around Rs 2.17 crore in 19 years.

“Symphony continued its strong momentum in the second quarter after a sharp recovery in the summer of 2019. The second quarter performance was in line with expectations and further builds our confidence for a robust H2FY20 show.

UPL, which was on an acquisition spree in recent years, had in November announced another deal, involving Yoloo (Laoting) Bio- technology, a Chinese agrochemicals firm, for a reported consideration of around Rs 95 crore.

In July 2018, the company announced its largest acquisition of the US-based Arysta LifeScience for $4.2 billion, catapulting it to the league of top five agrochemicals players globally with over $5 billion in combined revenue and around $1 billion in pre-tax profit.

Brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on UPL post Q2 results with a price target of Rs 665.

“In the near term, the stock may remain subdued due to weak growth, the US litigation and concerns over shifting goal posts on merger synergies post Arysta merger, especially those from revenue. We, however, maintain a ‘Buy’ rating based on the long-term growth prospects, once the combined UPL–Arysta portfolio starts delivering the full potential as expected by the management,” Nirmal Bang Securities said in a report last month.

Analysts’ view
“Nifty formed a dark cloud cover candle pattern on the daily chart, which is a bearish reversal pattern. Now the index has good support near 12,000 and if it manages to hold above this zone, then we may see some recovery, otherwise sharp profit booking can be seen. Immediate resistance is coming near 12,100-12,150 zone” -- Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities“Inflationary pressure and static manufacturing activity impacted sentiment while trade deal optimism buoyed global markets. Global factors are likely to be more supportive in the near term and market anticipates a better economic growth in the coming years, which is giving support in every consolidation. Investors are also keenly waiting for the upcoming GST council meet to get any cues on overcoming revenue shortfall” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

Global marketsAsian peers mostly closed lower as investors’ initial enthusiasm over a phase one US-China trade deal gave way to concerns about the lack of concrete details on the agreement. Japanese shares ended lower as survey showed the manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in December, and at a slightly faster rate. Though, Chinese shares ended higher after the United States and China reached a historic agreement on a phase one trade deal and key Chinese data beats forecasts. China industrial production and retail sales expanded at the fastest pace in five months in November as steps taken by the government helped to boost domestic demand.

Shanghai added 0.56 per cent. Hang Seng, Nikkei and Kospi slid 0.65 per cent, 0.29 per cent and 0.10 per cent, respectively."

39,2019-12-19,Eicher,"The market is discounting the future and it is not much bothered the past. There are green shoots and lots of expectations that there will be some positive growth, says Dipan Mehta, Founder & Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Given the rebound in metal names in global markets, is it a trading play or an opportunity?At the end of the day, metals are a trading play and they always have been so. They cannot be a secular growth story. We are dealing with the variables over here, but we are in a good plane as far as metal stocks are concerned. If there is a global recovery taking place, then you will see metal prices as well as sentiment move up. 

The US-China trade deal is in a quite advance stage and that will boost sentiment in a lot of risk assets. I do not want to sell any of the metal stocks which an investor is holding and at corrections, we feel safe in buying socks like Tata Steel where there is an opportunity on two counts. One is capacity expansion and second is hopefully something that happen with Tata Steel Europe at some point of time and that overhang will move away. That in itself can give a 40% boost to the stock price and that is our estimate. Just getting that risk factor out of the way can give a 30-40% boost on announcement, if I really stick my neck out.


I am just looking at the data despite what could be called as one of the worst years for auto industry. Maruti is on course to close the year with flat returns. Uber effect is fading away. In the dire backdrop, if Maruti and Bajaj Auto are all set to close the year with flat returns, is that a great news?It is great news. It clearly shows the market is discounting the future and it is not much bothered about what has gone on in the past. There are green shoots and lots of expectations that there will be some positive growth -- be it a low single digit or a double digit -- with the passage of time. But there is hope that with all the steps being taken by the government -- lower interest rate and higher discounting -- once the entire overhang of Euro VI is over and done with, you could get very good volumes going.

But I am looking at exit opportunities in the auto shares. I am glad all these brokerages are coming out with price targets of Rs 8,000 as we are stuck in Maruti as are many investors. The way things are happening in the four-wheeler passenger industry, the disruption which is happening - -- be it is EV or uberisation or public transportation becoming quite mainstream in a lot of cities, we feel that the longer term growth prospects of Maruti are not as great as they were three to five years ago. The best years may be behind them in terms of product launches and product gaps which they have filled up. You will have a nice trading rally in Maruti and some of the other auto shares but those are broadly exit opportunities from a long-term investment perspective. But it is a large sector and one stock you may still want to remain invested in is Eicher Motors.


The general consensus is that in banking a lot more policy initiative is required. How are you looking at some of these private bank stocks in terms of valuations, earnings, etc?Indian investors have a lot of choices when it comes to private sector banks. You decide what your risk capacity is and then choose the stock. If you have low-risk capacity, then go for HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. If you have slightly higher risk capacity, then Axis Bank and ICICI Bank it is. Down the line comes IndusInd, RBL and Bandhan Bank. If you want to take more risk, then you have IDFC First and then the last in the line is YES Bank. You decide what is your risk appetite and the stock is ready for you.

While YES Bank can become nearly zero or can go up by 3-4 times in two-three years, HDFC Bank has got 15-20% compound growth rate. Kotak is around the same level. RBL and IndusInd Bank valuations have corrected significantly and they can go back with their earlier growth rates of 20% plus or so, which will lead to PE re-rating multiple. That is the whole picture and if you pin me down to two-three stocks to buy within the banking space, then I would go with IndusInd Bank and RBL which have the balance sheet to absorb all the NPA losses and still grow."

“Despite premium valuation, the market is touching higher highs led by foreign inflows due to conviction on consistency in performance. The Union Budget is likely to be crucial for the market on account of new policies and to attract investments.

Nifty50 had a gap up opening for the seventh session and hit a new all-time high at 12,268 on Thursday. From last few sessions, market breadth has remained strongly in favour of the bulls and as a result, the index continued to make higher highs and lows for the sixth session and formed a positive candle on the daily scale. 

Momentum oscillator RSI is also signalling a breakout on the daily scale and, thus, we may see continuation of the ongoing optimism in the coming days. As long as Nifty sustains above 12,150, we may see an up-move towards the 12,350 – 12,400 zone. Nifty’s major support is now shifting higher towards the 12,100 – 12,150 zone.

In monthly options, maximum Put open interest was at 12,000 followed by 11,500 level, while maximum Call OI was at 12,300 followed by 12,400 level. There was meaningful Put writing at 12,200 and 12,100 levels, while Call writing was seen at 12,400 followed by 12,500 levels. Options data suggested a shift trading range to a higher zone between 12,050 and 12,350 levels for the coming sessions.

India VIX fell 1.76 per cent to 12.12 level. Lower volatility may support the index to attract fresh buying interest.

Bank Nifty continued to make higher highs and lows for the sixth consecutive session and formed a Dragonfly Doji candle for the second consecutive session, which indicated that intraday declines are getting bought into. The banking index is sustaining well above its consolidation breakout level.

Considering the overall chart structure, we reiterate our positive view for an up-move towards the 32,500 – 32,750 zone. But major supports remain intact in the 32,000 – 31,750 zone.

Nifty futures closed positive at 12,272 with 0.24 per cent gain. There was long buildup in SRF, TCS, Eicher Motors, TVS Motors and Escorts, while shorts were seen in Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Grasim, IndiGo and BHEL

“Auto is one sector that has seen growing interest from traders as there is hope that if there is a revival in economic growth then the demand will pick up quickly.

Recently, India’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki reported an increase in its production in November by 4.33 per cent year-on-year. The company had witnessed reduced output for nine-straight months due to lower demand.

A clarity on Brexit, with Boris Johnson’s win in the UK, has also helped sentiments, especially stocks that are linked to its economy. Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover, gained 1.72 per cent at Rs 177.70 and Motherson Sumi edged higher by 0.44 per cent to Rs 147.65.

41,2019-12-19,Eicher,"The tension between the US and China is a trend that is here to stay. Also, the demographic shifts are going to be difficult for countries like China, Russia, Brazil, Japan, Korea and positive for a country like India. Over a period of time, we have to go with the demographic story; in a shorter period of time, go with the political story, says Teresa C Barger, Co-Founder, Cartica Capital. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Global commentators like Ray Dalio, Howard Marks are surprised with the strength of the US economy and the markets. Do you think the party is here to stay?I do not think it is here to stay partly because in the US, profit margins have been growing largely because of a lack of regulatory enforcement and because of pricing power from companies that are very large and maybe oligopolistic. Also, we have had the lion’s share of EPS growth coming from share buyback. This does not seem sustainable to be me. That is not to say that we are going to have a crash in the economy but from the stock market point of view, it is unsustainable to have a market that is driven by share buybacks and oligopoly profits.


Just like the trade war dominated the better part of headlines of 2019, is 2020 going to be all about the US presidential election? What is the chance of Trump getting re-elected?I certainly hope not because he is a very boring kind of tug of war to watch with very little resolution, lots of noise for a very long time. But there is no clarity until we get close to October-November. We might not even have clarity then. I hope it is not but I do think that it may be about a more benign global growth picture. It also may be about a more benign dollar from the point of view of international investors and we see the dollar either staying the same or getting weaker over 2020, which should be positive for investors in overseas markets. 

This might also be a year where we see a few things getting more steady like the oil market. That is very positive for India.


You look at investors, you look at companies with good return ratios, you buy them and you even hold them. Some of the stocks which you owned in the past like Eicher Motors, Cholamandal, Berger Paints are terribly expensive. How are you investing in this market where what you like is expensive and what is cheap, you do not like?India is in a very difficult state right now with PEs at 18.5 times --basically almost EPS growth -- and it is really hard to buy that. On the other hand, there are many companies that have been left behind and 2019 has been the year of dumb money, where you have had a pretty good run in the Sensex but only with a few stocks. The smart investors, who are the local asset managers, mutual funds, have been more or less on the sidelines. Having been marginal investors in past years, in 2020, we might see a change in some smart money coming back into India. Otherwise, it is a little hard to buy fresh companies now when you do not see EPS growth in front of you.


Are you looking at increasing or maintaining your exposure to RBL Bank or Eicher Motor or Chola or Shree for the next couple of years?We love India for the very long term. We love the big themes that India has, that no one else has -- lots of growth, millennialisation, formalisation and premiumisation -- all great things. But for 2020, we see it in a cyclical and not a structural downturn, exacerbated by the noise that has come from the reforms. So, it is a country we will probably lighten up on and certainly not go heavier on.


What do you make of the slowdown in Indian companies? Is that cyclical or structural in nature? Are we looking at reboot in Indian growth at the consumer and corporate level. What is the view on the big picture?We see it as a cyclical slowdown. We have all had urban and rural issues. It is very unusual to find food prices going up and that not translating into profits for farmers. However, it looks like the newest numbers that had come out from April to November, might have seen a rise in the profits for farmers. Maybe, we will see that turning but we do not see any positives on the urban side.

Right now, there’s not much to see at the rural side though there maybe some brightness on the horizon. But there is no such thing for the urban side. We would love to see real economic reforms take place in the second Modi administration. Obviously we are not in India. So socio-political activities like Kashmir, immigration law do not get the core of the Indian issue which is creating more jobs for the people entering the workforce in India. 

It does not give us any joy. Real economic reforms absolutely would and I am not seeing that on the horizon. I am not seeing any green shoots on capital expenditure on the horizon. 


Telecom is a very contentious sector. You like to buy big consumer businesses in India which is not in a downtrend but the overall environment is one of the downtrend. Would you be interested in looking at the telecom sector? Yes, right now, it is quite a difficult time and a time of regulatory change. I would rather invest in companies which are beneficiaries from the fall in the price of the data coming over to cheaper cellphones. This probably would go with the new economy rather than investing in the telecom companies themselves. Those who are closer to the regulatory situation might be able to make investments there.


You have bought Eicher, Chola, Shree Cement in the past. You also have a deep understanding of private banks like RBL. Given what is happening to interest rate, disclosure norms and how some of the banks have conducted themselves, is the current decline an opportunity to revisit the old favourites?It is true that the market got spooked first by IL&FS which created a liquidity crisis and then created a credit crisis, particularly for the likes of YES Bank. We had some very specific incidents that made people question what the whole book might look like for other banks. We have great faith in RBL Bank and they have been unfairly tarred with the same brush. YES Bank is an inferior bank and has always been in terms of its credit quality and the quality of its management team. There are some opportunities to buy in the financial sector. These are very sound management and there’s a lot of runway for growth. 


Globally, the sale of beauty products has come down. 18 months ago, the signals were about glamour and about selfies and looking perfect. Now the conversation is about toxicity of images and that has affected the global beauty markets.-Teresa C Barger
Once liquidity came, the credit situation also calmed down. One can find pockets here but we need the government and the RBI to take very seriously the unclogging of the transmission mechanism to get credit flowing again to Indian companies and particularly to SMEs. That is a plea from Cartica Cap to the Government of India.


Capital reversion is the biggest prism of stock market in some of the stocks which you own. Shree Cement, Chola, Berger have given you fantastic returns for the last couple of years. Do you think in the coming decade also this kind of return should be expected or anticipated?I do not think that in our era, that is ever going to be true. There is a very small subset of stocks that are true compounders. One of the ways to go astray as an investor is to call a company a compounder that is not truly a compounder. They are very rare animals, they are lovely animals when you can find them. But there is so much going on, so much upheaval in the economy and so much creative destruction, that you always have to look at what is new in the economy and how consumption patterns are changing. They can change enormously quickly.

 Actually, I would like to give you a little example of that in the last 18 months over the whole globe. The sale of beauty products has come down. and it is a global phenomena. Look at the signals among consumers. 18 months ago, the signals were about glamour and about selfies and looking perfect. Now the conversation is about toxicity of images and has completely changed and affected the global beauty markets. It is so fascinating. 

We as investors have to be very much on top of what is going on with from Gen Z, all the way to people who are in hospice care. It is a very different and it is a different market every day.


Let us talk about something that perhaps the old timers are focussed on -- the big trends. 1980s was dominated by Japan, then came the TMT boom and bust. China took over the first 10 years of this decade and the last 10 years has been all about America and the birth of behemoths like Amazon, Google and even Netflix. What could be called a multi-year theme for this decade, ?I cannot be in the business of predicting what is coming in the next decade. The only thing I can predict is change. But using a little shorter timeframe, we have to look at the tension between the US and China as being a trend that is here to stay and we are going to have to look at demographic shifts that are going to be difficult for countries like China, Russia, Brazil, Japan, Korea and more positive for a country like India. Over a period of time, we really have to go with the demographic story; in a shorter period of time, go with the political story.


There is a list of stocks which you have owned for a long time and we have talked about them. In terms of the theme, will there be a core change at all for the India portfolio?It is already changing. The new economy theme is much bigger for us. That would include the adoption of new economy techniques in existing companies as well."

43,2019-12-19,Eicher,"Be cautious as markets continue to move up without broader market participation, says Sandip Sabharwal, asksandipsabharwal.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The Tata Group stocks seem to have recovered from the lows brought on by the NCLAT ruling. TCS is today the biggest gainer on the Nifty. How do you explain it?The market believes that even though Cyrus Mistry have won the case, he might not want to come back because it will obviously be a hostile environment.


Let me put it this way, 82% of the shares of Tata Sons are not with him. He has rights and voice as a minority shareholder but technically you cannot run with only 18% voting right and you cannot be the Chairman of Tata Sons?That is why the market believes that he might not want to come back in that kind of a hostile environment.


The Pallonji family always played a non-executive role at the Tata board. They had 18% ownership, but they were never involved in the executive decisions.Yes, so now that he has won, he might just step back and they might be some reproachment within the Parsi community, In any case, most of the Tata Group companies are professionally run. Every company has its own management. Unless he wants to come with the support of other directors and Tata Sons will have to start replacing whoever is heading other Tata Group companies, then it might be an odd scenario, which I do not think is the base case. 

That explains what is happening in the Tata Group because many of these are largecap companies. There is a fund flow from foreign investors. On an average, Rs 1,500-2,000 crore is coming in everyday. That mostly goes into largecaps in proportion to the index weightages and to that extent, ECS gets a fair share.


Eicher Motors, M&M have started seeing movement though there are no major fundamental triggers. Is this the right time to relook at some of these names?Autos are in a recovery phase. Yesterday, there was some news that the auto companies have approached the Supreme Court for allowing BS-IV vehicles manufactured till 31st March to be sold later. The current chief justice of the Supreme Court seems to be concerned about the economy and the way things are. Even the coastal road project stay was removed and that reflects a concern about the economy and that overall companies should not suffer. So, if that relief comes through that manufacturing has to end by 31st March but the unsold stock can be sold after that, it will be a big relief for auto companies. 

One part of the auto stock movement today might be because of that and the other part could be because auto stocks went up and gave up some of their gains. So, some value buying is coming in again.


It is not about what the Supreme Court will decide the challenge is. Whatever Supreme Court decides now for BS VI implementation, it is too late and too little. It is December and we are almost three months away from the deadline and I doubt that any auto company right now would have any BS IV components left in their assembly line. It would not confuse more because like you said, many of the components might not be there. I do not think most of these companies will go in for fresh manufacturing of BS-IV vehicles to sell them. Many of these companies actually expected that post the Diwali season, the uptick in sales could continue. That has not happened. We have not seen the uptick continue. The momentum that started then, has died out. The main concern among all the auto companies is that they have some BS IV components and equipment, and if they need to provide for that, I am not really sure for each company how much of a hit that will be. 

I guess Maruti started planning quite early so they might not have such a big hit but some of the other companies could.


Are you still bearish or have you changed your view?There is so much dichotomy between the way markets are moving and the way economic data is. I do not like euphoria. Despair is something I can live with because that gives opportunity to buy. But given the kind of euphoric upmove, even as the US markets are at all-time high, I believe some loss of momentum is coming in. The global volatility is at year’s low. When people become absolutely fearless, then we need to be a bit concerned. The possibility of a pullback becomes real. Now how big that pullback will be that we need to see as and when it plays out. 

Right now it makes sense to be cautious, especially about doing anything short term. If you are a long-term holder, then you could live with 10-15% draw down in particular stocks.


How stringent are the BS-VI norms for two-wheelers? Bajaj has been claiming that we have implemented these norms long time ago. The challenge is with four-wheelers, not with two-wheelers?Yes, they are not so tough. For higher cc bikes, they were slightly tougher but Eicher has adapted that. In fact, why Eicher has not been performing has been a bit intriguing because whatever volume decline was happening, the worst seems to have got ebbed out a long time back. 

My guess is that among the auto companies, Eicher could be something which could actually do well.


What is your view on the FMCG sector? A lot of FMCG players are saying that the slowdown may have been a hiccup, things will smooth over and we will see pricing power coming back. What is your stand?My stance is that interest rates came down and that did not really affect the consumption demand. In fact, I did some analysis historically of what happens when food inflation comes back and rural incomes improve. That is more beneficial to all these companies rather than the overall economy doing well. The way we have seen the food prices, vegetable and pulses prices come up, many of the other agri commodity prices (but not sugar) have come up, it will boost farm incomes, rural incomes and as they boost rural incomes, these FMCG companies should see volume growth coming back. 

On the flip side, we have to consider that many of these companies like HUL, especially on the soap side palm oil is a big ingredient. Now palm oil has gone to three-year highs globally and that will reduce some of the benefits on the input cost side could reduce and have an impact on margins. 

So how volume uptick combined with an increase in input cost prices balance out is something that we have to see.


What is your outlook on how divestment pans out? What are some of the PSEs that have been abuzz of late?The strategic divestment is going to be a long haul as we have been discussing over the last few months, since BPCL was declared as a candidate. I do not think it has gone forward at all at this stage. I would think that it is more a next financial story. Right now, in any case, the focus of the government is on non-economic agenda. To that extent, the economic agenda is also on the back foot. 

It is a long haul and we should consider nearer to when these deals actually start happening. The initial run up in many of these stocks has already happened.


What is your expectation from the New Year because everyone is waiting for earnings to catch up? Earnings catch-up will be tough and that is the reason why markets in the short run are delinked from the economic realities. It was a different case in July-August, when markets were at 10,600-10,700 and then the corporate tax cut also came which increased company valuations. 

After that from 10,600 till now, it has been a 15% move. A 15% up move is significant for an economy which has slowed down. I would think that the markets now need to consolidate and give up some of their gains before any upside can come. What can work against this view is that the government actually ends up doing something big bang like the corporate tax cut in the Budget on the individual taxation front also. If that happens, then we need to re-evaluate.


Foreign funds are saying they are coming to India because of 15% growth and money safety is more important than return. There is a 6% growth at individual level, 8% growth at nominal level and 14-15% growth in good companies and that is more than what we are getting anywhere else?If they keep on pumping in money, it is good for all of us that markets keep on doing well. But that liquidity argument to predict future market movements is the most flawed one. Historically, 2007 was the best year for equity flows into India. In December 2007, every day we got Rs 3,000-4,000 crore inflows and January 2008 was the worst month. 

I would not predict future market movements looking at today’s liquidity. I think we need to analyse it based on valuations, the real economic growth etc . I would be somewhat concerned at this stage the way the market is continuously moving up every day without the broader markets participating. 

Even today, the midcap index has not done anything great. It is a concentrated move. One should be cautious and if this view of being cautious is wrong and the markets sustain, then maybe some reasons will come out which we cannot see today which the markets can foresee."

47,2019-12-20,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Italian automaker Piaggio is looking to enter the mid-weight motorcycle market in India to take on Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield.

The firm was earlier looking at launching products in the 150cc motorcycle segment, but with the market moving towards higher-displacement bikes, the plan now is to introduce products in the 250-300cc range, managing director Diego Graffi told ET.

“Definitely, we are looking with a lot of interest at the motorcycle segment in India. It is natural, having a brand like Aprilia, which is well known across the world for winning in racing competitions,” Graffi said.

As many as 773,855 motorcycles with engine capacity in the range of 250-350cc were sold in the domestic market in the last financial year. With sales of 764,012 units, Royal Enfield had almost 99% market share in the category. “We are now looking more at this range (250-300cc). We need some time to introduce the products … But it is in our plans,” he said.

Piaggio additionally is working on introducing an India-specific scooter in the next financial year and refreshing its range of products here under the Vespa brand. Overall — domestic sales and exports — Piaggio India is targeting selling over 100,000 two-wheelers in 2019.

According to data available with industry body SIAM, twowheeler sales dropped 15.74% to 12,864,936 units in the first eight months of the ongoing financial year starting April, amid a broader slowdown in the local automotive market. At Piaggio — which currently sells scooters under the Vespa and Aprilia brands — two-wheeler sales declined 16.86% to 48,471units in the same period.

In the three-wheeler segment, Piaggio intends to remain fuel-agnostic and provide options in petrol, diesel and LPG/CNG even after the switch-over to BS-VI emission standards from April 1, 2020. The company will also have electric options available in three-wheelers and has partnered with SUN Mobility to set up battery swapping stations for the Ape Electrik range. Piaggio aims at introducing the range along with adequate battery swapping facilities in 10-15 cities in India by March 2020.

The company sold 106,943 three-wheelers in India till November this fiscal year, a 7.64% fall compared with the same period last year."

50,2019-12-24,Eicher,"Midcaps could start doing much better in the next 12 months considering volatility does not spike, says Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Which are the themes you are going to be most bullish on in 2020?2020 is going to be a very interesting year. We are pretty much closing the year on high levels, which was not expected as we started the year. Also, in between, there were quite a few challenges that we witnessed. But having said that, the global construct for equity markets continues to remain positive. More importantly, we are seeing two major themes emerging; a)there is a lot more interest in value stocks. The likes of metal stocks have started doing better, the larger banks are doing much better. b)The second theme which is expected to emerge over the next 12 months could be the midcaps or the high quality midcaps. Smallcaps might take a little more time but the midcaps could start doing much better in the next 12 months considering the volatility does not spike. That is a very good setup for the midcap allocation to significantly increase. That is the overall theme we are banking on and are bullish on for the next 12 months.

What is the outlook on individual sectors? We are banking big on the overall rural theme picking up. The trend having been fairly soft so far, do you think there is merit in the story?There is a clear-cut merit in the story, primarily because we are likely to see a very good rabi season. So from that perspective, if we consider the sowing patterns, where we have done some bit of channel checks, we have seen quite a bit of improvement in Maharashtra in two crops. Overall, the farm income and the rural income should rise significantly over the next six to 12 months. That is going to be a major theme. 
 From the perspective of what to play, we are quite bullish on Escorts. Escorts is one of our top picks in the midcap space as well as in the auto space. One is of course, tractors as a play. We see that the cycle has shortened in terms of the turnaround that can happen. 

Second is when the rural income rises and probably in the next 12 months we could see two things; one is the earnings picking up and the second something like Escorts rerating. That gives a significant upside to stock picks like Escorts. 

Apart from that, in the consumption space, Dabur is a very traditional rural play but the company is going through a very different kind of phase in terms of strategy and development. I would not put Dabur as a pure rural play but as an overall consumption play, it makes a lot of sense to allocate more capital there. 
 I would be very choosy in terms of playing the rural theme but there are certain ideas which make a lot of sense to invest at this point in time. 

If you are looking at the broader markets, we are starting to see more opportunity there, particularly in light of recovery. Would you be looking deeper into specific stocks where you see earnings catch up?Recovery is a very critical aspect. Something which is going to be a clear cut standout play on the recovery cycle will be the auto sector. If I were to look at pure consumer staples kind of a play, Hindustan Unilever on an average over a last 20-year period would have delivered a volume growth of around 6%. 

In auto we like four stocks. Escorts is one name. The second theme is a big play on the recovery cycle. It could be Ashok Leyland. Apart from that Maruti is another play which can give decent upside. The last name I would be bullish on would be Eicher Motors.-Naveen Kulkarni
Currently, in the last quarter, they delivered a volume growth of 5%. Essentially, the staples play are plus/minus 1% or 2% over the long-term average in good times and bad times. So that is not something. The discretionary part in the consumption theme is where auto fits. We have to see whether it is the CV cycle or the PV cycle or if it is the two-wheelers.

There is a case to play the recovery theme from autos perspective. Apart from that, we are quite bullish on banks. Coming back to the auto theme, as I just mentioned, Escorts is one name. The second theme is a big play on the recovery cycle. It could be Ashok Leyland. Apart from that Maruti is another play which can give decent upside. We are positive on the stock and I would say that the last name which I would be quite bullish on would be Eicher Motors. 

These are the four stocks in the auto sector where I would allocate most of my capital. Apart from that, the large banks are something and there are value plays where we would allocate more capital.



What about IT? Valuations are also looking comfortable now. Does it merit a look in the New Year?From an IT perspective, the earning visibility in that sector always tends to be reasonably strong. Second, cash flows are never a challenge in that sector and most of the companies are reasonably sound in terms of balance sheet. They do not need to raise capital. So all the positives are known. Valuations are reasonable, there are names in the largecap space as well as in the midcap space which merit looking at. 

In the largecap space, we like Infosys. The valuations are quite reasonable. The operating performance is quite good and that stands out. Apart from that, in the midcap space, we continue to like Sonata Software and Mindtree. It is going to be an interesting play to look at from quarter on quarter improvement perspective.


Let us talk about a few other specific names that are on your radar. You are bullish on Aarti Industries, Coromandel and even Nesco. Why are they looking attractive to you?Aarti Industries is a long-term play, it is not a short-term play. It is in the specialty chemical space. Their focus is on Benzene derivatives. If I were to look at one name where they have a certain moat, Aarti Industries clearly stands out. 

Second is in terms of the kind of deals that they have done in the space, they are consistently investing capital where they understand the category well. So, there is a long-term growth path. Apart from that, in the last quarter, we saw a bit of gross margin compression. The revenues are lower than what it was estimated, but it was essentially because the low product margin business did not do well, whereas the high product margin businesses have been doing better. Strategically, the company continues to do well. This is a time to accumulate the stock where the valuations have corrected a bit and it looks reasonable. 

Coromandel is a more straightforward story. We are banking on a better sowing season for the rabi crop. The rabi output is going to be pretty good and Coromandel is a straight-forward beneficiary of that. Apart from that, the quality and management and everything continues to be very strong. Coromandel is more of a medium-term play. Aarti is a very long-term kind play. Escorts is a very straightforward story on rural growth theme and rerating that can happen and the earnings growth that the company can deliver over the next two years.


What would be the three triggers for the markets to see a significant leg-up next year?The biggest factor for the market is going to be the economic recovery. A lot of music and sound and noise happens around the Budget. The clear cut factor there will be to look at what fiscal deficit target the government gives and where they are right now. 

The borrowing programme for the government will be a very clear-cut number because that determines the cost of funds in the overall economy, that is the second factor. The first factor is economic recovery and the high frequency indicators whether it is the auto numbers or some of the other factors like the IIP numbers. All these data will have to be very carefully watched.

The third factor will be the constructive global set up. The global scenario, whether it is in terms of a trade deal, the US elections being right next year etc. How the global market continues to emerge in the next 12 months is going to be very critical. If the global scenario continues to be constructive, the Indian markets will continue to do well. If supported by some of the domestic factors that are just talked about, the markets will do very well in the next 12 months.


What do you like among midcap banks? Do you have any midcap preferences?We do have midcap preferences like DCB Bank, but lately there are some challenges. It is a long-term bet but SBI stands out very clearly in terms of the resolutions that we are witnessing and the benefits that the bank is going to enjoy. Apart from that, if we see the overall improvement that has been taking place, probably this year they might do a 9.5% kind of an ROA and next year the ROA will improve. Apart from that, the valuations are quite reasonable. SBI is a clear-cut standout. There is also a subsidiary. SBI right now is our top pick in the whole banking space, followed by Axis Bank and ICICI Bank."

48,2019-12-24,Eicher,"MUMBAI: Mahindra & Mahindra’s board is betting on tried and tested leaders from within the group to take over key positions to lead it in a market that is undergoing transformation.

The maker of sport utility vehicles and tractors announced more names on Monday to head its second rung of top management, relying heavily on internal roster.

The developments are part of the second phase of M&M's succession plan, following last week’s announcement that Anand Mahindra would step down as executive chairman of the board, but continue as non-executive chairman, effective April 1.

The company said on Friday that Pawan Goenka would be re-designated managing director and take additional charge of CEO with effect from April 1, till retirement in 2021. Anish Shah will succeed Goenka after April 1, 2021.

In fact, the top-level management at the auto maker has hardly relied on lateral hires even as the group went global, making acquisitions and entering foreign markets with products made in India.

Analysts tracking the developments said the company may be taking one risk too less in the everevolving market space by promoting in-house talent. Rival Tata Motors, for instance, had brought in a globally proven talents like Carl-Peter Forster and Guenter Butschek to take its brand forward. Truck makers Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors, too, have relied on a leader from outside to chart its future course.

VG Ramakrishnan, managing partner at consultancy firm Avanteum Advisors, “Mahindra is a well-oiled organisation with a solid governance structure in place. An outsider may be needed to change the culture, but Mahindra is not at a stage of such transformation, hence they don’t need a radical change. Plus, where is the talent in the automotive industry today? It is better off to reward internal talent even though they may face challenges in retaining volumes or market share.”

M&M cannot be faulted for not participating in future disruptions like shared, electric or autonomous vehicles, but experts say there is need for a fresh approach or a set of young leaders — dynamic, aggressive or risk-takers — to pursue an approach different from its conservative, long-haul perspective.

An outside view may be missing, but at least key roles have gone to young talent from within the group.


BUILD VERSUS BUY
Most organisations have an explicitly defined build versus buy philosophy. Typically, mature organisations work on an 80:20 ratio — meaning most senior positions are placed from within the organisation. A higher build also signifies a sign of maturity of succession planning practices and drives a structured plan for providing career visibility to internal, high potential talent, said Anurag Malik, Partner - People Advisory Services, Ernst & Young.

The auto maker has started implementing recommendations by management consultant BCG on a Simplicity project it undertook more than a year ago, but the results have yet to show.

Whatever the management changes, industry experts said the company should get back to its winning ways, especially in the utility vehicles space where its market share has dipped to less than half, compared to eight years ago.

The three automotive products it launched recently have not been too successful. Additionally, strain of its two-wheeler and electric vehicles business, both of which have yet to see healthy growth, and a painstaking endeavour by subsidiary Ssangyong Motor Company to build scale and get back in the green, too, has not borne fruit.

Given the competitive scenario, regaining past glory is challenging for M&M, especially in utility vehicles, Ramakrishnan said. ""It still needs a steady pair of hands to move the company in a direction that has been defined,"" he reasoned.

Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that M&M’s underperformance in various auto and non-auto businesses in the last few quarters has pulled down its consolidated results despite the solid performance of the domestic business."

56,2019-12-28,Eicher,"There has been a remarkable comeback in the auto stocks. If someone is looking at high-risk stocks, then Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto at current levels hold a lot of potential. Another high-risk stock, Tata Motors could be a strong candidate for a multibagger from current levels, says Kunal Bothra, kunalbothra.co.in.


What will be your outlook for 2020?The start of 2020 could be on a positive note. That can be attributed to a lot of readings for the markets, one of which transpired on Friday. It is the increased cost of carry and the Nifty Futures premium is going up, nearing 1% mark. That is a very positive comeback because the end of December series was more on a tepid or a dull note but the start of the Jan series was more on a strong note. 

The beginning of 2020 looks to be on the healthier side for the markets. The India VIX dropped back to 10-10.5 levels, which also indicate that the markets are more confident that this uptrend would sustain. 

We need to see how the largecap stocks perform, especially Reliance, ICICI Bank, HDFC etc, which have done remarkably well in the last three to four months. If they carry the baton forward, then the confidence level of the markets would improve going forward. So, there are a lot of positives which transpired especially on Friday and a good part of last week.


What do you make of some of these banking names? The select ones have done very well this year? How would you look at the financial sector?The space seems to be fairly attractive. The markets earlier in the second half of this year were more polarised and more specific towards largecap stocks. Private sector banks like ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank used to find a lot of investor traction, but as now, we came very close to the year end and the markets got into a sort of a mature phase.

Suddenly, the sentiment is becoming positive. A lot of the other financial names have started to spring up. IndusInd Bank is also trading above its 200-day moving average. SBI and the PSU banking pack made a very good comeback in the last one-and-a-half to two months. 

A lot of flavour is now getting added to the banking pack and that is a healthy sign. A lot of bank largecaps have done very well and they are the ones to keep on holding their key support levels. The new emerging names add a lot of flavour to the traders as well as investors’ plate. It is a healthy sign for the market internals as well.


As far as the decade is concerned, are there stocks that you would like to talk about?From a longer-term view, I will go with ICICI Bank as one of the prominent buys. If someone is looking at more high-risk stocks, then Eicher Motors at current levels holds a lot of potential. There has been a remarkable comeback in the auto stocks. I believe Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto have a lot of potential. Tata Motors is more of a high beta stock because of the news flow. But if anyone is looking for more high risk stocks, Tata Motors could be a strong candidate for multibagger from current levels."

60,2019-12-31,Eicher,"Brokerages are betting on financials and select companies in the telecom, pharmaceuticals and automotive sectors to outperform the market in 2020. Reliance Industries, which was one of the top performers among Sensex constituents this year, is expected to continue its positive trend in the next year as well. Similar bullish expectations are from Bharti Airtel, too, after it undertook tariff hikes. Another stock being favoured by brokerages is Axis Bank as the bulk of impairment recognition is behind it and return ratios are showing improvement. ET takes a look at top picks of five brokerages for the New Year:


ICICIdirect

KNR Constructions
CMP: Rs 234.85
Change in Share Price in 2019: 10% 
Target Price: Rs 300

As of second quarter of FY20, its order book stood at Rs 6,680 crore, which is 3.1 times trailing twelve-month revenues. With execution anticipated to remain strong, ICICIdirect expects KNR’s top-line to grow at 19.1% on a compounded basis to Rs 3,030 crore in FY19-21. The stock is available at attractive valuation.


Narayana Hrudayalaya
CMP: Rs 306.25
Change in Share Price in 2019: 56.6% 
Target Price: Rs 360

Persistent improvement in occupancy rate across all segments continue to propel both revenue growth and margins. The brokerage continues to believe in the long-term prospects of the company on the back of its asset-right model and affordability philosophy.


Bharti Airtel
CMP: Rs 460.5
Change in Share Price in 2019: 60.3%
Target Price: Rs 550

The brokerage has a positive view on Bharti Airtel given its relative superior standing and comfortable balance sheet position. The tariff hike is likely to translate into FY21 revenue and EBITDA upgrade of 9 and 17%, respectively. Fund-raising intention assures that Bharti will survive given availability of funds coupled with price hike.


Motilal Oswal

Eicher MotorsCMP: Rs 22,829
Change in Share Price in 2019: -1.5% 
Target Price: Rs 24,900

The brokerage expects volumes to recover gradually. BS-VI transition would be an inflection point for Royal Enfield as a completely new improved platform could drive revival of the Classic 350. This coupled with building upon success of 650 cc twins in India and overseas would also aid the expected revival from the second half of FY20.


State Bank of India
CMP: Rs 334.25
Change in Share Price in 2019: 11.7% 
Target Price: Rs 425

SBI has shown healthy moderation in a slippage trajectory while significantly improving its coverage ratio. Macro environment remains challenging but the net stressed assets for SBI at 0.8% of loans are the lowest amongst peers. Monetisation of subsidiaries and upcoming listing of its card subsidiary are positive triggers.


CG Consumer Electricals
CMP: Rs 240.60
Change in Share Price in 2019: 5.7% 
Target Price: Rs 296

With moderate capex and a strong operating performance, the company has been able to generate healthy free cash flow, said Motilal Oswal. Strong profitability and an asset-light business model has led to healthy return ratios, with return on equity of 40% and return on capital employed of 28% in FY19.

While broadly the expectations are that Dalal Street should do better in 2020 than in 2019 and the broader market will start performing better, yet investors do not have the confidence to take the plunge and go value hunting in the deeply beaten-down counters. We rummaged through a dozen year-end brokerage reports to shortlist seven stocks from across sectors that, they say, offer decent potential to deliver solid gains in the year ahead.Next​Larsen & Toubro: Upside potential 37%30 Dec, 2019Axis Securities values this stock at 20 times FY21 EPS to arrive at a target price of Rs 1,736. With the surge in order intake of Rs 86991 crore in H1Fy20, the company crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore order book milestone at the end of September quarter, with international orders accounting for 22 per cent of the total order book. Deal pipeline remains strong at Rs 5.2 lakh crore for H2FY20, with 18-20 per cent win run-rate, Axis Securities said. L&T, it said, is well placed to surpass its inflow guidance of 10-12 per cent. for Fy20   NextKEC International: Upside potential 33%30 Dec, 2019Brokerage SMC Global noted that KEC International is continuously performing well and delivering in all the three parameters of revenue, profitability and order intake. The T&D business of the company has delivered a stellar performance, backed by robust execution in SAARC and the Americas, while the railway business has continued its growth momentum as it expands portfolio in other segments. The company has maintained its annual guidance of 20 per cent growth for FY20 revenue. SMC Global expects the stock to see a price target of Rs 392 in 8-10 months’ time frame on a one-year average P/E of 14.06 times and FY21 earnings per share of Rs 27.90. Next​Gujarat Gas: Upside potential 22%30 Dec, 2019Religare Broking noted that the company has a strong infrastructure and distribution network and enjoys near monopoly in the Gujarat state. The network expansion in other states may boost volumes going forward. The company is likely to deliver robust performance in FY20 as it has witnessed remarkable industrial volumes so far, the brokerage said.

The company has adjusted to new tax regime, resulting in an writing off of deferred tax liabilities that led to 13 times YoY growth in quarterly profits in Q2FY20. “Although the growth is likely to taper down in FY21, given higher base of the last year, we expect the company to deliver strong profit CAGR of over 35 per cent during FY19-22E,” the brokerage said.
 NextHindustan Unilever: Potential upside 28%30 Dec, 2019After incorporating GSK Consumer Healthcare merger, the opportunity for HUL is huge, said Nirmal Bang Institutional Research, which sees see the FMCG firm’s earnings to grow at a CAGR of 23 per cent over FY19-22. This is  without assuming any synergy benefits in margin estimates. On the valuation front, the stock is trading at 46 times/39 times  Y21/FY22 EPS and has delivered a return of 20 per cent in the past one year.



Volume delivery has been ahead of its much smaller peers and margins visibility could help sustain such premium valuations in the current environment, supported by best earnings growth visibility in the Indian FMCG space with the highest return ratios, the brokerage said.



“On a target multiple of 54 times September’21 EPS, we derive a target price of Rs 2,490,” the brokerage said.

Edelweiss Professional Investor Research

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail
CMP: Rs 226.55
Change in Share Price in 2019: 11.9% 
Target Price: Rs 301

Aditya Birla Fashion is one of the fastest growing companies in terms of revenues and profitability, said Edelweiss. There are significant margin levers yet to play out across most segments which should lead to company level margins improving from 6.8% in FY19 to 9% over the next 2-3 years, the brokerage said.


Balrampur Chini Mills
CMP: Rs 183
Change in Share Price in 2019: 79.8% 
Target Price: Rs 200

Balrampur is best placed to capitalise on the positive structural changes witnessed by the sugar industry, said Edelweiss. Reduction in uncertainty and increase in predictability will lead to structural rerating of the sugar sector and the company, one of the largest players in the sector, is expected to benefit from it.


Axis Bank
CMP: Rs 756.45
Change in Share Price in 2019: 22% 
Target Price: Rs 861

The brokerage is positive on the stock due to improving return ratios which will be driven by acceleration in loans and advances growth and as improving margin will lead to higher net interest income (NII). Improvement in cost-income will lead to higher pre-provision operating profit and robust subsidiary performance, said the brokerage.


Emkay Global

ICICI Bank
CMP: Rs 543.95
Change in Share Price in 2019: 51.1% 
Target Price: Rs 650

ICICI Bank has re-rated over the past one-year after the change in management and its strong delivery on return on equity from sub-10% as guided, coupled with its re-emergence as a strong retail-cum-digital bank and moderating asset quality pain would call for a further rerating, said Emkay.


Maruti Suzuki (India)
CMP: Rs 7,414.90
Change in Share Price in 2019: -0.6%
Target Price: Rs 8300

After a decline in domestic volumes in FY20, the brokerage expects a turnaround with 12% growth on a compounded basis over FY20-22, led by a low base and better macros. Despite an increase in competitive intensity, it should sustain market share around 50%, driven by a focus on product launches and network expansion, said Emkay.


Reliance Industries
CMP: Rs 1,544.20
Change in Share Price in 2019: 37.7% 
Target Price: Rs 1,740

Emkay likes RIL due to strong earnings profile and tangible deleveraging. Lowering of capex run-rate, completion of tower-fibre InvITs and Aramco stake sale is expected to result in significant deleveraging over the next 2-3 years. Creation of Jio platform and listing of retail and telecom businesses are other optional triggers.


SBICAP Securities

Reliance Industries
CMP: Rs 1,544.20
Change in Share Price in 2019: 37.7% 
Target Price: Rs 1,930

Jio’s market share gain likely to continue, while fibre to the home progress to be gradual. retail growth story should continue, said SBICAP. Deleveraging on a fast-track and RIL relatively better placed to mitigate the downstream margin challenges, it said.


Dr Reddy’s Laboratories
CMP: Rs 2,883
Change in Share Price in 2019: 10.2% 
Target Price: Rs 3,200

Despite good pipeline visibility and multiple optionality, the stock is trading at an attractive P/E of 14.5 times on the brokerage’s FY22 EPS. Strong growth in branded business, monetisation of the acquired ANDAs, resolution of warning letter and approval of limited competition products are catalysts for the stock.


Axis Bank
CMP: Rs 756.45
Change in Share Price in 2019: 22% 
Target Price: Rs 845

As the bulk of impairment recognition is behind and provisioning begins to normalise towards end-FY20, the brokerage expects return on equity (RoE)/return on assets (RoA) to reflect steady-state profitability. Continued portfolio normalisation is a key catalyst for the narrative to decisively shift to the visible positive momentum in operating sectors."

65,2019-12-31,Eicher,"NEW DELHI: Seasonality, year-end shutdowns and inventory management in the runup to BS-VI transition will likely result in another tepid month for auto companies when they report their monthly sales numbers for December on January 1, 2020. The numbers are likely to suggest that the slowdown that has engulfed the sector for almost a year now is not over yet, analysts said.

On a year-on-year basis, the picture isn’t good. Passenger vehicle (PV) sales are likely to be tepid. While Nomura estimates a marginal 2 per cent year-on-year increase in PV sales, Prabhudas Lilladher has projected a 5-6 per cent drop.

Two-wheeler (2W) sales may decline 2 per cent. However, the fall in sales of commercial vehicles is projected to be the higher at 30 per cent.

“With the impending price hikes of 13-15 per cent for BS-VI models coming in from April, 2020, demand headwinds should continue in FY21F for the two-wheeler segment,” Nomura said in a report.

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher sees some pre-buying in CVs in Q4FY20 but expects demand to remain under pressure till H1 of FY21. A significant price hike of 15-20 per cent in CVs is on the cards for BS-VI models.

Brokerages have a mixed view on Maruti Suzuki. Nomura expects the industry leader to post a 6 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in sales while Prabhudas Lilladher projects it to post a 2 per cent decline. Nirmal Bang Securities expects a sequential decline of 0.1 per cent for the auto major due to the year-end shutdown. However, the brokerage expects strong consumer offers to help drive higher retail volume.

Maruti shares fell 0.65 per cent in Mumbai trading to end the year at Rs 7,367 on Tuesday in a weak market that saw the benchmark Sensex tank 304 points.

Overall sales for Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) are projected to decline 2-8 per cent with a steeper fall seen in tractor sales. Nirmal Bang expects M&M's tractor volumes to drop 5 per cent to 16,534 while Nomura pegs December sales figure to come in at 16,700, down 4 per cent. The stock fell over 1 per cent in Tuesday's trade to Rs 531.

Tata Motors is most likely to continue the trend of rapid decline in PV and CV sales. The projections are for 41-33 per cent drop in PV sales and 32-22 per cent YoY decline in overall sales. ""High double-digit decline in CVs is likely to continue due to high inventory, economic slowdown, limited disbursals for infra projects, excess fleet capacity and tepid freight rates,"" said Nirmal Bang. The stock bucked the trend in the auto pocket to close nearly 1 per cent higher at Rs 185 on Tuesday.

Ashok Leyland is projected to post a 28-38 per cent YoY decline in December volumes. ALL shares fell about half-a-per cent to Rs 81 in Mumbai trading.

Brokerages expect Bajaj Auto to fare better than peers. Prabhudas Lilladher projects a 2.3 per cent jump in December sales while Nirmal Bang sees a 3.4 per cent rise. Nomura pegs growth in Bajaj Auto sales at 10.9 per cent. The stock dropped over 2 per cent in Mumbai trading to close the year at Rs 3,182.

Hero MotoCorp's sales are likely to fall 4-15 per cent, while those of TVS may dip 3.5-11 per cent. The stock slipped one-and-a-half per cent to Rs 2,443.

Nirmal Bang expects Eicher Motors to post a 5 per cent decline in sales of Royal Enfield bullets and a 40 per cent decline in VECV volume. Prabhudas Lilladher expects a marginal dip of just 0.5 per cent in Royal Enfield sales, while Nomura expects them to rise 3 per cent. The stock fell over 1 per cent to Rs 2,251 on Tuesday.

“We do not see growth in auto demand anytime soon. Consumer sentiment is not good. Auto is a good business going through a down cycle. We will wait for some signs of growth coming in before we buy into the auto or auto ancillary pack,” said Amit Jeswani, CIO, Stallion Asset."
