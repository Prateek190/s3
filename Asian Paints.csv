3,2018-01-03,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: Corporates are contributing their bits in maintaining ecological balance even as they pursue growth. This is reflected in various initiatives such as reduction in water consumption by 30-60 per cent and rising share of renewable energy.

India is the fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses. It accounts for about 4.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In this backdrop, it becomes crucial for local companies to take initiatives to go green.

India’s largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki lowered its groundwater consumption by more than 60 per cent to 13,945 million cubic meters between FY15 and FY17, according to company’s sustainability report for FY17. Maruti has been able to save 200 litres per vehicle.

This was achieved by increasing the use of recycled water and by resorting to rain water harvesting which required investments in creating water lagoons. Ranjit Singh, general manager for CSR and Sustainability at Maruti Suzuki, said, “Our emphasis has been on consistently reducing water consumption by innovative methods. Our Gurugram facility has entirely shifted to canal water from groundwater.” He mentioned that sourcing from rainwater harvesting rose to 25,000 million cubic meters (mcm) in FY17 from 6,800 mcm two years ago.




 Dabur, a consumer staples company, used 11per cent less raw water and increased the use of recycled water by 9per cent. Vedanta, a metal major, met 11per cent of its water requirement through recycled water in FY17 compared with 6per cent in the previous year.

Keeping with the government’s initiative to increase share of renewable energy in the country’s total power consumption, companies are gradually raising sourcing from clean fuels such as solar power, wind, and natural gas. FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever increased the share of renewable energy to 28 per cent by taking measures such as converting agricultural waste into consumable fuel. HUL’s Sumerpur plant uses solar energy to meet 80 per cent of the power requirement. The carbon footprint of its manufacturing plants was down 13 per cent year-on-year in FY17.


Companies Cut Water Usage in Green Push
RIL has installed solar photovoltaic modules across manufacturing units. Out of the total energy requirement of Asian Paints, India’s largest paint company, 22 per cent is met by renewable energy. Maruti Suzuki meets nearly 95 per cent of the power requirement from the clean fuel such as natural gas.

Services sector companies are also taking green initiatives. Union Bank, for instance, has switched its 245 branches and their ATMs to solar power. Telecom tower companies which account for nearly 8 per cent of total diesel consumption are turning green. In the past two years, diesel consumption of Bharti Infratel dropped by 25 per cent, while 43 per cent of sites operated by Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel are now diesel free.

Turning more environment-friendly products can help companies expand their market size. For instance, Ceat, a leading tyre maker, moved to using more silica instead of carbon black due to the demand from vehicle makers and European market. Silica reduces carbon footprint of tyres. Arnab Banerjee, Executive Director at Ceat, said, “We’re working on developing products from non-petroleum raw material which are considered as green materials.”

A senior official at a leading FMCG company said that companies are willing to invest in energy efficient plants due to benefits to broader society even though it lowers internal rate of return in the short term.

Namrata Rana, director at Futurescape, a consultancy for sustainable development, said manufacturing companies are keen to reduce carbon footprint in their processes but they also need to focus on the supply side."

16,2018-01-06,Asian Paints,"Clinics advertising cures for everything from back pain to erectile dysfunction. Posters of movies which are about to release and of politicians fighting an election. Declarations of teenage love. And, of course, generous doses of paan spittle. A welcome addition to these on the walls of urban India are a wide variety of murals, thanks to a bunch of initiatives promoting street art.

St+art India (pronounced ‘start’) is the largest of these efforts. First held in Delhi in 2014, the street art festival has so far had nine editions in all in five cities — three in Delhi, two each in Mumbai and Hyderabad, and one each in Bengaluru and Goa. Arjun Bahl, cofounder and festival director of St+art India Foundation, says the idea behind starting the festival was to make art more democratic. “There was a need to make art available to all. The best way to do it was to put it on the streets.”


“Colours of the Soul” by Senkoe, a Mexican street artist, in Delhi, 2016, as part of St+art India.

Colourful Palette
The latest editions of the festival in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Goa just concluded. In November and December, the festival had turned Mumbai’s Sassoon Dock into something of a gallery which was open to the public, free of cost, between Thursday and Sunday. From photographs of the fisherfolk of the area on the walls outside to installations inspired by the sights, smells and history of Sassoon Dock, the festival made many curious enough to visit. Bahl says there were around 2,000 visitors every day.

The festival, backed by Asian Paints, kicked off in October with an 81-ft mural of Mahatma Gandhi outside Churchgate station by Eduardo Kobra, a Brazilian street artist known for his portraits. Among the other prominent foreign artists at the festival was Australia’s Guido van Helten, who painted a mural of three Koli women he met at Sassoon Dock. He then went to Mahim, where he spent three weeks interacting with the locals, including from adjacent Dharavi. He then depicted two kids b-boying, a popular activity among adolescent boys in the area, on a residential building at Mahim.

“There is a tendency among artists to fly in and fly out. I arrive with no idea of what I am going to do. I learn about the place and the people. That’s pretty challenging,” says van Helten. He says street art is a loose, umbrella term which also includes graffiti. Unlike graffiti, he says, “mural art is done with permissions.” He has also done a mural in Panjim, Goa’s capital, also for St+art India.


Accessible Art
Sameer Kulavoor, a Mumbai-based artist who has been involved with St+art India in Mumbai and Bengaluru, says street art gives the creator access to the widest possible audience. “A guy in a Mercedes and a bhelpuri hawker will both see it.” He adds that unlike painting in a studio, the process of creation of street art would involve talking to passersby. In 2016, Kulavoor transformed the walls of the Kempegowda Majestic metro station in Bengaluru. Called ‘Magnetic Majestic’, the work is a visually arresting ode to the Majestic market, with a magnetic pulling people and objects to it.

For the Sassoon Dock project, Kulavoor made ‘Parfum Sassoon’, a mural and a larger-than-life installation of two perfume boxes, denoting the fragrances of Bombay duck and mackerel, two common fish of the city. Kulavoor has also done murals for a co-working space in Chennai and and a gallery and handicrafts store in Mumbai.


Ranjit Dahiya has painted murals of Bollywood stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, and Madhubala, mostly in Mumbai, but also in Delhi, Chennai, Paris and Greensboro (US).

Among the most popular and prominent murals of Mumbai are of legends of Hindi cinema. Under the Bollywood Art Project, Ranjit Dahiya has since 2012 painted images of Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Amrish Puri and Madhubala. It started as an effort to mark 100 years of Hindi cinema in 2013. As part ofSt+art India’s first Mumbai festival in Mumbai, Dahiya painted a mural of Dadasaheb Phalke, who made India’s first feature-length feature film in 1913, at Bandra in 2014. “People have just started doing it (murals). It will take some time to make our cities beautiful. Murals add colour and even a message to a plain building,” says Dahiya, who has also painted murals of Nadira in Delhi and Vyjayanthimala in Chennai, the latter as part of Conquer the Concrete, a street art festival in 2015. The festival was organised by the Goethe-Institut and Chennai City Connect, an urban management initiative.

 Yogesh Saini, who founded Delhi Street Art, a collective, in 2013, calls street art “perishable, accessible art.” He says street art has a shelf life - from a few hours to a few days to a few years. “It can’t be preserved and it’s not meant to be.” Delhi Street Art has travelled to around 15 cities, including Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Bhopal, and smaller cities like Rishikesh and Gorakhpur. “The idea was to find a creative outlet and in the process add some aesthetics and beauty to our cities and our open environments, which don’t necessarily have any public expressions.” Delhi Street Art has worked at government schools, night shelters and even Mandoli and Tihar prisons, where some inmates also participated.

As awareness and acceptance of street art grows, it is likely more cities, including smaller ones, will benefit. St+art India’s Bahl says the foundation is looking at cities in the south like Coimbatore and Madurai. Guess Who, an anonymous graffiti artist like Banksy, was much talkedabout on social media a few years ago when people started sharing pictures of the artist’s satirical works in Fort Kochi: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels dressed as Hindu saints, Heath Ledger’s Joker as a Chakyar Koothu (a monologue performance) artist, and Vincent van Gogh, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso in mundu and chappals.

In the next couple of months, St+art India will organise festivals in Chandigarh and Kolkata, which has another street art festival, led by painter Jogen Chowdhury. The Kolkata Street Art Festival, begun in mid-2017, aims to have around 500 murals in the city in five years.

Indian cities have a long way to go before they can boast of a vibrant street art culture like Bogota, Sao Paulo, Melbourne and Los Angeles, but a start has definitely been made."

Ten years thence, we are into a similar party mood, as the BSE barometer tests the 34,500 level, a lifetime high for the index.

In terms of market capitalisation (m-cap), the BSE universe expanded nearly three times in last 10 years, as did the number of Titans on Dalal Street. A total of 29 BSE-listed stocks now enjoy a market capitalisation of over Rs 1,00,000 crore each compared with 15 at the end of 2007. 

While familiar names like Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, PowerGrid and BPCL have made it to the Rs 1 lakh crore m-cap club, several firms that were top dogs in their respective industries back in 2007 have since fallen out of this Club Elite.

Among them are DLF from real estate, BHEL from engineering and construction, SAIL for steel and Reliance Communication from the telecom sector. Broadly, capital-intensive stocks took a back seat as consumer-oriented sectors took charge.

Among the top five companies in terms of market-cap, Reliance Industries remains numero uno, thanks to gains seen on the counter after the launch of its telecom venture Reliance Jio. TCS, the second most valued company, saw its m-cap swell five times to Rs 5.16 lakh crore. It was the 14th largest company 10 years back.

Five other companies that were not even part of the Rs 1 lakh crore m-cap club 2007 have since swelled in size and gone far beyond that benchmark. The HDFC duo and consumer-focused companies ITC, Hindustan Unilever and Maruti Suzuki today command market-caps in the Rs 2.7-3.20 lakh crore range.

ONGC, the second most valued company in calendar 2007 with Rs 2.5 lakh crore, is ninth largest today with a similar m-cap. NTPC, the third largest way back in 2007, is 17th largest today, while 2007’s fourth largest Bharti Airtel is 11th largest today.

DLF, the fifth largest back in 2007, has lost half its market value in these 10 years. NMDC has lost 73 per cent, BHEL almost 70 per cent and SAIL 65 per cent.

The biggest fall took place on the RCom counter. The seventh largest company by m-cap back then is not even a largecap stock today, as its market-cap shrank to Rs 9,153 crore. The stock has fallen 95 per cent in last 10 years."

52,2018-01-13,Asian Paints,"Indian companies with a substantial presence in the US are making changes following new tax rules that came into effect after the passage of legislation late last year. Not doing so could mean a spike in taxes they have to pay in the US.

Among those that will need to do so are Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Asian Paints, experts said.

While impact of new rules will vary, most companies could tweak shareholding patterns and customer contracts besides reducing management fees, interest and royalty payments to India from the US. “There is a huge impact for many Indian multinationals companies that operate in the US as they could see an additional tax of about 10% in the form of Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax (BEAT) for which they won’t even get a tax credit in India,” said Girish Vanvari, tax head, KPMG India. “Most companies will have to alter their business models and will have to look at various strategies but this could only be done from the next financial year.”




Tax experts said BEAT will work like minimum alternate tax (MAT) in India. Under BEAT, tax on normal profit will be 20% and 10% on adjusted profit, after disallowing payments like interest, management fees and royalties. Companies will have to pay the higher of the two. While the new tax regime has reduced the corporate tax rate to about 20%, exceptions have been carved out for companies shipping profits out and not creating jobs in the US, said experts. BEAT will be a risk for companies with substantial revenue coming from the US.

Most Indian companies have set up teams and roped in tax experts to draw up their course of action, CFOs and experts said. “For some capital expenditure incurred in last five years in the US, debt was taken against the Indian balance sheet,” said a senior finance executive with an Indian multinational. “Every quarter, the US entity pays interest to the Indian entity, and this could become a problem going forward.”

Under new regulations, any interest payment, management fee or royalty paid by the US entity to India should not exceed 30% of Ebitda. In most cases, interest payment, management fees and royalties are 80-90% of Ebitda for Indian multinationals.

US tax provisions are retrospective in nature and hence even investments made or debt incurred before changes may be covered under the new provisions, according to some experts.

“New US tax regulation includes a limitation on on interest deduction, which shall be limited to 30% of operating Ebitda (derived through certain specified adjustments),” said Maulik Doshi, partner, transfer pricing and transaction advisory, SKP Consulting. “Also, this would equally apply to existing debt / capital structures, which means there is no grandfathering provided for existing structures.”

The finance executive cited above said, “We are considering if we could convert debt to increase tenure of debt repayment to reduce interest outgo.”

Most Indian information technology companies will see tax outgo jump substantially if they don’t change their current structures, an expert said.

“For a $100 million contract that the US arm of an Indian IT company received from its client, they outsourced $99 million. Earlier, US tax would be levied only on $1 million, but now the whole transaction ($100 million) would be taxed,” he said.

Many Indian IT companies are looking to reword or renegotiate contracts so they don’t end up paying higher taxes. Without that, IT companies could see tax outgo rise about four fold.

“US tax could in effect be levied on the whole contractual value and not just the US margins,” said Rajesh H Gandhi, partner, Deloitte India. “Indian MNCs might look at restructuring their legal or contractual model in the US to overcome BEAT.”

This won’t be easy as Indian tax authorities wouldn’t want to lose out on taxes as well. They could trigger Place of Effective Management (POEM) provisions that deal with local taxes on Indian multinationals. “Such restructuring will not be easy because of legal or commercial constraints,” said Gandhi."

Auto Cos to Report Robust Profit Growth
Most auto companies and ancillaries are likely to report double-digit revenue growth of 14-51 per cent during the third quarter, says a weekend report by HDFC Securities. However, higher commodity prices and festive/year-end offers/marketing spends will shave off the margins of most players to the tune of 84 bps for the industry sequentially to 15.4 per cent, warns the report. Though passenger vehicles volume grew only 7 per cent despite favourable base in the reporting quarter, this will be compensated by better commercial vehicles volume which jumped 28 per cent, led by a revival in freight rates and pick-up in infra spending. Against this, two-wheeler volume soared 18 per cent driven by strong rural demand especially from Bihar, UP, Odisha and MP. 


India 30th on Global Manufacturing Index 
The World Economic Forum (WEF) has ranked India at 30th position on a global manufacturing index -- below China's 5th place but above other BRICS peers, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Japan has been found to have the best structure of production in the Geneva-based WEF's first 'Readiness for the future of production report' and is followed by South Korea, Germany, Switzerland, China, Czech Republic, the US, Sweden, Austria and Ireland in the top 10. The 25 'leading' countries are in the best position to gain as production systems stand on the brink of exponential change. India has been placed in the 'Legacy' group along with Hungary, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Thailand and Turkey, among others, countries which have strong current base, but are at risk for future.


India's First Agro Options Contract in Guar Seeds Launched
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday launched options trading in guarseed on the commodity bourse NCDEX and asserted that the new initiative will benefit farmers and ensure better prices in the coming days. Higher production has led to fall in prices of some agri-commodities in some places, he said, adding that options trading is one of the major steps towards taking farmers out of this situation. NCDEX is the second exchange after MCX to launch options trading in commodities. In October 2017, MCX had launched gold options. 


Land of sick PSEs for Affordable Housing? 
In a bid to provide a big push to affordable housing ahead of the next elections, land available with six loss-making central public sector enterprises has been identified to give momentum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiative for the urban poor. State-run construction company NBCCBSE 0.32 % Ltd. will develop some of the land under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. The six CPSEs, including IDPL, HMT, Hindustan Antibiotics and Tungabhadra Steel Products, have about 3,000 acres.


Indian MNCs Look to Align with New US Rules 
Indian companies with a substantial presence in the US are making changes following new tax rules that came into effect after the passage of legislation late last year. Not doing so could mean a spike in taxes they have to pay in the US. Among those that will need to do so are Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Asian Paints, experts said. While impact of new rules will vary, most companies could tweak shareholding patterns and customer contracts besides reducing management fees, interest and royalty payments to India from the US. Indian multinationals that operate in the US could see an additional tax of about 10% in the form of Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax (BEAT) for which they won't even get a tax credit in India. 


Finished Steel Exports Surge 29% in Dec
India's total export of finished steel in December last year jumped 28.9 per cent to 0.964 million tonnes (MT), official data showed.

On the other hand, imports were down 26 per cent at 0.561 MT in December 2017 compared to 0.762 MT during the same month a year ago. The import of finished steel during April-December last year surged 10.9 per cent to 6.096 MT, as against 5.495 MT in the same period previous year. 


P-notes Investment Drops in November
Overall investments into the Indian capital market through participatory notes (P-notes) fell to Rs 1.28 lakh crore at November-end after witnessing a rise in the previous month. P-notes are issued by registered foreign portfolio investors to overseas players who wish to invest in the Indian capital market without registering themselves directly.

Trading could be volatile next week as traders roll over positions in the futures & options (F&O) segment from the near-month January series to February series. The January 2018 derivatives contract expires on Thursday, 25 January 2018.

One such scheme that has performed well in the past three-year and five-year periods with respect to its benchmark (Nifty 50) is ICICI Pru Focused Bluechip. The scheme invests close to 90% of its portfolio in large companies, while the remaining is invested in mid-sized companies. In the past three-year and five-year periods (annualised returns), the scheme has given 11% and 17% returns, while its benchmark, the Nifty 50, has given 7% and 12% returns during the same period. In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers — S Naren and Rajat Chandak — have bought companies which represent a contrarian theme.

This is Swati Verma and I will run you through today's market wrap, complete with all the cues and views from seasoned analysts and those who matter.

A combination of factors, namely subdued Asian shares, overnight losses on Wall Street and profit taking, had a profound bearing on local stocks here today. Both equity benchmarks fell sharply. Participants were not keen to lower their guard ahead of the Union Budget, due on Thursday.

There's considerable interest in US Fed's two-day policy meet, starting today.

On the Nifty heatmap, 36 stocks turned red, 13 green and 1 was unchanged. In the Sensex lot, Asian Paints took the hardest hit while Coal India was the biggest gainer.

The government seemed to have made all the right noises in the Economic Survey. And now, all eyes have shifted to the Union Budget.

Having said this, we also need to understand that many times, pure technical reading is never enough on such days and we need to have a broader and macro view of the market’s behaviour.

We expect a quiet start to the trade on Thursday, and until the Budget proposals start rolling in, we expect rangebound trade in the morning.



Only after the proposals start rolling in, we will see olatility creeping in the session. With the levels of 11,170 and 10,235 acting as immediate resistance to the market, we expect the levels of 10,910 acting as strong support unless anything nasty comes up in the Budget.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the Daily Chart is 70.4888 and it remains neutral to the price showing no divergence. The Daily MACD remains bullish. On candles, an on-neck line occurred. However, in the present formation, it does not hold any significance.

Pattern analysis shows that Nifty has taken a breather after a stellar rally that it saw in January. It is seen taking a breather and has marked 11,170 as its immediate major resistance level.

Overall, while we go into the trade on Thursday, we need to have a look at two to three previous sessions. While the frontline stocks and the benchmark Nifty50 consolidated, the broader market saw some good correction.

Also, if we look at sectoral indices, barring IT, majority have not made any major headway since November and are already into what is known as time correction with minor declines.

Also, the Nifty PCR (put to call ratio), which touched nearly 1.90 has come down significantly and more so after the short covering that was seen in Wednesday’s session.

With all this, we can conclude that though volatility is something that will certainly remain; we do not expect any major downsides, unless something very nasty comes up in the Budget.

We expect effective sector rotation happening with focus on sectors that will benefit from the Budget and market are likely to move on after knee-jerk reactions.

Major downsides expected only if fundamentally nasty proposals are left to be digested by the market


STOCKS TO WATCH: Short covering was seen on counters like State Bank of India, Kotak Bank, Reliance, YES Bank, Torrent Power, Tech Mahindra, Tata Motors, Asian Paints, HDFC and Pidilite Industries.

0,2018-02-05,Asian Paints,"What has been the progress on investments in Karnataka in recent years?Karnataka has emerged as a top investment destination in the country. From last two years in a row, Karnataka has stood first among all states in the country on investment intentions filed. The state has accounted for an impressive 42.9% of the total investment intentions in the country as per the SIA statistics released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, up to October, 2017.


Which are the sectors that are attracting maximum investment in Bengaluru and rest of Karnataka?Karnataka has emerged as an information technology (IT) hub of India. Bengaluru is the fourth largest technological cluster in the world after Silicon Valley, Boston and London and is nicknamed as Silicon Valley of India. We envisage Karnataka to consolidate on this and are therefore focussing on emerging technologies like Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Robotics and Nanotechnology.

Karnataka is the undisputed leader of the country in the aerospace and defence sector. It accounts for 70% of the supplier base of the sector in India. Since 2013-14, the state has approved 72 project proposals with an investment of ?14,720 crore with an employment potential for about 30,000 people.

The state is committed to emerge as the automobile capital of India. The future of the auto sector lies in electric mobility. Karnataka is the first state in the country to introduce a comprehensive and well-designed Electric Vehicle and Energy Storage Policy 2017 to provide bespoke policy ecosystem for this sector.

Karnataka, as the largest bio-technology hub, is home to over 60% of the country’s biotech companies. It also ranks fifth in pharma exports and contributes 10% to the country’s revenue in the pharmaceutical sector. We have a separate policy to encourage bio-tech sector. We are setting up pharma parks and are getting good response. Textile and readymade garments is another sector which is attracting investment and creating large employment. Agro business and food processing is another thrust sector which is seeing lot of interest. We have come out with a special policy for agri-business and food processing. We are also developing food parks in many parts of the state. Thus Karnataka has many thrust areas which are attracting good investments. We are encouraging them by giving right policy environment and infrastructure.


What is your government’s score card on investments and jobs? How much of the investments promised have actually materialised on ground? And where do you stand on job creation front?
Karnataka is unarguably an attractive investment destination given its rich demographics that feed into the intrinsic demand and supply elements of businesses. Apart from overall investment intentions in which Karnataka stands first in the country, Karnataka accounts for a significant share in the total FDI that flows into India. Karnataka has attracted more than $6.8 billion (?44,720 crore) in FDI over the last one year (April 2016 – September 2017), which makes it the second best state in terms of attracting FDI in the country. Karnataka has attracted FDI of $ 27.09 billion (?1,53,633 crore) during the period of April 2000 to September 2017.

With regard to projects approved by State High Level Clearance Committee (SHLCC) and State Level Single Window Clearance Committee (SLSWCC) from 2013-14 to 2017-18 (upto November 2017), total investments of ?3,38,983 crore with employment potential of 9.45 lakh were approved. After announcement of the Vendor Development & Investment Summit 2017, about ?19,648 crore worth investments from 157 companies were approved from April 2017 to till November 2017 which would generate an employment of about 79,500.

The state has generated 12.16 lakh jobs in the last four years and is inching closer towards meeting the government’s target of creating 15 lakh jobs by March 2019. From 2013-14 to till date, Karnataka has generated 10.28 lakh jobs in the micro, small & medium enterprises (MSME) sector and 1.88 lakh jobs in the large industries sector. Another 6.25 lakh jobs are in the pipeline.


What is the latest on ease of doing business (EoDB)? What steps have you taken to improve Karnataka’s position in the all India ranking?
Government has introduced various initiatives in easing out “Doing Business” in the state. Through e-Udyami, the single window portal for Karnataka, the approvals/ clearances including their subsequent renewals, can be sought from more than 20 line departments. In addition, more than 80 services have been bought under the purview of SAKALA or time-bound delivery during the year. Inspection systems of major departments like labour, factories and boilers, pollution control board, commercial taxes and urban development has undergone major reforms. The focus is on self-certification, third-party certifications and risk-based classification for inspection. More and more information and services from different departments has been put on the online platform and payments organised through digital mode. The emphasis is on reducing human interface, reengineering of processes, online delivery of time-bound services and enhanced transparency. High Court has designated commercial courts to settle commercial disputes. The entire process of building plan sanction and delivery of civic services in urban areas is undergoing major reforms. Energy department has taken lead in reforming its services of inspections, certifications and sanction for new connections. Information Wizard-a detailed “guide to investors on setting up of industrial enterprise” providing holistic information on infrastructure, registrations, approvals, etc. has been provided on single window portal.

With all our initiatives, I am hopeful that we would be among the top in the country in ease of doing business.


Many industrial estates developed by KIADB in tier II cities are under-occupied, and said to have infrastructure issues. What are your plans to improve them?
Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board has developed many industrial areas in tier II cities such as Hubli-Dharwad, Mysore, Mangalore, Belagavi, Davanagere, Shivamogga, Kalaburgi, Tumkur, Bidar, Ballari, Raichur, etc., The government has invested more than ?500 crore for upgradation of the industrial infrastructure facilities such as road, water supply, street lights, power infrastructures, etc.

Development of housing for the industrial workers is also given priority. KIADB has developed group housing and residential sites at Gamanagatti Industrial Area, Dharwad, Raichur Growth Centre at Raichur, Narasapura Industrial Area at Kolar and Vasanthaarasapura Industrial Area at Tumakuru. Independent water supply schemes are implemented and operated by KIADB at IT park Devanhalli, Belur Industrial area at Dharwad, Raichur Growth Centre at Raichur, industrial areas at Mysuru, etc. KIADB has taken effective steps for providing quality and uninterrupted power supply to Industries by establishing sub-stations.

We are also making efforts towards improving the infrastructure maintenance of these areas in partnership with industry associations.

The state houses leading OEM, tier I and tier II companies. The list of home-grown and multinational companies which are headquartered here need no introduction – Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Dynamatic, Airbus, Toyota, Dell, Cisco, Rolls Royce, Honda and many others. We are the manufacturing hub for auto majors like Volvo, Toyota Kirloskar, TVS, Telco, L&T Komatsu and auto component companies like BOSCH, Delphi, Denso, Siemens and Rane.

There seems to be some delay in handing over ownership of plots to allottees even after ten years since they took possession and started production. Your comments.

Wherever the land acquisition process and infrastructure works is completed, the final price is fixed. Out of 150 industrial areas, 87 industrial areas final price is fixed and we are currently executing the sale deed and handing over the ownership of plots to the allottees. Even if the allottee has implemented the project before ten years, the sale deed is executed without waiting for the completion of the lease period.

But in the case, where the land acquisition process is not completed due to pending of land litigation or enhancement of land compensation cases in the higher courts, the sale deed is not executed even after completion of lease period. In this regard, steps have been taken by appointing senior counsels to represent KIADB in the higher courts.


How responsive has the Centre been to various demands put forth by your government? Do you have any specific cases where you are unhappy?
In the spirit of cooperative federalism, our government has worked with Centre on various initiatives to encourage growth and development. We are one of the few states which has managed the GST transition efficiently. We have taken up number of new projects in partnership with various ministries of Government of India.

We have taken up development of Tumkur node as a major Industrial hub on Bengaluru-Chennai corridor. We are setting up a machine tool park, advanced machine tool testing facility and aerospace finishing facility with department of heavy industries. We have taken up many small industrial clusters, technology centres for development with support of MSME ministry. We have taken up some food parks in partnership with Ministry of Food Processing Industries Government of India.

Many projects to encourage exports have been taken up with the support of commerce ministry like setting up of cool port, flower auction facility, infrastructure at Mangalore SEZ, marine products modernisation facility, jaggery, cashew processing centre, etc. We would, however, need much more financial contribution from Government of India to augment infrastructure for industrial areas, exports, MSMEs support and setting up of emerging technology centres. There are many more initiatives and together both governments can deliver the performance their citizens need and expect.


What is the impact of demonetisation and GST on the economic activity in Karnataka?Demonetisation was a mammoth exercise and overall impact on the real economy in the short term has been adverse with slowing down of income growth numbers. It has impacted unorganised sector, construction projects and some segments of the export sector such as readymade garments. The impact moderated by mid-February 2017, reflecting an accelerated pace of remonetisation. Though demonetisation has adversely impacted incomes of the most poor in the short term, its impact in long term would be clear only once more data is available.

Our government has lent support to the implementation of GST since 2006 itself when the then-finance minister announced in his Union Budget speech that India would introduce GST by 1stApril 2010. We favour the GST regime as the same will bring in a new era in the indirect taxation landscape of modern Karnataka and India, paving the way for a simplified tax structure for goods and services."

26,2018-02-20,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The bear hug on domestic equities continued on Monday, which caused equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty to slip below their psychologically important 34,000 and 10,400 levels. 

As a result, momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence, or MACD, signalled downward crossovers on 90 counters on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Among the stocks that witnessed downward crossovers in Monday’s session were Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Reliance Power, Bharti Airtel, Petronet LNG, Asian Paints, Nitco, Simplex Projects and Crisil.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, which adds further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Other stocks that saw bearish crossovers included Adhunik Industries, Liberty Shoes, Pfizer, Bharat Gears, Orient Cement and Venky’s India.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward trend or vice-versa.



However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

Market participants should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm such trends.

Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed that 19 stocks witnessed bullish crossovers on NSE to give a ‘buy’ signal. They included Bhushan Steel, Rain Industries, Reliance Industries, Jai Corp and DB Corp.



The 50-share index settled 73.90 points, or 0.71 per cent, down at 10,378 and formed a bearish candle on the daily chart. 

Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said: “Nifty is making lower highs and lower lows from last three trading sessions. Now, if it sustains below 10,450 then weakness could continue towards 10,333, and then 10,276, while on the upside, immediate hurdles are seen at 10,480, and then 10,550 levels.” 

India VIX moved higher by 1.77 per cent to 16.67 in the previous trading session. Rising volatility suggests volatile swing could continue in the market.


Understanding MACD


A close look at the chart of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shows whenever the MACD line has crossed below the signal line, the stock has shown a downward momentum and vice versa. 

Shares of the company closed 1.36 per cent down at Rs 87.20 on February 19, 2018."

58,2018-02-28,Asian Paints,"The NSE benchmark Nifty50 consolidated on expected lines and did not move out of the congestion zone. Still the session remained much weaker-than-expected.

However, given the global weakness that we witnessed, the domestic equity markets relatively outperformed other markets.

We have a short week, as Thursday will be the last trading day, with Friday being a holiday.

We expect this weakness to persist and consolidation to continue. However, we also strongly expect the 100-DMA to continue to hold on as the support on closing levels. No downsides beyond this are expected.



Going into trade on Thursday, the levels of 10,535 and 10,590 will act as immediate resistance for the market. The supports come in at 10,450 and 10,435 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 45.3143 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price or any failure swing. The daily MACD still remains bearish though it continues sharply narrow its trajectory and moving towards positive crossover in immediate short term.

A falling window occurred on candles. This is a gap down and usually implies persistence of the downtrend. 

However, this cannot be read singularly. Given the fact that it is very near to the important support of 100-DMA, it can have limited negative impact.

If we look at pattern analysis, it is clear that the Nifty still remains in the congestion zone that it has created for itself. It will break out of this zone only after it moves past the 10,590-mark. Until this happens, it is likely to remain in this zone while trading above its critical supports.

All in all, so long as the Nifty remains in this congestion area, it will stay at the mercy of its immediate support zone of 10,276-10,310. However, before that there is 100-DMA, which stands at 10,437 that it is very much likely to defend.

We do not see any likely breach of any of these critical support areas. Apart from banks, which will remain largely affected by news flow, we will continue to see bottom fishing in good quality stocks.

With no critical supports yet broken, we recommend avoiding shorts and keeping overall exposures at modest levels.

3,2018-03-05,Asian Paints,"Berger Paints, the second-largest decorative paints company in India, has reported good numbers for the third quarter of 2017-18 as well. 

Its consolidated revenue grew 14% compared to the same period last year, much higher than the industry average and even better than that of market leader, Asian Paints. 


Analysts’ viewsBuy: 11
Sell: 3
Hold: 3

Improvement in gross margin, despite the increase in raw-material prices, helped Berger to report a high net profit growth—20% year on year (yo-y)—too. Besides a better product mix, the company keeping operating expenses low helped improve margins in the third quarter. 

To protect margins from higher input costs, the management has gone for regular price increases—the latest being 1.5% increase effective 1 March. The company’s small international operation, which contributes 7% to its revenue, also performed well, reporting y-o-y revenue growth of 17%. Berger is expected to report good numbers in the coming quarters as well for several reasons. 

First, the industry-wide growth rate is expected to spike in the coming years due to government programmes such as Housing For All, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, etc. The growth potential of the paints industry is huge, given that per capita consumption of paints in India is still very low—just 4 kg, compared to the global average of 15 kg. 

Second, the introduction of GST has accelerated the shift from unorganised players to organised players and, with around 35% of the paints industry still with the unorganised players, the opportunity for organised players such as Berger is huge. Upgrading and premiumisation—customers shift to better brands—are also helping leading players like Berger. In addition to its power brands—Berger Silk, Berger Rangoli, Berger Illusions, Berger Weather Coat, Jadoo Enamel, etc.—Berger is also benefitting from its focus on decorative paints which contribute 80% to its revenue. 

Third, Berger has been outperforming the industry averages for the past few years and, because of this, it has been growing its market share by 50-100 bps annually. As 60% of its revenue come from the East and the North, it has shielded Berger from the ongoing cut-throat competition in the South. After the commission of new plants in Assam and Maharashtra, the company’s capacity utilisation is placed at around 65% and, therefore, no capital expenditure is planned for the next 2-3 years.

6,2018-03-11,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: With less than a month to go for the 11th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), officials at Star India are seeking to sign on as many advertisers as possible to help meet the daunting Rs 2,000-crore revenue target for the biggest global event in cricket.

Star officials are making confident claims of exceeding the target and of strong response from advertisers. However, there are no concrete financial details yet to ascertain how close the broadcaster is to touching the revenue target.

“We have a total of 34 clients signed on, out of which there are some high-value deals with Vivo, Coca Cola, Asian Paints, Ceat Tyres, and MakeMyTrip,” Anil Jayaraj, EVP and head of ad sales for Star Sports, told ET.

Some of the new advertisers include Reliance Jio, Domino’s, Ford, Haier, Voltas, Luminous, Ceat Tyres, AMFI, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Blue Star, Crompton, Dollar, Pidilite, Sleep Well, Vanessa and Vimal Pan Masala.

Earlier, Star had announced Amul, Colgate, Coca-Cola, Dream 11, Elica, Make My Trip, Parle Agro, Parle Products, Vu TV, Kent, and Polycab as advertisers for the cricket league.

India has, over the past two decades, emerged as the nerve-centre of modern cricket and the tournament modelled after the English Premier League is the primary vehicle for an expanding list of brands reaching out to an increasingly affluent set of customers. However, soaring advertisement rates have the potential to dim the IPL’s appeal as a credible and sustainable brand-building property, with broadcasters charging higher for their inventory to recoup initial investments in the telecast-rights auctions.

ET had reported on February 20 that advertisers are finding the ad rates too high and many usual names are missing from the list so far. Star’s asking price for advertisements is about Rs 10 lakh (per 10 seconds) a slot.

Despite confident claims by Star India officials, sources from within Star India and the media buying fraternity have confirmed that so far only about Rs 800 crore worth of advertising inventory has been sold or booked.

“It (ad sales) has not gone the way we had hoped,” said a highly placed source in Star India. “Now the task is Herculean as adding another Rs. 1,100-1,200 crore means a run rate exceeding Rs 40 crore per day.”

Media buyers say that advertisers are not willing to pay unreasonable premium.

“IPL is one of the strongest platforms and everyone wants to advertise on IPL, but I don’t think in today’s market, any client is ready to pay a significant premium over last year’s rates. I believe it will be a 10-15% increase over the last season,” said Ashish Bhasin, chairman and CEO, South Asia at Dentsu Aegis Network.

Some of the usual names missing from the list include Vodafone, Amazon, Maruti Suzuki, Airtel and PepsiCo.

On its part, Star is not yet disclosing the names of co-presenting or associate sponsors. It is also not disclosing which advertisers have taken spots on TV or on the digital medium alone.

“The sale is going pretty well and I think we will exceed our targets,” Jayaraj said. “What we are offering to the advertisers is a significantly higher value that IPL will deliver for their brands.”

Star India had put a bid of Rs 16,437.5 crore to buy the global media rights of IPL for 5 years starting the 2018 edition. To recoup its investments, Star has come out with an exhaustive telecast plan encompassing 6 languages, 12 channels and live steaming on digital platform Hotstar."

16,2018-03-12,Asian Paints,"NEW DEHI: Many growth stocks in the BSE200 pack today trade at PE multiples as high as 200 times on a trailing basis.

But bond yields in developed markets (DMs) rising and central banks tightening money policies the world over – which are big turnoff for emerging market equities – there are concerns as to whether such growth stocks may sustain at such high multiples.

Higher global bond yields on the back of global economic recovery and higher inflation and normalisation of monetary policies of developed market central banks may result in derating of multiples of the high PE stocks, said Kotak Institutional Equities, which believes the gap between bond and earnings yields is threatening. 

High PE multiple of a growth stock is supported by expectations that the company may continue to deliver above-average industry earnings. 

When bond yields fall, they generally make investments in equities look attractive and lead to re-rating of growth stocks. Due to higher prices that investors wilfully pays to own such stocks, earnings yields (1/PE or E/P) fall.

But when bond yields start rising, the difference between them and earnings yields for growth stocks widen and hurt the latter. To maintain the yield gap, either earnings need to rise or stock prices need to fall. 

Take the example of United Breweries, which trades at a trailing 12-month PE multiple of 116.87. This stock offers earnings yield of 0.85 per cent. Earnings yield is the return that an investor gets on s/her investments. In the case of UB, the yield is very low compared with 10-year bond yield of 7.67 per cent, which is as good as risk-free asset. Stocks such as HDFC Bank from the BFSI sector, Asian Paints, Nestle and Marico from FMCG, Page Industries and Jubilant Foodworks from consumer discretionary and automaker such as Maruti Suzuki are among a few growth stocks that are trading at high PE multiples. The list is long.

“We do not see high P/E stocks in consumer staples and discretionary sectors as defensives in the light of the emerging macro-economic environment. They may hold up better in the short term in the event of a swift market correction, but we find their valuations quite high, as it is not fully factoring in the possibility of higher domestic and global bond yields and/or lower profitability,” said the Kotak report.


Agencies
The report says consumer staples and discretionary sectors have seen big re-ratings of multiples on lower bond yields in the past six to eight years and an expansion of their gross and Ebitda margins due to lower raw material cost in last three to four years.

“Both these positive drivers could reverse in the medium term and it would be interesting to see if (1) their multiples will hold up in case domestic and global bond yields move higher and if their margins hold up if commodity prices were to stay firm. Their ‘moats’ may not be as great as is generally believed in a few cases,” it said.

Jubilant Foodworks (PE of 201 times), Avenue Supermarts (171 times), United Breweries (117 times), Biocon (96.56 times), Hindustan Unilever (78 times) are some of the growth stocks from the BSE200 basket, which trade at high PE multiples. Analysts say investors should look beyond trailing PE multiples. Even a small distruption or a one-off event can make such multiples look so high, even if the underlying fundamentals remain strong.

For example, Jubilant Foodworks’ trailing 12-month EPS has been hurt by its Q4FY17 numbers. During March quarter last year, the company had reported a 76 per cent plunge in net profit. But in the last three quarters, it has reported 25-230 per cent surge in net profit under the new management headed by Pratik Pota.

Nirmal Bang Institutional Research noted that affordability initiatives, strong focus on digital, product quality and overall cost efficiencies has led to superior results for this company in the past two quarters.

This has reinstated confidence in core strategy of the new management. We expect the company to deliver above-industry average earnings growth led by stronger same-store sales growth or SSG, store expansion and improvement in margins, it said. United Breweries numbers too were hit in March quarter last year. 

In an Interview to ET Now CLSA’s Equity Strategist Christopher Wood said: “In a situation where markets are worrying about monetary tightening and higher interest rates in US, the most vulnerable stocks are the growth stocks because they have got the high PE ratios.”

This year, investors should not just own growth stocks, they should also earn more value-orientated stocks because cheaper stocks are much less vulnerable to monetary tightening expectations, Wood told ETNow.


Global case
In a note to clients last month, DBS said overvalued growth stocks had undergone the most severe sell-down in past correction cycles. But this time, the NYSE Fang+ Index, which consists of technology-related growth stocks, had continued to outperform the broader market during the correction phase, suggesting portfolio allocators were holding on to their growth stocks to position for an economic upturn."

21,2018-03-16,Asian Paints,"The domestic equity market in Thursday’s session headed nowhere for major part of the trade, while remaining in a capped range.

However, closing trades were more sluggish than expected, as the Nifty ended the day with a loss of 50.75 points or 0.49 per cent, while adding fresh short positions.

The market will consolidate and spend more time subdued before it prepares itself to move past the 100-DMA levels.

Nifty is likely to see quiet to mildly positive start on Friday. However, Nifty is neither expected to move past 100-DMA, nor it is likely to breach any major support area.

Friday will see the levels of 10,395 and 10,475 playing out as immediate resistance for the market. Supports will come in at 10,345 and 10,275 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 44.8813, and it continues to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish, as it continues to trade above its signal line. No significant formations were observed on candles.

Pattern analysis reveals the credibility of the resistance area of 100-DMA as the Nifty has resisted those levels. Also it has established the support zone of the 10,275-mark followed by the 200-DMA.

At present, it continues to trade in a rectangle formation, which translates into a broad trading range. All in all, it is all likely that the Nifty continues to oscillate and consolidate a bit more before it prepares for a fresh up move.

In this process, the support of 10,275-mark will be critical area to watch for. The F&O data, which continues to show addition of shorts, reiterates the limited downsides for Nifty.

Also, taking into account the performance of the broader indices and sector indices, it is evident that the market continues to exhibit positive bias.

We reiterate avoiding shorts in the present scenario. Minor downsides cannot be ruled out, but overall, this will be nothing more than some more consolidation, which is ultimately likely to resolve itself with a directional bias on the upside.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen in stocks such as IDFC Bank, Coal India, REC Ltd, DLF, ICICI Bank, L&TFH, Arvind, Nalco, Asian Paints, Equitas, Reliance Power and Bharti Infratel.

 N Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party (TPD) moved a no-confidence motion against the NDA government in Parliament on Friday.

 Two TDP ministers had earlier resigned from the Narendra Modi government following the Centre's refusal to grant Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh, PTI reported.

I think that scenario is now working in mind of every investor.""

 Broader midcap and smallcap indices were no better and closed up to 1.07 per cent down.

Moreover, all the sectors on BSE closed in the red, with oil & gas and metal cracking over 2 per cent. Out of total 19 sectors on BSE, 15 suffered loss of over 1 per cent.

 “Weak global markets led to a negative start, which further deteriorated on the reports of political fallout between the BJP and its allies. Nifty is likely to test 10,000 shortly.

Most of the Asian stocks were on the defensive on Friday, as worries over the US investigation into the Trump Organisation tested investor nerves, which were already hit by fears that the US tariffs could hurt the global economy.

NEW DELHI: The Nifty50 index opened negative and witnessed sustained selling pressure throughout the day. It formed a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the daily chart, and corrected around 165 points on a closing basis.

The index has broken immediate support of 10,333-10,276 zones and slipped towards 10,180 levels. Now, till it remains below 10,276 zones, weakness could continue towards recent swing low of 10,141 then psychological 10,000 zones, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,276, and then 10,333 levels.

On the option front, maximum put open interest is at 10,000 followed by 10,200 strikes, while maximum Call open interest is at 10,500, followed by 10,400 strike.

We have seen significant call writing at 10,300 and 10,200 strike, which is shifting its resistance to the lower zones. Put unwinding was seen at 10,400 and 10,300 strikes, which is giving the further scope and fear of decline while marginal Put writing was seen at 10,200 followed by 10,100. Option band signifies a lower trading range between 10,100 and 10,350 zones.

India VIX moved up by 6.21 per cent to 15.22. Rise in volatility after the consolidation of last five sessions has given an upper hand to bears, suggesting more weakness as Put Call Ratio also fell down.

Bank Nifty opened flattish and witnessed selling at the later part of the trading session. It formed a bearish candle, and now is heading towards its crucial 200-DEMA. However, on weekly basis it traded inside the trading range of last week, but formed an Inverted Hammer on the weekly scale.

Now if it sustains below 24,500 zones then weakness could be seen towards 24,350 then 24,000 zones, while on the upside hurdles are seen at 24,750 then 25,000 levels.

29,2018-03-22,Asian Paints,"The recent sell-off in domestic equity markets has dragged the NSE Nifty below its 200-Day Moving Average (DMA), signalling that the index is losing momentum. So far this year, the 50-share benchmark has already slipped over 2 per cent to 10,155 till March 21.

More than 30 stocks on the Nifty50 are trading below their 200-DMAs. The list included Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Bosch, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Hindalco, HPCL, Lupin, ONGC and SBI.

Even on the Nifty500, as many as 294 stocks that constitute nearly 60 per cent of the pack, are trading under their 200-DMAs. This shows that the market is facing selling pressure across sectors.

Stocks trading below this crucial support line include names like Aban Offshore, Advanced Enzyme Technologies, Asian Paints, Aurobindo Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Bank of Baroda, Cipla, Colgate-Palmolive, Corporation Bank, Cox & Kings, DCB Bank, Dewan Hosing Finance Corporation, Dish TV, ICRA and NMDC, among others.

Moving averages are a tool for analysing the trend of a stock or even an index. They provide useful information on the support and resistance points.







Usually, any trader or investor uses three major DMAs - Daily Moving Averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 DMA. When a stock is trading above all of its DMAs, it is usually said to be in a continuing uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks are often seen coming off their highs and are slipping below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks testing their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause the stock not only to test 200-DMA but also slip below it.

Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, said, “If any stock trades below its 200-DMA, that means it is undergoing a serious corrective action. However, just because a stock trades below its 200-DMA does not mean that it is in a major bear trend. It just implies it is undergoing a major corrective move.”

Vaishnav told ETMarkets.com: “Bear trend in a stock sets in only if shorter term averages start trading below the longer term averages. As long as 50-DMA trades above 100-DMA and 100-DMA trades above 200-DMA, the stock just remains in a major corrective activity without any bear trend being initiated.” 

The 200-day average, also known as long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for the index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. A 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks.

S H Kelkar, Shree Renuka Sugars, Siemens, SJVN, SML Isuzu, Snowman Logistics, Tata Coffee, Tata Power, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Va Tech Wabag and Vardhman Textiles are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs.

The NSE Nifty index was trading 49 points up at 10,204 in early trade on Thursday. 

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking, said, “We reiterate that traders should remain light within this consolidation and should rather focus on individual stocks with a proper exit strategy. Directionally, the market is still not done with the corrective phase and hence, booking timely profits in existing longs with a short-term view makes a good play for the momentum traders.”"
30,2018-03-23,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: The number of crorepati senior executives in India Inc has increased nearly threefold in the past two years. The number of senior executives of BSE200 companies who earned more than Rs 1 crore in remuneration in FY17 rose to 1,172 compared with 422 in FY15, reveals data from Capitaline and annual reports.

Two key factors have contributed to this growth: first, large companies paid better remuneration to the senior management.

Secondly, more executives from midcap companies found a place in the sample as profits soared.

There are nearly five crorepati employees per company in the BSE200 group with an average compensation of Rs 5.5 crore.

They have paid nearly Rs 5,000 crore in compensation to executives in the past fiscal, or 1.1% of the total net profit.



The amount of compensation to senior executives receiving more than Rs 1 crore salary grew 47% every year between FY15 and FY17, while the profit of the BSE200 companies rose by 8%.

HDFC Bank, India’s largest bank by market capitalisation, had the largest number of senior executives (105) earning more than `1 crore, followed by TCS (91) and Bharti Airtel (82). The bank’s net profit grew by 19.5% annually in the past two fiscals.

In the manufacturing sector, companies such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Bharat Forge increased the count of the executives in the sample. In FY17, every fourth crorepati executive was from the manufacturing sector compared with one in 10 about two years ago.

Senior executives in the sample include Srikantan Moorthy, head of engineering global services at Infosys (Rs 3.2 cr), Jalaj Dani, president, supply chain, at Asian Paints (RS 3 cr), Amarpreet Singh Anand, VP, United Spirits (Rs 2.1 cr), and Dheeraj Arora, VP, modern trade, at HUL (Rs 2.1 cr).

There was also a rise in the number of crorepati executives at midcap companies, such as Kajaria Ceramics and Bata India. The number of such executives at Kajaria Ceramics increased to nine in FY17 compared with two in FY15."

32,2018-03-23,Asian Paints,"Post Budget 2018, Indian stock market has been on a roller coaster ride. In recent times, they have been hovering in the negative territory. This is largely related to the PSU banking stocks that have been ruffled with news flows and developments related to one of the largest PSU banks.

 And this has had a negative impact on the headline indices, considering that the banking stocks, in general and the PSU banking stocks, form a substantial chunk of the same. Small and midcap stocks have also taken a beating in the process, which is a common trait seen with this category of stocks whenever there is any kind of negative news in the market.

 Our stance for investing in PSU banking stocks has been consistent -- taking a ‘better to be safe than sorry’ approach. In fact, we have been maintaining this stance for a while now, as we continue to believe that issues related to them make the fundamentals unappealing despite their attractive valuations.

 Aspects such as poor quality of assets/loans advanced, the instances of mismanagement and the lack of autonomy environment that the banks’ managements operate in make the fundamentals of most players in this space, unattractive.

 These have only impacted the performance of the PSU banking space over their many years of their existence.

 So far, this call has worked in our favour. And we do not see any reason to change our stance anytime soon.

 Looking beyond this space and focussing on the broader market situation at the moment, we expect 2018 in general to be a relatively volatile year compared with 2017, which saw a run-up in stocks across the board.

 As more news unfolds, we believe that the pressure will only increase within the public sector banking space, and thus keep things quite shaky in the near term.

 Over the medium term, news flow related to the elections in key states this year will keep the market on its toes. Not to forget that the earnings numbers will play their part as well, especially at a time when expectations are running quite high.

 As such, investors would do well to brace for volatility in the short to medium term, but make the most of it by increasing exposure in a gradual and staggered manner.

 We say this because the broader situation is not bleak, as the broader fundamentals are unbroken. The fact is that the problem of housing shortage does remain and the need for quality infrastructure in the country is strong. The story of higher consumption and discretionary spends is very much intact. The government’s push towards improving the livelihood of the rural and agri space is real.

 One should always keep in mind that at the end of the day, investing in equities is essentially taking a call on corporate India, and how well it is doing and performing. Therefore, as long as companies grow and do well, equity markets will deliver healthy returns. And with India being one of the fastest growing large-sized economies of the world, it is a market that cannot be (or rather should not be) ignored.

 One may argue that broader valuations are not in the favourable zone. But simply going by history, one can infer that there are many stocks that have been massive wealth creators in short span of time. Despite one having invested in these stocks at the peak of the market before the 2008 crisis, one would have made good money over time.

 Some prominent examples include names such as Page Industries, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints or Balkrishna industries – all of which have moved up multifold in the decade gone by.

 Apart from having been multibaggers, what else is common amongst these stocks? Well, they are companies, which have seen strong growth, have above average return ratios, are compounding machines and possess good pricing power. This in itself is a combination that one can follow.

 At the end of the day, the fact remains that there is no close competition when it comes to equities being the best asset class to invest in for wealth creation over the long term. And thus having exposure to this asset class is a must. But goes without saying, should be in conjunction with one’s risk profile, of course."
33,2018-03-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Is your MBA at a second-rung business school worth it? Barring the top 50 Bschools, the remaining institutes find it difficult to place all their students. As many as half the students in some second and third-rung institutes don’t get placed, according to education experts.

Salary offers have not changed much over the past few years and some experts say the compensation offered can be as low as Rs 2-3 lakh per year. Average salaries at secondrung schools such as the TA Pai Management Institute (TAPMI), Institute of Finance and International Management (IFIM), SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST) and Jagan Institute of Management Studies (JIMS) have been almost static in the past two years. SRMIST has placed 63% of its batch so far compared with 66% at the same time a year ago. The average annual pay here for both years is Rs 4 lakh. 

Companies like Religare and OrangeScape Technology have offered salaries of Rs 2-3 lakh at SRMIST. At JIMS, salaries at the lower end have been at about Rs 4 lakh for the last three years, with 2015 recording a high of Rs 4.71lakh compared with Rs 4.6 lakh this year. At IFIM, the average salary has not budged from Rs 7.2 lakh last year. The average salary at TAPMI is Rs 10.6 lakh, among the highest in second-rung institutes, compared with Rs 10.1lakh per annum last year. “When compared to last year, the job market for second-tier Bschools is not so promising in terms of hiring,” said VM Ponniah, dean, School of Management at SRMIST. By comparison, a student from one of the top B-schools can expect an annual package of Rs 17-18 lakh on average. 
(Post-publication, TAPMI responded to the story claiming they were not a second-rung B school.)


Patience Key to Finding The Right Fit
“Besides the top 50 institutes where almost all the students get placed, the remaining institutes struggle to place their students with almost 20-50% of students without an offer in hand,” said Bakul Dholakia, former director of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad. He attributes this to the quality of faculty, infrastructure and student intake. According to another former faculty member who taught at IIMs, students have to accept offers of Rs 2-3 lakh. “Desperation forces them to take up temporary jobs of running odd errands in companies,” he said.



The fee for a two-year MBA programme at many of the second-tier institutes can go up to Rs 16 lakh while only a handful (less than 5%) get offers that exceed Rs 8 lakh per year.

Business schools such as We-School, Manav Rachna University, Fore School of Management, Jaipuria Institute of Management didn’t respond to queries.

Recruiters typically restrict themselves to the leaders among the tier-2 B-schools. “Campus talent from tier-2 schools is value for money. But we have to be patient in identifying the right fit,” said an HR head at a company that’s a regular visitor to the schools. Deloitte prefers to take the summer internship route, especially when it comes to zeroing in on talent from tier-2 schools. “It is better to go to these institutes and hire the talent through the summer internship.

This gives us a longer time to judge the right fit,” said SV Nathan, chief talent officer at Deloitte India. Currently, it hires only 20% of management personnel from second-rung management schools.

Amazon, another top recruiter at the management schools in India, does not differentiate between talent from top B-schools and the rest.

“The effort is on finding the right talent that would fit the Amazon culture irrespective of the institute,” said an Amazon India spokesperson. “When it comes to hiring new talent, our philosophy is focused on the potential we see in students. With India becoming a major growth story for us, we want top talent from B-schools to build a career at Amazon.”

JIMS in New Delhi said its placement rate is 90% this year. “Whilst recruitments in ecommerce and IT companies may have come down slightly, however, FMCG, consulting, banking and finance companies have etched a large footprint,” said Satish Seth, director general, JIMS New Delhi. Some of the recruiters at the institute include Deloitte, ITC, Asian Paints, Nestle India, ICICI Bank."
34,2018-03-25,Asian Paints,"Global markets continued to affect Indian stocks on the last day of the week. Though Nifty came off from their day’s lows, it still closed the day with a net loss of 116.70 points or 1.15 per cent on Friday.

 As we enter the fresh week, the caution will prevail, as we have a short week with Wednesday being the last trading day and also the expiry day of the current derivative series.

 Given the persistent weakness in global markets, we may see a modestly negative opening once again. However, that being said, the Friday’s low of 9,951 will be critical support to watch for. It may happen that we open lower, but do not breach 9,950, and improve later in the day.

 The levels of 10,075 and 10,110 will act as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports came in at 9,950 and 9,920 zones.



 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 32.1077, and it shows bullish divergence against the price. While Nifty formed a fresh 14-period low, the RSI did not. The daily MACD stays bearish trading below its signal line. A falling window occurred on the candles. This is a gap-down and implies a continuation of downtrend.

 But with the Nifty forming a white body, there are fewer chances that it may have a lesser impact in the present context and scenario on the charts. However, everything will need a confirmation on the following candle.

 Pattern analysis shows that the Nifty showed a minor pullback and resisted to the 200- DMA midweek. Thus forming a formidable resistance area, the Nifty continued to decline at the closing levels, while continuing to resist to the 200-DMA.

 While keeping in mind that the global markets will trade more days than Indian stocks, caution is certainly to prevail on our market.

 This cautionary approach may not see our market pulling back significantly or attempt to reverse the trend in this week itself.

 The current downtrend may persist, but the market is now overdue to attempt a technical pullback. However, the levels of 200-DMA will continue to pose immediate resistance.

 Now lows may not easily be formed or sustained. Some minor technical pullback can be expected any time.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Resilient technical setup is observed in stocks like CG Power, OIL, Marico, ITC, ICC, Idea Cellular, DishTV, BHEL, NHPC, HCL Technologies, Coal India, TVS Motors and Asian Paints.

0,2018-04-03,Asian Paints,"The domestic equity market is likely to remain volatile in FY2019 on account of political uncertainties, soaring crude oil prices and global trade war worries, among others.

Already, the 30-share BSE Sensex has plummeted around 3,000 points from its January 29 highs.

Key benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty were trading marginally in red in the afternoon trade on Tuesday following global cues. Escalating trade war tension between the US and China had recently dampened global market sentiment.

However, some analysts are saying that this is the time to build a long-term portfolio.

Here’s a list of 5 stocks recommended by global brokerage houses such as Citi, Nomura and Credit Suisse, among others.


Sun TV
Global financial services firm Citi is bullish on Sun TV with an upside of over 30 per cent, as valuations look attractive at present levels. The new financial year will be action packed for the company on account of three big movies, including two productions, with stars Vijay and Rajinikanth. Citi sees 14 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent revenue, ebitda and EPS CAGR over FY18-20E for Sun TV.


Asian Paints
Japanese brokerage firm Nomura maintained ‘Buy’ on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,360. Shares of the company were at Rs 1,149.15 on April 2. With a rise of 5 per cent, Asian Paints has underperformed BSE benchmark Sensex in the past one year. The 30-share index jumped 11 per cent during the same period. “Asian Paints was hit harder than others post demonetisation and GST. However, volume growth recovery appears imminent,” said Nomura.


Escorts
Credit Suisse maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on Escorts with a target price of Rs 1,040. Shares of the company were at Rs 883.20 on April 2. The global brokerage house said that Escorts has gained market share last quarter and demand for tractors remained very strong.

Escorts on Monday posted 65 per cent year on year (YoY) rise in tractor sales at 11,790 units in March 2018. It had sold 7,079 tractors in March 2017.


InterGlobe Aviation
InterGlobe Aviation, parent of airline IndiGo, has superior positioning as compared to its peers, according to Credit Suisse. The brokerage house maintained ‘Outperform’ on IndiGo with a target price of Rs 1,650. “Outperform based on strong sectoral growth,” Credit Suisse said.


Larsen & Toubro
Morgan Stanley maintained ‘Overweight’ rating on Larsen & Toubro with a target price of Rs 1,650 per share. “FY18 was a strong finish on order inflows and FY19 orders could be front ended,” said Morgan Stanley."

2,2018-04-10,Asian Paints,"Volatility has clearly dug in its heels in equity markets this year, and therefore, mutual fund investors in pursuit of good returns need to stay with schemes that invest in quality companies that have performed well in the past few quarters. This quality factor needs to encompass not just earnings growth but also management credibility and other key financial parameters.

Among large-cap schemes that focus on quality of companies, Mirae Asset India Opportunities has distinguished itself by performing consistently well by sticking to its investment mandate. In the past three- and five-year periods, the scheme has given 11 per cent and 21 per cent returns, respectively, while its benchmark, BSE 200, has given 8 per cent and 15 per cent returns in three year and five year periods, respectively.

The fund focuses on two key principles. One, buying companies which not only have a high return on capital employed and have generated consistent and incremental cash flows. Two, picking companies at attractive valuations. These factors have played crucial role in the scheme’s outperformance. It has been largely observed that the scheme has 5-10 per cent higher exposure to large-sized companies than its peers. In buying large-sized companies, the scheme’s fund manager, Neelesh Surana, chooses companies keeping their valuations in mind. The fund, co-managed by Harshad Borawake, has favoured consumption stocks, such as Marico, ITC, Dabur, Asian Paints and Hindustan Unilever.

3,2018-04-12,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: Kotak Mahindra Bank’s president for consumer banking Shanti Ekambaram has a deceptively simple approach to marketing. She calls it ‘business as usual’ and ‘disruptor’. “Business as usual is extremely critical because that forms almost 60-70 % of your base. The disruptor grows your base by 3-times and 4-times.”

This discussion stems from an assignment that will take up much of her time on Friday, the Brand Equity Marketing Awards jury meet. Ekambaram will join a panel of judges who will pick the final winners of the maiden edition of the awards, which will celebrate and, of course, award the finest and boldest marketers in the country.

Ekambaram, who has been an animating force behind Kotak Mahindra’s digital transformation, appreciates the changes afoot in the industry. She hopes to see evidence of that transition in the work that she will be judging. Or, as she puts it, “Has marketing in the relatively new era changed or is it old wine in a new bottle? Which means old ideas executed in new ways (given new tools and technology).”

Given there were 1,200 entries previously whetted by 40 expert jurors, at least some of the work is bound to meet her exacting standards. Ekambram’s fellow jury member Devendra Chawla, EVP at Walmart adds, “The challenge for brands is to stay relevant and manage the issue of disintermediation, more so in this digital era where the interface between consumers and brands is declining.” Chawla knows a thing or two about the brand consumer interface after amassing decades of experience, which includes stints at Asian Paints, Coca-Cola and Future Consumer. On judgement day, not the Biblical one that is, the winners in his mind will be those who do more than just check “the endless metrics marketers have”.

The judges will of course have a check list that will help them decide who walks away with a specially crafted trophy at the Brand Equity Marketing Awards, which is less than ten days away."

7,2018-04-23,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: The first Brand Equity Marketing Awards have been announced and the winners are: Asian Paints (Marketing Excellence), Bajaj V (Social Media Marketing), Carvaan from Saregama (Innovation), Durex (Digital Marketing), MakeMyTrip (Integrated Marketing), Rajasthan Tourism (Print Marketing) and Sonata ACT (Brand Launch).

The scope of winners was wide and varied. Bajaj V was a motorcycle crafted from the metal of India’s first aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, which put being social — both in terms of social good and leveraging the power of social media — at the heart of its communication. Carvaan brought an older audience closer to the songs they grew up on via an easy-to-use device. Durex effectively harnessed the power of digital and MakeMyTrip maximised the appeal of its celebrity brand ambassadors across all conceivable media vehicles.

The Rajasthan Tourism print campaign helped revitalise the appeal of an entire state among tourists. Sonata ACT was a watch targeted specifically at women and consisted of in-built safety features.

And finally, Asian Paints won for gaining phenomenal success in the market even as it reinvented the wheel on communicating what could have otherwise been a lowinvolvement b2b product.

The ceremony, held on April 20, was attended by some of India’s best-known personalities from the world of marketing and advertising.

Winners Chosen from Over 1,200 Entries
Those present in the event included Bharat Puri, MD, Pidilite; Sashi Shankar, chief marketing officer, Idea; Devendra Chawla, chief operating officer, Walmart; and Vikram Mehra, MD, Saregama, among others.

The ad business was represented by Ashish Bhasin, CEO, South Asia, Dentsu Aegis; Subhash Kamath, CEO, BBH India; Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands; Arun Iyer, chairman, Lowe Lintas; and Sonal Dabral, chief creative officer, O&M. The awards were presented by Piyush Pandey, executive chairman, O&M South Asia; Falguni Nayar, CEO, Nykaa; Prasoon Joshi, CEO, McCann Worldgroup India; and Ramesh Chauhan, chairman, Bisleri. The awards were interspersed by performances by a capella band Raaga Trippin’, a game of Pictionary which saw sporting participation from ad and marketing folks and a short session by YouTuber Snehal Kumar.

The winners were selected from a longlist of over 1,200 entries that went through a gruelling round of judging: a preliminary session held across Mumbai and Delhi with 40 category specialist judges, and a final round judged by some of the country’s biggest names in marketing. All the rigour paid off with the entries being deemed worthy of top honours by all of those present at the event.

Bhasin said, “You can relate to the quality of the work as being good and genuine. I personally prefer advertising that makes a difference in the life of people. So I liked the Sonata ACT campaign.”

The event was also an opportunity for many marketing and ad folks to find common ground to meet, given that the rather contentious nature of creative advertising awards has resulted in one or the other agency or group staying away every year.

Apart from the winners, the two big topics of conversation were the ongoing IPL and the recent exit of WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell — with the latter provoking many suppositions and conspiracy theories, considering Sorrell had been a boss, a rival, or an agency figurehead to many of those present.

The Brand Equity Marketing Awards will be back in a new, improved avatar in 2019. For full details on the winners, please remember to pick up the next issue of Brand Equity with The Economic Times."

13,2018-04-30,Asian Paints,"India has been a major beneficiary of the fall in international crude oil prices over the past few years. But crude prices have been rising for some time and Brent crude has already touched a 41-month high of $75 dollar (Rs 5,000) per barrel. 

Depreciation in the rupee, though small, is also adding to crude oil’s rising cost. While international crude prices jumped 45% in dollar terms last year, the spike was by 49% in rupee terms. 

This rise will impact us in several ways, including the jump in our driving expenses. Hike in oil prices will also lead to inflationary pressure and force the RBI to hike interest rates. 

Stock market investors need to be careful because the impact of the rise in crude prices will be slightly complicated. It will both be positive and negative, depending on the sector. Interference by the government may complicate the situation further. For instance, there were reports that the government had asked oil marketing companies (OMCs) to absorb the impact of the rise in crude prices to the tune of Rs 1 per litre. Though this has been denied by the government and the OMCs, the market still fears that the government may attempt to do this discreetly.


Crude shock for markets
Any govt move to prevent passing higher costs to consumers will hurt oil firms.

Let’s see how the rise in crude prices will impact oil industry players.


Upstream firms may have to bear higher subsidy burdenThe subsidy worries in the oil sector, which seemed to have been relegated to the past are likely to be back. Though only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene oil are subsidised now, this subsidy will balloon as the rise in LPG and kerosene prices won’t be passed on to consumers in an election year. “Government’s subsidy burden for 2018-19 may go up from the budgeted estimate of Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 40,000 crore now and as the government is not in a position to fund this, it is highly possible that it may ask upstream oil companies to bear it,” says Gagan Dixit, Oil & Gas Analyst, Elara Securities. 

But this does not mean that investors should totally avoid upstream oil companies— those involved in oil exploration and production. The added subsidy burden will not hurt them much as it will only marginally reduce their profit. “We are not bearish on upstream oil companies. We continue to be bullish on ONGC because of the new oil discoveries, increased gas production and increase in gas prices on half yearly basis,” says Dixit.


Price-caps will hurt OMCsStandalone refineries such as MRPL will not be impacted because they don’t share any subsidy burden. Central and state governments had raised excise duty and other levies when oil prices had fallen but it is unlikely that they will roll back these levies. “Since any cut in excise duty will have repercussions on the fiscal situation, the government is not in a position to cut excise duties now,” says Manish Sonthalia, CIO, Equity PMS, Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund. Since the state governments too are unlikely to roll back their hikes, raising prices is the only way out. But will the government allow OMCs to increase petrol and diesel prices in an election year? It is doubtful, because the required hike in prices is quite high. OMCs usually follow the 15-day average price, now placed around $70 (Rs 4,673)—$5 (Rs 334) below the current price. 

So, they need to increase prices to compensate this $5 dollar even if crude doesn’t go beyond $75. But OMCs may come under pressure, if the government imposes price caps. For each $1 increase in crude price, OMCs raise petrol and diesel prices by around 40 paisa—a hike of around Rs 2 for every $5 dollar increase in crude. If this increase is not allowed, their retail margin will suffer. Again, you don’t need to avoid all OMCs. “We are bullish on the refining industry and while we are bearish on OMCs such as HPCL and BPCL, we are bullish on IOC because of its higher revenue from refining and pipelines,” says Dixit.


Margins of crude oil users will come under pressureMargins of sectors that use crude derivatives as inputs will come under pressure. The paint industry will be among the worst affected because around 60% of its raw material is based on oil derivatives. While large players such as Asian Paints will be able to pass on higher costs due to their branding power, smaller players will come under pressure. Vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) is another crude derivative that is widely used by adhesive companies such as Pidilite Industries (VAM makes up 35%-40% of its raw material cost). Since most packing materials are now based on plastics, another crude derivative, FMCG companies will be affected. 

However, experts are not bearish on FMCG firms. “We are positive on consumer staples because of the rural demand and due to its under ownership now (most investors are bearish because these companies did not well in recent years). Companies with good pricing power will be able to protect their margin by passing on the increase in input costs,” says Manish Sonthalia."

0,2018-05-01,Asian Paints,"The March 2018 quarter yet again proves the resilience in earnings of large-sized companies even after several structural disruptions. Given this, it makes sense to be with a scheme which has high focus on large-sized companies and has consistently delivered superior returns in the long term. 

One such scheme is ICICI Prudential Focused Bluechip Equity. One of the factors that works in the scheme’s favour is its consistency in performance. This has been the hallmark even after its leading fund manager Manish Gunwani quit the fund house. Fund managers S Naren and Rajat Chandak have been managing the consistency in its performance quite well. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has delivered 13 per cent and 17 per cent returns, while its benchmark index Nifty50 has given 10 per cent and 14 per cent returns in the same period, respectively. 

This consistency in performance can be attributed to the fact the scheme follows its benchmark index quite closely. Considering this, it is quite evident the scheme has high weight to financial services companies. In the past six months, the fund managers have enhanced exposure to companies which have not participated in the rally of the past one year but hold the promise of strong earnings’ growth. These are Eicher Motors, Asian Paints and Larsen & Toubro.

11,2018-05-06,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market ended on a negative note last week, thus posting its first weekly loss in six weeks. Subdued global cues and heavy selling in IT and pharma stocks weighed on investor sentiment.

The S&P BSE Sensex ended 0.15 per cent lower for the week at 34,915, while the NSE Nifty settled at 10,618, down 0.69 per cent.

Here's a list of seven developments that may move the market in the coming week:


Next batch of earningsAmong notable names, ICICI Bank, Tata Chemicals and Tata Coffee are slated to announce January-March results on Monday, while ABB India and Jubilant FoodWorks will unveil their score cards on Tuesday. Eicher Motors and JSPL are scheduled to announce results on Wednesday.

Adani Enterprises, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Tata Communications, Titan Company, Union Bank of India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises will release their quarterly numbers on Thursday. Gillette India and Tata Global Beverages will announce January-March numbers on Friday.


Karnataka pollsThe Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections 2018 is scheduled to be held across the state on May 12. Results of the poll will be out on May 15. Leading parties, the ruling Congress and the BJP, have been campaigning aggressively in the state for the last few months to woo voters. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will be fighting against BJP's BS Yeddyurappa for the CM's post in the upcoming polls. Market will keenly follow the developments from the state.


US jobs dataUS job growth increased less-than-expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17.5-year low of 3.9 per cent, as some out-of-work Americans left the labour force, Reuters reported.

The report also showed wages barely rose last month, which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening. Financial markets across the globe, including India may react to it when trading resumes on Monday.


All eyes on US sanctions against IranOil prices rose about 2 per cent on Friday, with US crude hitting its highest in more than three years, as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported. On May 12, the US President Donald Trump will decide whether to extend waivers on economic sanctions against Iran. If it doesn’t, the global market could lose about one million barrels of oil a day, says a Market Watch report.

The sanctions on Iran were lifted under a 2015 agreement among a group of world powers, including the US and Iran, aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear activities.


Tech ViewThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a ‘Dark Cloud Cover’ pattern on daily chart, suggesting possible downside ahead. The pattern may have negative repercussions, which will be confirmed if the Nifty50 closes below the 10,600 level, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

However, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan has a bullish outlook on the index for the short term with a target 10,910 and reversal placed at 10,500. ""The short term trend will remain bullish as long as it does not close below 10,500. On the way up, 10,708 – 10,785 will be crucial resistance in the near term. The rise in the benchmark index can stretch towards 10,910, if it breaks the crucial resistance level of 10,785,"" Ratnaparkhi said.


Macro numbersThe government will release industrial production data for March on Friday. India's industrial output grew 7.1 per cent in February from a year earlier. This apart, the government will also unveil inflation data based on consumer price index (CPI) for April. Retail inflation stood at 4.28 per cent in March, slowing for the third straight month from a 17-month high, according to data released by the Central Statistics Office.


Global cuesThe big central banking event of next week is the Bank of England’s May 10 meeting, with market expectations overwhelmingly in favour of interest rates being held at the current 0.5 per cent. Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early April when investors priced a 90 per cent chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points, Reuters reported.

In addition, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting minutes will be unveiled on Monday, 7 May 2018."
12,2018-05-07,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The bulls ran out of steam on Dalal Street last week, owing to muted global cues and brisk selling on some of the heavyweight counters.

The S&P BSE Sensex ended 0.15 per cent lower for the week at 34,915, while NSE’s Nifty settled at 10,618, down 0.69 per cent.

Volatility is likely to remain strong next week too, says Teena Virmani, Vice President – Research at Kotak Securities. In the near term, the market would continue to focus on the outcome of assembly polls in Karnataka along with oil prices, yield movement, rupee depreciation. Also, by May 12, US President Donald Trump will decide whether to restore US sanctions on Tehran. If imposed, it would likely result in a reduction of Iran’s oil exports, thereby further lifting Brent prices, she said.

In the medium to long term, the focus would be on state elections lined up for H2CY18, earnings recovery, fiscal deficit, interest rate movement as well as demand revival, Virmani said.

Based on the recommendations of various brokerages, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver good gains over the next three weeks.


Aditya Agarwala, Technical Research Analyst, YES Securities (India)


Federal Bank | BUY | Target Price: Rs 107-112 | Stop loss: Rs 95

On the weekly chart, Federal Bank is on the verge of a breakout from a falling wedge resistance line placed at Rs 102, which is a bullish pattern. A successful breakout and a close beyond this resistance line with healthy volumes can extend the uptrend in the coming trading sessions. On the daily chart as well, the stock is on the verge of a breakout from an Ascending Triangle pattern. The neckline of the pattern is at Rs 101; a trade above the neckline will confirm the bullishness extending the upward move in the coming trading sessions. RSI has turned upwards after taking support at the Rs 50-level indicating a range shift in favour of the bulls.


JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals | BUY | Target Price: Rs 350-Rs 365 | Stop loss: Rs 300

On the weekly chart, JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals is on the verge of a breakout from a channel pattern resistance placed at Rs 328. The stock has turned upwards after taking support at the midpoint of the channel and now on the verge of a breakout from the channel. On the daily chart, it has broken out from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions. RSI on weekly chart has turned upwards after breaking out of the upper Bollinger Band affirming the strong bullishness dominant in the stock.


MAS Financial Services | BUY | Target Price: Rs 665-Rs 680 | Stop loss: Rs 608

On the daily chart, MAS Financial Services is on the verge of a breakout from the neckline of an inverse H&S pattern placed at Rs 634. Breakout and sustained trade above this resistance can extend the uptrend. The stock has resumed its upward trajectory after taking support at the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level affirming bullishness. RSI has turned upwards from the lower end of the bull zone i.e. Rs 50 level, suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA Technical Analyst


Tata Sponge | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,200 | Stop loss: Rs 1,080

After forming highs in the Rs 1,238-Rs 1,249 zone and marking a Double Top, this stock has remained in a modest corrective decline. Few signals have occurred which point towards likely resumption in upward move. While RSI stays neutral against the price, it is seen inching higher forming a higher bottom. The daily MACD is sharply moving towards a positive crossover. Weekly MACD has reported a positive crossover and it is now bullish while trading above its signal line. On-Balance Volume or OBV has already marked a fresh high. All these collectively point towards likely upward revision of price over coming days.


Asian Paints | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,260 | Stop loss: Rs 1,152
This stock is under prolonged consolidation and has grossly underperformed the general market. After marking recent highs and making a not-so-classical double top, the stock is under minor corrective retracement. It closed above its upper Bollinger band but saw a temporary pullback inside the band. Daily and weekly MACD charts remain in continuing buy mode. The weekly RSI has just marked a fresh 14-period high which is bullish and is seen breaking out of a formation. Weekly Bollinger bands are 44.37 per cent narrower-than-normal and this further improves the probability of a sharp move in price.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher


Prakash Industries | BUY | Target Price: Rs 230 | Stop loss: Rs 190

This stock has made, more or less, a higher bottom formation pattern in the daily chart, taking support at the Rs 192 level and signifies strength and potential to rise further in the coming days. It has maintained above the significant 50-DMA level and also has moved above the 34WMA moving average to maintain a positive bias and with the RSI indicating a recovery path there is much scope for improvement. With minimum risk on the downside and with the chart looking attractive for a decent return, we recommend a buy rating on this stock.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research &amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


Dish TV | BUY | Target Price: Rs 82 | Stop loss: Rs 73
After retracing 62 per cent of its last leg of rally from the lows of Rs 62, this counter appears to be consolidating around its 50-day moving average, whose value is placed around Rs 74, for the last couple of trading sessions. Interestingly, the weakness in the broader markets has not adversely impacted this counter as it almost remained flat in last five sessions suggesting that bottom may be in place around these levels.


Manappuram Finance | BUY | Target Price: Rs 140 | Stop loss: Rs 117

In turbulent market conditions, this scrip has chosen to hit new lifetime highs suggesting it has decouple with the broader direction of the market and can move to much higher levels based on its own inherent strength. As last couple of months price action appears to be inside the ascending channel, post Thursday’s breakout it should ideally head towards upper boundary of the said channel whose value is placed around the Rs 140 level.


Ujjivan Financial Services | BUY | Target Price: Rs 464 | Stop loss: Rs 397

This counter appears to be on the verge of a breakout as it appears to have started a fresh leg of upswing on relatively much higher volumes in last Thursday’s session. However, considering the volatility on the markets, positional traders are advised to adopt a two pronged strategy of buying now and on declines close to the Rs 410 level for a target of Rs 464.


Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities


Crompton Greaves | BUY | Target Price: Rs 270 | Stop loss: Rs 226
A sharp weakness seen on Feb 18, this stock has shifted into a larger consolidation pattern in the last couple of months, as per weekly timeframe chart. Currently, the stock price is showing an upside breakout of the upper range of Rs 245 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this hurdle could have a sharp positive impact on the stock price ahead. Weekly 14-period RSI is showing a positive indication and volume is also supporting the current bounce.

61,2018-05-14,Asian Paints,"Santosh Singh, Head of Research, Haitong Securities, calls on investors to go stock specific rather than sectors. He told ET Now that impact of GST and demonetisation on consumption is thinning. And that's a major tailwind.Edited excerpts: 

The Karnataka Exit Poll results came by on Saturday. Could the reaction to the exit polls which are indicating a hung assembly be a little stark in the near term?
The exit polls appear confused. The market is also going to remain confused today. But tomorrow, when results come out, is more important. The macro trends are not looking so great and if tomorrow results are not so great for the ruling party at the Centre, then we will definitely see some amount of profit taking in the market. 


What are you advising clients to do at this point in time -- fresh positions or raising cash?
The micro trends are quite positive. In case of a lot of companies, there are earning upgrades. So, on a macro front we might see headwinds but on the micro front, we are seeing a lot of positive things happening. We would advise our clients to be stock-specific rather than buying the market or buying the sectors.


How should one read into commentary from US President Donald Trump on pharma. It is a mixed kind of feeler. On one side, Donald Trump is acknowledging that US healthcare costs are high and generic players have to increase their total presence in the US healthcare market, on the other hand he has not come out with anything specific to take the cost down or keep a check on insurance companies and the distributors. What does it mean for Indian pharma companies in the generic market? 

US generic is the key for Indian pharma companies and whatever we heard from President Trump appeared positive. At least talking about generics being important seems positive for the Indian pharma companies. For Indian pharma stock prices, there is a lot of negativity on the generic side. At this juncture, given the way rupee is moving, I would rather look at this sector because they have gone through a real tough times in last one year.


Sun TV has already done pretty well on year-to-date basis. The overhang of political uncertainty also is well behind it. Is there merit in buying the stock right now?
This is one of the strongest name in southern states. They have got really good franchise. The only problem has been the political uncertainty which keeps on coming. Although the numbers are really strong, given that next year is election year, you would not want to bet on something which is going to move on political uncertainties. I would rather look at it post elections when there is more certainty.


Ideally, paint companies should do poorly when crude prices or oil derivative prices are moving but Asian Paints has done the reverse. They have managed to report a volume growth and margin expansion at a time when oil and derivative prices have gone higher. What is your view?
The effect of GST and the DeMo are wearing off in the consumption sector. That is a positive, As such Indian consumption has been on a very strong footing for some time now. For the next one or two years, there will be a lot of focus or spending in this sector from the government side. So, whatever happens to the underlying inputs, demand is going to be very high this year and moving into next year. In this sector, we should not look at the second level derivative that is input prices. If the franchise is really strong, consumption as a story is going to play out very strongly in India.


How are you combing through the commodities basket for opportunities right now?
For last one, one-and-a-half month, we have been not much positive on the commodity stocks simply because the movement has been really sharp across the board in commodities and given the expectation of a revival of demand in Chinese economy and firming up of commodity prices globally, at this juncture. we are not big fans of mining, especially the metal side of the business. However, the only stock which we like for some time is Hindalco because non-ferrous is an area where we have been slightly positive on.



Are telcos really an avoid given all that is happening with part of the disruption?
Yes, for a long period of time, we have been talking about it. This is a matured sector which has been forced to become new entrant because a new entrant has come in and changed the rules of the game totally. Their profits are reducing and it does not seem like that competition is going to reduce from Jio. Also some of the rules are not really favouring the existing players. Clearly this is one sector I would not be buy into now.


Do you continue to steer clear of the PSU banks space?
One of the positives which is coming out is that we are seeing a peaking out of NPAs. If we are just going to look at that, then these companies might look interesting but my view has always been that leaving aside a State Bank of India or a Bank of Baroda, where is the franchise value lying in the PSBs? 

A lot of them are already into this PCR and then you have got hardly any franchise which is left with them. They are going to lose market share and I do not know for how much time they can keep the deposits because one of their biggest strengths has been that they did not lose deposit market share. They have been losing the retail loan market share. But I would think that if the things go on like this for some more time, then they might start losing deposit market share as well. 

That means they will lose franchise value as well. Within PSUs, we do not look at prices. The only buys we have or the only stock we like in this space is State Bank of India because that has been a totally different story within the PSU space. It is better run, NPL problems are not that high. They have not lost market share. They are competing with all other private sector banks. So, that is the only one. If we have to put a bet on PSU, that is the only one which we would like at this juncture."

64,2018-05-15,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: India Inc is slowly overcoming its inertia despite turbulent politics, choppy markets and hardening oil prices. For a consumer economy plagued by supply overhang, promises of capital expenditure by several private sector companies after a year-long lull have stoked hopes of a rebound. Tata Steel, Ambuja Cements, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, CEAT, Apollo Tyres and Jubilant FoodWorks are among the companies that have announced investments totalling Rs 50,000 crore in the past four months.

Jubilant FoodWorks, which paused store expansion in the previous fiscal, plans to open 75 new stores in FY19 following a six-year-high growth of 26.6% in the March 2018 quarter. High capacity utilisation and better demand visibility are major triggers for companies to commit — and in some cases even go ahead with — fresh capital investments. The growth in private capex in India slowed down to less than 7% annually between FY11 and FY17 for the BSE 200 companies (excluding banking and finance firms and IT). But this figure comes down to 2% if investments by Reliance Industries, which was largely driving the capex growth, are excluded.

Capex growth had risen at a rapid pace of 35% between FY03 and FY11. The gross capital formation of Indian companies, which reflects investments in assets, dropped to a decade-low 27% in the September 2017 quarter, according to the ministry of statistics and programme implementation.





‘Fund-Raise to Help Capex Cycle’ 
But industry trackers believe that the cycle is turning for the good and chances of a more evenly distributed capex growth are stronger.

“Uptick in housing cycle, revival in select industries and continued government support are the key positives. Also, companies are expected to raise $60 billion (around Rs 4 trillion) in the primary equity market in the next two years. This should help capex cycle,” said Amit Tiwari, Partner, Pineoak Capital, a wealth manager.

Morgan Stanley in a note a few months ago said, “We expect a positive inflexion point in the macrocycle in 2018. This will likely be marked by a synchronous recovery in domestic and external demand and, more importantly, a pick-up in private capex for the first time in six years.” And, in the customary chat with analysts, more and more companies are talking about capex plans — a conversation they refrained from in the past one year.

Typically, capacity utilisation of over 80% prompts companies to expand capacities. According to RBI data, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector rose to 74.1% in the December 2018 quarter from 71.2% in the June quarter. The capacity utilisation of several companies in the consumer discretionary sector has crossed 80% and some facilities are operating at the full capacity.

For Hero MotoCorp, utilisation reached 82% in FY18 on the current installed base of 9.2 million units. In the earnings concall after the March quarter results, the company announced it would spend Rs 2,500 crore to increase the capacity to 10 million by 2020. “The main objective of capacity expansion is to fulfil demand without facing capacity constraints,” said a company official of Hero MotoCorp.

Eicher Motors, the manufacturer of marque motorcycle Royal Enfield plans to increase the installed capacity to 1.2 million by FY21 from the current capacity of 0.95 million by investing Rs 800 crore. Analysts expect Royal Enfield to record 14% growth annually between FY18 and FY21, which will require the company to expand capacity.

In line with automakers, autoancillaries too are increasing capacities.

Subbiah Kumar, CFO at CEAT said, “We are increasing capacity since we expect demand to remain strong. We also anticipate increase in the wallet share from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)”.

The capacity utilisation of CEAT is more than 80% and its truck and bus redial facility is at full utilisation. CEAT is investing Rs 4,000 crore in the next 2-3 years to increase its capacity to 1600 tons per day from around 1000 tons per day.

Its peer, Apollo Tyres is putting up a new greenfield facility inAndhra Pradesh by investing around Rs 1,800 crore.

Satish Sharma, president for Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa at Apollo Tyres, said: “With the automotive sector being the shining star of the GDP growth, there is an increased demand for tyres. Amid the increased demand for tyres, our products, across categories, is getting a good traction. While the de-bottlenecking and brownfield capacity expansion will help us meet the demand now, the Andhra Pradesh greenfield, once ready, will cater to the increased demand for the next five years.”

The buoyancy in the disposable income is prompting multiplex operators to expand capacities.

PVR, India’s largest multiplex operator, plans to open 90 screens in the current fiscal with an investment of Rs 450 crore.

Nitin Sood, CFO of PVR, said the company is stepping up the pace of screen additions and upgrade of existing screen portfolio.

The other large multiplex operator, Inox plans to open 55 screens in FY19 by spending Rs 250 crore."

Karnataka Results to be Out Today

The ruling Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fought in all 222 constituencies while the Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) fielded candidates for 201 seats. Its ally Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) contested 21 seats. The market would possibly be happier with the JD-S allying with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instead of the Congress. 


Oil Cos Resume Raising Prices
State-run oil companies have resumed raising prices of petrol and diesel following the conclusion of voting in Karnataka. Prices of petrol and diesel have been raised by y 17 paise and 21 paise, respectively, resuming price revision after a 19-day rate freeze ahead of voting in Karnataka.

No Units or Offices in India, Yet MNCs Slapped Tax Notices 
The I-T department's zeal to scoop up extra revenue continues. A US-based multinational company without a subsidiary or representative office in India received a notice by post asking it to file returns for assessment year 2011-12 for income that India’s tax department claimed had escaped assessment. Tax experts said many companies had been served similar notices for not filing returns. This could also result in transfer pricing compliance issues if the payer is a related party in India such as a subsidiary. The recent budget amendment enables authorities to initiate prosecution proceedings for not filing tax returns.This has many MNCs worried.


RBI Puts Deposit, Lending Curbs on Allahabad Bank 
The Reserve Bank has imposed restrictions on Allahabad Bank lending to risky assets and raising high-cost deposits in view of its deteriorating financial health. The directive has come within days of the RBI imposing similar restrictions on another state-run lender Dena Bank, which is under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) of the central bank. Meanwhile, the government today said it has initiated action for removal of Allahabad Bank CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian following the CBI's first chargesheet in the $2 billion fraud at PNBN detailing her role. Ananthasubramanian was the managing director of PNB till May 5 last year.

66,2018-05-15,Asian Paints,"Jefferies Group has a buy call on Asian Paints Ltd. with a target price of Rs 1385. The current market price of Asian Paints Ltd. is Rs 1298.45 Time period given by analyst is year when Asian Paints Ltd. price can reach defined target. Asian Paints Ltd., incorporated in the year 1945, is a large-cap company with a market cap of Rs 124547.04 crore.

Investment rationale by JeffriesAPNT Q4FY18 revenue and EBITDA growth of 14.7% YoY and 18.7% YoY, respectively, came slightly ahead of our estimates but PAT growth of 4.9% YoY was lower due to higher than expected tax rate. 10% YoY decorative volume growth suggests some recovery and addresses concerns of market share loss to an extent. Mgmt calling out improvement in demand conditions is heartening, something that was not heard in the past three quarters. Maintain BUY with PT of INR1,385.


Topline: Decorative paint volumes saw double digit volume growth of 10% YoY post 5 quarters despite a high base of 9% YoY. Overall consolidated business grew 14.7% YoY also aided by improved performance in industrial JVs (largely driven by auto OEM and General Industrial). Performance of home improvement improved sharply during Q4FY18 and H2FY18. International business was impacted by currency fluctuations in Egypt and Ethopia and sluggish demand in Srilanka.

Margins: Consolidated gross margins dipped 47bps YoY while EBITDA margins expanded 62bps YoY with 76bps YoY improvement in other expenses. YoY dip in gross margin has been coming down each quarter since Q1FY18 and expected to come off as the same comes into base going forward. Standalone business saw 20bps YoY expansion in margins and 155bps YoY improvement in EBITDA margins. Higher input prices impacted the overall margins in the industrial, international and home improvement business.

Key highlights from analyst meet (details inside): Demand improved for the paint industry during H2FY18. Rural growth was higher than urban growth for the company. Mix improvement helped the overall gross margins. Not losing market share, not witnessing shift from unorganized to organised and vice versa. Demand for both Sleek and Ess Ess have picked by in H2FY18 with growth of 18% in Sleek and 32% in Ess Ess during H2FY18.

Valuation/RisksWe adjust our FY18 numbers to that of the full year leading to ~1% cut in topline; however, we increase our EPS estimates for FY19/20 by 3%/4%, respectively, as we built in higher margin expansion on the back of better mix, cost savings and improving demand environment leading to better leverage. While steep valuations limit potential for re-rating, we believe EPS growth trajectory of ~20% over FY18-20 should help sustain multiples. We maintain our target multiple of 45x Mar20E EPS (~10% premium to its five-year average multiple) to arrive at PT of INR1385 (INR1330 earlier). Key risks: 1) lower volume growth; 2) sharp rise in key inputs like crude and Tio2."

90,2018-05-16,Asian Paints,"A day after paring 120 points from the high point of the day, the Nifty continued to remain weak on Wednesday, as it opened with a modest gapdown and drifted lower during the session.

The market made an attempt to recover from the day’s lows, but ended the trade losing 60.75 points or 0.56 per cent.

While keeping aside the prevailing uncertainties over Karnataka politics – even though it had short-lived sentimental effect -- the present technicals continue to point towards more consolidation.

We are likely to see a quiet opening on Thursday, and the previous day’s low and its range would be an important support to watch out for. The zones of 10,680-10,700 would be immediate levels wherein the Nifty might consolidate again. Thursday will see the levels of 10,745 and 10,785 acting as immediate resistance. Supports will come in at 10,680 and 10,625.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 60.1660, and it continues to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish, while trading above its signal line. On the candles, a ‘Spinning Top’ was formed. It has a small real body and signifies a session full of indecisiveness on part of market participants. 

Pattern analysis reveals that the Nifty has stalled its upmove, which it had resumed after suffering a throwback. The index has broken out of a broad rectangle formation as evident from the charts. However, even after a throwback and subsequent resumption of the upmove, the Nifty still appears to remain under consolidation.

Overall, though we can expect some stability to come in, volatility is still likely to remain very much ingrained in the session. Though any structural breakdown may not happen, still oscillations within a given range are likely to remain volatile.

Also, the higher levels of Nifty PCR (Put to Call Ratio) still remain a concern.

We expect consolidation to continue, as the Nifty is likely to oscillate keeping the range of 10,785-10,930 as its major resistance area for the immediate short term.

Highly cautious and stock specific approach is advised for the day.

81,2018-05-16,Asian Paints,"The billion dollar question on everybody's lip is if Narendra Modi is coming back to power next year. That narrative is going to be a driving force for market sentiment and price multiples for the next 12 months. Gautam Chhaochharia, ED and Head of India Research, UBS, spoke to ET Now. Edited excerpts:


Why is there such a selloff in mid-cap stocks? The fact that the tide has turned for small and mid-cap stocks is quite worrying?
For a few reasons possibly; one is the starting valuations were becoming almost frothy and not just rich for a few mid-caps and small caps. Secondly, macro headwinds are hurting local sentiments. People had made a lot of money in small mid-caps. The normal tendency would be to book profits there rather than keep hoping for more upside for valuations. 

The last thing is that the flows from foreign investors have been weak this year, both in absolute terms as well as in the context of global emerging market flows. That also adds to the negative sentiment for this asset class for local investors including HNIs and mutual funds.


Where are we headed from here? Do you feel that some of these mid-caps, which are falling for no reason and are fundamentally sound companies, are almost reaching that trough point where they could again be considered for a buy? Is there still some more pain to go for mid and small caps at large? 
It is always tricky to have a single view on Mid and small caps as an asset class. There are always bottom-up opportunities in the correction phase. There are mid and small caps which have done well in absolute terms also. But , if we want to stretch that argument, valuations in mid and small cap indices -- both in absolute as well as in relation to large caps -- is still not a level where we would say go overweight on mid-caps. We are still underweight in mid-caps from the broader market perspective. But yes, select opportunities always are there.


How are you approaching the markets post this earnings season especially, as there has been a big carnage in the broader markets?
It will be a mix of many signals. The global signals will still be the dominant driver possibly. The local signals are the earnings. The earnings season has been reasonably okay this time with many consumer facing businesses reporting positive surprise in volume growth.

On the other hand, in the next few months we will see if there is any potential support to rural economy from the government in the form of stimulus or fiscal expansion. The various models which we have elaborated and analysed in our recent note, including the model followed by MP or Telangana, would have a bearing on how the specific mid-cap and small cap stocks as well as the broader markets perform. 

Lastly, there is the narrative around 2019 elections. We are just a year away from the national elections. The narrative around whether Mr Modi is coming back or not next year will be a driving force for market sentiment and multiples for the next 12 months.


Do you think the Karnataka election was well priced in with that 1.5% volatility that we saw on the index and also the fact that mid-caps after having started off the day very well, fell pretty sharply from the top of the day?
The markets are pricing in that the BJP will form a government in Karnataka but beyond Karnataka. it is not about whether they form a government in Karnataka or not. The bigger narrative here is what it means for 2019 elections and that is what will drive the market reactions. 

So, if the Karnataka outcome starts showing up that the JD(S) and Congress are getting together, then it does add some level of discomfort around the Modi narrative for 2019. What is more important for investors to track is the fragmentation or unity among opposition parties and that will be the bigger delta in terms of the possibility of this government coming back in 2019. Markets clearly hope for and are pricing in Mr Modi’s return given the strong track-record of reforms over the last four years.


Are we done with the highs for the year and it is going to be perhaps very difficult for markets to a) go to the previous high and then b)stay above that?
Going above the highs is not too much from the current levels. It can definitely go there. You need four, five days of strong flows or strong buying and so that is not a big deal. But yes, fundamentally our base case for Nifty for December 2018 still remains 10500 and if I look at our upside downside scenarios also, the risk reward is definitely not attractive. 
Our recommendation to investors is not to get in or buy at these levels. They will get better opportunities later in the year.


When we started the year, nobody was pencilling in an uptick of 20% in crude prices. Nobody was pencilling in a 70, 80 or even a 100 bps uptick in bond yields, or a LTCG. Yet markets have been strong. The expensive stocks have even become bigger and the PE multiples for HUL, Asian Paints, even Maruti has only expanded. Why are markets getting more and more polarised?
As you said, it is a mix of rising macro concerns but still strong inflows. If you have inflows, you have to buy stocks. If you have concerns, then you try to hide in quality. Exactly that is what is playing out and as for the markets as long as the flows remain strong the markets may not correct in a big way.

Even with India’s rising macro concerns, over the last few months, the global macro backdrop has been quite supportive so that we have seen risk assets largely being okay. 

Emerging markets have seen more than $50 billion of inflows and that is why we have not seen any major outflows out of Indian equity markets despite some concerns on valuations and macro. The key here is the sentiment and flows. Sentiment has taken a back seat over the last two-three months given the macro concerns but the flows remains strong and we still have not seen any desperation amongst investors globally or locally to really start cutting down exposures in India.


 What should be the approach for the rest of the year? At a time of dwindling macros, there is still a little bit of a question mark on which way globally things are headed. Crude is a big cause of concern which is also weighing heavy on our macros and then there is the political uncertainty. Should one buy more of the same - more of HDFC Banks, Marutis, TCSs of the world or take a more bottom up approach?
I would say a mix of both. In this backdrop, the quality names will do well but there are select bottom up opportunities sectorally and stock wise, which investors should push because the long-term story for India still remains intact. 

There is debate on global growth outlook, about a synchronised recovery or lack of that. But nobody is saying we will see a big recession anytime in a hurry. The backdrop is still okay and we should not panic where you sell out and get out in a hurry. Look at the right stocks at the right levels. Bottom up always works in India and this year also should continue to work in India.


How would you approach the entire consumption theme and select stocks within that?
We are looking at two themes there. One is in general, the rural exposed businesses should do well whether we see a major policy support for rural or more rhetoric than actual money being spent. Any which way, the rural sectors will be supported this year ahead of elections and the commentary there should be positive.

Secondly, companies or specific companies on a bottom-up basis where we are seeing clear signs or normalisation of supply chain, gaining market share from informal sector as GST, e-way bill etc gets rolled out this year. Those would be the other opportunities from a bottom up fundamental perspective. And then we overlay that with where the stocks multiples are compared to recent history, medium term history and how the stocks have done and see what they are pricing in and that does throw up interesting bottom up ideas from that space and that is what we will stick to.


Where is value emerging in the mid-cap space now.
So, there is no space as such but yes bottom up there are opportunities in segments where the micro picking up is not broad-based but there are signals for sectors or stocks already visible. That would be an interesting area to look at. That is where the value is because the markets are not pricing in that recovery. Markets are reacting a lot more in terms of immediate numbers, not so much forward looking. That’s why it is reacting very violently in terms of the Q4 numbers on both positive and negative side."

98,2018-05-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: It's a sweet and sour feeling the way March quarter earnings have panned out so far.

The short point is there were only a few positive surprises as the season enters its last lap. And the numbers at best are in line with market expectations. 

A few consumption-driven sectors continued with their recent volume-driven growth. But red flags are going up. Rising raw material costs could play a spoilsport for some of them, going ahead. PSU banks with record losses disappointed the most. 

Combined sales of 1,040-odd companies -- apart from PSU and private banks -- climbed 14.9 per cent while their net profit surged 37 per cent on a low base last year. The March quarter of 2017 turned out to be painful for India Inc because of the cash ban announced in November 2016.

Top line rose to Rs 11,55,547 crore compared with Rs 10,05,488 crore in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line for the universe swelled to Rs 1,06,437 crore from Rs 77,801 a year earlier. 

On a sequential basis, sales for these companies went up 7.62 per cent. Profit advanced 4.14 per cent, Capitaline data showed, as compiled by ETMarkets.com.

Banks, especially PSU ones, made jaw-dropping NPA provisions during the March quarter. The result: as many as 14 banks reeled under losses amounting to Rs 46,593 crore. This includes PNB's record loss of Rs 13,416.90 crore. SBI (Rs 7,542 crore), Canara Bank (Rs 4,860 crore) and Allahabad bank (Rs 3,510 crore) suffered huge losses too. 

To give you a perspective, these 14 PSU lenders had reported Rs 4,338 crore loss in the year-ago quarter. If private and public lenders are taken into account, the 1,070 firms reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 71,072 crore for January-March.

""So far, the earnings season has been on expected lines. The upgrades and downgrades are by and large equal to each other following which the earnings estimate for the next year has only been marginally cut by about a per cent,"" said Neelotpal Sahai of HSBC Asset Management India.

From the Nifty bloc, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints, SBI, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Vedanta, HCL Tech, Wipro, Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel fell short of profit estimates. Others such as Bajaj Auto, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Lupin, Zee Entertainment, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Yes Bank came out on top.

""Consumer-oriented sectors from paints to consumer staples delivered not only good results, but very strong commentary on revenue and margin expansion. In some ways, that bullish guidance actually surprised me because I felt that commodity price spike would make them a little more circumspect about margins. Both consumer discretionary and staples are doing fine. Energy companies too performed well,"" Manishi Raychaudhuri of BNP Paribas told ET Now.

For the FMCG sector, what worked is the revival in rural growth, which has beaten the figure for urban areas for three quarters now. 

Metal companies have been putting up a strong earnings show, buoyed by a pick-up in metal prices. This partly hurt outlook for automakers though, which points to further impact of raw material inflation in H1 FY19. They may partially try to offset it by passing on the cost to consumers, said Motilal Oswal Securities. 

The squeeze was on the telecom sector, which saw ARPU downtrading due to renewed competition. That means Ebitda margin for the telcos may remain under pressure, going forward.

""Earning have been mixed bag so for, with IT , Cement , FMCG, Metal, Select private sector banks performing better on revenue, margin and net profit parameters. Some of the high frequency economic data-points such cement production, air traffic growth, petrol/diesel consumption, automobile sales among others, suggest a strong recovery in the economy. Revival in urban demand along with good monsoon led recovery in rural demand would augur well for the economy and corporate earnings,"" said Hemang Jani of Sharekhan. 

For the IT sector, FY19 should see an improvement on a low FY18 base, but the outlook is not exactly euphoric, the brokerage noted. According to Raychaudhuri, the currency depreciation has been a tailwind for software firms.

""In oil and gas space, refining margins have been good. Marketing margins have also been good after a tepid Q3 FY18. Outlook remains uncertain in light of high oil prices, a depreciating rupee, unwillingness of the government to cut excise duties on auto fuels, and the upcoming elections,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said.

Results of cement companies came in above expectations, led by lower-than-expected price decline and a better cost curve. The impact of higher petcoke and diesel prices was mitigated by better operating leverage and other cost efficiency measures, the brokerage added.

Jani said that the outlook for cement sector remains neutral as players across regions except eastern markets will continue to experience pricing pressure.""Moreover high Fuel expenses & logistics cost will keep margins under pressure,"" he said. 

So, where does that leave us with? The market will continue to be more truncated in favour of companies that can grow with earnings visibility, said Dhananjay Sinha of Emkay Global Financial Services.

""A rise in crude prices which can put pressure on margins due to higher Input costs. It could havesome growth and revenue repurcusion for FMCG, Cement , automobile sector. A rise in metal prices can be dampaner for construction & automotive industry & electrical component industry. Most of the Managements have shown concern regarding higher commodity prices . However, they said they will take price hike if required to pass on the higher RM cost. But we believe price hike might be challenging,"" Jani said."

99,2018-05-25,Asian Paints,"Krishna Kumar Karwa, Chief Executive and Managing Director, Emkay Global, spells out the art of making money from a three-year perspective. Other than putting 60-70% money in smallcaps, split the rest in midcaps and largecaps.Edited excerpts: 

A long-term optimist like you and me always try to look at the bright side. Buy today I am struggling, I am struggling because the core assumptions have got challenged on the interest rate front, on the oil front and also on the earnings front?
As you rightly said, macros are challenging and oil has gone up to $80 odd and that has had huge ramifications for a country like India which imports a lot of oil. On top of that, rupee at around 68.5 and hardening interest rates are adding to macro woes. My sense is we are in a cyclical upturn as can be seen by the performance of many of the domestic facing companies in Q3 as well as Q4.

There is this continuous mismatch between macro headwinds and micro. There is a lot of positives in micro and investors are caught in a dilemma. I believe that valuations are going to be the key trigger and that is what we are seeing of late in the last few months. Since valuations have been rich, people have been taking money off the table and liquidity seems to be strong. But let us see how that behaves. So, yes, very challenging environment from a short-term investor perspective but over a longer time frame, it all evens out.


In future, would all those who participated in the market in May 2018, be a happy lot or would those who do not participate and who hang on to their cash and capital have the last laugh?
A very short-term perspective is not the right way of looking at investing. Every investor has his own asset allocation strategy and risk return pay offs. But the fact remains that if you are looking from a short-term perspective, then returns are going to be challenging. Timing the market is always going to be a challenge. It is best to stick to your asset allocation strategy and accordingly have cash and equity or cash and other assets in your portfolio. Broadly keep an eye on valuations and your asset allocation strategy.


With the currency weakness, could there be a meaningful turnaround in the way one views IT and pharma?
From the last six months’ perspective, It stocks have already delivered stellar returns and that was not driven by rupee depreciation. It was primarily driven by attractive valuations. Even now, most of the companies have guided for a high single digit growth and some of them may have low double-digit growth. The question in the IT stocks or IT industry is basically about growth and opportunities in terms of the valuations. 

In order to invest in any sector or company on the basis of just one parameter, in this case currency, is not the right way to look at investing. A whole host of factors should be considered before investing but IT has done reasonably well. Most of the stocks are now probably quoting at very high valuations vis-à-vis the foreseeable growth in the industry. My judgment is that the run-up is over. 

As far as pharma is concerned, we are aware of the headwinds that pharma companies faced in last two years from their US businesses. Most of it is reflected in the stock prices but it is still a work in progress. May be the stocks have have bottomed out in terms of performances but valuations for the return ratios which are foreseeable in the next two years versus that valuations are still slightly expensive. May be one more year of pain is there before we can look to invest. May be, long-term investors can start accumulating at every decline but still some more time has to go as far as the US-focussed pharma companies are concerned.


The other interesting aspect of this market is that big is getting better, expensive is getting more expensive. Why is it that only 15, 20, 25 stocks are holding the market higher? If you knock off an Asian Paints, TCS may be a HUL, an ITC from the equation, the rest of the market is looking very hollow and this kind of a polarised market is never good news.
You have hit the nail on the head. Institutional investors tend to hide with each other in terms of in the stocks that they invest in. Currently the momentum seems to be with the name that you have mentioned and may be many of the institutional investors are not adequately invested in these stocks

The momentum seems to be there and they are hiding in these kind of stocks which are very expensive as you rightly said and I do not know how much return can investors make by investing in such expensive stocks, Ultimately you have to have an eye on valuations. It is going to catch up and we have seen that happening across market caps in the last 12-18 months. Wherever investors have ignored the valuations and have invested in momentum, it has never delivered returns. Then comes one small negative news and you lose the maximum over there. So, this is more of a hiding or a relative performance kind of a strategy than an opportunity which can help make absolute returns.


The earnings continue to be patchy. We do not know what banks would do. We do not know what pharma is doing. Cyclical companies are yet to go off the block. For someone who bought HUL or Titan three years ago, it was more expensive then. But frankly, in terms of returns they have managed to beat cyclical stocks hands down. This is a dilemma. Those stocks are expensive yet are making money. 
The stocks that you mentioned are all industry leaders in their respective segments. Their return and growth parameters and the way they have grown is obviously much superior than the rest. There will be paucity of floating stocks.

May be three-four-five years ago when you invested, they were expensive and today also they are making returns but there are intervening period when even such stocks do have their consolidation or relatively underperformance period versus the markets. The ability to stay invested in these stocks over longer timeframes is the key criteria which enables you to be able to earn the returns that you are talking of. 

As far as you are invested in top quality stocks across timeframe, they will deliver the returns despite some underperformances in the intervening period. It is all function of how you are positioning your portfolio and these kind of stocks do add lot of stability to your portfolios but you cannot only be invested in such expensive stocks. Somewhere valuations will catch up. 


How can one make money by investing the Krishna Kumar Karwa way?
First of all, let us look at the definitions of the market cap itself. As per the SEBI norms the top 100 companies become large caps which end at around Rs 30,000-crore market cap; then you have the next 150 companies which becomes the midcaps which ends at around Rs 9,000-crore market cap. All companies below Rs 9000 crore or Rs 8800 crore are small cap companies. 

If you go back Nifty, you see that over a longer timeframe it is the investing which you do in the smaller caps which gives you bigger compounding returns whether over a three-year timeframe or five-year timeframe. The first criteria according to me is that, based on your risk appetite, maybe 60-70% of your portfolio should be invested in good quality companies which are below this Rs 9000-crore market cap, today’s definition of small caps. That is the first segment that you look to invest in because those are the companies which will create multibaggers for you over a timeframe. 

I hope I have answered your question on where to put your money. 60-70% should go into the small cap sector and then maybe the balance can be split between your large caps and the midcap segments. That is my split as far as investing is concerned again from three-year perspective. 

As far as sectors are concerned, you need to be invested more in the leaders of these sectors that you are looking invest in. A leader in the sense the companies which you believe can become the leaders in the small cap segment. It is the same in NBFCs, consumption or auto ancillaries, Be amongst the top two-three companies which fall into this category.

2,2018-06-01,Asian Paints,"The correct way to approach a stock is to have an internal reference of what the business is worth. If Mr Market is giving you that price, sell higher 
  to Mr Market. If it is below that, buy from Mr Market, Mohnish Pabrai, Managing Partner of Pabrai Funds, tells Tanvir Gill and Nikunj Dalmia of ET Now.Edited excerpts:

You have told earlier that a business which you like in India is Piramal Enterprises. The Piramal Enterprises balance sheet is pretty much like Berkshire Hathaway, balance sheet in terms of disclosure, in terms of what they indicate and what they communicate. Here is a business which has potential to be a great compounder. What would you do there?
In a case like Piramal, there is some uncertainty around the fact that Ajay is going into relatively new areas which he has not been before and the markets always wonder if he is he going to stumble. You are absolutely right, a business like Piramal is a bluechip business. It is a very high quality and relatively low uncertainty business but for me, it was not a low risk high uncertainty bet as much as it was a jockey bet. 

Ajay has a few strong traits. One is he is very driven to deliver shareholder value in a very ethical way. Another of those traits is that he is a compounding machine and he cares about those things. A lot of management teams do not understand capital allocation and compounding and taking care outside shareholders. Riding on Ajay’s Piramal Enterprises is not a bad idea.


There was a lot of drama that played out with Rain Industries. The day the stock sold out, the side talk in the market was check with Mohnish Pabrai, is he selling? How do you look at the business out there? What have they reported in terms of earnings in the last quarter?
 I am not into stock tips and I do not want people to take it as stock picks. If we discuss Rain, it will be from the perspective of getting educated on how to deal with markets. From my perspective, there is really no drama in Rain at all. This is a business that I invested in about two and a half years ago vis-à-vis the price today. There is a six to one difference in my favour and so I have no complaints. 

It used to be 10 to 1. Two and a half years ago, they delivered a 10x. It is in the nature of equity markets that we are going to have extreme swings. Rain Industries, at one point in 2015, was priced at Rs 35 a share. A few months ago, it was priced at over Rs 400 a share. Now, it is priced at Rs 200 odd a share. The market is there to serve us, it is not there to instruct us.

We are not going to look at the stock price and then try to figure out what is going on. That will be a wrong way to approach it. The correct way to approach it is to have an internal reference of what the business is worth. If Mr Market is giving you that price, sell higher Mr Market. If it is below that, buy from Mr Market. We have a higher position in Rain today than we had three months ago and I am almost pretty much at the limit of the amount I am allowed to buy. We have to stay below 10% and we are just under that. I wish I could buy more, but I cannot.


Where do you see this lethal combination of high uncertainty and low risk going because that is your hunting ground.
Rain was a great example of low-risk high -uncertainty in 2015 and even in 2016. At that point, the company was going for Rs 30 or Rs 40 a share and there was a high probability that in the next three-four years, earnings per share would be equal to the price of the stock PO1. If I am buying at Rs 30 or Rs 40 and the earnings in 2018 or 2019 are going to be Rs 30 or Rs 40, I do not need a calculator and I do not need excel sheet. I do not even need a high IQ. In case of Rain, from the time I first heard of it to the time I placed the buy order was three hours. It was a very obvious investment and today I would say that this is probably not as obvious as it was then, but I have a better understanding of the business.

I have owned it for a while and we had a similar situation 12 or 14 months ago in real estate in Mumbai and other places. So, low risk, high uncertainty shows up very frequently in option driven markets.


That is not your only investment philosophy. When we scan through your portfolio, you also have Repo Home which is in housing finance because it is not a cheap stock from price to book perspective. There is certainty of growth because housing finance companies have been doing really well. So how do you play that story, what is the conviction that drives you there?
I would say, one should be really careful of levered institutions. In general, there are some elements of bubble in housing finance, maybe not amongst the listed players but anyone with some money wants to start a housing finance company and we are starting to see some of them having difficulties. I think lending is a difficult business. One of the simple things to remember while lending is when you make a sale, the cash leaves, it is not good to be in a business like that. One has to have a really strong approach to make sure that cash comes back. 

I have looked at several of the housing finance companies. Repco is a little bit unusual in the sense that the demographics are servicing typically do not have any competition. The only competition they have is the usurious money lender in the village who is charging 30-40-50%. They are actually taking people away from that type of environment into a more sensible environment. So they are getting into rural geographies and the Rs 10 lakh ticket price type areas. They have a moat around that. 

The second more important thing with them is that in the last 10 plus years, the write offs approached zero. So they have had NPAs and all of that but they have always had write backs against that. The actual write offs have been rounding error and that is the most important thing. One of the things I do not know as an investor is we do not know what happens in the future. So, I am making an extrapolation that the lending discipline they have had in the past will continue in the future. I am in a business with the high error rate, 30-40% error rates is normal even for Warren Buffett. We will see how it plays out but I think the odds are good.


Buffett also says that we love bad news as long as it is temporary because that gives us an opportunity to invest. If I look at classic compounder in India, that has been HDFC Bank. It never gave bad news and for those waited for bad news, they have never got one. How does one identify classic compounders like Asian Paints or HUL or HDFC Bank because they do not give bad news?
We are not going to be able to understand probably 99% of the companies. I probably understand less than 100 businesses in India that are probable listed and it is perfectly fine. In baseball, it is three strikes and you are out. Warren always says that in the investing business, they are no call strikes and so I love to be HDFC Bank investor. I am not an investor in HDFC Bank. I can get myself to buy at present prices, perfectly fine. There are 100 other ways to invest. One does not need to do it by looking at the past grade compounders. The investing business is a very forgiving business. We can do really well in the business even if we do not understand 98% of the markets and the companies in the market.


If we get the 2% right?
 It is very important to stay within circle of competence.


What would you define is your circle of competence? In the past, you have bought auto companies, commodity convertors, a seed company, real estate companies. What is the starting point which gets you to say hello to a stock? How do you start analysing a business?
One, what happens in any of our minds is in the first 30 seconds when we first encounter a company, it has a huge long term impact on our net worth. In the first 30 seconds you have to make a decision. Do I spend 30 more seconds more, or and another 5 minutes and then do I spend another half an hour? You keep going. At what point do you say that this is out and this is in? The data set is too large. If we were to spend a month on each business, we would never get to, probably 99.99% of the opportunities.

The way I look at the investing business is to be a harsh grader. Being a harsh grader means we have no call strikes. It is perfectly fine to say no to a company that ends up being a 100 bagger later. That is perfectly fine but it is more important not to have too many errors in your portfolio. Basically, when we look at these companies, I just have to ask myself if this is something I am able to get my arms around, something within my competence? 

Take the auto industry. I hated the auto industry. I still hate the auto industry, but 30% of my portfolio is in the auto industry. I have had huge returns in the auto industry. I spent about two-and-a-half months studying the auto industry before we actually became significant investors in such but at the end of two-and-a-half month period, I had certain insights that I felt were correct and that the market did not understand them so in that case it took a while. 

In the case of other Industries, it took a very short period of time. So, that is the nature of investing, Sometimes you can get to the finish line really fast and sometimes it takes a while. When I look at Repco Home, one of the first things I asked when I looked at any lender is what is their track record on defaults? What is their track record on the ability to collect back and how does management internally view that aspect of the business that is a very fundamental part of the business? Everyone can talk about spreads and all that, but is that the main driver or not? That is how I try to go at it."

Giving him company on the court are often other bosses, who leave their corner offices to play ball too. Gupta found one such tennis partner in Pidilite MD Bharat Puri. “As a management trainee in Asian Paints many years ago, I had the pleasure of playing with Bharat Puri.  It was great fun.

13,2018-06-04,Asian Paints,"Neeraj Dewan, Director, Quantum Securities, explains to ET Now that in the good quality midcap and smallcap stocks, the selling could be over.Edited excerpts:

There has been a selloff in the smallcap index for the last couple of months. What would you attribute the selling pressure to? Would it be the rally that we have witnessed in 2016 and 2017 or is the outlook going forward looks bleak with all the headwinds in terms of elections?
Multiple factors. are responsible. You cannot attribute this to one factor. Of course, one factor which is more significant, is what we witnessed in February, March. A lot of froth was building up in the midcaps and the smallcaps. Investors were buying anything and everything which anyone was suggesting. As froth built up, all these stocks became very expensive and ran much ahead of valuations. 

Not only the good quality stocks, even bad quality stocks, were running ahead at that time. There were no fundamentals to back them but still there was a lot of buying activity in those stocks. 

That was one of the major reasons which led to this froth building up. After the capital gains tax news came in the budget and with crude prices going up, there was talk about political uncertainty as well. All these negative factors aggravated the fall which started in March. 

In between, in April, we did stabilise a bit but then again with the crude going up, the talk of macro picture getting bleak, all that led to this kind of a fall in the midcaps and the smallcaps. Now, the thing has reversed. Everyone is talking about running towards safety, running towards largecaps and avoiding midcaps. Investors are not just avoiding midcaps, they are in fact dumping midcaps. 

Selling across the spectrum -- whether it is good quality or bad quality midcaps, smallcaps -- is taking place.


A large part of the fall in the broader markets has already taken place. Do you think there is another 10-15% fall in store or are we at the fag-end of this selloff?
I do not think there is too much of a downside left in good quality midcap stocks, though another 10-15% downside can’t be ruled out. The 10-15% fall is the maximum limit because a lot of these midcaps have already fallen a lot.

I saw advanced decline. The Nifty and the Sensex fell because stocks like HDFC, TCS, Asian Paints and Hindustan Lever led the fall from the top today. You may get some correction in the index but a large part of the correction in the mid-caps and small caps, at least the good quality ones, would have already got over. 

People may still be realising that they have some of the junk stocks in their portfolio, which they were expecting to rebound and which they may still keep selling. But in the good quality midcap and smallcap stocks, the selling may be over.


Other than Q4 GDP data, the macro picture does not look very encouraging. How do you see the macro picture from here onwards and what direction would the markets take based on that?
There are factors like crude, pressure on the rupee, which are mostly dependent on global factors and for this, we cannot really take a call right now. There has been some correction in crude prices. One does not know whether that correction will continue.

One good pointer was the US payroll numbers. Our GDP numbers are growing. We saw good sales growth in automobile and commercial vehicles continuing. This is giving some sort of an indication that growth is there and it is improving though it may be improving slowly. 

Somewhere down the line, there has to be a balance where you may get some factors like inflation going up. You may have some interest rate hike also. You may have an interest rate hike as early as this week as far as the domestic market is concerned and next week as far as US markets are concerned. 

If that is coming and the growth is also there, that small increase will get absorbed in the markets. That is my understanding. After the correction, you will get opportunities. If inflation is going up further, and if people start talking about political uncertainty, there will be some volatility in the markets which may even give you better opportunity.

As far as domestic growth is concerned, the numbers that we have seen and the kind of NPA resolutions that we have seen and even in the large part of the market which is the PSU banks or the corporate facing banks, a large part of negative is already priced in and they are already visible. Incrementally, I do not see any further deterioration there.

In fact, going from Q1 or this year you may start seeing some improvement happening as far as the NPAs are concerned. The provisions that they had taken, was because of the February 12th circular in the last quarter of last year. Going ahead, the pressure of provisioning may start decreasing on those stocks also. Incrementally, I feel that negatives are more or less priced in and you may get some volatility because of global factors which or inflation going up which you cannot price in right now but I think those will only be opportunities.


Your top bets are Quantum and there is DCM Shriram as well. What is the rationale behind liking this one?
One, there has been a massive correction in the stock. The massive correction was because of two factors. a), they took huge inventory losses because of sugar prices coming down in the last quarter and there were some write-offs that they took on the bio-seed business.

That write-off was something which they have already taken and which may not get repeated. They have taken a major hit as far as fall in the sugar prices are concerned but major profit for them now over the last few years have started building up because of their chlorovinyl division which earlier used to be 30% of their business and which has now become 37-38% as of last quarter. Going ahead, it will go up to 40-42% of their business and that is where they are doing their capex also.

They are doing a planned capex of about Rs 1100 crore because there will be more cogeneration capacity coming in. Distillery capacity has also come in last quarter. All that capex is coming in 2019-2020 and it will keep on showing the growth on their top line and profitability will also improve based on chlorovinyl.

Sugar is one part where they have taken a hit but going ahead at least in this season 60% of the sales has already been accounted for in mark to market. Any fall from the levels which you have seen earlier may be a negative but that is something which has already seen some bounce.

Because of these negative factors, the stock has already corrected to Rs 260-270 and that is available at 4-4.2 times EV-EBITDA. It has a very decent valuation and our target comes to close to 400-420 based on 6 times EV-EBITDA.


ICICI Bank has corporate governance issues. The board has directed an investigation. Would that be an overbearing worry for ICICI Bank?
If that was not the overbearing factor, then the stock would have already reacted on the positive. They seem to have cleaned the restructured assets and everything has been booked as NPA. But because that overbearing factor is there and everyone is expecting the worst will come because of the inquiry. There will be a lot of corporate governance issues but a bank like ICICI Bank is not a one person-driven bank. It is an institution. 

As uncertainty over the probe continues, that is getting priced into the stock movement. That is why you see a huge difference between the other private sector banks valuation and ICICI Bank valuation. But on pure operating fundamentals, if you see growth coming back and as most of the NPA mess have been cleaned and NPA resolution has started with Bhushan Steel, all that incremental will only improve the fundamentals of the bank. Based on pure fundamentals, over the next one to two years, I am positive on the valuation front as far as the bank is concerned."

28,2018-06-07,Asian Paints,"Vivek Mavani of Vivek Mavani Financial Services tells ET Now that though a lot of valuation froth got corrected in midcaps and smallcaps last month, the process is not over.Edited excerpts: 


What is happening in the markets?
What has got corrected in the last one month or so is the valuation froth. Although, the mid-cap and the small cap index had a stupendous rise over the last 18 months, a large number of stocks and some very prominent names which are very popular among the trading community and market participants, did not deliver on earnings through the last four to six quarters. 

Suddenly traders and investors realised that these stocks are trading at 40-6-50-60 times, some of them even close to 100 times earnings. Earnings growth of 10-12-15% does not really matter. Investors are buying or stocks which are trading at 50-60 times or 100 times earnings. A 10-15% growth even HUL, Asian Paints can give you. Most of the Nifty stocks will also give it to you barring the commodities which will probably have more volatile earnings. 

What has got corrected is the valuation froth in the last few weeks. In my view, it is an intermediate pause. If growth does not return, further valuation correction can take place. Some stocks listed in the last 12-18 months, even today trade at 45-50 times. When we look at the recent results, they have delivered earnings no more than 18-20% and trading at 50-60 times. There is still a long way to go as far as the valuation correction in some of these stocks are concerned.


Would you bet big on banks, financial institutions?
Private banks and NBFCs continue to deliver consistently on growth. We have not seen valuation froth there as yet because they trade at similar multiples that they used to trade two years ago, five years ago and even 10 years ago.

For example, HDFC Bank trades at 4-4.2 times price to book. That historically is the band. There really is no froth build up there or the same can be said for IndusInd Bank or a Kotak Bank. Kotak Bank perhaps has moved up slightly because the quality of growth in Kotak Bank is also better. 

Among the private banks, these three continue to deliver consistent and sustainable growth without any balance sheet issues or governance issues which seem to be plaguing the likes of ICICI and Axis and we keep hearing of murmurs about Yes Bank although nothing really has ever come out of it but last few years we have been hearing of that. 

In terms of PSU banks, one really is never sure whether the worst is really over because market and everybody is quite fatigued hearing from all the bank chairmen and MDs every quarter that the worst is over. We continue to have more skeletons tumbling out. 

As far as NBFCs are concerned, the housing finance space remains an attractive space but even general wide range NBFCs, the likes of Bajaj Finance and Cholamandalam are attractive. HDFC perhaps is the most attractive of the lot, trading at just about three times price to book and a series of value unlockings are planned over the next couple of years in terms of each of the different subsidiaries getting listed. NBFCs and private banks continue to be the preferred place."

36,2018-06-08,Asian Paints,"Smart investors, who spotted the trend early and shifted focus to largecaps in early 2018, have not only managed to protect their wealth in the recent carnage, but have made money too! Some have done it even in midcap and smallcap stocks, and how! 

Nifty Smallcap100 and Midcap100 indices are down up to 20 per cent this year, while the benchmark Nifty50 is still holding its head above water. 

A couple of largecaps drew investors’ attention this year, with IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surpassing the $100 billion market capitalisation in April, and stocks like HUL, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints scaling fresh all-time highs over the past one month. The Infosys stock is hovering around its highest level in two years. 

The theme is pretty clear: it’s a year for fundamentally strong businesses and those that have been trying to tap demand revival.

Most analysts are bullish on the largecaps despite the depression in the broader market in recent times. They are advising investors to add some stocks from this segment to protect their portfolios against volatility ahead of the general elections in 2019.

There are expectations that the largecaps may provide some cushion to investor portfolios as their valuations are lower compared with those of midcaps and smallcaps.

As many as 21 stocks from the Nifty pack were trading in the green so far this year, with Tech Mahindra up 37.50 per cent till June 6, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 31.58 per cent), Tata Consultancy Services (up 30.46 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 25.21 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 22.78 per cent), Infosys (up 19.73 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 18.23 per cent).

The 50-share index moved from 10,435 on January 1 this year to trade at 10,684 on June 6. 

Largecaps look attractive compared with midcaps and smallcaps at this point of time, Sankaran Naren, Executive Director, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, told ETNow in an interview.

Brokerage Sharekhan prefers HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS. HCL Tech has advanced over 3 per cent on a year-to-date basis. Managements of most IT companies have indicated that CY2018 would be better year compared with the previous one, thanks to some large deal wins, improving macro environment in key geographies, demand in certain industry pockets, emerging demand in digital, higher outsourcing demand from European clients and benefits of a weaker rupee.

Shares of HUL, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints and HDFC have gained between 10 per cent and 17 per cent in this period.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse has a ‘buy’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,750. Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target of Rs 2,251.

“Largecap valuations are far more reasonable than the second-rung stocks. Select largecap companies with rich valuations are also among the top picks right now when it comes to future growth visibility,” said Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director, Ladderup Wealth Management.

Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says the margin of safety is better in largecap names than in midcaps and smallcaps.

“There is certainty in terms of how the numbers will pan out,” he said.

More than 70 stocks from Nifty Midcap100 index gave negative returns to investors in 2018. Vakrangee, PC Jeweller, Adani Power and Suzlon Energy have plunged up to 93 per cent.

On the other hand, select midcap names like Mindtree, Indiabulls Ventures, Jubilant FoodWorks, Mphasis and Gruh Finance have risen up to 67 per cent in the same period. Gruh Finance hit an all-time high of Rs 381 on June 7.

There are takers for quality in any market. “I think it is time to buy into some of the quality companies in the midcap space, where the comfort level is on the higher side. Forget the index, this correction is a welcome opportunity for investors,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Smallcap stocks like Gitanjali Gems, Diamond Power, Bombay Rayon and Electrosteel Steels have slipped up to 91 per cent. 

There are specific pockets in the midcap and the smallcap segments, which are qualitative in nature, and earnings growth in this space can still be far better over the next two years, said Joshi of Angel Broking.

Coal India, YES Bank, L&T, Titan Company, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, ITC, Power Grid and Eicher Motors are other largecap stocks, which have been trading in the green so far in 2018.

On the other hand, shares of Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, HPCL, Vedanta, Bharti Infratel, BPCL, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Wipro are down up to 30 per cent between January 1 and June 6."

Avenue Supermarts last month posted 72.9 per cent year-on-year (yoy) growth in net profit at Rs 167 crore for the March quarter. The food and grocery retailer reported Rs 97 crore profit in the year-ago period. 

Total revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 3,810 crore, up 22.5 per cent. The company had clocked Rs 3,111 crore sales in the same period last year."
39,2018-06-11,Asian Paints,"Edelweiss Financial Services has buy call on Berger Paints (India) Ltd. with a target price of Rs 332.0 . The current market price of Berger Paints (India) Ltd. is Rs 285.55 Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Berger Paints (India) Ltd. price can reach the defined target. Berger Paints (India) Ltd., incorporated in 1923, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 27737.51 crore.


Investment rationale by Edelweiss
Berger Paints' (Berger) 16.7% YoY revenue growth came in line, whereas 24.2% YoY EBITDA surge surpassed our estimate. Domestic volume growth remained strong at ~13% YoY on a base of 10%, beating our ~8-9% estimate (Asian Paints reported decorative volume growth of ~11% YoY). 

Consolidated gross margin contracted 85bps YoY owing to spike in input cost, though price hikes (~1.5% in March 2018 and ~2.1% in May 2018) have brought some relief. We believe, Berger has gained some market share during the quarter considering its volume growth being higher than that of the industry. We envisage bounce back in decorative volumes and price hikes to aid overall revenue and earnings spurt. Hence, we raise our target multiple from 38x to 42x FY20E EPS and arrive at revised TP of INR332 (earlier INR293). Maintain ‘BUY’."
38,2018-06-11,Asian Paints,"JM Financial has hold call on Asian Paints Ltd. with a target price of Rs 1320.0 . The current market price of Asian Paints Ltd. is Rs 1277.4 Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Asian Paints Ltd. price can reach the defined target. Asian Paints Ltd., incorporated in 1945, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 122527.93 crore. 


Investment rationale by JM Financials
FY18 was no doubt a challenging year for Asian Paints - it had to contend with high input costs inflation and tax rates (unlike consumer staples, GST did not result in any saving for the Paints industry). On BS side, the company incurred huge capex on greenfield factories, and acquisitions. The combination of above resulted in a 620bps compression in ROIC (30.1% vs 36.2% in FY17) of which 290bps was on account of gestating assets. 

Interestingly, the efficiencies that Asian Paints consistently displayed in managing its overheads until FY12 returned to help constrict operating margin decline to mere 67bps in FY18 vs 220bps decline in gross margin. Net cash position was down INR8.3bn on account of the huge capex spends that will up capacity by >50% by end-FY19E, and cost of acquisition of Sri Lanka’s Causeway Paints. Operating CF generation growth has, however been strong (+38.4%) due to a negligible increase in working capital; FCFF, though, was down 18% due to capex spendsmentioned earlier. The company’s ability to sustain the recent recovery in volume growth to double-digit level would be key for the stock to sustain its premium valuation (51x NTM EPS) - we expect earnings to accelerate to c.20% CAGR over FY18-20E vs 11.7% over FY15-18."
45,2018-06-15,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Football fever is gripping the investment world as much as soccer fans, with the Fifa World Cup 2018 kicking off. 

Globally, brokerages are making projections for potential World Cup winners, just like they do them for stock prices and corporate earnings.

So involved is the financial world with this game of brawn that one analysis found as much one-third drop in equity trading volumes in select countries during this four-yearly extravaganza.

On Dalal Street, several renowned faces are either already in Russia or heading there to watch all the action live.

And then there are analysts and brokerages which are trying to draw simile between soccer and World Cup.

IIFL Institutional Equities has gone one step ahead to pick the equivalent of a World Cup soccer team from among the listed stocks, comprising the traditional strikers, defenders and goalkeeper.

The brokerage assigned the job of the coach to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Ayon Mukhopadhyay of IIFL Institutional Equities said he was tempted to put in four forwards or go the way of the 1970’s Dutch Total Football format for team formation.

However, he had to settle for a more orthodox approach. The stocks picked for the team do have a few substitutes, if conditions change, he said in a note.


Here are stocks the brokerage picked for its Dream Team:

3 Forwards:
Mukhopadhyay defined them as 
alpha generators; cyclical, high rewarding stocks with goal scoring appetite, momentum and energy. His picks are:-

Biocon: Having established its credentials in global leagues now with Mylan tieup, this sharpshooter is my centre forward. Expected to clear its ‘dope tests’ for its biosimilars approvals, revenues can grow 6 times in next four years. Mukhopadhyay says he would not be surprised if this ends up with the ‘Golden Boot’.


Yes Bank: The focus on scoring at all cost at times has led to RBI handing it the red card. But shedding the bad boy image by aligning its stressed asset recognition methods and extending the term to Rana Kapoor, Yes Bank is more focused. No matter what they do off the pitch, on ground action is what matters, and the stock is a winner on that count all the way. Still inexpensive, with strong earnings trajectory, Yes Bank will find the back of the net consistently.


Larsen & Toubro: The old war horse is getting fitter by realigning its business and shedding the non-core flab. Valuations at historical averages and with cyclical tailwinds and focus on core EPC business, this ambidextrous striker can get you off the mark very fast in an early uptick of the investment cycle and expand the lead in the more competitive late capex cycle.


Agencies

Midfield: They have ‘slightly attacking’ characteristics. They would still be high earners in a cyclical environment but could drop back and keep possession to allow consolidation when need to be less adventurous, Mukhopadhyay 
said.

HDFC Bank: The bellwether of the financial markets is the superstar. It is also the captain of team, who can effortlessly thrust forward with scale, organisational knowledge and cost competitiveness to drive growth and maintain profitability. As profitability is driven by both productivity and efficiency improvements, earnings growth will sustain and so will its tag as one of the most prized players. Its ADR avatar commands an even higher wage in the Major League in US.


Tata Motors: Another old hand, which is available at a decadal low valuation. But given the new launches of JLR and Indian business looking up (with CV improvement), things should turn around and it can be the attacking midfield option. Given the double dividend, I will play the DVR avatar.


Teamlease: A rookie, which has had a phenomenal run since its debut two seasons back on the bourses. But has it peaked too soon? Not really, it's well-positioned to mature to legendary status as it makes multi-year earnings growth underpinned by low penetration of temp staffing in India and market share gains from a vast unorganized sector.


Defence: These are the pillars of the team. Nothing can sneak past them. Be it on sunny days, or torrential storms, these will give you the comfort.


Hindustan Unilever: A consumer stock as defence is an old cliché, but this beast guarding the northern wall is India’s largest FMCG company. Hours on the training ground with manic focus on costs have led to this veteran ensuring an increase in operating margins for 7 seasons now. It has played the offside trap of GST to its advantage and long term drivers include market share gains with premiumisation opportunities.


Infosys: Having forayed across the pitch in various roles under countless mentors (with ugly exits) and been sidelined to the wilderness, the prodigal son of India IT returns with a rejuvenated but conformist mindset. With focus on scaling the digital business and use of AI/Automation to modernise the clients’ core and accelerating large deals and improving win rate, this refreshed new look augers well. Also tackling down the nemesis of rising USD-INR, a (still 20 per cent cheaper than TCS) new look Infy is the cornerstone of my defence.


Motherson Sumi: The three-pronged strength across its 3 lines with mid-to-high-teens earnings growth in standalone (led by volume and value) and SMR (led by market share gain, slight margin expansion) brings a steady head to the backline. High endurance training is also leading to significant Ebitda margin expansion for SMP/PKC and would result in multi-fold rise in earnings of these two subsidiaries.


Bajaj Finance: Earnings keep compounding for this stallion which is still shy of considering itself a big boy. Strong cross selling capabilities making core product an acquisition tool, long runway in underpenetrated market, strong management team, well managed execution and scalable businesses will keep overall growth higher than peers. A rock in the defence with clear visibility on earnings.


The goalkeeper: A safe no-frills option to do the job.


PowerGrid: Choosing from the PSU Club maybe unpopular, but given its regulated ROE model, and strong earnings visibility through FY21, PGCIL is safe as a house. A strong balance sheet and impeccable track record of clean sheets give it stability to stop any surprise attack of private competition. Also, its low risk model makes it best positioned to stop the penalties of global volatilities of liquidity crunch/portfolio reallocation. Very cheap (10x PE with 3% yield ) price gives it the gloves.


And finally the coach

PM Narendra Modi. A year back it seemed his position was sealed for a long term. But recent events at home have jolted his long term hopes a bit. Still loved by players, but popularity is dwindling. Need his team to fire to get back the confidence.

If you want a few more stock ideas, here are your substitutes:


Equitas: A forward with immense potential but seems to be less communicative on its role of MFI, SFB or NBFC. Also now shrugging off its provisioning injuries it should be well fit to ride the operating leverage to gain superior RoEs. A bit more faith shown by investors should see this kid take star status.


Ujjivan: Another kid to have graduated from the MFI academy but growing faster than Equitas. Very tempting option if you do not trust the old legs of L&T to score.

Asian Paints: Another expensive defender but worth its price tag with unmatched distribution network and leadership position. Proven ability to defend margins with price hikes makes it a first change if the formation needs to change to 5-3-2.


Zee: An attacking midfield option, which will benefit from sharp recovery in ad spending in India."

41,2018-06-15,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: Pune-based decorative paint maker Indigo Paints has signed cricketer and ChennaiSuper Kings’ captain MS Dhoni as the company’s first brand ambassador for the next three years.

Dhoni will feature in all the marketing and promotional campaigns of Indigo Paints, which has planned to spend over Rs 200 crore on advertising in three years. 

“We are a relatively young company, but are growing at a brisk 40-45% CAGR over the last 10 years. Now, we are looking at further strengthening our brand and Dhoni was the perfect choice,” Hemant Jalan, managing director at Indigo Paints, told ET.

Jalan said Indigo’s journey has been similar to that of Dhoni’s, who rose from a small town to touch cricketing heights. “We feel that his persona is an excellent fit for our brand,” Jalansaid. 

Dhoni said he is happy to be associated with a young and vibrant brand like Indigo Paints, which is challenging established players. “Reminds me of my early days, and would be glad to help the brand reach great heights,” he said.

Indigo Paints will launch an ad campaign across TV and other media, featuring Dhoni in early August. “We have been spending 8-9% of our annual sales on advertising. We plan to spend Rs 200-240 crore over the next three years on the same,” Jalan said.

Pegged at over Rs 40,000 crore, the decorative paint market is witnessing a healthy 12% CAGR growth. It is dominated by four big players - Asian Paints, which commands over 30% share, followed by Berger Paints, Kansai NerolacPaints, and Akzo Nobel (Dulux). Indigo Paints has 1-1.5% share of the pie.

“We are very small if you see overall market. But, in Kerala, we are the third largest paint company. We have entered Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat fairly recently,” Jalan added."
47,2018-06-18,Asian Paints,"The NSE benchmark Nifty ended with a minor loss of 17.85 points or 0.17 per cent at 10,799.85 after spending much of the Monday’s session is a capped and narrow range. 

With the session remaining extremely rangebound, key thing to note was Nifty’s struggle with the levels of 10,820-10,850, as it failed to move past this important pattern resistance.

As we step into Tuesday’s trade, we feel that some weakness might persist and Nifty may remain under modest pressure, but the downsides are likely to remain limited.

On the upper side, the struggle with the levels of 10,820-10,850 is likely to continue. The behaviour of the market vis-à-vis this zone is extremely important to watch out for in the coming days. Tuesday will continue to see the levels of 10,850 and 10,895 acting as important resistance area. Supports will come in at 10,765 and 10,710 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 57.7446. RSI continues to remain neutral, showing no divergence to the price. The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. A small black body occurred on the candles and in the present context it holds no significance.

The pattern analysis shows that Nifty continued to resist to the falling trend line resistance area of 10,820-10,850 zones. Breach on the upside of these levels is necessary for any meaningful upmove to occur. 

Overall, while Nifty continues to resist to the falling trend line that joined the high of 11,170 to the subsequent lower tops, it also continued to show some inherent strength by consolidating around the resistance area without showing any major declines.

The present amount of shorts in the system is likely to keep the overall downsides limited. However, in the same breath, unless the index moves past the 10,820-10,850 zone and sustain above that, it will remain vulnerable to pressure from higher levels and prolonged consolidation.

We recommend remaining modest on exposures, preserving cash and making select purchases with each available opportunity.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Long positions were being added in Idea, Equitas, SAIL, Adani Enterprises, Power Grid, BHEL, Bata India, Tata Motors, NBCC, Ujjivan, ICICI Bank, TVS Motors, Exide and Asian Paints.

46,2018-06-18,Asian Paints,"Time is a friend of good companies and a big enemy of bad companies, says Raamdeo Agrawal, Co-Founder, MOFSL. Agrawal tells ET Now that India produces the highest number of multibaggers in the world.Edited excerpts:

Yuu have culled this very interesting quote from Phil Fisher which says that it seems logical that even before thinking of buying any common stock, the first step is to see how money has been most successfully made in the past. Is it imperative that the stock has to have given 20-30% returns in the past?
The quote is much broader. What happens is that in every country, every market, a set of companies do well. It is not that in every country, every business does well. Take two-wheeler companies. In India, they are the bluest of blue chips. You have three-four of them and they are thriving and making money. There is no other country like that. In China, they may have bigger two-wheeler companies but even there, no two-wheeler company I making money. They make lot of two-wheelers but they do not make a lot of money. 

Even the way private sector banks are making money in India is seen in very few countries. They make money but not that much. So, you have to understand in which country which business is doing well. Once you grasp that, then you go to find the companies which are likely to do well because say we go from India to Japan. The companies in Japan are different from companies in India. I was there in Japan two-three months back, the businesses are very different. They are more electronic components, global market share.


They are way ahead…
I mean not ahead or anything like that…


In terms of technology…
Yes. Their whole focus is very different, competitive advantages are very different. Their competitive advantages are global in character because it is a very small country relatively but they have global ambitions. Most of the companies are globally competitive and so that is a very different dialogue when you go to the management room than what it was in India.


Let us drill it down to how you are looking at hunting for quality in this market. You are talking about indicators to classify a stock. At the very core, that is the problem that people have. There is such a big universe of stocks. What are the indicators that will drill it down to specific names that one would be interested in investing?
That is a process. Find out what is the current profitability? The Code Of Great, Good, Gruesome in 2007, page seven of Buffett letter is very illustrative of how to look at the companies. Companies or business will keep moving from one to other. 

There are three types of companies in every country, every market. If we look at only India, 4,000 companies are listed. There are three types of companies – great, good, gruesome. These are like three bank accounts. Buffett started investing in 1941. After 60 years, he realised that there are three types of businesses only. He explained in 2007, what is a great business and what is a good business? First, good business is something where cost of money, says 8-10% in India, earns about 19-20%. All the good banks like HDFC Bank and others earn about 19-20%. So on Rs 100 crore, they make Rs 20 crore profit every year.

You put in Rs 100 crore at the beginning of the year and the output you get is Rs 120. If you want to double the money, if you want to double the profit from 20 to 40, you have to put another Rs 100 crore. So, after three or four years, if you do not pay out dividends, all the money which you earned has to be redeployed to double the profit in three years’ time. 

So 20% return on equity. 20% you put in the bank, it will again earn 20% more and hence year after year, keep compounding and in three-and-a-half – four years it will double the profit. But at that point of time. your money deployed will be about Rs 200 and on that he will earn Rs 40. Again, your ratio remains the same 20%. That is a good business, this is what typical good capital intensive businesses like banks and all they keep doing. 

Now what is great? Great is what you start with say 20% first year, second year you do 25%, then 30%, then 40%, then 50%, 60%, 100% and then you do not need any capital to make money. It is like getting cane juice without putting in canes. There are very few of them like that.


In the Indian context…?
Yes Asian Paints, Nestle, Lever, IndiGo and so far unless they change the base model and all these global companies, FANG companies your Google, Microsoft, they all make money without putting any money.

So, that is a great company. 1% or 2% would be great companies. In India, if you have maybe 50-60 companies which are great companies, about 300 to 400 companies will be good companies. Then there is a long list of gruesome companies. 

It is important not to understand good and great. But what are the bad companies? Time is a friend of good companies and a big enemy of bad companies. This is a difference between gold or real estate and stocks. It is very necessary that if you want to become rich through the stock market, in the long run, you have to buy good companies.


You are looking at such a polarised market. Only 15-20 stocks are looking good….
Do not jump, let us finish this gruesome because that is the most important part. I read 45 times before I understood these gruesome companies are the companies which not only earn less than cost of capital, say 10% is cost of capital, for some reason you are earning 4-5% or you are actually making losses. Losses are no problem because you realise that this is a danger zone but if you are making 5% return on capital, on Rs 100, you are making Rs 5. If you want to double the profit from Rs 5 to Rs 10, and you have put in Rs 100. it will take like 15-20 years to make Rs 100. 

So, you go and borrow that money from the banks and put in that use as business. Eventually if there is any tough time and typically these is low return companies always face bad times. It becomes a process of capital destruction all the way for the banks, for the entrepreneurs and of course the person who has invested year after year. Nothing goes go zero straight away. They will go from 20% to 10%, 10% to 5% and then negative.


How easy is it to identify gruesome companies?
Very easy.


In hindsight everybody knows a JP Infra went bust, RCom went bust but at that time, was it easy to identify ? Or would think two years ago that ICICI Bank which is a great retail entity, will face such issues?
Yes, actually it is very easy. You look at the 10 years return ratios. The EBITDA margin, PAT margin, asset turnover and then finally they give you ROC and ROE. Whenever you look at the company, first you go to that ratio screen. At least, I do that. You ask me some new company anywhere in the world I will go to that ratio. It is like a janam patri (horoscope) of any company. 

It will tell you how it has been doing, its profitability, capital efficiency. You have to use the ratios in combination, it is like artwork in the sense that it shows what ratio is to be seen in a particular company. It will show if the company is temporarily profitable with a lot of compromises in the terms of trade. 


Can I use an example here, Dish TV?
I do not remember. It was not a great company till say a year back. I do not know what is the situation today. Have they actually turned around?

They did but then they are again making losses. Now, of course Mr Jhunjhunwala is buying into it. So, return on equity and return on capital employed are very important ratios and you have to look at them in conjunction with the overall profitability of the business but is there something that helps?


Past and future are two different things. Past had been patchy but you know that. What is lying in future? There could be a change of the competitive structure, say like say telecom. Till 2003, telecom was in gutter in the sense that nobody was making money.
Suddenly the regulation changes and Bharti was available at 25 bucks, in three years time it went to Rs 1200 and it became one of the most fantastic businesses ever. Then we saw the emergence of 16-17 licenses and the whole competitive structure got destroyed and now from that 16, it has come down to three. Now the repairing of competitive structure is done.

Yet the competitive structure is very intense among these three so it will take some more time but right now it is a bad business. All of the three companies are not making money but it is creating a potential for a huge upside at some point of time. Someday return will come but when, only time will tell.


Once you have identified the good, the great and the ugly, what about pricing because in this kind of a market scenario. the good and the great is coming at a very high price. It is only the rubbish which is available cheap?
Not all, not all.


But largely how important is pricing according to you?
 It is very important. There is no investing unless you buy at reasonable price. Margin of safety has to be there, maybe at times it is 50%, at times it is 33%, at times it is 80-90%. There are companies which have 70-80% kind of margin of safety in mind. 

Margin of safety is in the mind of investor. You may disagree, I may agree so that is where you will sell and I will buy. In our QGLP formula, one is the quality of business. Once quality of business is done, you have to go one by one. If quality of business is not good, you have no business to look at the other four buckets of quality of management, growth, longevity of growth and price. All have to be clear but I can do it simultaneously. But the process is; look at the quality of business, if quality of business is good, look at quality of management, which is most dicey in India. Every company is a piece of art. If that guy in charge does not want to make a nice, clean company in the future, you will not get a nice clean company in the future. Sitting as a minority shareholder what can you do?


I want to put in examples over here. How do you look at the ICIC Bank story? It is a great management…
You are putting an example and you are asking me a direct question.


Do not tell me what you think about the business but since you brought up managements, the lack of trust the business has right now is only because it is going through a leadership transition. Axis Bank has also faced that, PSU banks have faced that. How would you classify these businesses?
Yes. I am reading a book by Taleb, Skin In The Game. It’s a book worth reading, particularly in this context of Indian banking. Mr Kotak gave an interview recently. It was a wonderful interview and there he talked about Skin In The Game of the bankers.

When you are giving Rs 5,000 crore, Rs 10,000 crore, do you really feel that you are giving Rs 10,000 crore to somebody? How much pain do you feel about giving and how much due diligence will you do, apart from the process? Do you feel that money you are giving? When you have skin in the game, you will feel that. 

How do you bring skin in the game in Indian banking? The other side, the borrower has skin in the game. Unlike European and American corporations which are also run by boards and the lenders are also board driven. So, both sides are tie-walas. But in India, the borrowers are entrepreneurs and the lenders are tie-walas. 

One set of bankers have skin in the game and the other set of the bankers do not have skin in the game. How do you bring a level playing field wherein the risk assessment or risk measurement is taken with proper care? Lending is a very simple business at one level and yet very complicated, if you do not price the risk well. 

If you price the risk well and lend to some crook at 30-40%, you will make tons of money. 


Let us talk about the possibility of a gruesome company becoming good and then a good company becoming great. You know which company has actually done that journey and has come on tops. 
We see a lot of these turnarounds. There are tonnes of it. If you keep doing this thing, a company like say Bajaj Finance 8-10 years ago, was a very ordinary non-descript NBFC trying to do financing for two-wheelers as a sister concern. And then everything changed. The new management team came Rajiv Jain and the first two- three years, people like us who were watching from outside, did not realise what is happening and it was already 10x.

 Then at some point, we realised that these guys are winning and they are doing some very extraordinary things. In the same space, they have found a completely new strategy and new target and new way of doing things using computers, AI and all sorts of big data in a much more effective way to give loans in few seconds or few minutes to the customers.

They appointed a completely new segment on the customer loans. It gave a completely new life to that company and you see what has happened to the company. From less than a Rs 1,000-crore market cap to more than Rs 1 lakh crore market cap! It is a 100x in just about five-seven years. 

It is one of the most wonderful stories. In fact, other banks, NBFCs are trying to do a Bajaj Finance in their own banks or wherever. There is admiration for this company. From a completely gruesome or non-descript business or company, it has become one of the awesome examples for the entire finance sector.


Calling Bajaj Finance gruesome would not be really right. It was just another indifferent company. Any gruesome company where you feel the story could turnaround with change of management?
No, how do I know? I would not know.


Nothing on your radar.
No, we would not know. We look back and then we see some signs of it. One of the signs is that whenever a company turns around, the quarterly results will show 70-80% growth, top line 15% growth and then80% profit growth in first quarter, then in second quarter, then third quarter, then yearly. First year, from Rs 50 crore, it goes to Rs 100 crore. You realise something is happening. Then second year again, from Rs 100 crore to Rs 300 crore. Wow! These guys are now rocketing. You know by that time markets do not bother about it. Some insiders, close guys would buy it. The smart guys from Pune or Hyderabad or people close to it. Market caps will be Rs 1000 crore, Rs 2000 crore, Rs 3000 crore and still nobody in the institutional set up will look in.


They will be scared that is the point, they would be like okay there is something…
Something is happening but firstly they should come in radar. Right now the condition of the market is most of these rockets are already taken care of. The close guys the midcap, smallcap, PMS guys and the value pickers have picked up most of them. Five-six years back, that was the fun. You run a screener and you will find one or two ideas and then do masti. That fun is lost right now.


So I can think of two examples where the management really helped in this transition from gruesome to good to great. Maybe not even gruesome but just good to great. Eicher Motors and IndusInd Bank. Again Mr Sobti and Mr Lal are examples of good management changing the business.
So one of the ways a very ordinary or written off or non-descript business becomes great businesses or great companies is when the great managements or right time comes for the management. IndusInd Bank is a absolute classic case. Stock price was Rs 18-20. It is now 100 times or 150 times more.


It is an index company now.
Yes, index company and it is one of the foremost though it was one of the oldest private sector licensee but had not made much headway. Today it is one of the most aspirational private sector banks. In India, there are lots of these stories. That is why India produces the highest number of multibaggers. The number of multibaggers that are produced in India is not found in other parts of the world."
49,2018-06-20,Asian Paints,"PUNE: Startups in the industrial internet of things (IIoT) space, who so far have been focused on serving clients abroad, are now training their sights on the domestic market.

Integration Wizards, a four-year old company, is in the process of carrying out pilot projects for Asian Paints and Voltas to automate their new factories. “IIoT is just starting out in India,” said Kunal Kislay, CEO at Integration Wizards. “There was not a lot of demand up until now, but it’s beginning to gain traction. There is an acute deficiency of local players to automate local manufacturing.” While the larger IT firms are more focused on the mature Western markets, where budgets are also larger, Indian startups are starting to sense the domestic opportunity. The high profile M&A activity over the last few months — Hero Electrix acquiring Zenatix and Hitachi investing in Flutura — has also led to a spike in interest from domestic manufacturers.

In India, IIoT is pegged to be a fifth, or about $1 billion of the total IoT market. As per the Zinnov Nasscom 2017 India Startup Landscape Report, there are over 700 active advanced tech startups in India, of which 30% are IoT startups.


THE ECONOMIC TIMES Flutura Decision Sciences & Analytics, a big data analytics firm that focuses on engineering services, has been working in this space since 2012.

“We started with the overseas market as not many geographies have the early adopter mindset,” said Derick Jose, cofounder of Flutura.

“In India, we see interest in upstream sectors, oil and gas, solar and hydro. India is less than 10% of our revenue, but will go to 20% over two years.” The company is working on a few connected factory projects in India currently.

One key challenge these startups face when dealing with Indian clients is the mindset. “India is lagging behind when it comes to putting in money into IIoT. Given the costs involved, we cannot do free pilots, which is what a lot of companies want. It is a costconscious market and this reduces the speed of adoption and maturity,” said Tarun Mishra, cofounder, Covacsis Technologies.

While a Western client may be open to investing in a project even with 70% clarity on the benefits, a typical Indian one will want 100% clarity on the return on investment. Providing that level of tangible evidence isn’t always possible.

Another challenge is more practical — data collection is difficult with the old machines that many firms still use."
48,2018-06-20,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: India’s largest insurance company, the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), has been continuously investing in consumption stocks, anticipating buoyancy in both urban and rural spends on items such as cookies, soaps, packaged foods, and homecare products.

Accordingly, LIC has raised its stake in prominent consumption companies such as Gillette India, Asian Paints, Britannia Industries, and P&G Hygiene, and proxy consumption companies such as Castrol India and Indraprastha Gas by 0.8-2.2 per cent in the March 2018 quarter on a sequential basis, show the data released by Kotak Institutional Equities.

On the other hand, the insurer sold 1.7-4.1 per cent stake in the publicsector banks such as Bank of India, Union Bank, Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank in the March 2018 quarter.



LIC holds on an average 21.7 per cent in the consumer companies of the BSE 200, the second highest holding among all sectors after media. The most significant holding of the LIC in consumer space is ITC, where it holds 16.2 per cent, accounting for about 9.2 per cent of its total AUM.

By the weighting of the consumer sector in the BSE 200 companies, LIC is overweight by 3.6 per cent. Of 15 industries of the BSE, the country’s top insurer has an overweight position in only five sectors.

For many consumer companies selling soaps, toothpaste and other personal-care items, India’s traditionally under-served villages are becoming increasingly more exciting for the growth opportunities they offer.

The leading FMCG companies have indicated that their rural sales have been recovering at a brisk pace, while the same-store-growth at quick-service restaurants shows that urban consumption has been quite encouraging."
50,2018-06-21,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The government said enforcement agencies were looking into the latest set of Panama Papers released on Thursday, many of which were linked to Indians. According to reports, some 1.2 million documents were released in the new revelation, out of which about 12,000 were related to Indians.

“The fresh release made in the media today under ‘Panama Paper Leaks’ is being promptly looked into by the law enforcement agencies under the aegis of the multi-agency group already constituted for facilitating coordinated and speedy investigation,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes said in a statement.

The multi-agency group was formed in 2016 when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) released the first batch of 11.5 million documents under the so-called Panama Paper leak.

The department said under the standard operating procedure in these cases, it would reconcile the information filed by the individuals in their tax returns, particularly in the foreign assets schedules, with the disclosure made in the latest documents.

“Subsequently, investigations in appropriate cases would be carried out to bring them to a logical conclusion,” it said.

The new set of documents highlights details of offshore companies allegedly incorporated by several Indian businessmen, who did not figure in the 2016 leak of documents purportedly from the database of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

The new names include Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR Cinemas, and members of his family; Kavin Bharti Mittal, chief executive of Hike Messenger and son of Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal; and Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani.

The CBDT said it had constituted the multi-agency group on the same day the ICIJ released the Panama Papers in 2016.

The group, headed by the board’s chairman, comprises representatives of the Income Tax Department, the Enforcement Directorate, Financial Intelligence Union and the Reserve Bank of India.

The finance ministry said the group had investigated 426 cases from India and found that 353 of those were non-actionable.

Among the rest, invasive action such as searches and surveys was taken in 62 cases, leading to the detection of aboutRs 1,140 crore in undisclosed foreign investment, it said.

“The investigations conducted in Panama Paper cases reflect the government’s continued focus in dealing with black money stashed abroad,” the ministry said.

“The promptness in action is more than evident as most of the actionable cases have been effectively addressed. Though the investigating agencies faced problems of incomplete data and absence of financial information as well as not very prompt cooperation from other countries, the overall outcome has been very satisfactory,” it said."
51,2018-06-24,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints is embarking on its largest capacity expansion this fiscal year, investing Rs 4,000 crore at its Visakhapatnam and Mysuru facilities to add 1.1 million kilo litre to its present output. 

The city-headquartered company is setting up plant with a 5 lakh KL per annum capacity at Visakhapatnam at an investment of Rs 1,785 crore and a 6 lakh KL plant at Mysuru pumping in Rs 2,300 crore. 

""We are in the midst of our largest capacity expansion. In the first phase, two mega plants with initial capacities of 3,00,000 KL per annum each of water-based paints would be commissioned at Mysuru and Visakhapatnam in FY19,"" Asian Paints managing director & chief executive KBS Anand said in the annual report. 

Asain Paints, which is the domestic market leader, operates in 16 countries and have 25 manufacturing facilities globally, catering to consumers in over 60 countries. 

Its industrial coatings business was badly affected in the second half of FY18 due to GST as well rising input costs. But launch of industrial tinting machines in the dealer networks, and the success of its direct-to metal coatings, it could not only retain market share but in fact increase it in the second half of FY18, Anand said. 

In the automotive paints segment, the company added Ford and Hyundai during the year. It could also gain market in share in the twowheeler space. 

However, Anand said international business did not perform well. While a weak economy and a highly deflated currency hit its Egyptian operations, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka also did not do well. But higher sales in Nepal, Oman and Bahrain could contain some the impact of the poor show by the above markets. 

He said the greenfield operations in Indonesia as well as acquisition of Causeway Paints in Sri Lanka have increased its global revenue. 

Having completely existed the low growth Caribbean markets, Asian Paints is now focusing on expanding its portfolio into the emerging markets of Asia and Africa, chairman Ashwin Choksi said. 

He further said the uncertainty is likely to continue in the current financial year as well, citing the general elections and a slew of assembly polls. 

""While the economy gradually absorbs the impact of GST, impending elections across many states and the general elections will add to the instability, Choksi said."

Trade Tensions Mount, Markets Skid

The recent imposition of import tariffs by the US, and counter-measures by other countries, are starting to affect global production and supply chains. Global stocks extended a sell-off on Tuesday as trade tensions mounted between the United States and other major economies.

However, Indian shares, especially the largecaps, showed some resilience during the afternoon session as European shares showed a slight uptick, despite the worries around an escalating trade war.

“The escalating global trade tensions between the US and other major economies could keep the Indian markets choppy and volatile in the coming sessions. The progress in monsoon and movement of crude oil prices and the rupee will also be closely monitored by the market participants. Investors’ focus should remain on quality stocks with strong financials and bright prospects. However, traders should remain cautious and strictly hedge their positions,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.

The BSE Sensex finished Tuesday's trade slightly up by 20 points, or 0.06 per cent, at 35,490, with 19 stocks in the green and 12 in the red.

On the contrary, Tata Motors, Reliance Industries, Power Grid Corporation and Tata Steel stood as the top losers in the Sensex kitty.

Shares of Tata Motors declined over 4 per cent after analysts raised concern over JLR's weak volume outlook.

ICICI Bank shares extended their losses to the second consecutive session on Tuesday. 

A PTI report on Monday said that a preliminary examination by Sebi has favoured adjudication proceedings against the bank and its CEO Chanda Kochhar for alleged violation of listing disclosure norms regarding 'conflict of interest' in business dealings of her husband with Videocon group. 

Shares of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare closed nearly 3 per cent up on BSE on reports that Coca-Cola is set to buy GlaxoSmithKline's consumer nutrition business.

61,2018-06-27,Asian Paints,"India Inc’s earnings recovery has remained elusive in last five years, due to varied challenges such as rising raw material costs, higher slippages, GST rollout and the war on bad loans.

However, as many as 25 companies from the BSE500 pack defied this broader market trend and reported higher profits and sales growth year after year for five years till FY2017-18.

Today, most brokerages are bullish on them.

Shrimp feed manufacturer and exporter Avanti Feeds tops the list. Look at its profit growth profile: Rs 446.50 crore profit in FY18, Rs 215.70 crore in FY17, Rs 157.50 crore in FY16, Rs 115.90 crore in FY15, Rs 70.40 crore in FY14 and Rs 30.10 crore in FY13.

The top line, too, have been rising in a similar fashion.

No wonder then, the stock has rallied 5,508 per cent from Rs 9.30 on June 25, 2013 to Rs 521.60 on the same date this year.

ICICI Securities is bullish on Avanti. India’s shrimp exports are projected to grow in mid-teens in value terms and that would make Avanti the biggest beneficiary.

With 35 per cent return on equity (RoE) and 66 per cent average PAT growth over FY13-18, Avanti’s earnings growth trajectory is expected to remain on a steep gradient though lower margins may cause a dip in FY19E, ICICI Securities said.

The brokerage recently initiated coverage on Avanti Feeds with a ‘buy’ rating.

Four other companies that have put up similar performances are Meghmani Organics, KNR Construction, Aarti Industries and KPR Mill; whose shares have surged over 1,000 per cent in last five years, as both bottom lines as well as top lines strengthened.

Brokerage Anand Rathi is positive on Aarti Industries (AIL) with a target price of Rs 1,489. The company manufactures specialty chemicals and pharma products and has a global footprint. The brokerage projects the firm to post Rs 410.80 crore profit for FY19 and Rs 554.50 crore for FY20.

Roads builder KNR Construction multiplied profit by five times in last five years even as sales increased over 2.5 times. Antique Stock Broking has projected the company’s net profit for FY19 at Rs 207.70 crore and for FY20 at Rs 216 crore against Rs 243.50 crore net posted for FY18. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 338.

Bluechip firms Infosys, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank also reported growth in net profit as well as net sales for the fifth straight year in a row in FY18. Shares of these companies have rallied between 100 per cent and 500 per cent in last five years.

Motilal Oswal has ‘buy’ ratings on HDFC, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Infosys, Maruti Suzuki and LIC Housing Finance.

Shares of CCL Products, Edelweiss Financial Services, Natco Pharma, Britannia Industries, Cholamandalam Investment, Aurobindo Pharma and Solar Industries have risen over 500 per cent between June, 2013 and June, 2018.

Edelweiss Financial Services’ profit climbed to Rs 890.10 in FY18 from Rs 178.50 in FY13, while sales grew to Rs 8,405.10 crore from Rs 2,144.40 crore.

Britannia’s profit increased to over Rs 1,000 crore in FY18 from Rs 259 crore in FY13. The FMCG firm is in a sweet spot given its leadership position in the largest segment of processed foods, which has a market of around Rs 30,000 crore.

A strong pipeline of premium products priced low at Rs 10, Rs 15 and Rs 20 is projected to increase sales and improve product mix of the FMCG major. Prabhudas Lilladher is positive on Britannia with a target price of Rs 6,170.

Motherson Sumi, JM Financial, Pidilite Industries and YES Bank have also seen profit grow year after year for the fifth straight year, even as share prices soared 250-400 per cent in last five years.

Other names on the list included PC Jeweller, Asian Paints, Sun TV and LIC Housing Finance, whose shares have rallied up to 200 per cent in the same period. Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘hold’ rating on Sun TV with a target price of Rs 947."
60,2018-06-27,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: The mouse that had quietly entered the Mumbai bull-ring more than two decades ago has taken about a quarter of a century to put the paper scrip finally out of business.

About 2.3 per cent of India’s $2-trillionplus market capitalisation is still held in the form of physical stock even more than two decades after Mumbai exchanges went online. Holders of these shares in listed companies now face a December deadline to convert them into dematerialised form if they have to transfer or sell them.

The Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR), which the market regulator tweaked earlier this month, have made the conversion mandatory for all classes of investors. Many investors, especially senior citizens, still hold shares in physical form.

On June 8, Sebi notified the amended LODR regulations saying that except in the case of transmission or transposition of securities, requests for the transfer of stock shall not be processed unless the securities are held in the dematerialised form with a depository.



“Promoters were barred earlier from selling or transferring shares in physical form. Now, the new regulations become applicable to all other investors,” said Arindham Chanda, head of broking at IIFL. “This means all off-market trades in physical mode in respect of shares of listed entities shall be prohibited and shall be required to be done compulsorily in the Demat mode”.

Long-term retail investors and some institutional investors hold a sizeable part of their stakes in physical form even seven years after Sebi ordered 100 per cent dematerialisation of the shareholdings. Retail investors own stocks worth Rs 1.24 lakh crore in physical form, while mutual funds hold Rs 45,760 crore worth of paper stock.

For instance, 31 per cent of ITC shares worth Rs 1 lakh crore are still in physical form. Similarly, Reliance Industries’ shares worth Rs 9,600 crore are not yet dematerialised. Companies such as MRF, Sun Pharma, JSW Energy, and HUL have shares worth Rs 7,000-8,000 crore each in paper form.

Most of these shares have been purchased decades ago before the Depository Act was passed and since the investors intended to hold them long-term, they did not see any reason to pay for a demat account.

“To keep a check on the instances of fraudulent transfers and for ensuring more transparency, this amendment has been brought into force,” said Vikas Jain, co-founder of Share Samadhan. “Investors holding physical shares sometime lose track of the corporate action such as bonus/dividend due to change in their address and those corporate actions remained unclaimed”.

In 2016, several listed companies, such as TCS, Aptech, Britannia Industries and Asian Paints, filed a complaint against share transfer agent Sharepro for diversion of unclaimed dividends and shares of investors.

In June 2011, the market regulator had mandated promoters of listed companies to convert their entire equity holding in dematerialised form by September 2011. Sebi had then said that failure to comply with compulsory dematerialisation of the promoter holding would invite punitive action.

National Securities Depository and Central Depository Services are the two main depositories that hold securities of investors in electronic form through their registered depository participants."

By 11:35 am, overall 10 stocks had hit 52-week highs on NSE. However, over 110 stocks had touched 52-week lows by that time. 

Market sentiment remained negative in the absence of any positive trigger amid sustained capital outflows.

Global cues are uninspiring. Trade conflict between the US and other economies of the world continues to be a key concern for investors.

0,2018-07-02,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: If the historical correlation between the Rupee and the Nifty were any guide of future trends, pressure would mount on the Nifty in the near-term. The 90-day rolling correlation between the Rupee (against the US dollar) and the Nifty currently stood at a negative 0.34, compared with the 10-year average of negative 0.47, according to Bloomberg data compiled by ETIG.

The rupee has depreciated 6.7 per cent since the beginning of the year, becoming the worst performing currency in Asia in the process. But the Nifty rose 1.7 per cent in the same period, standing out among the emerging markets that have been hit by the dollar gains.

A positive correlation means the two securities move in the same direction with one being the highest level of relationship — both go up or down together at the same rate — and a negative correlation means both move in the opposite direction with minus one being highest level of negative correlation — both move in the opposite direction at the same rate.



The current reading of the correlation is nearly one standard deviation away from the mean. According to the mean reversion theory, the variable eventually moves back towards the mean or average and the probability of mean reversion is higher if the variable is farther away from mean or, in statistical terminology, when standard deviation is higher. Therefore, in case of mean reversion, it could put more pressure on the Nifty performance.

The Indian rupee hit its weakest level ever of 69.09 per dollar last Thursday. Economists are predicting more pain in the coming days, with Barclays forecasting the rupee at 72 to a dollar, and DBS sees it at 71 by next June.

In the past seven years, whenever rupee depreciated more than 5 per cent, the Nifty return has been in the range of negative 4-14 per cent. For instance, when in rupee depreciated between April 2015 and February 2016 by 7 per cent to reach a low of 68.71, the Nifty dropped 14 per cent in the same period.

Investors who closely keep an eye on correlation to hedge their portfolio would be increasing their weightage to the IT and defensive stocks such as Kotak Mahindra, HDFC Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra and Asian Paints.

IT and select defensive stocks have typically outperformed the Nifty during the period of Rupee depreciation."

17,2018-07-06,Asian Paints,"If you trust return on capital employed (RoCE) as a good filter to spot growth stocks, you have 20 of them staring in your face. Read on.

History can help understand the present and predict the future. Simply put, it can guide you build a portfolio that can deliver multibagger returns over time. 

It takes time to build good businesses. And it requires company managements to set realistic goals while investors need to have the ability to spot such a business early to be able to capture that growth. 

Home appliance major TTK Prestige created humungous wealth for investors as well as for itself in last 10 years. The company has maintained a return on capital employed (RoCE) of over 15 per cent all this while; the stock has surged over 5,200 per cent to Rs 5,823 on July 3, 2018 from Rs 108.50 on the same day in 2008 and market capitalisation has grown from just Rs 123 crore to over Rs 6,500 crore.

There are 19 other such companies which have a similar stellar record, if not better. On an average, these stocks have delivered 1,000 per cent return since July 2008.

HDFC Bank is one, and even the average investor has been able to notice that. Others include Balkrishna Industries, Kansai Nerolac, Bajaj Auto, Tata Elxsi, Asian Paints, Dabur India, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Rallis India.

One common denominator about them is steady growth RoCE at over 15 per cent through past 10 years. Shares of these companies have rallied between 650 per cent and 2,400 per cent in this period.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a financial ratio that measures a company’s profitability and the efficiency with which it uses capital.

Independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga told ETMarkets.com that the RoCE filter is good for stock selection as long as the cost of borrowing or leverage is low.

TTK Prestige is still gung-ho about the opportunity in hand. “The appliances segment constitutes about 40 per cent of our revenue currently and we expect it to reach 50 per cent in next three years,” says TT Jagannathan, Chairman, TTK Prestige.

TCS recently became India’s second $100 billion company after RIL had achieved this feat in 2007. 

Balkrishna Industries continues to be in the good books of brokerages. Kotak Institutional Equities has just upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ (from ‘add’) and believes its valuations are looking attractive after the stock corrected from its high point recently.

The brokerage expects the company to deliver 24 per cent EPS growth CAGR over FY2018-21E and has set a target price of Rs 1,260. The stock traded at Rs 1,151 on Thursday.

Other stocks that fulfil the criteria of a minimum of 15 per cent RoCE year after year for last 10 years and over Rs 100 crore market capitalisation as of July 2008 include Empire Industries, Zee Entertainment, Colgate-Palmolive, Lakshmi Machine Works, Hero MotoCorp, ITC, KEC International, Wendt (India), Infosys and Wipro.

Shares of these companies have rallied between 100 per cent and 550 per cent during this period. 

“A company is considered good if it maintains robust RoCE year after year. It means the company is able to extract better returns than the opportunity cost of funds. It becomes a good option for stock selection. But a decision to invest in such a company should also depend on valuation comfort,” says G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Adivsory.

JM Financial is positive on ITC with a target price of Rs 335, while IIFL prefers Zee Entertainment with a target price of Rs 691.

“We prefer Zee Entertainment Enterprises owing to launch of ZEE5 (OTT platform) with strong content inventory (1,00,000+ hours) and portfolio of channels,” the brokerage said.

Brokerage firm Nirmal Bang recently upgraded Wipro to ‘buy’ (from ‘accumulate’) with a target price of Rs 335."

16,2018-07-06,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: A lower base in the previous year’s quarter and likely good show by select companies in sectors such as automobiles, capital goods, FMCG, IT, and metals should help the Nifty 50 companies report a double-digit growth in aggregate sales and profits for the June 2018 quarter. According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, net sales is likely to increase by 12.1 per cent and net profit by 13.5 per cent year-on-year. Sales and profit will grow in double- digits for the fifth and third consecutive quarters, respectively.

The corporate performance in the June 2018 quarter will get a leg up given relatively muted performance in the year-ago quarter. This was because of lower inventories of companies in the June 2017 quarter ahead of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1, 2017. Subsequently, net profit of the sample grew marginally by 1.8 per cent during the year-ago quarter on sales growth of 10 per cent while the operating profit fell by 1.3 per cent.

Operating profit for the June 2018 quarter is likely to grow by 15 per cent, the highest growth in at least nine quarters. In addition, the operating margin is expected to improve by 180 basis points year-onyear to 20.2 per cent.

For investors, the quarter will be crucial in deciding whether an overall turnaround will be in sight amid headwinds of strong crude oil prices, a weakening rupee, rising inflation and hardening interest rates.




SECTOR TRENDS

AUTOMOBILESAuto companies are expected to report good numbers following sustained volume growth across the vehicle segments thanks to improving consumer sentiments, replacement demand and price increase. Auto volumes grew 13-60 per cent during the June quarter. A better operating leverage is likely to support operating margins of Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki and domestic operations of Tata Motors.


BANKING AND FINANCEPrivate sector banks with relatively higher focus on corporate lending, including Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, are expected to report lesser amount of new non-performing assets considering their higher slippages in the previous quarter. This combined with rising retail book may help them to post a resilient performance.


CAPITAL GOODSThe continued support from the government-funded projects is likely to support the earnings growth of capital goods companies. The trend in Larsen & Toubro’s order flow will be watched closely since the country’s largest infrastructure company has earlier guided for 12-15 per cent growth in order flow on a higher base. PowerGrid is expected to maintain the ratio of project commission-to-capital expenditure above one.


CEMENTCement prices were largely stable during the June quarter, which means companies may not be able to clock meaningful growth in realisations. Volume growth will be between 5 per cent and 18 per cent for large companies. Companies are expected to record 4-21 per cent year-on-year revenue growth.


FMCGFor FMCG, numbers may not be strictly comparable due to destocking before the GST implementation in the previous June quarter. However, the positive trend shown by FMCG companies in the previous two quarters is likely to continue. Nifty companies HUL and Asian Paints are expected to deliver highteen sales growth, albeit on a low base, while ITC may report modest numbers as the year-on-year decline in cigarette volumes continues.


IT
Select top IT companies including TCS, Infosys, and HCL Tech are likely to report 2-3 per cent growth in the dollar denominated revenue keeping the currency rates constant to the previous quarter’s levels. The impact of unfavourable cross-currency rates between the euro, the pound, and the dollar may be partially offset by 4 per cent sequential drop in the average rupee rate against the dollar. The trend in digital revenue will be critical.


METALSFerrous metal companies are likely to do better than non-ferrous counterparts unlike the previous few quarters, thanks to record high global steel spreads (excluding Europe). Non-ferrous companies will face the headwinds on the cost front, particularly coal, crude derivatives and alumina. Coal India is expected to do well with 15 per cent volume growth in the first three months of FY19.


PHARMAPharma companies are likely to report strong double-digit growth for their Indian businesses, due to low base of the previous June quarter. The US business for pharma companies is likely to remain flattish to marginally positive due to lack of any meaningful launches. However, the Indian players will benefit from the rupee depreciation and see a double- digit operating profit growth in the US business.


TELECOMTelecom companies are expected to report pressure on average revenue per user for voice and data segments. This may limit the scope for higher topline growth despite rising data usage."

Healthy buying in metal, auto, pharma, oil & gas and bank stocks amid positive global cues in the light of a strong US jobs data and hints from Bank of Japan that it will maintain its ultra-easy money policy, helped Sensex and Nifty extend their gains to the second straight session on Monday.

35,2018-07-09,Asian Paints,"The equity market had a buoyant start to the week, as NSE benchmark Nifty ended the day with a gain of 80.25 points or 0.74 per cent. Monday’s session remained technically important, as the Nifty officially reversed the negative breakdown that it suffered a couple of days back from a large symmetrical triangle formation. 

Further to this, with the Monday’s upmove, the index has further attempted to move past the falling trend line pattern resistance.

As we approach Tuesday’s session, there is a high probability that Nifty will see an upward breakout from the pattern resistance. A modestly positive start to the session is expected, and even if market consolidates at higher levels, it will do so with a positive bias.

The levels of 10,875 and 10,930 will play out as immediate resistance levels for Tuesday. Supports may come in at 10,810 and 10,760 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 58.5325. It does not show any divergence against the price, but it has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish.



Daily MACD has also shown a positive crossover. It is now bullish, as it trades above its signal line.

If we look at the pattern analysis, it suggests that the Nifty has finally attempted to move past the falling trend line pattern resistance. This falling trend line started from the high of 11,170 and joined the subsequent lower tops. If the market manages to hold itself up above the 10,850 mark, we will see higher chances of this culminating into a breakout with the Nifty inching higher.

Overall, Monday’s upmove was much in line with what was expected. Some technical indicators remain slightly overstretched, which might make the market consolidate at higher levels. Still, the underlying current remains bullish.

The Bollinger bands remain nearly 48 per cent narrower-than-normal. This further increases the chances of volatility increasing with sharp moves in prices over the coming days.

Even if Nifty consolidates at the higher levels, we would strongly recommend refraining from creating shorts as long as the Nifty stays above the 10,800 mark.

Continue to make select purchases with each consolidation. Overall, a positive outlook is advised for the day.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa.





The MACD alone may not be a sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

As many as 10 stocks in the Sensex pack gave positive return during January 29 to July 11 whereas 19 stocks in the index were in negative territory. ITC remained unchanged.

Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 24 per cent), TCS (24 per cent), HUL (23 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (22 per cent), Asian Paints (18 per cent), Infosys (12 per cent), IndusInd Bank (10 per cent), RIL (8 per cent), HDFC Bank (7 per cent) and YES Bank (4 per cent) stood tall among large caps.

On the other hand, Vedanta, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, ONGC and Bharti Airtel slumped between 17 per cent and 37 per cent during the same period.

In the BSE Smallcap space, Electrosteel Steels rallied more than 550 per cent since January 29. It was followed by Nalco (up 107 per cent), Indiabulls Ventures (86 per cent) and V-Mart Retail (79 per cent). 

Excel Industries, Firstsource Solutions, Seamec, Merck, Take Solutions and KDDL rose 39-78 per cent during the same window.

With a jump of 30 per cent, Mphasis and Page Industries are the stars in the midcap space. Bajaj Finserv, Berger Paints, Exide Industries, Glaxosmithkline Pharma, MRF and Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health advanced up to 24 per cent since January 29 this year.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices are down around 14 per cent and 18 per cent from their respectively all-time highs, hit in January this year.

On the further movement of markets, Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking, said, “Key domestic macro events like May IIP, June CPI inflation data and corporate earnings season will provide further direction to the markets in the near term. Stock or sector specific volatility will remain high. The progress of monsoon, movement of crude oil prices and global developments will continue to be monitored by the market participants. The rising trade tensions between the US and China could induce high volatility across the indices globally. Traders should avoid risky leveraged positions.”

Foreign institutional investors have offloaded shares worth Rs 5,470 crore on a year-to-date basis till July 11 while domestic institutional investors poured more than Rs 64,000 crore.

On the oil dip, Vandana Hari, a market analyst and founder of Vanda Insights, told ETNow, “There was almost a simultaneous plunge in a lot of metals as well as crude yesterday. The biggest bearish factor right now for the crude market is economic headwinds. The trade battle between China and the US, the world’s two largest economies, is set to get far worse before it gets better. That was the biggest factor that knocked crude off its perch yesterday.”

“I would differentiate crude from the other industrial commodities. There are opposing pulls on crude right now. There is a question mark on what happens to global oil demand growth if the Chinese and US trade sparring continues which is a little bit of concern but is very hard for oil markets to quantify. The opposing pulls, the bullish forces on crude, on the other hand are very much intact and Iran is the biggest of them,” she added.

She further said one probably can expect some impact on oil demand growth as a result of the trade wars but on the other hand, there is clear and present danger to Iranian crude exports. 

“I do believe that despite the overnight slump, crude will remain supported and probably will start picking up again from this point, but it is going to be several months in my view before we can actually see any tangible impact on demand growth. In the absence of that tangible figure, the bullish factors are going to assert themselves much more,” added Vandana."
41,2018-07-13,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity market ended Friday's session on a flat note, snapping five-session winning streak, as gains in Reliance Industries, HDFC duo, Infosys and Kotak Mahindra Bank were offset by losses in ITC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and State Bank of India. 

The risk appetite received a blow by weak macro numbers released on Thursday that highlighted an uptick in headline inflation and a slump in industrial production.

The retail inflation accelerated to a five-month high of 5 per cent in June compared with 4.87 per cent in May, while industrial production fell to 3.2 per cent in May compared to 4.9 per cent in April.

Rising inflation is expected to trigger further key rate hikes this fiscal by India's central bank. 

However, easing crude oil prices, firm global cues and rupee's improving health saved the market from witnessing a sharp fall today. 

Sensex closed 7 points, or 0.02 per cent, down at 36,542, while Nifty settled 4 points, or 0.04 per cent, down at 11,019.

Market breadth remained negative with 812 stocks advancing on BSE, compared with 1,824 decliners. 

BSE Midcap and smallcap indices suffered more losses, falling up to 1.36 per cent.

For the week, Sensex rose by 2.48 per cent, while Nifty climbed by 2.29 per cent.

The mixed bag of Sensex gainers included Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints and Coal India, whereas ONGC, Hero MotoCorp and Bharti Airtel joined the pack of Sensex losers.

Most PSU bank stocks, including Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda suffered significant losses on Friday. 

IT stocks including Infosys, TCS and Wipro went home with gains. However, HCL Technologies dropped over 2 per cent on Friday following the announcement of its much-awaited share buyback.

The board of the third-largest IT firm on Thursday approved a share buyback of up to Rs 4,000 crore, which is higher than Rs 3,500 crore offer it came out with last year. 

Tata Steel settled with a mild gain of 0.33 per cent. The firm is planning to sell some of its businesses in South-East Asia as part of its strategy to exit non-scalable businesses and turn focus to the domestic market, ET reported citing sources. 

Among the sectors, BSE Energy, IT and consumer durables settled with gains. 

European shares were in the green, underpinned by optimism around better earnings. Asian markets portrayed a mixed picture. Shanghai SE Composite Index closed with a loss of 0.23 per cent, but Hang Seng inched up by 0.16 per cent. Nikkei settled almost 2 per cent up."
42,2018-07-15,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: FMCG major Hindustan Unilever is poised to report its financial results on Monday for the quarter ended June 2018 on Monday. There are expectations that consumer-oriented companies are likely to see double-digit volume growth aided by a recovery in rural areas and a soft base.

An assessment by Kotak Institutional Equities showed that the company may report 27.80 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 1,639.70 crore in Q1FY19, while net sales may increase by 14.70 per cent on year-on-year basis.

The brokerage house sees 25.80 per cent YoY and 26.90 per cent YoY jump in EBITDA and EPS, respectively, for the quarter ended June 2018. 

“We expect the FMCG bellwether to report another solid quarter with 20 per cent comparable topline growth driven by 14 per cent underlying volume growth (UVG),” Kotak said in a report. 

Edelweiss Securities projected 13.80 per cent YoY and 11.50 per cent YoY growth in net profit and revenue, respectively. EBITDA may jump 16.20 per cent YoY.

""We expect HUL, Dabur, Britannia, Marico, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Pidilite, Emami (on a very soft base), and Nestle to report double-digit volume growth,"" Edelweiss Securities said.

The brokerage house expects HUL to report a volume growth of around 11-12 per cent YoY on a flat base. The growth is likely to be stronger on the back of improving sentiment and preference towards HUL products such as Lever Ayush as well as decent performance of new launches. 

HUL may also report higher ad spends too to back their new launches."
45,2018-07-16,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: FMCG stocks were trading mixed during Monday's session.

However, gains in Godrej Consumer Products (up 2.09 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (HUL) (up 1.34 per cent), GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (up 1.16 per cent) and Britannia Industries (up 1.16 per cent) were keeping the sectoral index in the green.

The Nifty FMCG index was trading 0.53 per cent up at 29,786 around 10:45 am. 

Shares of Jubilant Foodworks (up 0.59 per cent) and ITC (up 0.43 per cent) were also trading with gains.

Key indices Sensex and Nifty were down, tracking weak Asian cues. Investors were cautious after an official data showed that China's economy slowed a little in the second quarter. 

Weak domestic macroeconomic indicators too hit the sentiment. India's trade deficit widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was down 19 points at 10,999, while the BSE Sensex was 5 points down at 36,537. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 20 were trading in the green, while 30 were in the red. 

Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever and Cipla were among the top gainers in the Nifty index.

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Tata Steel and Lupin were among the top losers in the Nifty kitty of stocks."
48,2018-07-16,Asian Paints,"Selective buying in heavyweight stocks took the benchmark BSE Sensex to an all-time high level last week.

However, most of the stocks in the 30-share index are still giving negative returns on a year-to-date basis. The selling pressure has been severe in midcap and smallcap stocks. 

Headwinds in the form of weak emerging markets, rising rates, higher crude oil prices, election year worries and relative rich valuations have mainly impacted sentiments on Dalal Street this year. 

Global brokerage Morgan Stanley, which estimates Sensex to hit 36,000 by June next year in base case, believes the largecap index has support from an improving growth cycle, strong macro stability and local appetite for equities.

“We expect Sensex earnings growth of 5 per cent YoY in F2018, 23 per cent in F2019 and 24 per cent in FY2020,” the brokerage said in a report.

In a bull case scenario, it sees Sensex at 44,000 and in bear case at 26,500. 


Factors favouring the market
The global brokerage highlighted the factors that are looking favourable for the market. They include macroeconomic stability evident in positive BoP and backed by RBI’s commitment to keeping real rates positive. 

A bullish steepening of yield curve, which is at a post-2010 high, correlates positively with stocks and low and falling beta, which augur well in a weak global equity market environment.

In addition to this, India’s growth is likely accelerating relative to emerging markets. “Our work shows corporate confidence is at a multi-year high and profits are likely to mean-revert from below trend. Strong domestic flows, currently averaging around $2-2.5 billion a month, are in a structural uptrend,” Morgan Stanley said.

The brokerage prefers largecaps to midcaps and like sectors, including banks (private corporate and retail), discretionary consumption, industrials and domestic materials, while avoiding healthcare, staples, utilities, global materials and energy.

The brokerage further says crude oil prices remain a key risk to equities given its ability to cause pain to fiscal deficit and, therefore, growth. It sees strong growth in 2018 and 2019 driven by consumption, exports, government spending and a nascent recovery in private capex.


Valuations
Morgan Stanley said equities do not look compelling compared with long bonds. India’s recent outperformance has lifted relative valuations above average. “Our composite valuation indicator suggests low double-digit index returns in the coming 12 months,” it added in a report.


Stocks in focus
Bajaj Auto, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, Titan, ITC, ITC, RIL, Bharat Financial, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, M&M Financial, Shriram Transport, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Adani Ports, Havells India, Asian Paints, Ultratech Cement, UPL and Infosys are among the stocks on Morgan Stanley’s focus list. 


Factors against domestic equities
The global brokerage said a likely rise in crude oil prices can put pressure on growth, while upward pressure on inflation from food price hikes indicate that more rate hikes are coming. The election cycle, which brings its own set of uncertainties, relatively rich midcap valuations (even after the recent drawdown) and high equity valuations relative to bonds, which indicates that the market is pricing in some part of the coming growth recovery, are some of the factors looking against Indian equities."

43,2018-07-16,Asian Paints,"Several stocks generate excess returns compared to their benchmark indices. The most consistent among the outperformers also have the ability to generate wealth over the long term. 

So, we have identified stocks that have outperformed the benchmark BSE Sensex for most of the trading days over the last three years. We restricted our study to BSE 500 stocks and calculated their daily returns from 29 June 2015 to 29 June 2018. We also calculated the daily returns of BSE Sensex for the same period. 

We then considered each stock from our universe of 500 stocks and looked for trading days on which the stock outperformed the Sensex. After that we added all the trading days on which a stock outperformed the Sensex, and calculated the outperformance of the stock in percentage terms. 

For instance, IndusInd Bank outperformed the BSE Sensex on 395 trading days out of 745 trading days in the past three years, so its outperformance stands at 53%. We repeated the exercise for each of the 500 stocks and then sorted them in descending order on the basis of their outperformance.


Outperformers analysts are bullish on
The average 3-year return of these consistent outperformers is a whopping 178% compared to the BSE500’s 34.2%.
 *Number of trading days the stock has outperformed the BSE Sensex in past three years. Operating profit (including other income) and PAT growth is y-o-y. Absolute returns as on 29 Jun 2018. Source: ACE Equity and Bloomberg

After analysing point-to-point returns of the selected stocks, we found that the top 10% delivered an average return of 143% between 29 June 2015 and 29 June 2018. The BSE500 returned 34.2% during the same period. These top 10% stocks delivered 25% point-to-point average returns between 29 June 2017 and 29 June 2018, while the BSE500 generated 10.6% returns during the same period. 

So, in the past one and three years, the top 10% of the outperforming stocks have generated a premium of 2.4-times and 4.2-times respectively compared to the benchmark index. These stocks have not only consistently outperformed the BSE Sensex but also score highly on their fundamental attributes.

The unaudited results for 2017-18 show that the top 10% of the stocks have delivered year-on-year aggregate operating and net profit growth of 15% and 12% respectively. Comparatively, aggregate operating and net profits of BSE500 were 8.1% and 2% respectively for the same period. Our study shows that the analysis of stock performance with respect to market benchmarks could help investors identify medium to long-term outperformers.


 Let us look at the five stocks from our top 10% list that have got the highest buy recommendations from analysts.


1. IndusInd BankIt’s a new generation private sector bank with more than 1,000 branches and around 1,800 ATMs spread across the country. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the bank’s profit growth will be supported by robust revenue momentum, driven by strong loan growth and healthy expansion in net interest margins. The bank’s loan growth is likely to strengthen further in the June 2018 quarter and its asset quality will continue to be among the best in the industry.


2. Britannia IndustriesIndia’s leading food company, Britannia manufactures bakery and dairy products. According to a research report by KR Choksey, the company is likely to grow faster than the market due to the management’s efforts on new innovative products in the premium segment, improvement in distribution channel, focus on capturing new markets and increasing penetration in the rural areas. Steps to mitigate the impact of inflation on raw material prices will help improve Ebitda and profit after tax margins by 2019-20.


3. Dalmia BharatThis cement manufacturer has an annual installed capacity of 25 million tonnes. Sustained improvement in variable cost parameters, rising market share across regions, increasing scale of premium brands, discipline in capex and debt repayment, and organisational restructuring will be future growth drivers, says a research report by Antique Stock Broking.


4. JSW SteelProducer and distributer of iron and steel products, JSW Steel has a capacity of 18 million tonnes per annum. The company has invested $1 billion in the US. According to a research report by ICICI Direct, JSW Steel will benefit from its expansion, given the stringent trade measures announced by the US to support its domestic steel industry.


5. Asian PaintsThe company’s product portfolio comprises paints, water proofing material, wall coverings and adhesives. According to a research report by JP Morgan, healthy domestic demand aided by rural recovery, improved overseas operations, extensive distribution reach and product innovations offers positive revenue growth outlook in 2018-19."

Godrej Consumer Products, HDFC, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mphasis and Sanofi India too joined the pack of stocks that touched 52-week highs on NSE.

Frontline equity indices Sensex and Nifty extended losses to the second consecutive session on Monday owing to losses in metal, pharma, auto, bank and energy stocks, while weak macroeconomic indicators and mixed global cues kept investors' mood subdued. 

Sensex registered a muted start in the light of tepid Asian cues after an official data showed that China's economy slowed a little in the second quarter. 

Moreover, a set of weak macroeconomic numbers eroded market optimism.

Market's risk appetite was dealt a blow after India's trade deficit widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee. 

The market mood got further hit as a government data released today showed that the inflation based on wholesale prices shot up to 5.77 per cent in June on increasing prices of vegetables and fuel items.

Earlier, a government data last week had revealed that the retail inflation jumped to a 5-month high of 5 per cent in the month of June on rising fuel prices.

Surging inflation may push India's central bank to hike key rates in its next policy meet in August.

50,2018-07-17,Asian Paints,"Stock picking turned difficult this year thanks to strong volatility in the domestic equity market. Market participants look undecided whether to go with a technical or fundamental view.

But how about going with the combination of the two? CAN SLIM does exactly that to identify potential value stocks. 

Developed by investor William O’Neil, this is a techno-fundamental strategy that helps pick quality stocks. Fundamentals give the conviction to hold a stock while technicals indicate attractive entry and exit points.

 “CAN SLIM is a rules-based investment system based on the study of historical multibagger price runs in stocks. The system was created by one of America’s most successful stock investors, William O’Neil, after he studied stock market winners and market cycles going back to the 19th century,” says Anupam Singhi, CEO, William O’Neil India.

William O’Neil observed that most multibaggers shared seven common characteristics. He then started investing in stocks that had developed there seven traits and went on to become one of the all-time investing legends.

“The methodology is based on 100 per cent realistic historical studies of how the stock market has actually worked,” Singhi said.

Since its inception four years ago, the MarketSmith India model portfolio based on CAN SLIM has grown around 111 per cent between June 1, 2014 and July 6, 2018. The Nifty has gained over 40 per cent during the same period. 

“CAN SLIM is primarily a momentum trading or investing strategy. It tends to work well in a directional market. Like any other strategy, it too has its pros and cons. CAN SLIM may not do very well in a choppy market. As a strategy, it tries to merge fundamentals and technical analysis,” says Kolkata-based value investor Abhishek Basumallick.


How does CANSLIM work?
CAN SLIM is a guideline where each letter stands for an important factor that needs to be considered before investing in a stock.


C – Current Earnings
Healthy financial performance in most recent quarters demonstrates that a business is able to succeed in the current environment.


A – Annual Earnings
A history of healthy sales and earnings growth in recent years demonstrates that a business model is sustainable and viable, and can generate profits consistently.


N – New Product/Service, Management or Price High
Studies have shown that the greatest stock market winners of the past were all trying something new. Always look for companies with new, game-changing products and services


S – Supply and Demand
S is for supply and demand of the stock. As more investors demand a limited supply of shares, a stock’s price goes up. Look for heavy volume accumulation by institutional investors, particularly at key moments like when the stock is breaking above prior resistance levels.


L – Leader or Laggard
True leaders are those companies that show best earnings growth, strongest sales, superior price performance, and are in leading industry groups. Every bull market has a new leader and there is no point getting stuck with stocks that belong to the lagging industry groups. Look for the best of the best – leaders in strong industries that are showing superior earnings growth and sales.


I – Institutional Sponsorship
Mutual funds, banks and other professional investors are big players who drive the market. For a stock to be a top performer, it must have institutional support to fuel its price moves. Look for stocks that are showing signs of heavy accumulation and consistent increase in the number of funds holding the stock.


M – Market Direction
Studies have shown that three out of every four stocks follow the current market trend. You should always trade in sync with the market. You should be buying more stocks when the market is in an uptrend, and protecting your capital when the market is in a downtrend.

“This rules-based system helps identify stocks with the right fundamental profile to succeed. Once the stock passes this litmus test, one needs to look out for a breakout from a sound base pattern. Base patterns are periods of sideways movement where the stock has less buying interest. No stock can be in a rally forever, even multibaggers have periods of consolidation and we must wait for the stocks to breakout to new highs before we take any fresh position. A rules-based system helps us nail down fundamentally strong growth stocks, and then we wait for the technical buy signal, i.e. the breakout, to pick up the stock,” said Singhi of William O'Neil India.


Who can go with the strategy?
To be successful in the stock market, all investors regardless of whether they are first-timers or experienced investing professionals need to learn sound, historically proven buy rules as well as sell rules.

Singhi says CAN SLIM strategy is tailored for investors looking to beat the market by investing in stocks with high quality fundamentals. The aim of the system is to capture big price runs by buying fundamentally strong stocks that are market leaders. 

“Our strategy gives investors a huge advantage by materially improving stock selection and timing. The system requires strict discipline and helps investors develop the right money management skills,” he added.


Top stocks on the basis of CAN SLIM model
William O'Neil India shared a list of 10 stocks based on the CAN SLIM model with ETMarkets.com.


Asian Paints: Organised paint companies are likely to get benefitted from increasing population and housing shortages in India, which will drive growth for residential construction industry (expected to grow at 15 per cent during the period 2018-2022). Moreover, the government’s push for affordable housing under its plan “Housing for all by 2022” is providing much needed traction for the paint industry. 


Nestle India: The revival of its major brand Maggi (60 per cent market share) and new product launches (40 new products over the past two years across various segments) helping the company to substantiate its position in the market. Moreover, the reducing material cost helping Nestle in expanding its margin. The deflationary price trend in Q1 2018 (-11 per cent YoY) for skimmed milk powder continues to prevail owing to an excess supply leading to a decline in prices by Rs 4-10 per litre. Coffee prices also continue to decline 4 per cent YoY as of H1 2018, reaching the low recorded in 2014. “With the lowering input prices, we expect its margins to further expand in 2018, supported by a favourable product mix and input costs,” said Singhi.


Maruti Suzuki: Maruti Suzuki is the largest passenger vehicle company in India by sales. The management is confident about its future prospects and expects to sell 2 million vehicles by FY2020. 


VIP Industries: The company manufactures a wide range of hard-sided and soft-sided luggage under the VIP, Skybags, Alfa, Aristocrat, Carlton, and Caprese brands. The company reported five consecutive quarters of high double-digit EPS growth. It is expected to grow further on the back of its capacity expansions in Bangladesh, where it currently enjoys a tax holiday of seven years. Moreover, aggressive brand promotion, growth in the aviation industry, and wider retail network add more revenue prospects for the Company.


Britannia Industries: This company drives its growth through its capacity expansion plan, new product introductions, and geographic expansion. In addition, the goods and services tax has brought the unorganised sector (25 per cent of biscuit market) under the tax net, helping the company gain 170bps of market share in the Hindi-speaking belt, where it faces intense competition from regional players. It reported three consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth and two consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth.

Edelweiss Financial Services: Edelweiss has delivered industry leading growth with its credit book growing to Rs 42,010 crore in FY 2018 from Rs 3,956 crore in FY 2012, implying a CAGR of 48.3 per cent. The company achieved this growth while maintaining healthy net interest margins (7.7 per cent in FY 2018) and robust asset quality with net NPA at 0.7 per cent, at the end of FY 2018.


KEI Industries: This is a cable manufacturing company involved in the manufacturing and supply of power cables and other industrial cables. KEI Industries’ strong order book and the growing pace of export are helping it substantiate its position.

HDFC Bank: It is the second-largest private lender by assets with a focus on rural and semi-urban markets. Its asset quality remains top-notch thanks to stringent credit origination practices, strong monitoring system, and adequate provisioning.

Along with increased digitisation, the bank is also expanding its presence in rural and semi-urban areas, which are largely underpenetrated. Among the total number of branches, 53 per cent of the total bank outlets are in semi-urban and rural locations. The expansion strengthens its retail segment, which is highly dependent on SME and unsecured lending. The share of unsecured lending and SME continues to trend higher; recorded at 47.6 per cent in FY 2018 compared with 40.8 per cent in FY 2015. Double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with strong ROE continue to attract the investor community, according to William O’Neil India."

57,2018-07-19,Asian Paints,"By Anand Datla

There are nearly as many bunkers at Carnoustie as there are bones in a body. Spare the exaggeration, but it is daunting to think that there are 112 bunkers that dot this 7.402 yard course.

A flight above the Angus coast can make you wonder if you are looking down on an uneven collection of deep UFO circles.

It will take precision and patience from the 156 men assembled in Carnoustie to test themselves against the toughest links course on the Open rota — the average winning score has been three under par, the highest among all Open venues.

“I think you just have to take a few deep breaths,” Craig Boath, head greenkeeper of Carnoustie Golf Links, told the ET. The reaction from Craig was priceless even as anticipation builds into the Open Championship. “You might want to lay up just short and work on a good approach. It is important to think and play straight.”

Easier said than done when the ball rolls a mile and hungry bunkers wait to swallow your trundling ball.

During the practice rounds, the golfers have been trying two, often three clubs off the tee, trying to figure which club might serve them best. They have been visiting bunkers and navigating the rough as they put in the last few hours before plunging into this daunting examination of character.

Dustin Johnson admitted to checking out a driver and three different irons off the first tee. And that is just for one of the eighteen holes. The pot bunkers are on the top of Johnson’s mind. “You hit it in a bunker and it’s like a penalty shot.

You can advance the ball forward but I haven’t seen one I could actually hit it out of and on to the green,” analysed the world No.1.

“The rough is not very penal so if I can carry all the bunkers, I’m going to hit driver.” Anirban Lahiri went about his practice round like a clinical researcher trying to examine the import of each ingredient in a complex molecule. The 104th ranked Indian wants to depend on some familiar cues to get through the challenge.

“I am going to play it a la DGC (Delhi Golf Club). The terrain may not be similar, but I need to get that same mindset I use there,” said Anirban.

“The ball is running like crazy here, it does over there as well. You need to avoid running into the bushes and almost thread your tee shots. You have to do the same here except that the bushes are replaced by pot bunkers.”

Rory McIlroy believes that he has a better chance of adding to his major collection if he rediscovers the spirit of his teenage years. McIlroy was at Carnoustie in 2007, as a greenhorn who took home the silver medal that decorates the best amateur.

“The golf course is playing so firm and fast,” said four-time major winner McIlroy. “The risk of hitting the driver on some holes is not having full control of your ball if it does run into the rough.

“But either side of the fairway there are five to 10 yards where the rough is not too bad. If it does go in the rough, you’re still able to get some control and then you’re trying to land the ball on the front edge and get it trundling on to the green.”

There are as many perspectives on the course as there might be shades of colour on an Asian Paints colour palette. By the time you read this, experiments will have met with execution and the first pages of the 147thOpen Championship will be in the bank.

Anirban played well for the most part but a bad drive at the tenth and a couple of lipped out putts cost him dear. Among the morning groups, playing with Matt Kuchar and Peter Uihlein, Anirban drove his tee shot into the thick rough just beyond the bunkers. 

His effort to extricate the ball from there came unstuck at the first attempt leading to a double bogey. A three putt at the par-3 16thhole resulted in another bogey as he slipped to five over Anirban made three bogeys – 4th, 9thand 16th– besides the double at the tenth to account for his 76.

“I did not strike the ball very well,” admitted Anirban. “I am going to work a bit today, get some rest and come back for more tomorrow. I need a few birdies tomorrow.”

Kevin Kisner was the early leader with a spotless 66, with Erik van Rooyen and Tony Finau sitting right behind him at 67.

The bunkers at Carnoustie are no imagined threat. As the early starters on Thursday learnt at their own peril, they are like hungry beasts with their mouth open. It only takes an unruly ball to ruin a young man’s day in these dark and dangerous woods."

60,2018-07-21,Asian Paints,"Markets turned out to be extremely volatile this week, taking even the experts by surprise on which way the market is heading. Corporate numbers were not appreciated even after delivering robust set of numbers, which is a cause of worry. 

HUL posted a staggering 19 per cent PAT growth, but the stock was down 7.6 per cent, post results. Mahindra CIE, JK Tyres and Mindtree had all delivered great set of numbers, but still the stock prices were hammered. This throws an important signal that the upside is limited at least in the near term. 

Although markets are likely to touch new highs to test the strength of the bulls, it seems more likely that they would recede from the highs and make a failed top, given the internal weakness. 

The sentiment is low, which comes from the fact that IPOs are getting below-average response. However, all that is going to change when HDFC AMC comes out with its IPO next week at an attractive value proposition. 

Any euphoric response to such an IPO could possibly mark the top in the Nifty. We do recommend subscribe HDFC AMC from a long-term investing perspective. 


Events of the week:The government is planning a breakthrough policy decision which will decrease the logistic costs for the economy, which is currently as high as 16% compared with the global average of 10 per cent to 12 per cent. The plan is to allow truckers to increase the load factor by 20-25 per cent. 

This may lead to a slowdown in CV sales and therefore, some companies may be impacted. But it is good for the long-term competitiveness of the economy. 


Technical Outlook:
The Nifty is likely to touch previous highs after a small consolidation phase. Still, the indicators have not reached overbought levels that make a strong case for the NSE benchmark touching 11,170 levels in the short term. 

Momentum is intact, which should allow the Nifty to test higher levels. Given that the breadth of the broader market is weak, there is every likelihood that higher levels will not sustain. Traders should buy with today’s low as a stop. 




Expectations for the week:Since the Parliament sessions are going on, some amount of political conundrum could drive market volatility. It is expected that reforms agenda will get accelerated, which would be a positive for the markets in general. 

Investors must maintain a cautious stance, as the year ahead is heavily clouded by political drama. Contra bets in metals, realty and housing finance companies -- which are heavily beaten down -- can be good bets, going forward. 

Quarterly earnings of a few companies such as ACC, Asian Paints, Ambuja Cement, Indiabulls Ventures, Hero MotoCorp, JSW Steel would be important to watch. 

In general, investors should now adopt a wait and watch policy before taking fresh investment positions. The Nifty50 closed the week marginally down by 0.07 per cent to close at 11,010.20."

New axle load norms hit CVsFor the week ended July 20, shares of commercial vehicle makers, led by Ashok Leyland, slumped up to 19 per cent after the government brought in new axle norms for load carrying capacity that experts said could hurt demand.

""We believe the Street is overly concerned about the new load-per-axle norms. Demand in the near term is thus likely to be subdued due to confusion around the applicability and implementation of norms,"" Edelweiss Research said in a report.

62,2018-07-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: No-confidence motion against the Modi government, fresh fall in the rupee, poor macro data in the form of rising inflation as well as widening trade deficit and global trade war tensions influenced market sentiment in the week gone by.

Volatility persisted with equities witnessing see-saw trade, although, in the end bears had the last laugh.

On a weekly basis, the BSE Sensex lost 0.12 per cent while NSE's Nifty50 index shed 0.07 per cent to settle at 36,496 and 11,010, respectively.

Let's take a look at the major factors that are likely to steer market in the week ahead:


Next batch of earnings: A slew of big names are slated to release their Q1 report cards during the week.

ACC, Hindustan Zinc and Granules India are slated to release their numbers on Monday. Asian Paints, Borosil ans Symphony will announce their numbers on Tuesday. BHEL, Canara Bank, HCL Infosystems, Hero MotoCorp and PVR will announce theirs on Wednesday.

Telecom major Bharti Airtel, Biocon, Dr Reddy's, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Power, Tata Coffee and YES Bank are scheduled to announce their June quarter earnings on Thursday. Bank of Baroda, HCL Tech, ICICI Bank, M&M Finance will declare theirs on Friday. 


F&O expiry: Trading is expected to be volatile as traders will roll over positions in the F&O segment from the near month July 2018 series to August 2018 series. The July 2018 F&O contracts will expire on Thursday.

Brokerage Emkay Global in a report said, FII positioning has been reduced, and they have increased their Long position by 59 per cent and have reduced Short position by 21 per cent. Also, Nifty FII long short ratio is 1.15 times against 0.64 times of beginning of July series. FIIs have covered their short positions and decent long position is still there. Considering these, it expects Nifty roll level to go up from here.


GST-linked stocks: The GST Council on Saturday slashed tax rates on a number of products, ranging from paints, white goods to footwears. The Council, headed by Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, lowered indirect tax slab on products such as paints, leather goods, bamboo flooring, stoves, televisions and washing machines from the highest rate of 28 per cent to mostly 18 per cent.

The tax rate on ethanol blended with petrol, footwear costing up to Rs 1,000 and fertiliser grade phosphoric acid has been cut to from 12 to 5 per cent, Goyal said.

This apart, the minister announced that sanitary napkins will be exempt from GST. Sanitary napkins are taxed 12 per cent tax under the one-year old GST regime, which attracted serious criticism from different quarters.


Rupee: Movement in the rupee will be keenly watched by the investors. On Friday, the currency hit a fresh record low of 69.12 against the US dollar before recovering 21 paise to close at 68.84. Deteriorating domestic macro scenario coupled with global uncertainty shocks could continue to keep the rupee under severe pressure in near term.


Impact of no-confidence vote: Stocks are likely to react positively after the government comfortably defeated the no-trust vote in the Parliament late Friday. The motion was defeated with 325 votes against it while 126 voted in favour.


HDFC AMC IPO: The much-awaited IPO by HDFC AMC will be open for subscription during July 25-27. The company has fixed a price band of Rs 1,095-1,100 per share for its initial public offering (IPO), through which it is estimated to garner Rs 2,800 crore. HDFC AMC operates as a joint venture between Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Standard Life Investments.


ECB policy meet: The European Central Bank (ECB) is slated to meet for monetary policy next week with decision due on Thursday. It is widely expected to leave rates unchanged. Reports say ECB chief Mario Draghi could speak on the ongoing trade spat and its possible impact on both European and global growth during his presser.


US GDP data: The GDP data for the second quarter will be released on Friday. Recent US Federal Reserve minutes highlighted that the US economy continued to look strong. Economists predict GDP expanded at a 4.2 per cent annualised rate, compared with a 2 per cent increase at the start of the year, Financial Times reported. 


Tech chart: The Nifty, in the week gone by, traded in a rangebound manner and ultimately posted a negative weekly close. In terms of the bar patterns, it formed an Inside bar along with a Doji pattern on the weekly chart. This shows indecision in the minds of market participants, say experts.

""The detailed structure shows that the index has formed a flat correction over last few sessions. Alternately, the structure can take the form of a triangular pattern if the consolidation continues going ahead,"" says Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Nevertheless, the outlook continues to be positive from short-term perspective with 11,078-11,100 as a key target area. On the downside, 10,935-10,925, which is the lower end of the consolidation, shall be the crucial support zone to watch out for, Ratnaparkhi says.


Other factors: Progress in the monsoon, global markets trends, trade war tensions, investment by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and crude oil prices movement will also dictate the trend on the bourses next week."

During the week gone by, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty traded in a narrow range with a negative bias due to weak global cues, volatility in rupee and official data showing a surge in inflation.

Global cues were not clearly supporting the domestic market, as trade tensions between the US and other major economies continued to add fears on investor minds.

Analysts say while the market is likely to take some time before it chooses its direction, investors can look at stock-specific opportunities.

Analyst: Jay Anand Thakkar, CMT, Anand Rathi Shares

IDFC | BUY | Target Price: Rs 48.50 | Stop loss: Rs 42.80
IDFC has formed a falling wedge pattern, which is a bullish reversal pattern. It has been formed after a substantial fall; hence the probability of a reversal is quite high.

IndusInd Bank | BUY | Target Price: Rs 2,000 | Stop loss: Rs 1,860
The stock has given a correction from the peak of Rs 1,990 to show signs of bottoming out at around Rs 1,880 levels and has currently indicated a positive candle pattern in the daily chart to signify strength for further upside movement in the coming days. The RSI also has shown a trend reversal from the oversold zone and has given a buy signal on this stock.

Analyst: Gajendra Prabu, HDFC Securities

ITC | BUY | Target Price: Rs 300 | Stop loss: Rs 259
This stock has formed a bullish candle with a long lower shadow on the weekly chart, which indicates that the momentum is in favour of the bulls. The stock price has started a new rising leg post a throwback fall (which ended at Rs 266) and in smaller degree higher top and higher bottom formation is developing. Price is in the internals of “wave C”; so more upside move is expected in the coming days. In addition, the price is placed well above the key moving averages of 21-, 50- and 200-day EMAs; this could add strength to the bulls. “Traders may look to buy the stock at Friday's CMP and add in dips to Rs 266 for the upside target of Rs 300 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 259 (on a closing basis),” he said.


Manav Chopra, CMT, Indiabulls Ventures

SBI | BUY | Target Price: Rs 285 | Stop loss: Rs 250
After a recent decline, this stock has formed support near the 200-DMA and is making a higher bottom.

Cipla | BUY | Target Price: Rs 680 | Stop loss: Rs 590
This stock has held support at Rs 600 and seen a strong reversal candlestick. There is breakout on volumes as the prices have exceeded its 20-day average and oscillators remain in the buy mode. “Expect the prices to exceed the weekly resistance zone of Rs 640 as the undertone trend remains bullish,” he said.


BEL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 115 | Stop loss: Rs 98
The stock after a series of positive divergence in the RSI has bounced from the oversold levels. There is an emergence of morning star candlestick pattern which hints for short-term bottom in place. “There will be a strong support at Rs 100 on the downside, which is likely to provide a cushion in case of decline.

Sterlite Technologies | BUY | Target Price: Rs 370 | Stop loss: Rs 297
After a multi-month correction from the high of Rs 415, this counter appears to have posted durable bottom around Rs 255 and resumed its upward move. Considering strong momentum and swift runup in the last couple of days, traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines in the zone of Rs 320–310. Sustaining above Rs 300, it can be expected to scale to much higher levels. “Positional traders are advised to buy for an initial target of Rs 370 with a stop below Rs 297 on a closing basis,” he said.


Analyst: Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA

Thermax | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,120 | Stop loss: Rs 1,005

74,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Mixed global cues are hinting at a flat start for the domestic market on Tuesday, but volatility may pick up as the day progresses, as traders roll over their positions ahead of Thursday's F&O expiry.


Let's check out what all might matter to Dalal Street during the day:


Singapore trading sets stage for flat start
Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 8.50 points, or 0.08 per cent, lower at 11,118, indicating a flat to negative start for the Nifty50.


Tech view: Nifty50 forms small bullish candle
The Nifty50 logged solid gains on Monday and closed above the 11,080 mark, which had in the past proved to be tough resistance for the index. A consistent rise above this level, especially if the index rises above the 11,130 mark, would pave the way for further gains in the index. A failure to hold above this level may drag the index back to 10,930 level. 


Market-wide F&O rollovers at 27%
The market-wide rollovers till Monday stood at 27 per cent, which is higher than the average rollovers of 24 per cent in the last three F&O series. Nifty futures rollover at 21 per cent too were higher than average rollovers of 17 per cent in the last three series. ""The much anticipated and talked about event relating to physical settlement in select F&O names kicks-off from this expiry. As a result most of the names have already seen pickup in rollover activity,"" Edelweiss Securities said in a note. 


Asian shares unchanged
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei index bounced 0.4 per cent in early trade as a pullback in the yen eased concerns about earnings pressure on exporters. Moves elsewhere were marginal with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan barely changed, Reuters reported.


US stocks end mixed
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.06 per cent lower, the S&P500 index added 0.18 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.28 per cent.


Rupee ends 2 paise lower
The rupee retreated from early high levels to close down with a modest loss of 2 paise at 68.86 against the US currency on stray dollar demand from importers. The home currency initially reacted positively to the GST Council’s decision to cut rates on several items and also tracking broad weakness in the dollar.


Oil prices extend losses
Oil prices extended losses on Tuesday as attention shifted to the risk of oversupply, with market participants shrugging off escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. Brent crude oil futures were down 10 cents, or 0.14 per cent, at $72.96 a barrel, after settling down 1 cent on Monday, Reuters reported. 


Asian Paints, ICICI Pru Q1 results today
Asian Paints, ICICI Prudential Life, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, Symphony and Rane Brake Lining are among companies that will report their quarterly results on Tuesday. Radico Khaitan, Info Edge, Network 18 Media, TeamLease Services and Music Broadcast will be other companies scheduled to report their earnings during the day.


FIIs buy Rs 259 cr worth equities
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 259 crore worth of domestic stocks on Monday, provisional data available with BSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 125 crore, data suggested."
88,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Taking its winning streak to third straight session, NSE barometer Nifty on Tuesday hit a closing high of 11,143, just 37 points short of its record intraday high of 11,171 hit on January 29, 2018. 

But within the index, some stocks have not only recovered but offered handsome return of up to 60 per cent to investors in this period. Only 10 index heavyweights added a whopping Rs 6 lakh crore to investor wealth during the six months.

The list included NBFC players Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, index heavyweight TCS, paintmaker Asian Paints and FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever.

“There are some of the select largecaps in which I see value. The market will keep on doing what it has to do. You buy stocks in which you find value. I do not think the value is in largecaps. Just because largecaps have outperformed for a few months does not mean they will outperform over the next five years,” Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind, told ETNow."
87,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Frontline indices Sensex and Nifty closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in metal, auto and financial stocks amid positive global cues.

The domestic stocks rallied for a third consecutive day, in line with global market, which too climbed for a third day in the row after China indicated that Beijing would take steps to give a stimulus to its economy.

Positive sentiment prevailed after the GST Council slashed rates on over 100 items on Saturday, a day after the NDA winning no-confidence motion in Parliament. 

Following this, FMCG, capital goods and consumer discretionary stocks turned bullish, making Nifty and Sensex scaling new peaks.

At the macro level, global crude oil prices also eased up in the wake of a glut in supply. Indian rupee, barring intermittent hiccups, firmed and foreign funds inflow improved. 

The Sensex climbed 106 points, or 0.29 per cent, ending the day at the fresh peak of 36,825.

The Nifty rose about 50 points, or 0.45 per cent, settling at 11,134.

Sensex saw 20 stocks advancing and 11 declining, whereas 32 stocks closed the day in the green and 18 in the red in the Nifty pack.

BSE Midcap and smallcap indices displayed stellar gains, surging 1.77 per cent and 2.21 per cent, respectively.

Larsen & Toubro, Infosys and HDFC stood as the top drivers of the rally in Sensex index.

Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints and Mahindra & Mahindra too contributed significantly.

However, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever and Tata Consultancy Services failed to perform on Tuesday and ended up as the top drags on the Sensex kitty of stocks.

Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp extended their fall on Tuesday and touched fresh 52-week lows. Both settled with losses of up to 2 per cent. 

Shares of Idea Cellular closed 7 per cent up on the BSE, on the back of the telco and Vodafone India clearing their dues of Rs 7,268 crore with the telecom department, which paves the way for their merger. 

Cement stocks dazzled on Tuesday, with ACC surging 13 per cent, on the back of June quarter earnings. Many brokerages, including CLSA and HSBC, are positive on ACC, terming the earnings as ahead of consensus estimates. Media reports suggested that cement export to BRICS nations is expected to increase soon. 

Sugar stocks also jumped today amid a tight supply of sugar in the wholesale market owing to ongoing nationwide truckers' strike.

Barring BSE Bankex and energy, all indices settled in the green. Global stocks were moving up."
86,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints on Tuesday posted 30.56 per cent rise in consolidated profit at Rs 558.02 crore for the quarter ended June 2018. It has posted a net profit of Rs 427.41 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

ETNow poll had predicted a net profit of Rs 521 crore.

Ebitda on a consolidated basis jumped to Rs 874.40 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 665.40 crore in the same quarter last year. The figure beat ETNow poll estimates of Rs 830 crore.

Net profit on a standalone basis increased 35.40 per cent YoY to Rs 542.63 crore from Rs 400.86 crore during the same period.

The company said that it is taking steps to pass on the benefit of GST rate reduction."
85,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"The domestic stock indices, Sensex and Nifty, scaled fresh lifetime closing highs on Tuesday. If you are wondering why the market is scaling newer peaks even as macros have nothing exciting to offer, the answer is here. Money is chasing select largecap stocks on Dalal Street. 

It can be gauged from the fact that as many as 16 Sensex stocks are still in the red on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. This, when the BSE Sensex hit its fresh all-time high on Tuesday.

Stocks fuelling this rally included TCS, which has rallied more than 50 per cent so far in 2018. This was followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 33 per cent), Infosys (31 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (25 per cent) and Asian Paints (25 per cent).

Other stocks chipped in too. YES Bank, Reliance Industries, Mahindra & Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, HDFC, HDFC Bank, ITC, Larsen & Toubro and Maruti Suzuki advanced between 0.30 per cent and 24 per cent this year. 

“There are some select largecaps in which I see value. Market will keep on doing what it has to do, you buy stocks in which you find value. I don’t think the value is in largecaps. Just because largecaps have outperformed for a few months does not mean they will outperform for the next five years,"" Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind told ETNow. 

He added: ""I am finding much better valuations in midcaps and I am willing to take the bet. So, I think it is time to put more money in stocks where there is value and there seems to be more of that in the smaller stocks than in the larger ones.” 

Domestic institutional investors (DII) have been the proverbial white knights till now, with their robust inflows. Foreign institutional investors have dumped shares to the tune of Rs 10,825 crore in the ongoing calendar year while DIIs have poured in nearly Rs 67,000 crore during January-July 24.

According to market experts, rising current account deficit is putting pressure on the rupee and higher domestic inflation will nudge interest rates higher. Depreciating currency and hike in interest rates make dollar return weaker for foreign portfolio investors, which pushes funds to the exit door. Besides, US interest rates are on the rise, which further sucks out foreign liquidity. 

Tata Motors, Vedanta, Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and State Bank of India declined up to 40 per cent this year.

Considering the broader picture, most indices and stocks have been moving south since the beginning of 2018. Sector-wise, all but BSE IT, Technology, FMCG and Bankex indices slipped up to 23 per cent. 

The BSE IT index advanced 30 per cent, followed by Technology (up 16 per cent), FMCG (8.8 per cent) and Bankex (4.70 per cent). On the other hand, the BSE Realty, Power, Metal, Oil & Gas and Consumer Durables lost 11-23 per cent this year so far.

As for the Sensex June 2019 target, Morgan Stanley India Equity Strategy Alpha Almanac report recently talked about three scenarios. In the base case, it's 36,000. If the bulls take charge, it could hit off 44,000 and in a bear case, it may have to be content with 26,500."

Kotak Institutional Equities believes that the company may post 26.20 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit while net sales may increase 16.30 per cent annually.

The stock was up 0.37 per cent at Rs 1,439 ahead of its quarterly results.

Kotak also estimated a 14 per cent volume growth in the domestic decorative business, aided partly by a low base (2 per cent) of the pre-GST June 2017 quarter. EBITDA margin may expand by 134 basis points for the quarter in question. 

“EBITDA margin expansion reflects operating leverage. We estimate flattish gross margins despite the recent raw material inflation as we factor in the mitigating effects of price increases and strategic sourcing,” the brokerage house said.

ICICIdirect.com projected that Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac are likely to record sales growth of 15 per cent and 14 per cent YoY, respectively. PAT is seen to jump 12.30 per cent.

The brokerage added that Asian Paints is likely to clock record sales growth on around 12 per cent volume uptick. The company has taken a price hike at different intervals (3 per cent YoY) mainly to offset higher raw material prices. As a result, the EBITDA margin is likely to increase 66 bps YoY to 18 per cent."
79,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Equity Advisory, Motilal Oswal Securities, says he is expecting around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. He was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Do you believe UPL’s acquisition of Arysta Lifescience is going to be value accretive and the synergy realisation can provide a significant upside even after yesterday’s upmove in the stock?
UPL has a fantastic track record of acquiring overseas companies in last 20-25 years. They made 20-odd acquisitions in so many years. With Arysta, it will be increasing $3 billion worth of debt on UPL’s special purpose vehicle and that would be a dilution. Net debt to equity will go higher. How they will be able to service the debt, the interest cost on the debt is something needs to be watched.

There will be a bit of postponement. It will be there for the earnings over FY20-FY21. It is very much priced in and it is not going to be value accretive at this point in time for next one-one and a half years.


Talking about the big earnings which the market is going to be reacting to and besides ACC’s good numbers, one wonders what went wrong with United Spirits? How to explain that kind of muted volume growth?
There was high expectation that post highway ban, there would again be a significant jump in the quarter, but the premiumisation is not working well. The Prestige and other brands have shown a very tepid growth and the cost has also gone up significantly.

EBITDA has improved but margin is not improving and the EBITDA margin and the profit margin both are very much flattish. Topline is growing but bottom line is growing a little less -- 10% to 15%. Plus, the earnings volatility is such that it is unpredictable whether one quarter will be a good enough to show traction for profitability in FY19 or FY20 or any other financial year. It is just a flipflop kind of an earning trajectory. They are still struggling with trying to rationalise operations again the regulatory actions.


What could we expect from Asian Paints today given that it is the leader in the paints segment? It is the go-to story when it comes to paint stocks and the fact that the market is betting big on the segment especially after the GST rates are being cut?
Asian Paints has 60% odd market share in the paint industry. It is a dominant player. This quarter, Asian Paints could see a 10-15% kind of a growth. Crude volatility, which is a raw material margin, needs to be watched out for. Crude has now retraced back from 80 to odd 72-73 odd. That gives some kind of a breather for rest of the financial year. We expect around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. That means it can show further growth also.


In the metal story, do you think Hindalco, Tata Steel, Vedanta are buys even at the current levels?
Currency headwinds are almost there for the metal sector but trade war between the two elephants is showing a worrisome sign for these companies. Prices are declining day by day. Realisation will get hit for at least next one to two quarters and that is visible from here. Plus, we believe that the metal companies have done their capacity expansion to the fullest. Now there is not much of a scope there but if demand declines, then bad days will start for them. 

It is not a linear growth for metal stocks at any point in time throughout the year. With 100% capacity expansion, if demand slows down and price realisation is down, then they will have to suffer. However, with Hindalco, there is a different story. They have acquired Aleris and that is a different ball game. One can enter the stocks at around 8% to 10% correction. Even JSW Steel or Hindalco or Vedanta will provide a good opportunity in the longer term.


What is your perspective on mid-tier cement names? Cement is more of a regional play and if names like ACC are doing well, one can only extrapolate that some of the smaller companies will also see traction in their earnings. Would you agree?
I would say even UltraTech Cement has delivered in line with expectation. ACC is beyond comparison because traditionally, it is a very old plant and has had limited capacity expansion. Now the premium segment is picking up in ACC and so it is not comparable with others.

Irrespective of ACC cost per tonne has been reduced, the other cost has gone down and EBITDA has improved slightly, that does not mean that other midcap company which we are talking about is going to be performing better. It is a different ballgame for ACC at this point in time. We believe volume growth will be tepid enough. There will be 6% to 7% average volume growth for all the companies.

In midcaps, Birla Corp is something which needs to be watched out for in terms of results and ongoing for next one-one and a half year, the stock has corrected significantly and Reliance Cement which was the recent acquisition of one-one and a half year back, is running at 80% capacity. There are high chances that the stock can react to the positivity for next one-one and a half year. But it would be an investment perspective and not for trading. So for midcaps, almost 5% to 7% volume growth will be there in this quarterly numbers.


Beside earnings, this week is very critical in terms of a Nifty earnings composition. L&T, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Industries will report their numbers. Which ones are you looking out for and what is your expectation thereof?
This week, the result to watch out for would be ITC. We have to see where are its growth numbers and how the food and the non-cigarette business is shaping up. It can surprise positively rather than negative. 

In Hero MotoCorp, again a price war is taking place at the domestic level with Bajaj. The entry level segment will again be dampening the sentiment. It is not something which would be exciting.

Reliance needs to be watched to see how the margin will come up for this quarter and whether it has taken anything out of the crude advantage. On EBITDA front plus, Jio is doing very well and the retail needs to be watched. Maruti is our favourite."
75,2018-07-24,Asian Paints,"The GST council’s monsoon bonanza for consumers in reducing rates on several general use items is likely to boost prospects of certain paint, footwear and consumer companies. These stocks rallied up to 7 per cent on Monday. ET takes a look at outlook for beneficiaries of reduction in the rates.


ASIAN PAINTS, BERGER PAINTS
Both Berger and Asian Paints are seen as biggest beneficiaries of reduction of GST on paints and varnishes to 18per cent from 28 per cent. “Both are seeing double-digit volume growth in recent years and market share is also fairly stable. Because of GST, growth rate is likely to accelerate 200bps on a compounded basis in the next three years,” said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president-institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities. Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICIdirect, expects Asian Paints to touch Rs 1,550 level in the next one to three months.


BATA INDIA, KHADIM, RELAXO FOOTWEAR
Footwear costing up to Rs 1,000 will now attract GST rate of 5 per cent. Earlier, footwear costing up to Rs 500 attracted 5 per cent GST. “We view this as positive, especially for organised players like Khadim (Rs 500-1000 per pair segment accounts for 30-40per cent of sales), Bata and Relaxo, as proportion of the sub Rs 1,000 portfolio was significant for these players,” said IDFC Securities. Chandan Taparia, derivatives analyst at Motilal Oswal, sees Bata rising to Rs 935-940 if the stock sustains above Rs 865.


WHIRLPOOL OF INDIA
GST Council has reduced GST rate from 28 per cent to 18 per cent on white goods such as washing machine, refrigerators, TV (up to 68 cms), vacuum cleaners, juicer mixer, grinders, shavers and hair dryers, water coolers, water heaters, electric iron, etc. IDFC Securities said Whirlpool will be a key beneficiary, as refrigerators and washing machines comprise 70 per cent of the company’s revenues. Others such as Havells, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricls, Voltas, Dixon (indirect benefits) will see benefits for part of their revenues.


ITC
The company benefited primarily on lack of bad news surrounding cigarettes, which is its mainstay business. The GST council did not revise the cess on cigarettes, which lifted the stock by 3.8per cent in the spot market. “While future cess hikes cannot be ruled out, the short-term overhang on the stock will now be lifted which could result in a reduction in valuation gap between ITC and the FMCG players and also provide greater visibility to FY19 earnings,” said IDFC Securities. Amit Gupta of ICICIdirect said the stock has rallied mainly due to short covering. “It has seen 20 per cent closure of positions in the current series. As long as it does not fall below Rs 280, it is poised to move up to Rs 300,” said Gupta.


PROCTER & GAMBLE HYGIENE & HEALTH CARE
The exemption of sanitary napkin from GST is positive for P&G Healthcare & Hygiene. A technical analyst with a domestic brokerage said the trend in the stock is positive and it can go up to Rs 11,350-11,700 if the stock surpasses the hurdle of Rs 11,000."

94,2018-07-25,Asian Paints,"Harendra Kumar, Managing Director - Head – Institutional Equities & Global Research, Elara Capital, says cement stocks are undervalued and 
  
  
  stocks like Heidelberg Cement and Prism Johnson are available at cheaper valuations.Edited excerpts: 


Asian Paints results have met street estimates and for the quarter gone by, domestic sales volumes have been higher than anticipated. The stock had run up about 24.5% in recent times. How much further can it go?
What good numbers do is that they eliminate any selling at least for the subsequent quarter. That means the trajectory of the stock remains unchanged. If there is any correction, fresh buying will emerge on the back of this results as well. Overall, the consumption pack have been demonstrating phenomenal numbers plus the GST cut impetus is going to play on the sentiment of this space. 

There are no hiccups on consumption -- be it an HUL, a Godrej Consumer or for that matter the paint stocks. You have to stay long, buy into the high PEs and they will get only higher.


An easy option is to avoid Asian Paints and HUL because they are expensive. You can’t make money on 70 PE stocks. But that logic is not stopping anybody from buying it fresh. Do you think the polarised nature of the market will continue and Asian Paints and HUL and Jubilant Foodworks will continue to compound?
Yes, there are two trades. HUL has been doing well over the last six to nine months after GST. That trend will continue because there is a structural bias. You do not see that changing any time now but the market character is changing. 

The NITI Aayog chairman has said that rupee weakening will continue. So, tech sector will continue to do well. Both consumption and tech are under owned. In consumption, even though the PEs are high, they are under owned by the domestic investors. In fact, it is the only largely FII story. When chasing starts, this could take the stocks higher.

While the fundamental story is intact, one has to mean that this is under owned. When you are chasing benchmark returns, it pushes the stock price high. On both accounts, both are very attractive.


We are going to eye the four-wheeler numbers as well. How are you looking at trends picking up in the auto and the auto ancillary space?
The auto pack has delivered spectacular returns but since the beginning of this year you have seen a all stocks other than Maruti cracking. There were vulnerabilities even in Motherson Sumi. It started with the trade war and the currency impacting some of the ancillary stocks. Now it is percolating to the margins story in some of the domestic players. 

Volumes are robust but the market is pricing in margin concerns at the moment. Margin concerns typically work on PE numbers. The correction is underway. Actually, more a reset of the value is underway. Some of the stocks will reach the value zone sooner and up there in the pecking order is Hero and potentially a TVS which has corrected significantly. But we would not wade into Bajaj Auto at the moment.


Are you impressed by anything from the new issuances?
HDFC AMC is fundamentally a long-term structural story. The anchor investors’ character will tell you what they are buying into. Financialisation of the Indian saving story is currently underway. I do not think the valuations today are in anyway expensive. 

One has to take a view of five years down the line. So, it is a compounder. It has demonstrated over cycles that it can grow assets. The industry is getting consolidated. given the selling and buyouts by some of the larger ones. Since top four or five companies are dominating this industry, the valuations can go upwards. Fundamentally, it is an attractive asset to own in terms of your portfolio.


Give one investment idea from the midcap space. By a midcap name I mean a company which has a market cap or $2-3 billion?
The cement stocks are undervalued and you see good prospect for the next three years. There is Heidelberg Cement, Prism Johnson which trading at a cheap valuation. Good results are expected and we expect them to become doublers from here.

In aviation, we are very choosy. We like Spicejet but I would wait for results because this is the first quarter after the volatility in crude. But it could give you enough signs because the headwinds are over in terms of the arbitration that they were undergoing with Sun TV. The structural opportunity is very strong.

There is something like a Vijaya Bank which is giving a very good outlook for the next two years. Some names that are robust are coming at prices that could be attractive for value investors."

100,2018-07-26,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: Over the past 12 years, Asian Paints has managed to upend the traditional maxim that rising crude oil prices often smudged the operating performance at paintmakers. Recent earnings at India’s paints leader gives further confirmation of just the opposite: that there is a strong positive correlation between rising oil prices and operating margins at the company.

In its latest quarterly results, Asian Paints surprised the Street again with double-digit volume growth for the second consecutive quarter and higher margins. With recovery in demand and lower GST, the future appears more colourful for the largest paints company in India.

For the June quarter, revenues increased 15 per cent to Rs 4,390 crore, driven by 13 per cent volume growth in the domestic business and a total price increase of 3.3 per cent in the last two quarters. On the margin front too, the company surprised the Street — gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 43.2 per cent despite inflation in the raw material prices (crude prices up by 40 per cent) and a 250-basis points jump in EBIDTA margins to 19.9 per cent. Net profit stood at Rs 571 crore, up 30 per cent year on year, much ahead of expectations.

Trends are positive across segments — decorative and industrial. In the post-earnings call with analysts, the management said that the pace of volume recovery continues to improve and lower GST will result in higher demand for the organized players.



GST rates have now been reduced from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. While the benefit of tax will have to be passed on due to strict anti-profiteering laws, the company will continue to see higher margins from operating leverage.

In the June quarter, the EBIDTA margins expanded much more than gross margins (margins before overhead and other expenses), thanks to lower overhead costs. Capacity utilization is at little over 75per cent and higher volumes will help.

The company’s overseas business was affected due to lack of currency/ forex availability in Ethiopia and macro factors in other markets such as Egypt, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. However, that did not weaken the overall results given that the overseas business accounts for nearly 12 per cent of total sales.

All the fundamentals point at a strong year for Asian Paints. Although the stock has run up 15 per cent in the last one month and trades at an expensive valuation of 57 times estimated FY19 and 50 times estimated FY20 earnings, there is still some steam left in the stock. Almost all analysts tracking the company have raised their target prices by 10-15per cent. On Wednesday, the stock closed at Rs 1,450."

  Edited excerpts: 


Markets are at an all-time high but no one is feeling excited largely because mid and smallcap stocks are not leaving too many people satisfied with the market action even though Nifty is at a record high?
Yes, this is the paradox of the market. People who have invested in mutual funds are reasonably content as majority of mutual funds holding is in largecaps. There are many retail direct investors who have invested in small and midcap stocks, based on the momentum of small and midcap stocks delivering returns earlier. Of course, they are not happy. At the end of the day, this is a market of stock selectors. You have to bear the volatility. The way largecap indices have scaled all time high levels, at some point in future, the midcap and smallcap indices also will scale all time high levels, driven by quality midcaps and not necessarily momentum midcaps.


If you look at the list of stocks that have really helped the markets higher in this journey over the last six months, you see a major chunk of financials, a bit of IT. TCS has held out, Infosys has gained about 14%. Then we have HUL, Asian Paints representing the consumption story. Has it really been about financials all the way?
There is a whatsapp forward which is going on which says that it is the HRITHIK stocks which have pulled the Nifty up. That includes HDFC, RIL, Infy, TCS, HUL, Indusind and Kotak. Then there were someone else who put a another whatsapp on that, saying yes HRITHIK stocks have gone up but there are also ROSHAN (RCOM, ONGC, Suzlon, HCC, Aban, NTPC) stocks that have not gone up. 

The market is made up of different stocks. Sometimes it could be HRITHIK, sometimes it could be ROSHAN but at the end of the day, largecap stocks have scaled heights because they are quality companies. In the midcap space, we will see the quality midcaps come back at some point of time, not necessarily near term, cross their all-time highs. But for ROSHAN stocks, there could be problem."

  Edited excerpts: 

Just when it appeared that earnings season will not be on expected lines, there is a sliver of hope because cement sales are looking strong. Canara Bank numbers are strong, commentary from ITC is not bad, and L&T also is reasonably confident of a bounce back in their hydrocarbon business. Are we at that big turn in earning season because nobody is using words like uncertainty and low capacity utilisation?
Overall what we are seeing is that the stocks which everyone loved actually and where the expectations were very high, there the earnings were not up to that much of expectations. In other cases, where the expectations were low like L&T and Canara Bank, the numbers are looking much better than what they actually could be.

The other part of the equation is compared to last year, we are also seeing a strengthening in the economy. There is a clear bounce-back in the economy from last year. It is already visible and it also has to do with the base effect. Last year, the basis was impacted quite widely because of DeMon, GST etc. Also, this is an election year a lot of expenditure are going on the infra side. 

So there is a definitive bounce back and buoyancy in the economy compared to what we saw last year.


Consumption numbers so far have managed to stick to the script. Double-digit volume growth is seen from some of the big guys like HUL and Asian Paints, but all of them seem to have rallied significantly. Asian Paints even after delivering those strong numbers had actually fallen the next day. Do you think all of this strong performance is already in the price?
I would agree to a big extent here. We were also expecting consumption to be driving growth and that is what is happening. But that is what the stocks were also expecting and that is where the stocks also moved quite sharply to valuations which are not sustainable. If the EPS growth is not commensurate with valuations as we saw yesterday after Maruti results. 

The results per se were really good but given the expectations that the company will show 50% EBITDA growth, a 44% EBITDA growth was supposed to be a negative surprise. So, the valuations have become very demanding in the entire consumption space. This was one of our favoured areas from the beginning of the year but the valuations increase have been a bit of disappointment and there could be a sell-off because of very demanding valuation.


Yesterday there were a lot of queries on Yes Bank’s numbers. While the numbers look good optically, the stock has also priced in large part of the growth. Where does the story go from here?
This was another company where the expectation build-up was very high. The stock rallied just before the results. The stock has moved up almost 20-25% and on a regular basis my trading team used to ask me that what is going on? Are they going to report some 50% growth or something like that? 

Despite good growth that was visible, there was some disappointment in net interest margin and the sort of numbers. The market had been thinking that this was going to be an extremely good quarter with net interest margins also increasing. That caused disappointment but I would say that results were not as disappointing as the markets think.

We do not think there is anything to worry about on the company or on the stock also as of now.


Give me your top idea or top two-three ideas from the midcap space which has a margin of safety for a long-term investor?
From the midcap and smallcap side, one is from the auto space -- Motherson Sumi -- where we have been bullish. The stock has corrected quite significantly from its top. We expect that from here on, we are going to see more than 20% EPS growth in this company. They have been an acquisitive company and there could be some further value accretion. 

The other midcap we like is Tejas Network which has done really poorly over last almost one year and that is mainly because of their miss on earnings. We have been highlighting that this is a company where we believe on the digital story but given their orders are wholesale, it tends to be sort of lumpy in some quarters.

Over a two-three year period, we are expecting more than 25-26% growth in income. The stock is now no more on a demanding valuation, given the sort of fall in the stock price. Finally from insurance side, there is Max Financial which has also not done well and has been sort of falling in the recent midcap fall. If you look at the company, it has performed really wel. It is one of the top performers in the life insurance space, its margins are improving, new business numbers are improving. The quality of business is improving and on an overall basis our expectation is that the return on embedded value could be more than 20% here.

These are the three top ideas we have on the mid and small cap space."
108,2018-07-30,Asian Paints,"The government’s decision to slash rates of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on a wide range of consumer goods is being cheered by analysts. Tax rates were cut from 28% to 18% across items, including consumer durables like washing machines, television sets, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators, apart from sharp cuts in smaller items like footwear, paints, leather products and textiles. This is expected to spur demand and give a fillip to the consumption theme.

Of the 50-odd items that are under the highest tax slab of 28%, 19 will see a cut in taxes. Tax rates on select items from other slabs of 18% and 12% have also been lowered. Analysts say this cut will be passed on to consumers through slashed prices in the range of 8-12%. With the festive season around the corner, lower prices of more than 50 items will allow companies to boost volumes, giving a push to the discretionary consumption theme that has been a prominent play in the market for the past few years.

“The broader implication of the changes is that, along with other reflationary fiscal measures taken, they will boost our overweight stance on the consumption theme. One can expect this reduction in GST rates to create a positive consumer and household sentiment ahead of state elections,” says Dhananjay Sinha, Head of Research, Economist & Strategist, Emkay Global Financial Services. “The cut in tax rates will expand the market with certain households that held back discretionary spend coming into the fold,” adds Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.


Consumer discretionary stocks are likely to benefit the most

Investors will have to bet selectively on stocks that are relatively cheaper.
 
Source: ETIG Database/Bloomberg. Compiled by ETIG Database. Data as on 24 July.

The consumption theme gained prominence 3-4 years ago in the midst of a benign interest rate environment that allowed for low-cost borrowing for purchase of consumer durables. It benefitted from a rise in disposable income following implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission and, more recently, higher rural consumption supported by strong monsoon in the past two years. However, consumption growth hit a bump last year after demonetisation and rollout of the GST regime that initially led to supply channel disruptions.

Demand has since recovered in most pockets and is on track to revert to earlier growth rates. “A pick-up in consumption from a low base was on the anvil, irrespective of any tax cuts. The relaxation in GST rates on select items will help further,” says Anand Shah, Deputy CEO and Head of Investments, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund.

Already, the GST rate cut has triggered a rally in stocks of companies manufacturing consumer electronics, footwear and paints. Stocks of Bata India, Relaxo Footwear and Khadim’s are in focus after the move to cut tax on footwear priced at Rs 500-1,000 to 5% from the earlier 18%. However, Gupta feels the tax cut will not materially move the needle for smaller-ticket items like footwear and leather goods. These are non-discretionary in nature and are not likely to see a big spurt in volumes purely on account of lower prices. 

He is more positive on the prospects of durables where even a 8-10% cut in prices will lead to a better off-take. “There is a possibility of trading up in certain white goods, which will lead to a pick-up in sales volume,” says Gupta. Companies like Bajaj Electricals, Crompton Consumer, Whirlpool of India, Havells India and IFB Industries will benefit from higher volumes. 

Analysts feel there is more room for upside in shares of consumer discretionary companies, whereas the growth is priced in for consumer non-discretionary stocks. Paint makers will also see a boost in volumes after the reduction in tax rate, say analysts. Kansai Nerolac and Akzo Nobel shares are relatively cheaper than Asian Paints.

While investors may find reason to continue to favour consumer stocks, they will have to be mindful about overplaying this theme. They will need to be more selective and identify sub-segments within the broader consumption space that provide more room for growth. Much of the consumption play is also represented in the high pace of growth in NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Edelweiss Finance, among others. 

Over the past few years, these lenders have grown their loan books manifold by tapping into the demand for low-ticket consumer durables. Gupta feels there is overcrowding in NBFC stocks and suggests that the frenetic pace of loan book growth could put stress on asset quality in the future."

114,2018-07-31,Asian Paints,"Huge growth ahead in consumer space and within that in FMCG space, Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBI Cap Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Can Dabur continue to beat itself or is this quarter’s results a one- off? If they are reporting volume growth of 21% in Q1, which has surpassed their 
  
  
  own expectations, what does one pencil in for the remaining three quarters?
Basically, in consumer space and within that in the FMCG space, there is huge growth ahead. That can be partly seen because rural incomes are getting better. We have a normal monsoon although the spatial distribution is not so great. There is a situation where a lot of GST rates have been moderated. 

Some of this is applicable for consumer durables but that is translating into a consumption boost which will continue to have momentum for two-three quarters more. While the growth rate in terms of volumes that we have seen from the likes of Levers, Daburs and Asian Paints have been in double digits, those double digit growth numbers will moderate because the base effect will catch up. The numbers, nevertheless will be strong. 

In an FMCG company, one has volume growth plus the pricing advantage and then comes the premiumisation effect. All three combined would drive growth on the top line and that growth will be in double digits.


Harley is now eyeing Royale Enfield’s turf. Although CLSA believes that they may not quite harm Royal Enfield’s market share and may not really target a very large market size, I guess pricing is the key. Could this escalate into a deeper problem for Eicher?
No not really. There is a separate niche that Eicher enjoys in the bike space in the light-weight categories. Harley while it is graduating from the heavy weights to middle weights and then the light-weights now, is not really going to affect Eicher in a big way because distribution is the key for such bikes. 

While the product is great, if you do not have great distribution network, your ability to generate sales is limited which is what Eicher has been targeting over the years. Now they have been expanding their distribution reach and they are becoming quite strong now. They were earlier the south-based distribution reach company. Now they have a well established distribution base. Overall, Eicher should not be worried about Harley coming into India in the light-weight category.


What do you make of Bajaj Auto? Are they doing the right thing by coming out in the open and saying that we will do whatever it takes to regain market share? They have become number four. I can sense the desperation in the management. But will the bid to regain market share come at a price? Is the stock pricing in a margin erosion and a price war?
Let me split your question into three parts. One is the strategy that is being employed by Bajaj Auto. It is in the right direction because you have to necessarily react to market pressures. The two-wheeler space is competitive and you cannot just stand by the way side. 

The second part of your question was will this really affect the company in terms of its margins and thereof? While the company has guided that they will not have 20% kind of margins for the next two or three years, I tend to believe that there are enough margins levers available with Bajaj Auto because of its diversified nature of business that can eventually take it to 20% margin.

The third part of your question is whether the stock price is reflecting all this. I would say no. The stock price is not reflecting the potential that Bajaj Auto has in terms of growth ahead. It is fairly cheap at this juncture relative to the peers and relative to the broader market as well for the kind of return ratios, balance sheet strength and the kind of management quality they possess.


Can Bank, Bank of Baroda have come out with excellent set of numbers. The PSU banks doing pretty well for themselves. But with Bank of India numbers, again all the factors which were looking positive for the space have turned bit negative. Should one be stock specific in PSU space?
We continue to like the PSU space as a whole but then you have to be very stock specific even within that space because RBI is intervening and there are lots of banks under prompt corrective action. That means there will be a period of virtually no growth for those companies and for investors those are not the companies to look at. That leaves the other set of PSU banks which appear quite promising because now the NPA worries are going to be over. 

Also, it is not about NPA issue alone, it is about growth as well. Unless and until you have strong capital, you really cannot grow and therefore you cannot arrest the slide. For us, there are three or four PSU banks that we like -- Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank, Indian Bank and Can Bank seems to be coming into our radar right now. That space is generally good. The moment any bank comes out of the prompt corrective action, that would be something one should be watching out for."

7,2018-08-04,Asian Paints,"There is a generational transformation underway at many of India’s marquee industrial houses. Founded in the late 1960s and 1970s, they grew with India, and are now readying the ground for the next generation of the family to take the reins.

At the $13 billion core sector conglomerate JSW Group, led by Sajjan Jindal, this script is now playing out. In the hot seat is 28-year-old Parth Jindal, an alumnus of Brown University and Harvard Business School.

Sajjan Jindal is the son of Jindal group patriarch OP Jindal.

The burden of expectations is inevitable. His father Sajjan Jindal took the reins of a small steel plant on the outskirts of Mumbai in 1984, with revenues of Rs 9 crore, and grew it in three decades into an operation that overtook the century-old Indian steel business of Tata Steel, in volumes.




But steel is not where the younger Jindal is expected to play. He is expected to build his own turf, in areas with little presence of the group — cement, paint and sports.

When we arrive at the group headquarters in Mumbai, Parth Jindal has just returned by chopper from the company’s steel plant in Dolvi in Raigad district. He meets us looking fresh from a quick shower in office, wearing an air of nonchalance.


Sports Track
Jindal says he is determined to build India’s first publicly traded sports company. He wants a listing on the bourses by 2025. JSW Sports includes team franchises in cricket, football and kabaddi. The expectation is that in another seven years, the perception about the worth of a sports franchise among investors will change for the better.


For instance, the Dallas Cowboys, an NFL franchise in the United States, is valued at over $4 billion. European soccer franchises such as Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona, are also multi-billion dollar businesses. “My dream is to create India’s first IPO for a sports company. India currently is behind the curve. But sports as a business is fast gaining traction,” he says.

In March, JSW Sports acquired a 50% equity stake in the Delhi Daredevils franchise of the Indian Premier League. Jindal is bullish about its prospects. Firstly, it is very hard to break into the IPL owners’ league because new teams are unlikely and existing owners are wealthy individuals who have no reason to sell.

So when the opportunity to buy a stake in the Delhi franchise came along, it wasn’t a difficult decision to make.

With the new television broadcast deal and the earnings that accrued to each IPL team, Jindal says all the eight IPL teams are now profitable. His Delhi Daredevils finished eighth in the IPL this year out of eight teams, but will still be profitable, he claimed. Each team is poised to make an excess of Rs 150 crore in profits, he says.

Other sports such as kabaddi and football need more time to grow. The company owns the Pro Kabbadi League franchise Haryana Steelers and the ILeague football club Bengaluru FC.

The break-even point in kabbadi, Jindal says, would come in the next three years. Football is a longer-term play and could take anywhere from five to seven years to break even, he says.

“The money in sports is only going to grow. You can see where the new deals are happening. Cable TV is only going to survive for two things — live news and live sports. Everything else is moving to platforms like Netflix, Jio TV and Amazon Prime. There’s going to be nobody watching cable TV for any other reason,” he reasons. 

While sports is a glamorous business to be in, he’s also been tasked with building two dust-and-grime businesses from scratch — cement and decorative paints. The target date for a roll-out of its paints business is set for the year-end.

JSW Group has built a fortune serving or selling to other businesses in steel, energy and ports. Cement and paints, however, are consumer-facing businesses, with an altogether different set of challenges.

From a standing start in 2009, JSW Cement has ramped up to become a 12.5 million tonne business. And in two years, it will see a further expansion to 20 MT. The company makes three varieties of cement from slag, a byproduct of the steel-making process.

Jindal says in two years the cement business will achieve sufficient scale (20 MT) for an IPO. He wants it to have a capacity of 50 million tonnes eventually. A lot of the growth would have to come from acquisitions. The group has been eyeing assets to buy.

“We looked at several acquisition opportunities. At one point we were considering Lafarge Cement very seriously,” Jindal said.



On Your Own Dime
Being part of a $13 billion conglomerate must make financing a new business easy, right? Wrong.

While the group under Sajjan Jindal has decided on diversification into allied sectors, the group’s stated policy is that diversification into newer businesses will pay for itself to further grow the business. Thus the steel business, which brings in some 90% of the group’s revenues, will not divert funds from its revenue streams to fund other businesses.

“We don’t discuss allocation of capital at the group level, we allow each business to organically or inorganically grow on their own strength,” Jindal says.

But when Lafarge was on the selling block, the proposition to scale up the cement business fast was a rare opportunity and the group was prepared to make an exception. But it proved unnecessary, as the deal didn’t happen.

One cement sector analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said recent steps have indicated the group is serious about the cement business. “Two things that the company has done — buying Shiva Cement for its limestone and setting up a clinker facility in Fujairah in UAE — bode well for the company’s IPO plans. Had it not been for these two steps, I would have written them off,” he added.


War Paint
JSW’s diversification into paint has raised eyebrows. India’s paints market is dominated by four large, entrenched players. “For a company like JSW Paints to penetrate the paints market, it will have to overcome the entry barrier put up at the distribution level,” says an analyst tracking the paints industry. He said that at the distribution level, shop shelves don’t have room for a new brand to come in. “In the past, companies like the Japanese brand Nippon Paints and American brand Sherwin-Williams tried to enter the market but without any success,” says the analyst.

Jindal is unfazed.

“There is so much opportunity in this country that it amazes me. I had the same thoughts that you harbour — how will I take on an Asian Paints or Berger for instance,” Jindal says.

He mentions his father’s predicament when he started out building an integrated steel plant. “I’m sure my father thought too when he started on his entrepreneurial journey whether he can take on Tata Steel… When a market is growing so fast, there’s always space for a new entrant to come in. That’s my fundamental belief.”





His reasoning is simple. The paint industry is growing at an attractive pace. As incumbents get bigger and bigger, there are opportunities for a new player to enter, he reasons. Because he believes, the bigger players may find it difficult to react to market challenges because they’re too big now.

There’s also a trump card. Unlike, Asian Paints or a Berger Paints, he says JSW Group can offer its dealer a steel franchise, and another branch of the same dealer a cement franchise or a paints dealership.

Mahesh Singhi, founder and managing director at Singhi Advisors, a transaction advisory firm, sees merit in the JSW gameplan to be a “complete building solutions provider”.

“The market for paints is expanding. There is room for new players to grow,” Singhi said. The idea is that a customer buying steel rods to build a house is also a potential buyer for cement and paints.

Jindal’s unique selling proposition is going to be water-based paints, which are environmentally friendlier than solvent-based paint products.

“Also the (dealer) channel of established paint companies fear, the guy hundred metres away is also competing against him by offering the same paint product. JSW Paints can offer an alternative,” he reasons.


Family Bond
Those who are watching the grooming of the Jindal scion say Parth Jindal’s confidence to take on big players such as Asian Paints or Birla Group’s Ultratech Cement stems partly from the close guidance he is receiving from his father and the JSW top brass.

With the schedules that come with globe-spanning businesses, how does the family find time to spend together?

Whenever they are at home, they work out together and meet for breakfast after. As a kid, he used to see his father work out. He recalls when he was homesick at school in the UK, his father’s advice was to go outdoors and take part in sports. You’ll make friends, his father said. It worked.

“As a family, we are quite passionate about sports and working out. It’s a good way of being mentally agile and staying sharp,” he says.

These days, he beats his father in a game of squash."
8,2018-08-06,Asian Paints,"The current earnings season has proved that some of the fears that we saw in the selloff in January were untrue, Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG 
   
   AMC, tells ET Now. Reliance, TCS and HDFC have taken the Nifty to new highs.Edited excerpts: 


Look at what Reliance, TCS, HUL and for that matter even Bajaj Finance has given this year.
Looking at a couple of things here. One, if you look at Nifty, majority of the earnings has come from three stocks -- Reliance, TCS and HDFC. Many of the Nifty names are also trading at 52-weeks low. While the index seems to be at a higher level, it is contributed by only three or four stocks. Against this backdrop, the index is overheated but just the three stocks have taken it up. The current earnings season has proved that some of the fears that we saw in the selloff in January were untrue because the Nifty or nearly 70% companies have beat earnings and 20% have missed the earnings. In this backdrop, the fact that earnings are coming back will provide some kind of a back bone to the market.


Could Tata Motors ever turn out to be a hopeful story? Going by the commentary from Chandra at the AGM, they are looking at cost appropriate options for Nano. However, the official announcement which the market was anticipating that it is going to close down Nano production lock stock and barrel, did not come by. He is saying that there are headwinds because of currency, because of the impending Brexit for JLR, however, he is extremely hopeful and buoyant about the CV recovery in the domestic business.
Yes indeed. I guess Nano was a lost story quite some time ago. What is driving is JLR and JLR has facing problems from Brexit as well as currency trouble and of course they are still a highly indebted company. Against this backdrop, the CV cycles will recover but at the end of the day, Tata Motors valuations is still derived from the JLR bit. The CV cycle in India is improving. I do not think the stock is oversold at current levels. It is unlikely to see any meaningful recovery. The fact that the stock is down a lot means we might even see a trading bounce. It is too early to get into because Brexit is still more than a year away with no deal in sight. Investors in the UK are being cautious. Against this backdrop, I would continue to stay away from Tata Motors.


What do you expect to hear from paint companies? Berger was a strong set but the uptick in crude prices may actually hit them, a quarter or two from now. Do you think any increase in cost is passed on to consumers and in that sense, it is a neutral event.
Costs are passed on to the consumers and second, Asian Paints as well Kansai have shown some amount of discipline. Against this backdrop, we are also going in to the festive season starting a couple of months from now which is usually an important quarter for these companies. I would continue to hold these stocks and would buy some of these stocks especially Berger or Kansai. Asian Paints also looks okay and the cost inputs are something which will be passed on as they have been in the recent quarters.


If the market premium is anything to go by, HDFC AMC is in for a cracker of a listing. Till what price point you would be happy to buy it. I mean forget about a gap up start, there is going to be a mega start for HDFC AMC but at what price you would say look I will buy the stock and I can still make 10% in next six months?
It all depends on where it opens and sustains today. While everybody is expecting a very strong opening today, if it goes up 30-40% today, then I would wait for some time because it is a large listing. There is going to be liquidity and it is bound to come back to more reasonable valuations. The valuation is reasonable but post the run-up, I would wait."

41,2018-08-14,Asian Paints,"A falling rupee may not spell good tidings for the Indian economy, but it can benefit exporters that may fetch you decent returns on Dalal Street. 

The local currency has been in a hole for some time now as it went past the 70-mark for the first time ever on Tuesday. 

A weakness in the rupee could support top line of domestic pharma players with a substantial bottom line from exports. However, they have not shown any traction so far this year. 

Information technology firms, which have huge overseas clients, can be the other biggest beneficiary from a tumbling rupee. The sector has already outpaced broader market in 2018. 

On Tuesday, the Nifty pharma index was up 3 per cent while the Nifty IT index rose 1 per cent even as NSE benchmark notched up around 70 points.

The Nifty IT index has rallied nearly 30 per cent so far this calendar whereas the rupee tumbled 10 per cent on a year-to-date basis till August 13. The Nifty Pharma index slipped over 4 per cent during the same period. 

From investing point of view, Chakri Lokapriya, CIO and MD, TCG AMC, told ETNow, “IT and exporters will continue to do well both for fundamental reasons and the rupee rate. Currency analysts have forecast rupee at Rs 70 plus over the coming year or so... IT is still not an overheated trade. There are still lots of money to be made out there and so are the other export-related sectors.”

The key trigger for the rupee’s fall is coming from the selloff in Turkish lira, which in turn, contributed to the overall emerging market weakness. 

Saurabh Mukherjea, founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, recently said, “I have been saying for the past 8 months that buying leading IT services, pharma and chemical exporters makes sense as does unearthing smaller companies who have credible export franchises.”

The Nifty IT index was trading up by over 1 per cent today while the Nifty Pharma was marginally in the red at around 11.30 am.

For investors, Sharekhan is bullish on Cadila Healthcare with a target price of Rs 450 in the pharma space. Nirmal Bang is positive on Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of Rs 764. 

Elara Capital recommended IPCA Labs with a target price of Rs 860. It's also bullish on NIIT with a target price of Rs 138. 

“NIIT has transformed its revenue profile from an India-centric, retail-oriented IT training business to an exports-oriented, asset-light B2B training outsourcing business over FY10-18,” Elara said in a report.

On a year-to-date basis, IT majors including Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies, surged 51 per cent, 36 per cent and 11.55 per cent, respectively, till August 13. Similarly, Mindtree and KPIT zoomed 62 per cent and 59 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

According to Phillip Capital, risk aversion and rising volatility led to the market moving towards tried-and-tested defensive plays such as TCS, Infosys, HUL, HDFC, and Asian Paints. This is also a typical election-year phenomenon -- seen in the last two elections -- given the comfort for large-cap defensive plays.

On the other hand, Biocon, Cipla and Divi’s Labs advanced 2-7 per cent YTD, whereas Cadila Healthcare, Aurobindo Pharma, Lupin and Dr Reddy’s Labs came off by up to 18 per cent in the pharma space.

Sanjeev Prasad, Senior Executive Director and co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities, told ET Now: “You have to look at every stock, not just depend on some programmed trade. You have to look at everything on the bottom and based on that see whether the price value creation makes sense or not. This holds across every sector, every stock. I am not running a programme which says if macro is bad, just go and buy some IT and pharma; macro is good, buy corporate banks or metal and mining stocks.”"

Nifty has more scientists, doctors, engineers now, than it did 20 years back.”

On the other hand, Tata Motors, Vedanta, HPCL, Bharti Airtel and UPL slipped up to 38 per cent between January 23 and August 17.

The BSE Sensex also hit a fresh record high of 38,266 in early trade on Monday. Gains in capital goods, metals, realty and banking stocks amid firm Asian cues aided the market. 

From a valuation perspective, analysts are not too comfortable with the current level of the market.

Even though the Sensex typically trades at a premium to its peers, it is currently trading at a higher-than-normal premium relative to its emerging market (EM) peers. For instance, from a five-year average perspective, India typically traded at a premium of 18 per cent to the median P/E of nine emerging markets. However, today India trades at a whopping 37 per cent premium to median P/E of EMS, Ambit Capital said in its recent report.

The 30-share index currently trades at a 21 per cent premium to its 10-year average P/E ratio, Ambit said.

The recent rally in the stock market has more support from domestic flows than FIIs. On a year-to-date basis, foreign portfolio investors have taken out some Rs 1300 crore, while domestic institutional investors have poured in more than Rs 68,300 crore.

“Many emerging markets, maybe not so much in India, are under severe distress. I’m talking about some very high-growth economies, like those in Eastern Europe. And we have economies like Poland, which are doing well. Yet, these stock markets relative to the US are at multi-decade lows. Liquidity in markets like the Philippines and Indonesia has completely dried up. India has been fortunate that it has had a domestic investor base, which has kept the market humming,” New York-based investor and author Ruchir Sharma told ET in an interview."

  Edited excerpts:


Do you believe there is merit in buying into L&T? Is the first-time ever buyback justified? Do you think this is going to be a sizable quantum and would get absorbed?
The buyback is a tool to distribute the cash back to investors and that is where you end up doing the financial engineering in the books. You end up suggesting better return on capital employed ratio eventually to the investors. 

If that is the case, buyback is a helpful tool in the hands of the company and also the investors. However, I have not examined it from this particular viewpoint for L&T. What I believe as far as L&T’s business is concerned is that this is probably the best of times for them. 

The order books are basically showing the visibility of at least three years now and as a result, in every subsequent quarters, you should be seeing better performance coming from L&T, including many of the capital good segment players.

We are likely to see better performance going forward. We remain relatively more positive on the capital goods segment as a whole. Companies like L&T, ABB, Siemens remain among the short-listed companies where we believe that the fundamentals will support the higher amount of growth momentum.


What is happening in the steel space? Tata Steel is almost at Rs 600. Analysts like Hemang Jani are also sounding quite bullish on that. Should one buy into Indian steel companies irrespective of all the trade issues and growth challenges?
The issues pertaining to metal companies are right now helping them in a way. On one side, a country like China is getting out of the outdated old steel manufacturing facilities and more production is happening through the electric car route which means that the prices input cost is going up.

At the same time, the commodity prices would be stronger from here. The global demand for steel has stabilised and is likely to grow though in a muted single digit manner. 

The India demand scenario remains extremely bullish. As we understand, most of the rolling mills do not have even the stock in their godowns to sell. Basically, that is a presold kind of a situation that they are enjoying currently in many cases.

From that point of view, we are in the best of the times as far as business is concerned. Commodity prices are steady. Obviously, that is an advantage. On one side, the demand scenario remains buoyant and on the other, commodity prices are remaining strong.

Obviously, the companies are likely to produce better performance including the management of Tata Steel. If you go through the commentary, they have basically charted out the plan to beat the cyclical nature of the business in some way.

We will have to wait and see how exactly it will come out but the fact is the company’s managements are preparing themselves to beat the cyclical nature of the business.

That is where you feel more confident that going forward, the business of the companies could probably fare better than what we have seen. That is the reason for which I believe one should remain relatively more confident. I do not know about the price. At this point of time, I believe that in case of a market correction, they offer good opportunity to buy.


What are your thoughts on Asian Paints?
 Business condition-wise, they are relatively better placed. The input cost increase is a challenge but in a good economy, you pass on the input cost and that is where I think the company is favourably placed. 

Though I do not expect a very sharp jump in the business, I believe that the company’s business eventually remains robust. Their expanded capacities could possibly add to the volume led growth going forward in coming years.

That is the positive view. The stock is trading at a relatively higher valuation but that is the case for most of the paint companies including Kansai Nerolac.

I believe that investors were looking at a horizon of beyond two years and they should be looking at this particular company from investment point of view. Otherwise, the best time to buy would be a corrective downside in the market. Overall, business condition remains positive.


What is your best idea in trade this morning? Where are you happy to allocate 5%, 7%, or 8% of your current portfolio? And don’t say Reliance.
We have been liking some of the pharma companies and auto companies. I will give two ideas in each basket. In auto, I like Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland and in the pharma basket we continue to like Sun Pharma and we have added Glenmark. 

We like these companies largely because in pharma space, these two companies have shown that they are likely to launch some of the speciality products going forward in the US markets. That is where we are seeing a higher amount of revenue and visibility coming into play with better margins.

We like these two companies from investment perspective. We are fully aware that Sun Pharma has rallied in the recent past but I would think that the market gives correction opportunities and at that time it would be the best to accumulate further into the portfolio."
44,2018-08-22,Asian Paints,"Nirmal Bang Securities has a buy call on Mold-Tek Packaging with a target price of Rs 450.

The current market price of Mold-Tek Packaging is Rs 298.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Mold-Tek Packaging price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage:

Robust growth expectations from India business: The management reiterated its guidance of 15 per cent volume growth for FY19 and more than 20 per cent for the next couple of years in respect of India business. Over the next five to seven years, MTEP aims to achieve Rs 10,000mn in revenues led by strong growth across segments. Both the new dedicated facilities for Asian Paints (Mysore and Vizag) aggregating to 6,000tn will start contributing meaningfully to revenues from FY20 onwards wherein 50 per cent capacity utilisation is expected. The response from Asian Paints has been better than expectations as MTEP has already received orders which are being executed from existing facilities till the time new plants come on board. We believe that 50 per cent capacity utilisation will contribute to around 10 per cent of incremental volume growth. Asian Paints has shifted to Heat Transfer Labelling (HTL) which enjoys a similar margin as that of IML and hence it will not be margin-dilutive. Lubricant division’s performance is expected to be muted. Robust growth of Food & FMCG (F&F) segment will continue with new orders and an extremely encouraging response for generic containers and Q-packs for ice-cream, edible oil and ghee containers. The tool room is running short of capacity due to robust demand and therefore currently 25 per cent-30 per cent of the generic moulds have been outsourced. It was discussed that MTEP is going to expand the capacity for F&F in Hyderabad and also new plant dedicated for F&F would be set up in 2HFY20.Capex guidance for FY19 has been given as Rs.520mn and around Rs.300mn-Rs350mn in the next few years.


Improved performance likely from RAK unit from 2HFY19: On the RAK facility of 3,000tn, it was informed that the delay in achieving break-even was because of cancellation of one of the orders from Iran, lower-than-expected response for paint and lubricant divisions and overall economic slowdown in the Middle East. However demand for F&F has been very strong and MTEP has shifted its core focus on the F&F segment at its RAK plant wherein some of the machinery and related equipment have been relocated there. Currently, the facility is operating at 35 per cent of its capacity whereas the plant will achieve breakeven at 50 per cent utilisation. The management indicated that MTEP is in the process of achieving a big order from a FMCG company which can take the capacity utilisation of RAK plant to 70 per cent-75 per cent directly.


Rising IML share will increase operating margin: MTEP has cost-plus contracts with all clients and hence it does not bear the risk of raw material inflation. Also, with the new capacities coming on board, the product mix of the company is going to change in the medium term. Asian Paints - for the new capacity - has shifted to Heat Transfer Labelling (HTL) which enjoys margin similar to that of the IML segment and hence will not be margin-dilutive. Also, a rising share of F&F will continue to improve the share of IML and hence will uplift the margin profile of the company. The share of IML in volume terms in FY18 stood at 52 per cent and the same in value terms was 58 per cent. The same in FY17 was 47 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. We expect blended EBITDA/kg to improve from Rs33 in FY18 to Rs38 by FY20E. Also, as currently the RAK division is incurring losses, it is expected to achieve breakeven in the current financial year. Hence, from next year onwards, blended margins will improve further to that extent.


Outlook and valuation: Considering the strong demand outlook and capacity expansion plan, we continue to remain bullish on the long-term structural story of MTEP. It is on track to become a decent-sized F&F IML packaging player and we believe that there could be an upside to our estimates. We expect volume/sales/EBITDA/PAT estimates to post CAGR of 14 per cent/18 per cent/23 per cent/26 per cent, respectively, over FY18-FY20E. Therefore, we have retained Buy rating on MTEP with a target price of Rs450 based on FY20E EPS and P/E multiple of 25x, indicating an upside of 50 per cent from the CMP."
45,2018-08-24,Asian Paints,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India’s biggest institutional investor, holds over 1 per cent stake in as many as 344 companies in a portfolio that was worth Rs 6.50 lakh crore as of August 21. 

But just 25 stocks contribute 72 per cent of the portfolio value. Stocks from across industries such as FMCG, oil & gas, infrastructure, IT, finance, metals and mining, auto, logistics and power are among the top holdings of LIC in value terms. 

The insurance behemoth held 197.50 crore shares of ITC, valued at Rs 61,770 crore, at the end of June 2018. The stock is up 19 per cent for this calendar against a 12 per cent rise in the Nifty50 index. It underperformed the NSE barometer in calendar years 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Analysts are currently bullish on the stock. “ITC is going to be a pedigree stock. I have a Rs 350 target for the yearend. And I can stick my neck out to say ITC will be Rs 450, because 63 per cent of the cigarette volume is no longer the brand show. Also, ITC is now all about paper, hotels, FMCG and ITC Haryali. Other businesses are doing extremely well. Valuations are extremely attractive,” Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL told ETNow.

Reliance Industries (RIL) is one stock where the insurance behemoth holds 7.6 per cent stake, worth Rs 58,637 crore. The oil-to-telecom behemoth on Thursday became India’s first listed company to hit the Rs 8 lakh crore mark in market capitalisation. 

The Mukesh Ambani-led company last month posted 4.47 per cent rise in June quarter profit at Rs 9,459 crore on robust growth in petrochemical business backed by higher realisation in refining.

Global brokerage Macquarie has an ‘outperform’ rating on Reliance Industries, with a target price of Rs 1,315. It estimates RIL’s EBIT to grow at 2.2 times in three years. 

Shares of TCS and RIL have advanced over 50 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, this year till August 21.

Larsen & Toubro (holding worth Rs 32,572 crore), Tata Consultancy Services (Rs 30,359 crore), State Bank of India (Rs 27,636 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 21,356 crore), Infosys (Rs 20,694) are among other major players in the LIC portfolio in value terms. 

The L&T stock has been creating a lot of buzz on Dalal Street after its board approved a proposal to buy back six crore shares worth Rs 9,000 crore to reward shareholders. G Chokkalingam, Founder Equinomics Research, expects around 20 per cent upside in the stock in next three months.

Nomura has a ‘buy’ rating on State Bank of India with a target price of Rs 360. “Valuations at 0.9 times are not undemanding. We maintain a buy rating as the corporate cycle is improving and core pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) is likely to improve,” Nomura said. 

SBI posted a Rs 4,876 crore loss for June quarter on higher provisioning for accumulated non-performing assets (NPAs), or bad loans. The PSU lender had earned a net profit of Rs 2,005.5 crore in the same period last year.

LIC’s investments in ICICI Bank, ONGC, Coal India, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC, HUL, HDFC, LIC Housing Finance, HDFC Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Asian Paints, Indian Oil Corporation, Sun Pharma, YES Bank, Adani Ports, Power Grid, Tata Steel and Indiabulls Housings Finance together was worth Rs 2,11,309 crore as of August 21.

Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ call on the country’s biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, with a target price of Rs 11,041. “Ciaz will underpin the brand’s strong customer loyalty. We expect the new model to kickstart rollout of hybrid power train in India. New Ciaz should further widen leadership and add to existing robust order backlog,” the global brokerage said.

Of the 25 top stocks, as many as nine stocks have delivered negative returns this year.

Shares of IndianOil, Tata Steel, ONGC, NTPC, Power Grid, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports, LIC Housing Finance and SBI are down up to 19 per cent this year."
49,2018-08-28,Asian Paints,"Investors on Dalal Street became richer by nearly Rs 15 lakh crore in just 40 trading session, as sustained buying in largecap stocks as well as fund inflows by domestic institutional investors supported market sentiment.

The total market capitalisation of all the BSE-listed firms soared to around Rs 159 lakh crore on August 28 from Rs 144 lakh crore on July 2. However, falling rupee, US-China trade war concern and weakness in emerging market currencies kept market participants cautious.

Benchmark equity index BSE Sensex closed at a fresh record high on Tuesday, while the NSE Nifty index ended above the 11,700-mark for the first time ever.

On further movement of the equity market, Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities in an interaction with ETNow said, “Nifty is inching towards 12,000 and medium to long-term, we are very bullish on the market and as well as the economy. But yes, there will be short-term jerks coming in betw een. We are advising our investors to keep pumping money on all these jerks and triggers.”

In terms of wealth creators, oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries added over Rs 2.25 lakh crore to its market capitalisation during the period. Share price of the company jumped 37 per cent to Rs 1,318.20 on August 28 from Rs 961.10 on July 2. 

Still, brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities has reiterated ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 985. 

“Our reverse valuation exercise suggests that investors have not only priced in a robust energy segment performance in RIL’s current valuations, but also ascribed the enterprise value (EV) of leading players in key sectors that are being targeted by RIL’s platform narrative—Bharti’s India business (telecom), Avenue Supermarts (retail), Flipkart (e-commerce) and key players in the media sector (content ecosystem),” Kotak said in a report.

Tata Consultancy Services has added Rs 80,381 crore to its market cap since July 2. ITC (Rs 59,890 crore), State Bank of India (Rs 40,919 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 39,591 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 38,027 crore), Bajaj Finance (Rs 36,788 crore) were among other top grossers in terms of m-cap.

In terms of share price, companies such as Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, SORIL Infra Resources, Adani Enterprises more than doubled investors wealth during July 2-August 28.

All the sectoral indices on the BSE moved northwards since July 2 with FMCG index rallying 13 per cent, followed by Oil & Gas (up 11 per cent), Healthcare (up 11 per cent), Power (up 10 per cent), Bankex (up 9 per cent), IT (9 per cent). 

Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, “On the earnings front Q1FY19 numbers have been above expectations and we remain confident that rural demand will pick up in the coming quarters. With government focusing on cleaning up the banking sector there may some short-term pressure on banking names, but the worst is behind.”

Jani prefers stocks in the private banking space and feel that they will outperform their PSU peers. Stocks such as HDFC Bank and RBL Bank remain among preferred picks. He also believes that market will continue to be volatile in the short term on the back of global fund inflows and general elections in 2019. “Any correction should be used by investors to add quality companies,” Jani said.

Capital Goods, Teck, Consumer durables, Metal, Auto and Realty index also rallied up to 8 per cent during the past 40 trading sessions.

Foreign portfolio investors have poured over Rs 4,000 crore in domestic equity markets since July this year. However, they offloaded shares worth Rs 6,000 during the first half of 2018. On the other hand, net investment of domestic institutional investors stood over Rs 71,000 crore on YtD basis.

For investment perspective, global brokerage CLSA has recommended few largecap stocks for investors.

50,2018-08-30,Asian Paints,"Make part of your portfolio a play on the macro cycle and the other part structural long-term plays, Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus 
   
   
   Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


What role do you think cycle will play because ultimately markets follow a cycle. Let us say a Page, HDFC Bank or a Bajaj Finance are good companies and will continue to grow. Now, whether the growth is 10%, 15% or 8% is the debate. Whether India’s GDP will grow, 5-6-7% is the debate. India will grow.
A very interesting thing about the market is that a market bifurcates nicely into sectors which are very structural -- IT, pharma, FMCG. There are three sectors which are intensely cyclical; they are BFSI, banks, metals and capital goods. If you want to be a large player in these three sectors and in a way, by default everybody now is a large player in BFSI, you are going to have a really good fix on the cycle. 

I am not saying I am the world’s greatest expert on the business cycle but whoever today is playing heavily in BFSI, metals and capital goods better have a really good fix on macro, in this case GDP, interest rates and the repo rate cycle. 

The interest rate cycle is the main thing to look at now. One, the cost of money has risen and will rise further over the next 12 months, potentially with an upside surprise. Which is why the banks, the BFSI price worries me so much. There are three parts of the Indian market which are very susceptible to cyclical corrections; banks, metals and capital goods. 

Outside that, in sectors like auto, consumer, IT, pharma, FMCG there is not that much cyclicality. So if you have a good structural holding in your portfolio such as Page or an Asian Paints, history shows that it has been folly to trade in and out of it. Asian Paints is up 1500x since its IPO in 1983. There must be millions of people out there who have tried to time Asian Paints over the last 25 years and failed. Page, at this juncture, touch wood, feels like a similar story. I have tried to time it myself before giving up. It does not work. 

So, in sectors which are non-cyclical like auto, pharma, IT and FMCG, there is no point to try to catch the ups and downs. You can do that to your heart’s content in capital goods, metals and banking.


People often say it is a good business but the stock is expensive. What should one do then?
Obviously, there is going to be a practical way to gauge this and typically what I look for is not just the earnings growth but also the return on capital employed.


Why are you sounding different to me in your new avatar?
The return on capital. This is one of the reasons I decided to invest full time. I figured out that I could make more money doing this for myself than I could running around the world investing, giving broking advice to others. Anyway, on the point on valuation, return on capital employed is the critical metric. Everybody obsesses about earnings growth, if ROC is well above the cost of capital as it is for someone like Page, that is the premium you command. If you sell a company with ROC, you are basically giving up a cash machine.


I look at Marico, HDFC Bank and I get your theme about consumption not being cyclical. But you are saying that banks have a bit of a cyclicality.
HDFC Bank deserves a lot of credit for being an exception. When I wrote the Unusual Billionaires, I just realised how exceptional HDFC Bank is. It deserves a lot of credit for being a structural play in a cyclical sector. I have not seen any other lender to be honest who has been able to pull that of a structural play in a cyclical sector is almost walking on water and all credit to the people behind that bank for pulling this off.


Can Bajaj Finance be the one? The way people are valuing Bajaj Finance is that there is a cycle but they also have an advantage of understanding of the consumer insight. Our understanding of Bajaj Finance model is that they are essentially leveraging the same customer more and the same customer wants a mobile phone, then he wants a car. I read an ad where Bajaj Finance is saying get your hair back and pay money in EMIs, essentially over weight loss and hair transplant. 
On the internet shopping sites, they are even giving EMIs for my book so...


Is that an expensive book?
All books are now available on EMI. But the key concern I have for the top quality NBFCs is that the key raw material is money and it is not evident to me that any of them have a competitive advantage when it comes to getting money from the wholesale market. 

Until I can get my head around that it is difficult to put it in the coffee can category. The unique CASA franchise that HDFC has built gives them a competitive advantage. Others have tried to emulate it but not to the extent of success that HDFC Bank has had.


What makes you worry? Would you say that on a macro level, the currency, crude, US interest rates are the worrying factors?
The big worry is if you look at India now versus India five or 10 years ago. The crux of our banking system is gone, the PSU banks are gone. As a result, our economy is now almost entirely funded by our wholesale markets and the Bajaj Finance example illustrates that point. As a result, whenever liquidity tightens in America, it will ripple straight into our economy. 

In the past, the PSU banks right or wrongly gave us a buffer which meant global shocks did not hit the real economy directly. Now we do not have that buffer so in a way we are more exposed now to adverse events in the western world than we were five or 10 years ago. That is something we need to reckon with. Anybody who talks of decoupling and all of that nonsense, needs to reckon with the fact that with the core of our banking system gone, we are left with no cushion to face a western liquidity shock.


How does one go about investing in this market because macros are not great, globally we know that things are not very straight lined. If global risk comes back and if there is a liquidity crunch, then we will be hit hard and smallcap and midcap stocks will get crunched because there will be no liquidity. So, how does one invest in this kind of a market?
I will say what I am trying to do and I will be very candid about it. A part of my portfolio consists of structural plays whether it is coffee can types structural plays or high quality smallcap companies with a great future. The other part of my portfolio is where I have some fix on the macro cycles. If I have a fix on where the rupee will go, I am trying to be opportunistic about buying IT, pharma and auto exporters, who I think will benefit from the rupee. 

Make part of your portfolio a play on the macro cycle. Choose a metric in the macro world which you feel very comfortable with. Currency is the one I feel most comfortable with and choose macro plays which benefit from a weaker currency. 

Make the other part of your portfolio, arguably, the core of your portfolio structural long-term plays where you do not wake up every morning looking at the PE multiples. That way you are both dealing with your itchiness to do something in the market and react to macro news. At the same time, you are giving structural compounders like Page where the opportunity to generate wealth for you."
0,2018-09-03,Asian Paints,"Edelweiss Financial Services has a buy call on Pidilite Industries with a target price of Rs 1,334.

The current market price of Pidilite Industries is Rs 1,173.65.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Pidilite Industries price can reach the defined target. 


View of the brokerage on the company:

Huge entry barriers in distribution: In spite of signs of intensifying competition (with Varun Dhawan promoting Astral’s Resinova), PIDI management remains confident of maintaining its turf comfortably aided by brand equity and strong distribution reach – Fevikwik sells at 4mn outlets. PIDI also has the second-deepest distribution reach (40,000 outlets out of the 60,000 universe) after Asian Paints. Adhesives are likely to sustain a strong run with new applications (globally, EVs need huge amount of adhesives; latest aeroplane wings too do not use nut-bolts but adhesives!). Management’s focus on volume growth over margin expansion will further erect a big barrier for new entrants. Recent floods in Kerala provide an opportunity to PIDI to push its waterproofing range of products.


Sealing gaps in portfolio: PIDI is smoothly filling gaps in its portfolio through either acquisition/JV or license agreement. India has been the fastest growing geography for WD40 since its acquistion by PIDI. PIDI also acquired CIPY, the largest player in floor coatings (target markets: car parking decks, doctor clinics, food factories, etc); it has a JV with Jowat, a leading manufacturer of hot adhesives (used in factory-made furniture).


Outlook and valuations- Strong bond; maintain ‘BUY’: Demand revival, entry in new markets/adjacent categories and anticipated demand shift from unorganised to organised players are likely to drive PIDI’s revenue and earnings. We ascribe 50x FY20E EPS to arrive at a target price of Rs 1,334. At CMP, the stock is trading at 43.8x FY20E EPS."
1,2018-09-03,Asian Paints,"KOLKATA: If you join an MBA course at any of India’s top business schools, chances are you may land a job a little more than a year into the programme.

Companies are increasingly giving pre-placement offers (PPOs) to students of top B-schools based on their performance during summer internships. At this rate, the 30-minute final placement interview — the traditional method of campus recruitment — may soon become the second most-preferred way for hiring future managers.

Estimates from several Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other top B-schools such as MDI Gurgaon and XLRI show that up to one in every three students in the class of 2020 is likely to be recruited through PPOs.

Consulting and consumer biggies are leading the charge with a flurry of preplacement offers, in the process ensuring that more students have a job in hand before the final placements even kick off in what institutes expect to be a strong placement season.

Pre-placement offers usually go on till January. This year, just a couple of months into the process—and more than four to go—most IIMs have already notched up 60-80% of last year’s total PPO tally.

IIM Bangalore has already received over 100 PPOs this year, against a total of 155 PPOs the previous batch managed to attract by the end of the academic year. IIM Calcutta has 80-plus PPOs (last year’s total was 133) while IIM Kozhikode has so far got at least 61offers against 79 in the whole of last year.



At MDI Gurgaon, the PPO tally has crossed 71, a nearly 122% jump over the 32 offers it had at the same time last year. XLRI-Xavier School of Management students have notched up over 81 offers against last year’s total of 122.

CONSULTING, CONSUMER COS LEAD WAY
Sapna Agrawal, head, career development services, IIM Bangalore, said strategy consulting, general management and FMCG companies are normally early with their pre-placement offers. “The finance firms will confirm their PPOs later,” she said.

Global management consultancy BCG India has already made 50-plus pre-placement offers across the country’s top B-schools. “Over the last few years, our internship numbers have increased dramatically given our overall strong growth and intent to shift towards sizeable PPO hires,” said Sumit Gupta, partner & recruiting head at BCG India. Hiring through PPOs is aimed at giving both the parties a chance to experience each other and bring out the best results, he said.

Bain & Company, too, will continue to double down on PPOs across experienced consultant roles, its partner Megha Chawla said. The global consulting firm runs its summer programme at IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta and IIM Lucknow. “It’s an indispensable part of our recruitment process,” Chawla said, adding that about 75% is the typical conversion rate of interns landing pre-placement offers.

Consumer companies too are going strong. Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and Reckitt Benckiser are among consumer products companies that have made PPOs at IIM Calcutta, said Abhishek Goel, chairperson, career development and placement office, at the institute.

At IIM Kozhikode, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Asian Paints, BCG, Deloitte, EY, HUL and Nestle were among those who have made offers, its placements chairperson Shovan Chowdhury said.

Godrej offers internships and hires full time for all its key businesses in human resources, supply chain, sales, marketing, strategy and business development. This time, it has made 26 PPOs from summer internships for students graduating in 2019. Besides scaling up hiring from regulars such as IIFT, MDI, FMS, IIM Ahmedabad, ISB, SPJIMR, NITIE, SIBM, SCMHRD, IRMA and XIMB, it has also explored some new schools like IIM Trichy for the Godrej Agrovet business, and IIM Calcutta, for Godrej Properties.

Sumit Mitra, head-group HR and corporate services at Godrej Industries and associate companies, said 37 of the 41 management trainees who joined the group in 2018 were through the PPO route. “We believe it is a smarter strategy to hire someone who we have observed closely over a two-month summer internship, rather than to go back to campus for full-time placements and make hiring decisions about people who we have never met before, after 30-minute long interviews,” Mitra said.

COMPANIES QUICKER TO ROLL OUT PPOS
This year many companies are quicker in extending PPOs to talent they have tried and tested out, institute officials said. “This year, nearly double the number of companies (27) have rolled out pre-placement offers during June-August in comparison to 14 last year,” said Kanwal Kapil, dean, continuing education, consulting, alumni and placements, MDI Gurgaon.

The highest offer so far at the institute is Rs 28 lakh offered by P&G. “At present, many of the technology companies including ACT Fibernet and Intel have started offering PPOs,” Kapil said. “New companies which came for summer placements like P&G, MARS and Bajaj Auto have also offered PPOs,” he said.

At XLRI, top offer so far is Rs 39.7 lakh from Uber. JP Morgan Chase Markets, BCG, Uber, Microsoft, P&G, RB, HUL, Asian Paints, Mahindra, J&J, RPG, AB InBev, Cipla, Flipkart, and RPG are among the companies that have made offers at the institute, according to Uday Damodaran, chairperson, placements (two years PGDM programmes) at XLRI. “Initial numbers look promising,” he said."
9,2018-09-04,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The bears tightened their grip over Dalal Street on Tuesday, as benchmark Sensex logged its longest losing streak since May on unabated fall in the rupee, jump in crude oil prices and weakness in global markets.

Indian currency slipped 33 paise today to hit a fresh record low of 71.53 against the US dollar on strong demand for the greenback.

Crude oil prices rose sharply after the evacuation of two Gulf of Mexico oil platforms in preparation for a hurricane. US light crude rose $1.31 a barrel from Friday's close to a peak of $71.11, its highest since mid-July.

The BSE Sensex closed the day at 38,157.92, down 154.60 points or 0.40 per cent. Only six constituents ended the day on a positive note. This was the fifth consecutive day of fall for the 30-share index.

The NSE Nifty ended the session 62.05 points, or 0.54 per cent, down at 11,520.30. As many as nine stocks closed higher while the remaining 40 shut shop in the red.

""The persistent strengthening of crude oil prices and weak currency dampened investor sentiments. The broader market indices underperformed the benchmark with BSE Midcap and Smallcap ending the day with losses of 2.6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively"", said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.

""We remain positive on the Indian equities over medium to long term, however in the near term one should remain cautious as further correction cannot be ruled out, considering a sharp upmove witnessed over the last couple of weeks. Additionally, global developments on trade war, movement of crude oil prices and currency movements (USD vs INR) will be on market radar. Any correction in fundamentally sound companies with strong growth prospects should be considered as a good buying opportunity for investors"", Manglik added.

Among Sensex stocks Asian Paints emerged to be the top index loser with a loss of over 3 per cent. 

However, IT major Infosys was the best index performer and soared nearly 3 per cent to settle at Rs 735.65. Shares of the company rose after the scrip went ex-bonus in the ratio of 1:1. 

The BSE Midcap index underperformed Sensex with a fall of 2.60 per cent against Sensex's declien of 0.40 per cent. Reliance Power was the worst hit midcap stock with a loss of 7.54 per cent.

Among sectoral indices, only IT stocks managed to end the session on a positive note bolstered by a sharp decline in rupee. The Nifty IT index jumped 2.06 per cent to 16,048.70.

Banking, media, FMCG, metals, auto and pharma stocks shed the most. The Nifty metal index lost 1.94 per cent to settle at 3,585.60. 

The Nifty PSU bank index slid 116.50 points to 3,167.05 with all 9 constituents ending the day in the red.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices trailed Sensex by a slight margin, rising 0.31 per cent and 0.46 per cent, respectively. 

Let’s walk you through the key highlights of the session:


Sensex movers & shakersAfter Wednesday's loss, RIL made a comeback and settled 2.80 per cent higher at Rs 1,260. The scrip led the pack of Sensex gainers, which included PowerGrid (up 2.21 per cent), Coal India (up 2.05 per cent), Sun Pharma (up 2 per cent) and Adani Ports (up 1.70 per cent). YES Bank fell 1.42 per cent at Rs 339 after Wednesday’s gains and led the pack of Sensex losers, which included Maruti Suzuki (down 1.33 per cent), Bharti Airtel (down 0.83 per cent), ICICI Bank (down 0.45 per cent) and Asian Paints (down 0.28 per cent).


Chaos in currency market Sliding for the seventh day in a row, the rupee slipped below the 72 mark for the first time ever as the US dollar eased a bit. The local currency is down over 12 per cent on a year-to date basis, making it one of the worst-performing currencies among emerging markets and giving jitters to the financial markets. A Reuters report said the Reserve Bank of India was not seen intervening after the rupee fell below 72. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday attributed the fall in the rupee to global factors and said there was no need for panic or knee-jerk reactions. He said RBI was doing whatever was necessary to deal with the situation. 


Trade war aggravatesEscalating the ongoing trade tussle, China on Thursday warned that it would go for tit-for-tat action if fresh tariffs are imposed on Chinese imports to the US. China will be forced to retaliate if the US implements any new tariff measures, China’s commerce ministry warned, as the world’s two biggest economies remained locked in an intensifying trade war. Earlier, the US President had threatened to raise tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Stocks fell in Asia and Europe for the fifth day on Thursday.


Cement & realty stocks riseThe Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted the ban on construction activities in Maharashtra and Uttarakhand after the two states submitted their respective solid waste management policies to the court. Following this, cement and realty stocks witnessed decent traction in Mumbai trading. Shri Keshav Cements And Infra (up 5.75 per cent), Ramco Cements (2.73 per cent), Prism Johnson (2 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (1.46 per cent), Ambuja Cements (up 1.16 per cent), DLF (0.99 per cent) and Oberoi Realty (0.70 per cent) were among the top gainers from the cement and realty segments. 


BEL extends losses to 9th sessionShares of BEL (down 3.39 per cent) plunged for the ninth consecutive session. A report that the Ministry of Defence may reduce margins (at PBT level) for defence orders has hit the stock hard. Shares of the state-run defence company is likely to remain subdued in the near term as margins for ministry of defence-led projects have been reduced to 7.5per cent from 12.5per cent although some market participants believe that Wednesday’s slump in the stock was overdone, ET reported.

13,2018-09-10,Asian Paints,"ET Wealth together with Morningstar India have selected and ranked India's best equity fund managers, across categories, based on their five-year risk-adjusted returns. Here are the top 5 in the small and mid cap category. These managers have proved their mettle while dealing with stock market volatility and have delivered consistent returns over the years. Read about each of these managers, their top stock and sector picks and what they think is the promising theme for the next few years.


Should you start sips in small cap funds?
The correction in mid- and small-cap stocks has led several fund houses to reopen their doors for fresh investments in schemes focused on these segments of the market. Several small- and midcap funds, which had stopped taking fresh investments, are now open for investments. For instance, DSP Mutual Fund has started accepting SIPs or STPs in the DSP Small Cap Fund. However, the fund will not accept lump sum investments. 

“We still expect the market to remain volatile in the run up to the election in mid-2019. The earnings cycle may be picking up, but broad valuations continue to be high,” said Kalpen Parekh, President, DSP Mutual Fund, in an interview to a financial portal. Another small-cap fund, L&T Emerging Businesses Fund, opened its doors to fresh SIP investments last week. 

Earlier, the SBI Smallcap Fund (previously known as the SBI Small & Midcap Fund), which had stopped taking new investments in October 2015, reopened for fresh SIPs in May. But there is an investment cap of Rs 25,000 per month per individual. Though many investors may rush to start SIPs in these reopened funds, experts advise caution.

1. Neelesh Surana, Mirae Asset Mutual Fund
 Age: 45 Years

Education: B.E. and MBA
Experience: 19+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 30.33%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 2,036 crore


Profile
Neelesh Surana has consistently ranked among the best fund managers in all previous editions of these rankings, which is a testimony to his investing prowess. With the fund house’s other flagship offering, the mid-cap oriented Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip, he replicates his impeccable track record of consistent outperformance every year since the funds inception, beating both the benchmark index and peers. 

The initial exuberance around the mid-cap space few years ago made handling this segment a tricky affair, but Surana has focused on being in the right pockets within sectors, rather than playing on sector rotation. Being a stickler for quality, he has contained risk by focusing on the larger mid-caps and avoided hunting lower down the market-cap ladder to generate alpha.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“We are coming out of a period of subpar earnings growth—reflected by low profit to GDP ratio—compared to longterm averages. We expect corporate earnings to improve over the next few years. This will help mitigate the macro-economic challenges.”


b) Navigating current environment
“Our focus remains on individual businesses. In the current environment, the large disparity in valuation across sector and stocks offers good opportunities in businesses whose long-term prospects are intact, while their near term performance is impaired.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“We remain positive on the consumption side of the economy, subject to reasonable valuations. In the long-term, structural growth drivers related to favourable demographics, rising income levels and urbanisation will lead to higher demand, particularly in the under-penetrated consumer goods and services segment.”


2. S.N. Lahiri, L&T Mutual Fund
 Age: 51 Years

Education: B.E.and PGDM
Experience: 28 years

5-year asset weighted return: 27.51%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 1.634 crore


Profile
While recognising that the mid- and small-cap space provides ample opportunity to beat the index comfortably, S.N. Lahiri stresses that his focus is on consistent returns. He is passionate about new ideas and believes that if a company is part of the index, its growth has been discovered and is likely to be captured in its price. 

Lahiri prefers quality businesses with differentiated offerings and a significant competitive edge over peers. To contain risk, he insists on healthy diversification, limiting exposure to individual bets. Lahiri recognises that selling right is often more important than buying right.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“Volatility has returned—but it is integral to equity markets. Although popular indices have scaled new highs, mid- and small-caps remain sluggish and this divergence is throwing up opportunities.”


b) Navigating current environment
“The recent correction in midand small-caps has taken away some of the froth and we are looking at some of these stocks that are available at cheaper valuations. We are looking to use the market volatility as an opportunity to raise our stake in some of the quality companies, with a long-term perspective.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Consumption due to urban and rural demand remains a strong theme. We are also looking at quality infra stocks. Another theme we are quite positive on is the digital transformation in various fields and the use of technology as it looks to disrupt traditional business models.”

3. Ravi Gopalakrishnan, Canara Robeco Mutual Fund
 Age: 50 Years

Education: MBA and MS
Experience: 21+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 31.16%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 1,136 crore

Profile
Ravi Gopalakrishnan asserts that navigating the mid- and smallcap segment successfully requires discipline so as to not deviate from the investing style. He is happier when volatility is high as it yields good bargains, but insists that trying to capture the volatility through market timing is a futile exercise.

Gopalakrishnan has chosen not to have more than 3-4% in individual bets, which has helped de-risk his portfolio while pushing him to find new, better investment ideas. Performance during drawdowns is critical in the mid-cap space, he argues. 

Gopalakrishnan prefers a portfolio mix with a sizeable chunk of high potential alpha generators with a smaller portion in steady compounding businesses with a sound track record. His portfolio comprises firms that can maintain and gain market share across cycles, are moving up the value chain and show balance sheet improvement.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“This year, interest rates and commodity prices have switched from being tailwinds to headwinds. Further, changes in political equations have also raised concerns on economic reforms. While volatility is likely to remain elevated, we are likely to see markets in a bull phase over the next 3 to 5 years, most likely led by improvement in the earnings growth.”


b) Navigating current environment
“With the market in a consolidation phase, the best strategy is to focus on quality stocks that have seen large corrections and accumulate them taking advantage of the ongoing volatility.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Both discretionary and nondiscretionary consumption themes are expected to immensely benefit over the long term, as the economy gradually shifts from the unorganised to the organised sector. The other theme that will most likely see opportunities is the investment theme. However, this theme requires careful selection.”


4. Anoop Bhaskar, IDFC Mutual Fund
 Age: 48 Years

Education: B.Com and M.B.A.
Experience: 23+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 26.08%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 4,419 crore


Profile
Anoop Bhaskar has helmed schemes across two fund houses during our selected period. He takes a conservative approach and has derived strength from a low beta (low volatility) portfolio that ensures better downside protection. 

Apart from bringing healthy diversification, he has emphasised on a healthy liquidity position that can withstand stress. He has leaned towards stocks offering relative value for the most part, with the rest of the portfolio comprising quality companies. Bhaskar has opted for a mix of leaders in smaller sectors, not part of frontline indices, but with strong potential. He has backed unconventional ideas that offer growth visibility.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“Investor sentiments have shifted from a preference for return on capital to return of capital. This is because of uncertainty around the 2019 general elections, RBI’s hawkish policy stance, fears of a protracted trade war, interest rate hikes by US Federal Reserve, rising dollar and crude oil prices. Domestic earnings, thankfully, have been fairly strong.”


b) Navigating current environment
“We remain focused on identifying companies and sectors where growth could surprise market expectations. We are rebalancing our sector weights with a focus on reducing overall beta of the portfolios.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“The infra theme looks promising. But the high beta of this theme makes it eligible only for informed investors. Domestic consumption, however, is suited for investors with longer investment time horizon.”


5. R. Janakiraman, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund
 Age: 47 Years

Education: BE and PGDM
Experience: 21+ years

5-year asset weighted return: 25.78%
Average 5-year AUM: Rs 7,108 cr


Profile
In the mid- and small-cap segment, cutting down on mistakes in the portfolio itself helps deliver healthy alpha over time. This, according to R. Janakiraman, is far more valuable than being among the first to identify new ideas. His effort during the past few years has been to reduce the risks significantly without hurting the fund’s return profile. 

With positive macro factors losing traction recently, along with a shift in market focus to earnings, emphasis on quality businesses will work favourably going forward, he insists. After the recent correction in this segment, he finds many quality stocks have become more reasonable—earlier, the risk in these stocks was due to their price and not the business. Janakirman insists that a portfolio built around quality, growth and sustainability will have a better probability of generating alpha over a cycle, even if it doesn’t fare well in certain stretches of the cycle.

QUICK TAKE

a) On evolving market
“Demand continues to strength. A pick-up in monetary signals (total credit, currency in circulation) bodes well for a durable economic recovery. The micro factors indicate a sustained momentum in growth recovery even as the macroeconomic indicators remain in check. Growth should be led by consumption, exports, amid improvement in investment growth.”


b) Navigating current environment
“We focus on identifying promsing companies. Quality stocks never go out of style, regardless of the market environment due to their fundamental strength and long-term growth potential. Corrections offer opportunities to increase exposure to such companies.”


c) Promising theme for next 3-5 years
“Opportunities in consumer cyclicals is promising. This includes auto, durables, branded garments, big retail, entertainment, leisure and travel etc. Interim pockets of overvaluation don’t tend to diminish the long term potential of the theme.”

23,2018-09-11,Asian Paints,"The market opened on a subdued note on Tuesday and remained rangebound for the first half of the session. However, the last two hours of the trade were very disappointing, as the rupee fell to its fresh lifetime low, and it affected the domestic market, which were grappling with negative global cues.

The NSE benchmark Nifty saw a sharp decline and went on to test its 50-DMA before ending the day with a deep cut of 150.60 points or 1.32 per cent.

The damage was secular, and all the sectoral indices ended in the red. The Nifty has ended a notch above its 50-DMA, and we can expect this level to act as support on a closing basis. The index has lost over 300 points in the last two sessions. We can expect some support to come in at the c urrent levels.

A muted start to the trade cannot be ruled out on Wednesday. Even if there are minor downsides, the 50-DMA level, which stand at 11,274 level, should act as an interim support.

The levels of 11,325 and 11,390 are expected to act as technical resistance to Nifty, whereas 11,250 mark followed by 11,210 is expected to lend support.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the weekly chart is 40.2086. It is bearish, as it has marked its fresh 14-period low, but it shows no divergence against its price.

The daily MACD stays bearish trading below its signal line. The pattern analysis shows that the market is classically reverting to its mean after it ran away too ahead of its curve. However, Tuesday’s decline was slightly overextended in nature.

Overall, as we approach the market on Wednesday ahead of the holiday on Thursday, we recommend staying away from taking any directional call in the market.

Shorts should be avoided, as there is little tradable gap on the downsides, and also because there are still significant number of shorts that exists in the system.

On the long side, there are chances of participants turning cautious at higher levels in event of a pullback given a trading holiday in between.

We recommend avoiding any kind of directional bets in the market until it is seen getting little stabilised. While preserving liquidity to protect existing trading positions, very cautious view is advised for the day.

22,2018-09-11,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Extending its losses to the second consecutive session, headline indices Sensex and Nifty suffered massive losses on Tuesday on all-round selling as the rupee hit a fresh record low.

Lingering trade war worries, wobbly crude oil prices and turmoil in emerging markets weighed on sentiments. Sensex settled 509 points, or 1.34 per cent, down at 37,413 while Nifty plunged 151 points, or 1.32 per cent, to close at 11,287.

FMCG, telecom and consumer durables stocks were worst hit. Pharma, auto, bank and financial also reeled under selling pressure.

Domestic equity investors have lost around Rs 4,14,121.84 crore in two sessions as the Sensex erased about 977 points and the Nifty 302 points. Broader BSE Midcap (down 1.36 per cent) and Smallcap (down 1.37 per cent) indices fell in sync with Sensex. 


Let’s walk you through the key highlights of the session:

Who dragged the SensexTata Steel, falling 3.46 per cent, was the top loser in the 30-share index. PowerGrid, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Motors suffered losses of over 3 per cent each. In terms of index contribution, HDFC Bank, ITC, RIL, ICICI Bank and TCS were the top index losers while Coal India (up 1.73 per cent), NTPC (up 0.36 per cent), Infosys (up 0.31 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 0.26 per cent) and Asian Paints (0.26 per cent) were the five stocks that managed to end with gains. 


Mayhem in the currency martAfter recovering in the morning session, the rupee saw sharp a drop in afternoon deals and traded 19 paise down at 72.63 around 3.55 pm. Turmoil in emerging markets, firming US dollar and a surge in crude oil prices put pressure on the domestic currency. The relentless slide in the rupee has analysts rushing to rework their forecasts. DBS Bank is now predicting the domestic unit to slip as low as 75 to the dollar.


China stocks near 2016 lowThe Shanghai Composite slipped 0.18 per cent in Tuesday’s session to touch the low of 2016. Worries of an ever-intensifying trade war between China and the US have dealt a heavy blow to Chinese stocks. After the US President announced on Friday that China may face tariffs on virtually all exports to the US, China warned retaliation. 


Stocks that plunged over 10% on BSEShares of GTN Industries (down 19.29 per cent), The Indian Wood Products Company (down 17.50 per cent), Span Divergent (down 13.76 per cent), Chandni Textiles Engineering (down 12.68 per cent), Globus Spirits (down 10.89 per cent) and Usha Martin (down 10.88 per cent) tanked over 10 per cent on BSE.


52-week highs & lowsAs many as 96 stocks, including BPCL, Dhanlaxmi Bank, GIC Housing Finance, Manappuram Finance and Jaiprakash Associates, hit 52-week lows on NSE, while 19 others, including Mindtree, Albert David, Electrosteel Steels, Gangotri Textiles and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, hit 52-week highs.

21,2018-09-11,Asian Paints,"Rural is the theme in terms of next 12 to18 or 24 months and Mahindra Finance is best placed to take advantage of that situation, Vivek Mavani, Independent 
  
  
  Investment Advisor, tells ET Now. Mavani also says in midcaps, he likes all three gas distribution companies as also auto ancillaries.Edited excerpts: 


Where are you finding value now?
In a falling market, seemingly it may look attractive but for next couple of weeks, it is best to sit on the side lines and one of the reasons is that historically when we look at the movements on the currency markets, basically INR-USD, whenever the currency has been weak, markets have corrected very sharply in a very short timeframe. 

The rupee in the 72-73 band, does not augur well for equity markets. And again, it is not that rupee has found stability. So, rather than sticking my neck out on taking a call on where the equity markets would go, I would be looking more at INR movements and any further weakness in rupee means weakness in the equity markets as well.


Would you look to trade or invest in the currency sensitives? Would exporters be a theme that you would look at or would some of the paint companies or cement (RMC) costs actually go higher and you could look to either profit taking or selling into those names?
Two things. The first segment which you mentioned was the exporters. What comes to mind is obviously is the IT and pharma and some part of manufacturing which has sizeable exports. 

The IT sector, in the shorter term, will be an area of strength amidst overall weakness in the whole markets but over a period of time, with currency movements, even they are adjusting prices. This year will be good for technology companies because rupee earnings will be higher. They have 10% bonus in terms of earnings coming just from the currency translation but obviously that will not last forever. But in the short term, it will be an area of strength.

Coming to paints which is import sensitive, it is also crude oil sensitive and that is trending higher. The paints sector is dominated by four players controlling more than 90% of the market and they have tremendous pricing power. When you look at over five, ten-year periods, the margins do not see any blip or impact of the currency, despite the currency having gone from 39-40 levels to 72 plus levels today. But margins of Asian Paints or Berger Paints or Nerolac have stayed in a range. So, going forward also, price adjustments, end consumer price adjustments will happen.

In the shorter term, there may be an impact in the current quarter and next quarter depending upon their booking of the raw material and ability to pass on price increases or revisions. But I am not so much concerned about the paint sector specifically. I would look to buy the weakness as far as Asian Paints is concerned. 


There are two other segments which are bound to get impacted by a) the crude spiral up and b) the currency weakness. These are high debt companies like Jain Irrigation, Jet Airways, Bharat Forge, Hindalco, Tata Power and Bharti Airtel among others. Would the case be weaker for some of these names in the backdrop of the currency weakness?
Well absolutely. In a few of the companies you mentioned, like Jain Irrigation, even if the currency had not depreciated, or a Jet Airways for that matter, the performance had not been anything to write home about. 

I mean, there has been general weakness in their business performance. The currency only makes it worse. In case of Hindalco and Bharat Forge, one cannot really draw a straight line or connect the dots directly because they have dollar denominated debt. It is negative for them because at the same time, they also earn in dollars. So earning in dollars and interest outgo in dollar terms, may cancel out depending on what kind of repayment and servicing commitments they have on an annual basis versus annually how much they earn in foreign currency. 

But in case of a Bharat Forge or a Hindalco, I do not see the situation to be as grim a Jet Airways or a Jain Irrigation.


On the point of crude, though OMCs at this point would be the obvious short as they get negatively impacted, is that a trade you would look to make?
I would stay away from OMCs in any case. The trade in OMCs was fantastic in 2017. In 2018, basically there is really no trade to look for as far as OMCs are concerned with or without crude simply because they had run up a bit too much, number one. 

Number two, so long as the current government does not have a policy regarding fuel prices like the previous government where they were made to bear the subsidy burden both in the short term and long term and there were cash flow mismatches. Actually things are not so bad for the OMCs in that case. 

If crude prices continue to stay at elevated levels but at the same time, the retail prices or the end product prices of petrol, diesel, aviation, kerosene etc are also revised upwards so that they are not in a losing proposition, then I will be neutral on that. And at least at this point of time, that is what seems to be the scenario. But the closer we get to the elections, my sense is they will probably be not as good for the OMCs. 


In all the cases which are pending in NCLAT, minus the debt, the assets are very productive. Is there any particular business or story that you particularly fancy if they were to win an asset? I am not talking about Maharashtra Seamless but any of the bidders?
I have tried to find value in some of those -- whether it is Electrosteel or Bhushan or Essar. The argument that is being made out that minus the debt, the business is good but then I do not think things work out so smoothly in this country because of two-three reasons. Debt alone was not the problem. The problem in most cases is also the viability of the businesses with or without debt.

Again, if we were to assume the best-case scenario that banks were to take 100% writeoff and you start on a clean slate with the asset which is available and which is right now ideal, I am absolutely certain and this is a feedback I have got from some of the corporates which have looked at some of these assets is that even without debt, some of those assets probably are not viable for various reasons. Either the cost structure if those assets were to put to running or were not viable, maybe the technologies are outdated. I would give this a miss in terms of an opportunity, if at all there is an opportunity. 

There are a whole lot of other good quality stocks that one can look at which have been correcting very sharply. I have been noticing NBFCs today seem to be singled out as a sector for some bit of pasting and all of them are down anywhere between 5% and 10%. So, why not look at some of those sectors where growth opportunity is sustainable and you really do not have these kind of other issues to deal with. You are only dealing with the price correction in the market.


So any favourites there or would it be the obvious, Bajaj Finance?
Well, yes. Bajaj Finance is a must have but I would also look at a Mahindra Finance because if we were to recollect on your programme, rural is the theme in terms of next 12 to18 or 24 months and Mahindra Finance is best placed to take advantage of that situation. The other is Cholamandalam Finance which also has a fair bit of rural play plus it has the other parts of the financial services business of the group, basically the Cholamandalam Group. That is another one which I would look at.


What are some of your top midcap ideas right now?
In terms of the new ideas, if I were to deploy money at this point of time then Mahanagar Gas, Indraprastha Gas and Gujarat Gas -- basically the gas distribution business is what appeals to me. All the three companies in this sector. I will also put a disclaimer. I already have an interest in Mahanagar Gas both for myself as well as on behalf of clients. I am also looking to add IGL and Gujarat Gas over a period of time. 

The other space is autos, not necessarily midcaps, but Bajaj Auto and Maruti are other two stocks that I would be looking at. Among the midcaps, within auto ancillaries, there is a company called JTEKT. It used to be Sona Koyo Steering. Then the Sona Group exited and now it is a Japanese company and they have renamed it as JTEKT which basically is into shock absorbers and suspension systems for passenger cars. 

Maruti also has a holding in this company is a sort of a co promoter and even Suzuki has a little holding in JTEKT. At Rs 135-140, I see significant opportunities in terms of business transformation over the next two, three years with margin expansion likely to play out."

25,2018-09-14,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty staged a stellar show on Friday on across-the-board buying fuelled by healthy macroeconomic indicators. 

Domestic investors embarked on an all-round buying spree after inflation data showed the economy is in a good shape. 

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Friday showed inflation based on wholesale prices eased to a four-month low of 4.53 per cent in August on softening of food prices. The wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.09 per cent in July and 3.24 per cent in August last year.

Earlier this week, government data showed retail inflation eased to a 10-month low of 3.69 per cent in August. 

The rupee, too, was on a recovery path in anticipation that the Prime Minister may announce some steps to curb its fall at an weekend review. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee was trading 35 paise higher for the day at 71.93.

Positive global cues also influenced the sentiment. Asian shares rose on Friday as the US and China prepared for a new round of trade talks on the tariff row, while a decisive interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank helped support global risk appetite, Reuters reported.

Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley raised the Sensex target for September 2019 to 42,000, citing that the earnings cycle was at the cusp of turning. However, it highlighted the election outcome in 2019 is a key risk for the market.

The 30-share Sensex surged 373 points, or 0.99 per cent, to settle at 38,090, with only two stocks - Coal India (down 1.42 per cent) and Infosys (down 1.01 per cent) – ending as losers. 

The Nifty50 index jumped 145 points, or 1.28 per cent, to close at 11,515, with four stocks – HCL Tech, Coal India, Infosys and GAIL – ending in the red. Reliance Industries finished flat. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outperformed Sensex, gaining 1.62 per cent and 1.38 per cent, respectively. For the week, Sensex slipped 0.78 per cent and Nifty 0.64 per cent.

26,2018-09-15,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: The stock market rose for the second straight day on Friday, taking cues from the rebound in the rupee amid expectations that the government will soon announce measures to stem the slide in rupee and stocks.

The Sensex closed above 38,000 and the Nifty edged past 11,500 on Friday, erasing most of the week’s losses that emanated from worries about the impact of a weaker rupee on the economy. The Sensex rose 372.68 points or 0.99 per cent to close at 38,090.64 while the Nifty climbed 145.30 points or 1.28 per cent to end at 11,515.20. Vedanta, PowerGrid, Asian Paints and NTPC gained 3-6 per cent. Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth ?1,090.56 crore, reversing their recent selling spree.

The rupee gained 0.45 per cent to close at 71.86 after recovering from a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday. Financial markets were shut on Thursday. Analysts said in addition to expectations of intervention by the government and the RBI, the rupee’s bounce was also driven by the Turkey central bank’s decision to raise interest rates to 24 per cent in a bid to curb rocketing inflation and prevent a currency crisis.

“The rupee could take some respite amid a cocktail of external and internal factors,” said Anindya Banerjee at Kotak Securities. “While Turkish lira shows some signs of stabilising, the authorities back home are expected to come out with some measures that could check further slide.” The crash in Turkish lira by as much as 50 per cent against the dollar has been one of the main triggers for the sell-off in emerging market currencies and stocks including India’s.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strong opponent of raising interest rates.





The rupee has fallen 11.1 per cent so far this year, sparking panic in the government and the market over the pace of the slide. The country’s forex reserves slipped below $400 billion as on September 9 because of the RBI’s efforts to curb the fall in the rupee.

Some traders expect authorities to come up with a NRI-bond investment programme, which would boost the dollar reserves and prop up the rupee. Dealers are now expecting the rupee to trade in the broad range of 71-73 in next few weeks. The direction of the stock market will depend on the moves in the rupee and crude oil prices. “It will be too early to conclude that the worst is over for the markets and the rupee,” said Nilesh Shah, managing director, Kotak Mutual Fund.

“Oil, US interest rates and the politics here will play a big role in the market direction.”

MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index outside Japan rose 1.2 per cent on Friday after the US and China looked set to initiate fresh talks on trade after months of escalating dispute. Korea’s Kospi rose 1.4 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1 per cent.

Oil rose on Friday after prices fell by the most in a month on Thursday. Brent crude was up 5 cents at $78.23 a barrel after falling 2 per cent on Thursday. The benchmark had risen to $80.13 — its highest since May 22."
27,2018-09-17,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: After logging gains in last two consecutive sessions, domestic equity indices took a pause, as it opened in the red on Monday amid mixed global cues.

Optimism around healthy macroeconomic numbers and government's measures to arrest the fall in the rupee and keep a check on current account deficit did not help lift the mood of the market.

Analysts have advised caution.

A HDFC Bank report said the government measures to support the rupee may not drive overseas inflows and are a negative from a longer-term perspective, as they would increase short-term debt.

In a separate report, global brokerage conglomerate Credit Suisse said Indian equities have run well ahead of fundamentals and investors should book profit given the stretched valuations. 

The week ahead is going to be a truncated one. Equity, commodity and forex markets will remain closed on Thursday on account of Muharram. Macroeconomic triggers, global cues and rupee movement will be the key factors, influencing market movement through the week. 

While the outlook for the broader market remains uncertain, analysts see stock-specific opportunities across sectors. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are top 10 stocks that are expected to log gains over the next three weeks.

28,2018-09-17,Asian Paints,"Keep your eyes and ears open. Chances are, you might just spot some big winners on Dalal Street. And take this, they may be even from the lot that has trailed benchmark indices so far! 

Look at Morgan Stanley, which recently added three underperformers from different sectors to its portfolio. The global brokerage has suddenly taken a fancy to India's biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI), which just about doubled investor money in the past 10 years even as the benchmark Sensex rallied over 180 per cent during the same period. 

Leading super-specialty hospital Apollo Hospitals and real estate developer Prestige Estates are the two other favourites of Morgan Stanley after the latest correction.

For the short-list, the third-largest wealth management firm in the world in terms of total client assets focussed on stocks that have underperformed the market over the past 12 months whose business fundamentals have been weak with slow earnings growth and RoEs below the standard deviation from the average. Prospects of these companies are now looking robust in terms of RoE and earnings growth, Morgan Stanley said. 

“We choose stocks rated ‘overweight’ by Morgan Stanley and where our analysts expect a positive change in RoE (return on equity), along with EPS growth in excess of 10 per cent over the next two years,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.

SBI stock has rallied 6 per cent in the last 12 months till September 14 whereas the benchmark BSE Sensex has advanced 18 per cent.

Morgan Stanley believes that the government’s recapitalisation move enabled the state-owned banks (SOE) to recognise problematic corporate loans as non-performing loans (NPLs) and increase provisioning.

“We expect an improvement in overall provisioning and NPL slippages to drop sharply during the second half of FY19 (H2FY19). However, loan loss charges are likely to remain high as banks take coverage towards 60 per cent with Ind-AS rolling in from April 1, 2019 (our base case). Core pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) growth should start picking up from H2FY19 as NPL formation slows and higher rates help margins expand. Given its strong liability franchise and technology, SBI is better positioned relative to other SOE banks to sustain growth and ROE,” Morgan Stanley added.

Japanese brokerage Nomura in August gave a ‘buy’ rating to SBI with a target price of Rs 360. “Valuations at 0.9 times are not undemanding. We maintain a buy rating as the corporate cycle and core PPOP improve,” said Nomura. 

The state-owned lender suffered a major loss of Rs 4,876 crore for the first quarter to June, caused by higher provisioning on account of accumulated non-performing assets (NPAs), or bad loans. In a stock exchange filing, SBI said it earned Rs 2,005.5 crore net profit for the same period of last financial year.

Shares of Prestige Estates and Apollo Hospital have climbed 9 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, during the period.

Prestige Estates has a balanced portfolio of developmental and rental projects, both of which have good scale-up potential. Presence in healthy South Indian cities (Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad), will be complemented by diversification to NCR and MMR markets. “Valuations appear reasonable at 51 per cent discount to our March 2019 NAV,” Morgan Stanley added.

The company is also looking to acquire malls across major cities to expand its rental income base. 

In the case of Apollo Hospitals, Morgan Staley believes that valuations seem inexpensive at 15x F20 EV/Ebitda. Operational improvement in the ensuing quarters would be driven by all the three revenue segments, including hospitals, steady growth in standalone pharmacies and narrowing of AHLL retail losses, for the target to break even in the first half of 2020.

Apollo Hospitals is also one of the top picks of IDFC Securities. In a report in August, the brokerage firm maintained ‘Outperformer’ rating on Apollo with a target price of Rs 1,483. 

The domestic brokerage firm further said a leadership position, national footprint and multi-pronged healthcare delivery model make Apollo one of the stronger EM healthcare models. 

“Post a prolonged weak earnings phase emanating from an aggressive expansion plan, earnings recovery is visible from H2 FY18 onwards, driven by improvement in mature hospital profitability. The new hospital cluster has begun to contribute positively, led by improvement in Navi Mumbai unit. While the ASAP business will sustain growth momentum, reduction in operating losses at the retail health platform too should aid growth in consolidated profitability,” IDFC Securities said in a report.

Morgan Stanley has upped its target price for the Sensex to 42,000 for September 2019 from 36,000 in June.

Asian Paints, ICICI Bank, ITC, M&M Financial and UltraTech Cement are other underperformers that made their way to the Morgan Stanley list.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has ‘Buy’ rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 355 while it has ‘Neutral’ call on Asian Paints with a target of Rs 1,405.

Brokerage firm JM Financial is positive on M&M Financial with a target price of Rs 650. “We expect earnings CAGR of 53 per cent over FY18-20E with RoA and RoE expanding to 2.9 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, by FY20E."

29,2018-09-18,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: The sliding rupee singed India’s equity indices over the past few days. But what went unnoticed is that stocks had become cheaper due to their projected earnings gains in rupees — by at least 2.5 per cent for the Nifty members.

For every one percent slide in the local unit against the dollar, the combined earnings of the index constituents rise by about 60 basis points. With the previous Nifty earnings estimates pegged at 68 to the dollar, the gains could be touching 3 per cent as the rupee heads toward 73.

This means an addition of around Rs 2,500-3,000 crore to the profits of the Nifty for every 1 per cent slide of the local unit. Bloomberg consensus EPS for Nifty in 2018 stood at Rs 579 per share, which implied a growth of 20.8 per cent YoY. The Street has, before the beginning of the fiscal year, pencilled in the rupee at 66-68. That would now be revised upward to 70-72.

Typically, investors believe the impact is limited to exporters such as IT and drug-makers. But there are sectors such as refiners, oil explorers and metal producers, where the revenue is denominated in dollar terms or pegged to import parity prices. For stance, Reliance Industries, owner of the largest refinery in a single location in the world, benefits from rupee depreciation as refinery product prices are priced in dollar terms.



Credit Suisse in a note released in July wrote that current year earnings growth could be revised 4.4 per cent upward if the rupee slides to 72 and could add an incremental profit of Rs 19,500 crore to the total projected profit of the Nifty for the current fiscal year.

The quantum of the benefit reflecting in immediate earnings is dependent on the hedged exposure.

The lower the hedged exposure, the greater would be the gains. In the IT pace, Infosys, TCS and Mindtree would benefit from the recent depreciation in the second quarter too. On the flip side, a weak rupee may hurt earnings of Maruti and Asian Paints as several cost items for such companies are denominated in dollars. The profits of companies having foreign currency debt liabilities, such as Adani Ports, IOC and HPCL, remain susceptible to forex loss. The combined forex loss of oil marketing companies between January and June was around Rs 4,000 crore."

Financials gutted

YES Bank plunged
Shares of YES Bank plunged 28.71 per cent on BSE on Friday, finishing at Rs 227.05. The stock hit its 52-week low of Rs 210.10 today after the RBI asked its managing director and CEO Rana Kapoor to step down after an extended term till January 31, 2019. The news upset the investors and most top brokerages downgraded the stock after RBI's directive. The market capitalisation of the company plunged by over Rs 22,000 crore today.

  term, Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Quality got smoked as well on Friday. A stock like Asian Paints got corrected 7-8-9% and then recovered in the second half of trade. Would you like to buy some of these so called non-financial stocks or companies which do not have a solvency risk or companies which do not have a debt at all? Do you think now more money will migrate towards classic staples and FMCG?
You are absolutely right.There are two bits to the story; one is of course, the fact that they have very strong balance sheets and therefore they will be less impacted by an overall credit tightness in the system. But on the other hand, paint at the end of the day is a consumer discretionary. It is likely to see a certain amount of business slowdown if there is lesser credit flowing around or higher cost credit is flowing around. That will lead to slightly less demand for consumer discretionary goods including paints. Companies like Hindustan Lever have a strong balance sheets and high valuations but there is not much of a downside given their stability of earnings.


What would you make of Friday’s price action and do you believe that after that kind of massive fall in NBFCs, that is a space that you would look at or do you think tighter liquidity conditions would continue to bear heavy on NBFCs and that is a space that you would be weary of right now?
Coming into this week, we are likely to see an environment of continued weakness in NBFCs, maybe not the stocks as much but we are likely to see higher tightness in the credit system. Their net interest margins are likely to fall, cost of lending as a result going to go up. Various other things are going to happen towards the end of this year -- elections are coming up, festive season is coming up. These are the periods when there is a higher credit demand. Higher credit demand plus tighter credit leads to a far negative environment for NBFCs in general as they would not be able to pass on the entire increase in credit costs.


What are you making of individual cases like IL&FS, now that the CEO as well has resigned? Would DHFL be a contagion kind of story? Could IL&FS really be that can of worms?
The IL&FS problems have been fairly well known for the last several months and it has kind of been doing the rounds in terms of how they are going to restructure IL&FS. IL&FS in isolation is not a big worry. On Friday, you also had DHFL, which was sold at a couple of percentage points higher yields.

That is a part of regular management of overall liquidity done by any fund. Against that backdrop, PSU banks have been lending low or rather have not been lending that much for the last couple of years and NBFCs have taken that space over.

If you have ALM mismatches and a knee-jerk reaction which usually translates into a tighter spread, that would hit the NBFC profitability margins. So, it is not any systemic issue but over the short term, it is likely to increase cost of borrowing and lending for NBFCs and the end customers and consumers.


Yes Bank after 40% fall or HDFC Bank after 15% fall -- which way would you lean? Where do you think there is more money to be made?
Following what happened to Yes Bank, in the medium term until they find a new MD, it could lead to a couple things. Yes Bank has been growing very strong and loan book growth rate has been very robust. Now that is likely to come down over the coming months because of the state of the bank itself.

If you look at the list of factors that RBI has laid out, there is going to be lower lending by Yes Bank. The question becomes what is the sustainable lending growth rate of Yes Bank over the next couple of years? Against that backdrop, the stock is trading at about the midpoint of its last 10 years’ valuations. It is not a particularly cheap stock even after the fall. And given the uncertainty of the last three months, I would rather stay away a little bit from Yes Bank.


You would have seen different phases in the market. You would have seen such kind of days before as well. We have seen historically that unless and until, there is some structural problem, these kind of things do not happen?
More than structural, this is more from a transactional point of view. Something is happening to IL&FS, people extrapolated it to DHFL. But I guess from a regulator perspective, one needs to watch the liquidity levels and be ready to do OMOs to manage the short-term liquidity. 

That is far more important for keeping markets stable because a long run is a series of short runs and if the regulators are able to manage the short runs better, then everything is fine over the medium term."

43,2018-09-25,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: August was a tricky month for domestic equity fund managers, as there was a spike in redemptions and a marked slowdown in flows to equity-linked funds, thanks to fragile investor sentiment amid US-China trade war, emerging market contagion and a rupee depreciation.

Amid such volatility, fund managers were busy buying some of the Nifty stocks such as Adani Ports & SEZ, Vedanta, Tech Mahindra, Indiabulls Housing, HDFC and Asian Paints, data showed. 


Top MF picks in volume terms

Adani Ports, where each of 18 funds held 2 per cent or less, saw the holding of the institutional category rise 15.4 per cent by the end of August from that in July. MFs held 3.95 crore Adani Ports shares at the end of August.

Some 18 funds raised their cumulative holding in ITC by 11.9 per cent in August from that in July. Among others, Tech Mahindra (up 11.9 per cent), Indiabulls Housing (up 10 per cent), HDFC (up 6.6 per cent) and Asian Paints (6.3 per cent) witnessed good buying by MFs during the month.

Bharti Infratel, TCS, Grasim Industries and Hindalco were other Nifty stocks that saw brisk buying by mutual funds during the month.

While inflows to equity funds rose 9 per cent month-on-month to Rs 28,300 crore by August end, redemptions surged 66.1 per cent month-on-month to Rs 22,400 crore. Net inflows to equity and equity-linked funds during the month stood at Rs 5,900 crore against an average of Rs 8,900 crore seen during the March-August period, data showed.


Increase in MF holdings in value terms

There were also counters where mutual fund holding rose in value terms, primarily due to a rise in stock prices. Six of the top 10 stocks that saw a largest change in mutual fund holding in August were from financials and technology sectors, said Motilal Oswal Securities.

BSE Bankex gained 2.4 per cent during the month, and BSE IT index 7 per cent. The Sensex gyrated in a 1,900-point range during the month, while Nifty50 swung in a 500-point range.

ICICI Bank saw net buying by eight of the top 20 funds. MFs collectively bought 40 lakh shares in the private lender. However, the change in mutual fund holding in the bank in value terms was largely in line with 12.7 per cent surge on the counter during the month.

In case of ITC, MF holdings increased by 7.2 million shares, or 0.8 per cent, to 924.4 million shares. The value of MF holding on the counter rose by 8.4 per cent, or Rs 2,280 crore, to Rs 29,570 crore. The stock rose 7.4 per cent during the month.

Axis Bank saw a drop in MF holding, but given the 18 per cent surge in stock price, the value of MF holding jumped 17 per cent during the month to Rs 15,430 crore. 

Reliance Industries was another preferred stocks among MFs in August, where 14 funds bought extra shares. The stock saw MF holding rise by 9.5 per cent, Rs 2,230 crore, in value terms even as the stock rose 4.6 per cent.

NTPC and Tech Mahindra were two other stocks which saw buying by mutual funds, even as the stocks logged gains.

56,2018-09-27,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity market came to a yet another uninspiring end on Thursday, as traders squared off positions on the expiry of September series future and options contract.

A weak rupee and tepid global cues along with firm oil prices caused further pain to investors on Dalal Street.

The BSE benchmark Sensex shut shop at 36,324.17, down 218.10 points, or 0.60 per cent while NSE Nifty settled the day 76.25 points, or 0.69 per cent lower at 10,977.55.

A poor show by bank and auto stocks was the reason behind Sensex’s 200-point fall. YES Bank was the worst performing stock in the 30-share index. It was followed by Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, ONGC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank.

TCS gained the most among Sensex stocks to settle 2.16 per cent up at Rs 2,187.80. Among other index leaders were Coal India, Asian Paints, Power Grid, Infosys and HUL.

Midcaps and smallcap stocks underperformed benchmark Sensex and lost nearly 2 per cent.

Among sectoral indices, Nifty IT index emerged to be the sole gainer amid a weakening rupee.

Pharma, realty, bank, financials, and auto indices shed up to 2.75 per cent.


What caused the fall?
F&O expiry: Volatility was the hallmark of Thursday's trade, as traders squared off positions on the expiry of September series F&O contracts.


No end to rupee's troubles: The rupee lost nearly 30 paise from its intraday high level despite government's effort to control current account deficit and strengthen rupee.

The government on Wednesday increased import duties on 19 items, including jet fuel and air conditioners, in a bid to check the widening current account deficit resulting from high crude oil prices and falling rupee.

The domestic currency was trading at 72.64 against the greenback at the time of writing this report. It had appreciated 20 paise against the US dollar at the open.


Oil prices gain 1%: The oil prices jumped over a per cent on Thursday, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supply once US sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in just five weeks' time. The most-active December Brent crude futures contract was up 59 cents at $81.38 a barrel, just off Tuesday's four-year high of $82.55, Reuters reported.




Weak global cues: Poor performance by Asian and European markets rubbed off on domestic shares too. 

Europe's share markets took a tumble as a report that Italy's long-awaited budget was facing a delay compounded an already groggy global mood after the third US interest rate rise of the year. The STOXX 600 was down 0.5 percent while the euro skidded all the way down past $1.17 in the currency market, according to a Reuters report.

In Asia, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended lower. Japan's Nikkei briefly touched an eight-month high but eventually ended down 1.0 per cent.

What experts say:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesThe Feds 25bps rate hike was in line with expectation whereas outflow of foreign funds and higher oil price weighed on the sentiment. Raising of import duty for essential goods, liquidity constraints with NBFC and F&O expiry added volatility in the market. This pressure is likely to continue till the financial market stabilizes and confidence reverts with accommodative valuation.


Jayant Manglik, President, Religare BrokingNifty slipped below the psychological mark of 11,000 as selling pressure resumed on the F&O expiry day. The news of rate hike by the US Fed fell in line with the market expectation and thus failed to attract any major reaction. However, the decline continued in banking and NBFC stocks which later joined by the others.

Markets are currently struggling mainly due to sentimental dent despite reaffirmation of liquidity support by the apex bank and other related agencies. The continuous fall in NBFC and banking counters is adding to that pressure. We reiterate our view to reduce position on bounce and waiting for further clarity. Also, we recommend keeping hedged positions on stock specific front and avoiding highly volatile counters."
57,2018-09-27,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extended losses to a second session in a row on Thursday, on sustained selling in bank, financial and auto stocks, as investors’ risk appetite remained subdued amid expiry of September series futures & options contracts.

The Sensex opened in the green and traded with gains for some time before giving up the gains amid weak global cues and a fresh slide in the rupee against the US dollar. 

A rise in global crude oil price, rupee’s weakness and listless trading in peer markets in the wake of US Fed’s rate hike also hit sentiment back home. 

Most emerging market stocks and currencies fell on Thursday after US Fed hiked policy rates by 25 basis points and signalled another rate hike in December. The US central bank foresees three more rate hikes next year and one in 2020, Reuters reported.

Equity barometer Sensex suffered a loss of 218 points, or 0.60 per cent, to settle at 36,324, with 17 stocks ending in the red and 13 in the green. NSE’s Nifty50 finished 76 points, or 0.69 per cent, lower at 10,977, with 19 stocks gaining and 31 losing.


Let's walk you through the highlights of Thursday's session:

300 stocks at 52-week lows on NSEAs many as 310 stocks, including Tata Motors, Vodafone Idea, Hudco, APL Apollo Tubes, IndiGo, Jet Airways (India) and JMT Auto, Karur Vysya Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Punjab & Sind Bank hit 52-week lows on NSE. Meanwhile, Monnet Ispat & Energy, Deepak Nitrite, Gangotri Textiles, Prakash Steelage and Ruchi Infrastructure featured among the 10 stocks that touched their 52-week highs on NSE.


Sensex movers and shakersYES Bank (down 9.14 per cent), Maruti (down 3.68 per cent), Tata Motors (down 3.32 per cent), Axis Bank (down 2.79 per cent) and ONGC (down 2.49 per cent) finished the day as top losers in the Sensex pack. TCS (up 2.16 per cent), Coal India (up 1.39 per cent), Asian Paints (up 0.97 per cent), PowerGrid (up 0.93 per cent) and Infosys (up 0.88 per cent) were among the top gainers. 


Crude oil on the boilTight supply ahead of US sanctions on Iran kept the oil market boiling. A Reuters report said crude oil prices rose nearly 1 per cent on Thursday, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supplies once US sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in five weeks. Opec did not indicate any plan to increase output at its meeting last Sunday, which is causing oil prices spiral up. 


Rupee sees seesaw tradeRupee swung between gains and losses. The government attempts to stem the fall in the rupee and keep current account deficit in check have not helped so far. The government on Wednesday raised import duty on a range of items including air-conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, footwear, jewellery, furniture fittings and tableware besides imposing it on aviation turbine fuel to try and boost the health of the rupee and keep CAD within the target range. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 4 paise higher at 72.57.

Ircon International’s tepid debut
Ircon International made a tepid debut, as the scrip got listed at Rs 410.30 on BSE, a 13.62 per cent discount to the issue price of Rs 475, mostly because of weak market sentiment. The scrip closed the day at Rs 416 on BSE, down 12.28 per cent from issue price.

67,2018-09-30,Asian Paints,"The Friday’s session saw a lot of volatility dominating the session, as NSE benchmark Nifty saw wild swings on either side. Despite trading in a defined range for the major part of the session, the market saw a sharp selloff in the second half of the trade.

Despite the Nifty recovering over 80 points from the day’s low, the index settled the day losing 47.10 points or 0.43 per cent.

As we approach fresh week and a month, we need to tread with caution. If we inspect several important data points of the past couple of days, it was seen that the level of 10,860 has been tested thrice and the Nifty managed to bounce back from there.

Monday is likely to see a stable start again, but we expect the Nifty to remain rangebound and tentative in approach. However, with each passing day, the technical pullback remains imminent.

Monday is likely to see the levels of 10,990 and 11,045 playing out as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in at 10,890 and 10,810 zones.


ETMarkets.com
The RSI on daily charts is 32.8807. A bullish divergence was seen on the charts as the Nifty set a fresh 14-period low, while the RSI did not. The daily MACD stayed bearish while trading below its signal line. No significant formations were seen on the charts.

If we take a broader view of the market, after nearly 800-point decline from the lifetime high, the Nifty is now showing some signs of a potential bottom formation on the short-term charts.

It also remains oversold on the short-term charts and shows high possibility of the technical pullback.

In event of any weakness, the level of 10,860 is likely to send support as the Nifty has pulled back twice after testing those levels again. Very low volumes in cash segment as compared to futures segment also point towards likely exhaustion in selling in the near term.

We strongly recommend staying away from creating shorts continue preserving liquidity for select purchases.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Long positions were seen being added in ONGC, GAIL, Axis Bank, Canfin Home, M&M Financial, ITC, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Jet Airways, Infosys, RPower, Tata Chemicals And Asian Paints.

2,2018-10-01,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices opened on a depressing note on Monday, amid weak signals from other Asian markets. Concerns over rising crude oil prices and uncertainty over RBI’s money policy outcome later this week weighed on investor sentiment. 

RBI’s money policy review, some macroeconomic numbers, rupee and oil price movements will be among the key market drivers this week, which will be a truncated one owing to Tuesday’s Gandhi Jayanti holiday. 

While the outlook for the broader market remains uncertain, analysts see stock-specific opportunities across sectors. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are top 10 stocks that are expected to log gains over the next three weeks. 


Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities

The Indian Hotels Company| Buy| Target price: Rs 151| Stop loss: Rs 128
As per weekly timeframe chart, The Indian Hotels has been moving in a larger consolidation pattern for last few months. Currently, the stock is holding on to its support at Rs 125, which led to a sustainable rise in price on multiple occasions in the past. The formation of long lower shadows in the last couple of weeks indicates the emergence of buying interest from the lows. The weekly 14-period RSI has turned up from near the 40 level, which suggests possibility that the upside momentum will pick up pack in the coming weeks. “One may look to buy Indian Hotels at the current market price of Rs 138 and add more on dips down to Rs 133. Hold it for an upside target of Rs 151 over next 3-5 weeks. Keep a stop loss at Rs 128,” Shetti said.


Cyient| Buy| Target price: Rs 825| Stop loss: Rs 705
On weekly timeframe, this IT stock has been moving up consistently forming higher lows over the past few months. After showing weakness recently, this stock saw a smart bounce last week and closed higher. Last week’s low could now be considered, as the new higher bottom of the sequence. According to this pattern, one may expect further bounce in the stock price in coming weeks. “The overall chart pattern is showing an opportunity to create long trading positions. Buying can be initiated in Cyient at the current market price of Rs 750. Add more on dips down to Rs 719 and hold for the upside target of Rs 825 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 705,” Shetti said. 


Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, senior technical analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas


Axis Bank| Buy| Target price: Rs 677| Stop loss: Rs 586 
This stock clearly outperformed the bank index during the week gone by. The weekly chart shows the Axis Bank stock has taken support near its crucial weekly moving averages and has taken off from there on. The daily chart shows the stock has the potential to start the next upward move. In the last session, it formed a bullish outside bar on the daily chart. Thus, from here on, the stock is expected to march higher and can head to an all-time high of Rs 677.

Infosys| Buy| Target price: Rs 800| Stop loss: Rs 700 
This stock has been rallying smartly in a multi-month rising channel. The recent correction found support near the junction of 40-day exponential moving average, the daily lower Bollinger Band and the lower channel line. Near these crucial parameters, the stock has formed a base for itself and is ready for the next leg up. In terms of bar patterns, the stock has formed a Popgun pattern on the daily chart, whose follow-through is expected on the upside.


Tata Global Beverages| Buy| Target price: Rs 255| Stop loss: Rs 227
This stock has been in the consolidation phase for last few sessions. Structurally, the consolidation looks mature now and the stock is expected to break out on the upside. The larger picture shows the stock has been falling in a channelised manner and has taken support near the lower channel line. From there, the stock has entered the pullback mode, subdividing it into lower degree waves. The daily momentum indicator is already in bullish mode, whereas the weekly momentum indicator has given a fresh buy signal.


Mazhar Mohammad, chief strategist for technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Exide Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 290| Stop loss: Rs 250
A strong recovery in last Wednesday’ session after retesting the panic low of Rs 254 registered on September 21 suggests that the bottom is in place for this stock at around Rs 254 mark. Positional traders can look to buy this stock at current price and on declines up to Rs 258 level and look for a target of Rs 290 over time. “As the market is in a volatile phase, traders are advised to maintain a bit wider stop around Rs 250 level,” Mohammad said.

ITC | Buy | Target price: Rs 316 | Stop loss: Rs 287
After positive closing in last two sessions, this counter is pointing to some sort of bottom formation around Rs 289 level despite the wild fluctuations. Traders can initiate fresh buying for a target of Rs 316, with a stop loss of Rs 287.

1,2018-10-01,Asian Paints,"Jay Thakkar of Anand Rathi has a buy call on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,330.

The current market price of Asian Paints is Rs 1,294.05.

3,2018-10-02,Asian Paints,"The government’s choice of Uday Kotak to lift the multi-billion Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd out of bankruptcy should be no surprise. He is one of the few bankers in the country who have navigated banking crises successfully not once, but at least thrice.

Even for Uday Kotak — who witnessed the Harshad Mehta scandal in the early 1990s, the CRB scam, the bursting of the tech bubble and the post Lehman credit crisis — the job at hand is of monstrous proportion. The balance sheet size of IL&FS is Rs 1,15,815 crore.

What is Kotak’s selling point? A sense of caution. When many bankers were getting carried away by the growth opportunities from infrastructure lending, Kotak saw what all could go wrong. And everything has unfolded just the way he anticipated.

Thanks to his belief that banks are not designed to lend to infrastructure, his bank managed to keep bad loans low at 2.17% of total bad loans when it was 10.69% for India’s largest lender State Bank of India.

One of Kotak’s jobs is to untangle the numerous subsidiaries and associate companies which have mushroomed over the years under IL&FS. Should he aim to revive the institution, or seek moratorium on payments, sell assets and pay as and when an asset is monetised? That’s a difficult question to answer, but the rainmaker in Kotak could make it easy for government.

His instinct for deal making is legendary — from selling the ‘Good Knight’ mosquito coil brand to Godrej, to stepping in to buy a controversial stake in Asian Paints on behalf of UK’s ICI, to the takeover of ING Vysya Bank — all testify to his ability to sell assets at a valuation that few would complain about.

A key principle that Kotak has kept as a bedrock of his business is to keep it simple. That helps him see the risks associated with complicated lending practices and instruments that could initially appear exotic but blow up during times of stress.

While his business has thrived for more than three decades during the ups and downs of the Indian economic cycle, Kotak’s desire to live through the tests could help him overcome the obstacles at IL&FS too.

“If what you create does not outlive you, then you have failed,” Kotak had told ET in an interview. “The thing that excited me then, and that excites me now, is the fun in the journey, and not the destination.”

Over a period, Kotak Mahindra Bank has become a lender with a market value of Rs 2.14 lakh crore, but what has guided Kotak has been the belief that he has to fend for himself and ‘there’s no big brother’ to bail him out. The task before him now is challenging and he will need all his wits to revive IL&FS and bring down its debt."
4,2018-10-03,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices took a beating on Wednesday ahead of the kick start of three-day RBI policy review. 

Investors were worried over a sharp plunge in rupee's value to an all-time low level of 73 against dollar amid a surge in crude oil prices globally. The market was also concerned over escalating Italian crisis.

At 9.22 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 146.97 points, or 0.40 per cent, lower at 36,379.17. Nifty barometer Nifty50 was testing 10,950 level and was down 53.25 points, or 0.48 per cent.

The index will find support at 10,821, while the 11,050-level will act as its resistance, IIFL said in a note.

Fear guage India VIX spiked 5 per cent to 17.66. Midcap and smallcap indices performed relatively well and were trading flat.

Shares of Maruti Suzuki fell 2.10 per cent to Rs 7,308.85. It was followed by Asian Paints, Wipro, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel and Axis Bank which declined between 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent. 

YES Bank surged 6.11 per cent to Rs 214.30. Sun Pharma, ONGC and Adani Ports rose up to 1 per cent."
5,2018-10-03,Asian Paints,"The domestic equity markets witnessed an impulsive correction in September. As a result, nearly 60 per cent of the Nifty50 stocks breach their respective support at the 200-day moving average (DMA). 

As of September 28, 2018, blue chips such as Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Coal India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, YES Bank, UPL, Tata Steel, Eicher Motors, Grasim Industries, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment and Kotak Mahindra Bank were trading below their 200-DMAs.



When a stock falls below its 200-DMA, it generally means it is trading below its last one-year’s average price. The 200-DMA is most commonly used indicator among traders and investors as it typically represents one working year. 

The average is perceived to be the dividing line between a stock that is technically healthy and one that is not. Furthermore, the percentage of stocks above their 200-day moving averages helps determine the overall health of the market.

However, when a stock dips below its 200-DMA, it in a way gets oversold and shows signs of recovery and a possible technical pullback. It also offers good entry points to investors from a medium-term perspective.

“What we saw in the market in September was a sharp revision to the mean. Mean revision is a powerful concept wherein we see a market return to its average,” says Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“This usually occurs when the market runs up much ahead of its curve. With regard to largecaps that are trading on, near or below their 200-DMAs, many -- but not all -- have shown signs of bottoming out. In this kind of a market, investors should remain with largecaps and use these levels to make bargain purchases,” he said.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said historical behaviour of a particular indicator or technical tool should be given due importance while making buy and sell decisions in technical analysis and the 200-DMA is not an exception to that rule.

“Technically, we can conclude that stocks that breached 200-day moving averages are in a longer-term downtrend, which may not be practically true because often we find stocks or indices breaching 200-day moving averages for a brief period and then resuming their uptrend,” he said.

For instance, Maruti Suzuki breached its 200-day moving average in May and stayed below it for a couple of days and then resumed its uptrend from the low of Rs 8,255 to move all the way to Rs 9,929. A similar thing happened with HDFC Bank in December 2016. 

“Just a breach of 200-DMA is not an indication to stay away from a scrip, especially if it is from the largecap segment. Along with this average, it is important to consider the larger trend and direction of the market. Unless the entire market itself is reversing, we should not avoid such largecaps. They should be considered an opportunity to create fresh longs by looking at various other technical parameters,” Mohammad said.

However, Ruchit Jain, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking, said largecaps that have breached their 200 DMAs in this correction are likely to continue the underperformance in the near term.

“Traders should avoid bottom fishing in such stocks. A prudent strategy for traders should be to avoid bottom fishing at current juncture. In such times, weekly charts should be given more weightage and only when a reversal pattern is formed on the higher time frame charts, should traders look at opportunities for stock picking,” Jain said. 

He said this market could correct further in the near term and hence, traders should wait on the sidelines and be vigilant on market moves.

Other analysts also said while over half of the largecaps are trading below their 200-DMAs, only a few of them look attractive.

Mohammad said one can look at the HDFC twins and Kotak Mahindra Bank at present, as they appear to have formed a short-term base after breaching their 200 DMAs. Asian Paints also looks good as it is taking support on its 200 DMA.

“As Maruti Suzuki is trading far below its 200-day moving average, traders or investors should avoid this for the time being till the price stabilises at a particular point,” he said.

Vaishnav said stocks from pharma, infrastructure, IT, metals and energy sectors qualify for bargain hunting at this moment. “The main reason for selecting these sectors and leaving the rest out is that they have clearly outperformed the broader market on a relative basis and are improving on their relative momentum when benchmarked against the broader market,” he said.

IT stocks Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies are now trading above their 200 DMAs. Reliance Industries (RIL) and ICICI Bank were also trading above their 200 DMAs as of September 28, 2018."

What triggered the fall?


1. Rupee hits record low, again: The domestic unit created a fresh record low of 74.28 against the US dollar on Tuesday as the global crude oil prices reclaimed the $84 per barrel mark and strength in American currency overseas. The rupee had opened with gains against the greenback.


2. Oil back above $84The oil again turned out to be a sore point for the markets as the global crude prices rose in today's trade on the back of growing evidence of falling crude exports from Iran before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions and a partial shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Michael.

Benchmark Brent crude was up 65 cents at $84.56 a barrel, having fallen as low as $82.66 on Monday. Brent hit a four-year high of $86.74 last week. US light crude was up 45 cents at $74.74, Reuters reported.


3. India likely to miss fiscal deficit target: Moody'sGlobal financial services firm Moody's Investors Service sees fiscal deficit at 3.4 per cent of GDP in FY19. The government plans to reduce fiscal deficit to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 from 3.53 per cent a year ago. The fiscal deficit target for 2018-19 is Rs 6.24 lakh crore.


4. Emerging Markets near 17-month lowsEmerging market stocks dipped close to 17-month lows on Tuesday as the IMF cut its 2018 and 2019 global growth forecasts, putting more pressure on developing economies already facing tighter financial conditions and capital outflows, as per a Reuters report.

MSCI's main emerging market stocks index was 0.1 per cent lower, around levels last hit in May 2017.

European shares too stayed at 6-month lows as concerns over a likely clash in Europe over Italy's budget plans and a worsening outlook for global growth kept sentiment fragile.


What experts say:
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesVolatility continued in the market in spite of which short-term investors are accumulating select beaten down stocks with an eye on upcoming quarter earnings. However, negative sentiments from global market on concerns over a slowing world economy led by lingering trade wars between US & China dragged the market.


Jayant Manglik, President, Religare BrokingAmongst the broader market indices, BSE Midcap outperformed the benchmark and ended with marginal losses while BSE Smallcap fell broadly in-line with benchmark. The sectoral indices exhibited a mixed trend. IT, Metals and Healthcare ended on a positive note. However, Auto, Consumer Durables, FMCG and Oil and Gas witnessed selling pressure and closed down in range of 1.7-3.9%"
16,2018-10-09,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A day after logging gains, the domestic equity market returned to the negative territory on Tuesday on losses in select auto, FMCG, bank and energy heavyweights amid a record-setting fall in the rupee and uninspiring global cues.

Cautious investors kept their bets restrained ahead of corporate earnings, while absence of any positive trigger kept sentiments subdued.

Analysts said the market may slide further due to concerns around rising crude oil prices after US sanctions on Iran comes into effect next month. 

Nomura (India) said a further 5-10 per cent downside in the Indian stock indices in the near term cannot be ruled out. 

International ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said the cut in excise duty on petroleum products will inflate fiscal deficit and reduce combined Ebitda margins of IOC, HPCL and BPCL by Rs 6,500 crore this financial year.

The 30-share Sensex ended 175 points, or 0.51 per cent, down at 34,299, with 15 stocks ending in the red. The Nifty50 finished 47 points, or 0.45 per cent, lower at 10,301, with 25 stocks ending in the green and 25 in the red. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell in sync with the benchmark Sensex. In terms of percentage loss, they were slightly better off than Sensex. The midcap index settled 0.16 per cent down at 13,703 while the smallcap index closed with a 0.45 per cent loss at 13,501.

Agencies

Rupee hit record lowThe domestic currency touched fresh record low of 74.35 against the US dollar today after Brent crude breached the $84 a barrel mark again and the American currency strengthened overseas. Unabated foreign fund outflows amid strong demand of US currency weighed on the rupee. At the time of writing this report, the domestic unit was trading 22 paise lower at 74.29.

10,2018-10-09,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic headline indices Sensex and Nifty opened higher on Tuesday amid optimism triggered by rupee's rise against the US dollar and easing global crude oil prices. 

The rupee on Tuesday opened 22 paise higher at 73.85 against dollar due to some selling in American currency by banks and exporters.

Dollar slipped against yen on simmering anxiety about higher US bond yields, the Sino-US trade war and political turmoil in Europe.

A fresh spell of buying emerged across sectors. Barring telecom, auto and consumer durables, all sectoral indices were in the green on BSE.

Asian peers were mixed. The Shanghai SE Composite Index and Hang Seng were in the green zone, but Nikkei declined over 1 per cent.

Around 9:25 am, the 30-share Sensex was 146 points, or 0.42 per cent, up at 34,620, with 22 stocks trading with gains.

The NSE Nifty was 46 points, or 0.45 per cent, up at 10,394, with 32 stocks advancing and 18 declining.

Shares of YES Bank jumped nearly 5 per cent, leading the pack of Sensex gainers. It was followed by Adani Ports, Coal India, HDFC, Larsen & Toubro and Hero MotoCorp. 

Tata Motors, ICICI Bank, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel and Kotak Mahindra Bank were among the laggards in the Sensex kitty of stocks. 

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were outperforming Sensex. The midcap index was 0.63 per cent up at 13,811, while the smallcap index was 0.52 per cent up at 13,633 around the same time.

BSE Metal pack was witnessing decent traction. Most componenets in the index were trading with gains. Coal India, SAIL, Naclo, Vedanta and Tata Steel were top index gainers.

17,2018-10-11,Asian Paints,"A fair value of Indian markets is still 10-15% away, but there is value in IT, pharma and export-oriented auto stocks, 
Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

Do you really think that US equities are seeing a big trend reversal or is it just sentimental knee-jerk reactions? 
I really do not know that much about US equities. My reckoning is fair value for the Indian market. It is at least 10%, perhaps 15% away. I have been saying this for the last one year or so that the market is significantly overvalued. Yes, we have corrected meaningfully but I still think that the Nifty and the Sensex is overvalued. 

The biggest pocket of overvaluation in the Indian market was in financial services stocks. Their valuations made no sense at all a month or so ago. I still think there is a further derating to come in wholesale funded lenders in particular but there is still value in IT. There is lots of value in pharma and export oriented auto stocks are still worth buying. There are pockets of value in the Indian market but the overall market and especially wholesale funded lenders are very significantly overvalued.


At what point would you say India holds value?
I do not think anybody can invest by looking at the market day to day. That is just for getting stomach ulcers rather than getting rich. It is exactly for this reason that legends like Robert Kirby created the Coffee Can Portfolio where you buy your bunch of high quality stocks such as HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Marico and you hold them through. There is no way on earth where you can buy stocks and react to events like last week or a day like today. You will never make any money. You just give yourself heartburn, blood pressure and stomach ulcers.


How do you get the conviction to buy at any price point? 
One of the key parts of our jobs -- whether you are on buy side, sell side, in the media or an investor, is to decipher the signal, the underlying structural trend from the noise. The signal in our country is that the Indian investor has given up the ghost of making money from real estate and land and so on and has decided that financial assets is the way forward. 

There might be a temporary lull in that because of what we are seeing in the stock market and the bond market at the moment but the structural trend towards financial assets is not going to go away in India. 

Secondly, our stock market is fortunate and the economy is fortunate that there have been a dozen and a half companies in the Indian market who over the last decade have shown that they can systematically allocate capital and generate solid results. The names that I mentioned, Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, Marico are three of examples but I will say there are dozen-and-a-half strong portfolio of great companies which consistently allocate capital in good times and bad times. So you focus on the underlying signal, the signal is real estates’ days are behinds us. 

Whatever is left of residential real estate as an asset class will be turned into rabble over next six months as our housing finance companies face funding challenges and hence the shift towards financial assets is here to stay. 

Secondly, we do have high class companies in the Indian stock market with high class management teams, great capital allocation and the focus has to be on investing in them. It could be TCS in the IT sector. It could be Marico in FMCG. It could be HDFC in the banking sector but you have to focus on quality rather than trying to time market and figuring out what will happen with the Fed and in America and with our own policies.


TCS is slated to come out with its numbers today. How much of the good news is already priced in? 
In October-November last year, exactly a year ago, I started banging the drum on IT. My reckoning is the sort of currency tailwind that the IT sector has, will lead to business wins. It is impossible to believe that given the sort of currency tailwinds the Indian IT sector has got, they will not see sharply higher business wins in the coming quarters. 

Secondly, unless a miracle saves India, the rupee is likely to fall further. If you had to look at one sector in the Indian economy where there is a complete competitive reset, it is Indian IT. 

Within Indian IT, focus on the scale gorilla, focus on a company with 30% ROCE almost a 100% dividend payout ratio. In times like this, let us not try to second guess its PE multiple and say whether it is fully valued or not. There is enormous competitive tailwinds to Indian IT sector and it will be sort of a second guessing of a very high order to say TCS is fully valued at this juncture. 


Is midcap IT likely to match up with the performance of some of the frontline names considering secord quarter is traditionally a strong quarter for IT?
You are right. This is in a way the analogue of midcap stocks in the broader economy where they do not have any tailwinds anymore. Midcap stocks in the broader economy, excluding IT and pharma, have negative tailwinds as their margins get crunched and as they lose top line growth as well. Midcap IT is likely to do well. If I had to choose one player in the middle segment of IT, I would go for L&T Infotech. All these guys will get currency tailwinds but L&T Infotech is a well managed firm and I think there is good reason to believe beyond producing good results L&T Infotech will use this currency tailwind to strengthen its competitive position over the next three, four quarters.


The RBI paused on rates this time around and that kind of unnerved the markets as well. They are going to do calibrated tightening but they are also concerned about inflation.
Let us break it into two parts; our authorities both in Delhi and in Mumbai deserve a lot of credit. There is a lot of work going on behind the scenes to ensure that the Indian economy and the financial market get a soft landing. After all, once interest rates start rising and the economic cycle starts decelerating, there will be trouble for wholesale funded lenders. 

Our authorities deserve a lot of credit for working very hard behind the scenes to ensure a soft landing for the financial system. That being said, I am still not sure that investors how they have recognised just how big a reset the NBFC valuations deserve to become aligned to reality. 

Almost every wholesale funded lender in India can give up the ghost of growing its balance sheet over the next 12 months. It is not going to be possible. At best, well run wholesale funded lenders can keep their loan book at broadly the same level as it is today but they will become an ex-growth sector and I do not think valuations reflect that as yet. 

The incredible runup in the stock prices yesterday suggests that investor in wholesale funded lenders are still on cool aid and have not come to recognise the fundamental reset that valuations for this sector deserves. Our authorities are doing their job, it is the investors that need to come to their senses with regards to this very large sector of in the Indian stock market.


The consumption theme always finds favour in the market despite high valuations as we step into an extended festive season. Is Zee Entertainment’s numbers telling you that the consumption story is far from done?
I agree with you. Wherever consumption is not funded through credit, by taking loans from banks and NBFCs, we will be in a pretty good shape. Whether it is FMCG or electricals, that element will hold up quite nicely. Where the challenge will kick in obviously is the consumption sector where the spend is heavily financed by borrowings from banks and NBFCs. So, car and truck OEMs look vulnerable from a top line growth perspective. But electricals, the broader aspirational consumption play FMCG, are still in a decent shape and will hold up nicely through the festive season."
18,2018-10-13,Asian Paints,"In an interaction with ET NOW, Sanjiv Bhasin, IIFL, talks about the stocks and sectors that look poised to bounce back; offers his view on IT, pharma and FMCG and reveals where he is putting his money at going into 2019. Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Do you think that the worst of the fall is behind us or do you sense a further weakness dependent on how much the US equities fall?

Sanjiv Bhasin: The markets were underperforming of late more due to local issues like the IL&FS fiasco, oil rally and rupee weakness. The much needed Dow correction is now telling you that there is a lot of uncertainty and the oil bulls is where you are seeing a lot of weakness. For the Indian markets, it only means good news as the dollar is weakening. Now the emerging markets, particularly India, should see a lot of constructive buying and we are positive on this fall and have rather used this fall to buy. 

Another 500-600 points on the upside are definitely on the cards and if I can stick my neck out I would say Nifty could climb to even 10,800 to 11,000 by Diwali.


ET Now: Focussing on IT sector at large, how much of the optimism, do you think is already baked in into the prices? Should good number in earnings be used as opportunities to profit take?

Sanjiv Bhasin: Over the last two-three weeks we have been saying that use all rallies in IT to exit. TCS has come out with the excellent numbers but they also indicated that this weakness in rupee just aided margins of about 1% or so in this quarter where the rupee has fallen around 12 per cent. It tells us that it is a myth that weak rupee is going to give IT companies large income on the treasury side. 

I think most of the IT companies are well hedged and are fully priced. If we want to play the weak rupee, we would rather play it through pharma. But there are a plethora of stocks and sectors which are beaten down fairly. To name a few, we have are positive on - Maruti, Bajaj Finance, Eicher Motor, UltraTech - the real hardcore India where we think the pessimism was overdone. 

IT will rightly take a back seat, all rallies will be used to sell and if rupee strengthens more then the local cyclical should do relatively well for the remainder of this month and next.


ET Now: How are you reading into Hindustan Unilever’s performance and what indication does it give to you for FMCGs at large?

Sanjiv Bhasin: The numbers were highly impressive given they have been able to maintain margins at 21 per cent and overcome the double whammies of rising interest rates and oil. They have hedged themselves perfectly. These numbers tell you that the consumption part, particularly the one on personal care, is doing extremely strong. HUL has indicated strong numbers on the cream side and on the hair shampoo side and it will only start to get a bigger fillip given they have a better period coming ahead after the shraad. HUL’s numbers tell you that the correction in some of the FMCG stocks may have been overdone and this is a good time to buy some of these names. 


ET Now: What do you think should either be bought or avoided in near-term?

Sanjiv Bhasin: I would advise staying away from IT. You may see a decline in some IT stocks post the Q2 results as the best of IT has played out. Focus on sectors and stocks where pessimism has given an opportunity to buy and be with some of the bellwether stocks. Some of the names like I said earlier are - Reliance, UltraTech, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Maruti and Eicher. Some of these names are showing a lot of strength. They have been resilient in this fall but the other pedigree names on the consumption side are likely to bounce back very fast after this one-quarter hiatus. We are underweight on IT and overweight on pharma as a rupee proxy but cyclicals is where we are putting our money going into 2019."
19,2018-10-15,Asian Paints,"Elections, high crude oil prices, weak rupee and tradewar concerns make the outlook for the stock market hazy. But the likely weakness in the market may make share valuations cheaper over the next few months. Analysts say the best strategy for retail investors will be to spread out their investments over the next few months to reduce the risk of committing money at higher prices when the sentiment is wobbly. While the most popular way of doing it is systematic investment plans, or SIPs, through mutual funds, those who want to hold shares in their demat accounts could do these staggered investments through stock brokers. “While doing this there is no burden of making lump sum investments at one time. This works in both bull and bear markets, as the average cost of holdings improves if one sticks to the strategy,” said Deepak Jasani, head of research at HDFC Securities. ET spoke to four brokerages for their stock picks to build a portfolio through SIPs and the strategy investors need to follow.


HDFC SECURITIESDeepak Jasani of HDFC Securities advises a stock SIP portfolio of better-known medium-risk stocks and lesser-known high-risk stocks. Jasani advises investors to opt for a better-known stocks SIP if they have a lower risk appetite and opt for a lesser-known stocks SIP if their risk appetite is higher. He advises keeping ratio equal in terms of value of stocks in both the stock SIP options. Jasani said one should be invested in these stocks for a period that coincides with trend cycle of stocks, which is 15-18 months, but added that one should review the portfolio every six months. Investors can choose as many stocks from the list as they wish or add the stocks out of the list that they have tracked and want to accumulate over time, he said. Ideally one should do SIPs in 4-6 stocks. At the end of the 15-18 months, they may extend the SIP period or stop the SIP and wait for an opportune time to sell the stocks if they are in good profit, he said.



GEOJIT SECURITIESIn the current market environment, it would be wise to start with a stock SIP with a mix of high-quality sectors and stock ideas available at cheaper valuations compared to the averages of the past three years, said Geojit. Given the risk-taking ability, 15-30 per cent can be spread on opportunities in auto, pharma and NBFCs, with a view that equity market will stabilise over the next two quarters. Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Securities, recommends a portfolio for defensive as well as aggressive investors. He advises equal ratio of investment in UPL, Titan, IndusInd Bank, HCL Technologies and Asian Paints in defensive-stock SIPs. For aggressive investors, Nair recommends allocating 20 per cent in Tata Motors, 15 per cent each in Can Fin Homes and Capital First and 25 per cent each in Inter-Globe Aviation and Ashok Leyland. One can go on to hold these SIPs for 2-3 years.


IDBI CAPITALThe brokerage advises doing an SIP investment spread over the next 12 months given that the market is still showing a bearish inclination. The elections are coming in the next 6-8 months, while depreciating rupee, rising crude oil prices and global trade war tensions are posing other concerns, said IDBI Capital. “The SIP can be done as a basket investment with 14 to 20 stocks with a periodicity of a month or fortnight,” said IDBI Capital. The brokerage’s list of beaten-down and deep-value stocks includes Aditya Birla Capital, Ashok Leyland, BSE, Bharat Electronics, NBCC, Sun TV, YES Bank and Federal Bank.




IIFL
IIFL is focusing on stocks more from the large cap space, which are not likely to get impacted by liquidity crisis and which will continue to see strong growth going forward. “Our focus is on quality companies which have been beaten down. We are focusing on stocks more from the large-cap space, rather than telling people to bottomfish in midcaps,” said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL. The investing ratio in each stock should be 25 per cent. He advises an SIP portfolio of Bajaj Finance, RIL, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance."

24,2018-10-19,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices took a beating on Friday morning amid a global selloff, thanks to concerns over a slowing global economy. Concerns over likely Fed rate hikes and Italy's expansionary budget too weighed in on the sentiment. 

 Data showed China’s economy grew 6.5 per cent in September quarter. The growth came in lower than the consensus estimate of 6.6 per cent. This along with a slump in US stocks in overnight trade hurt the domestic sentiment. 

 At 9.30 am, the BSE Sensex traded 263 points, or 0.76 per cent, lower at 34,516. The index had fallen nearly 500 points in opening trade. Nifty50 was ruling at 10,374.90, down 78.15 points, or 0.75 per cent. The index hit a low of 10,304.60 in early trade.

Shares of Reliance Industries declined 5.68 per cent to Rs 1,083.60. The company on Wednesday reported a 17.35 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit for the September quarter at Rs 9,516 crore, below estimate of Rs 9,629 crore projected by analysts in an ET Now poll. 

YES Bank, Infosys, TCS and Hero MotoCorp declined 3.95 epr cent, 2.98 epr cent, 1.83 per cent and 1.59 per cent, respectively.

Sun Pharma bucked the weak trend. The stock rose 1.73 per cent to Rs 603.70. Asian Paints, Tata Steel, NTPC aqnd Adani Ports added 1.07 per cent, 0.74 per cent, 0.72 per cent and 0.63 per cent, respectively.

UltraTech Cement, SBI Life, ICICI Securities, BEPL and Bombay Wire Ropes are among a haldful companies, which will announce their quarterly results later in the day.

Earlier in the day, Asia markets dropped as global sentiment soured on issues ranging from trade worries, Italy’s 2019 budget, higher US interest rates and growth concerns in China that led to a slump in Chinese shares in the previous session, Reuters reported. 

In overnight trade , the Dow Jones Industrial Average index tanked 1.27 per cent, the S&P500 index declined 1.44 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.06 per cent on Thursday.

The Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy path would raise the risks of recession in an economy where recent, unexpectedly strong growth may start to taper anyway, Reuters reported St Louis Fed President James Bullard as saying on Thursday."
25,2018-10-19,Asian Paints,"The bears hijacked the proceedings on Dalal Street on Friday, dragging equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty close to 2 per cent. 

The Nifty slipped below the 10,300 mark as 39 of its constituents dropped up to 14 per cent. Indiabulls Housing Finance and YES Bank led the index losers.

At 1357 hours (IST), the 50-share index was down 193 points while the 30-share BSE Sensex fell 622 points to 34,157. 

Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here is a list of five factors that are dragging the market.


Fed worries: Subdued global cues
Weak global cues weighed market sentiment. All Asian markets traded in the red, as higher US interest rates, growth concerns in China and global trade tensions weighed on investors’ risk appetite. The US market ended sharply lower, on worries over global growth and investors continued to weigh minutes of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting, which were viewed as hawkish. In overnight trade Dow closed 1.27 per cent, or 327 points, down at 25,379 on October 18.


Foreign money outflow
Foreign investors have pulled out over Rs 20,000 crore from the domestic markets so far in October amid an unabated fall in the rupee and rising crude oil prices and a spike in US treasury yields. 


Double whammy of trade deficit & rupee fall
Traders were cautious after SBI Economic Research said the rupee depreciation has neither helped improve exports nor slowed imports, leading to an incremental trade deficit of $4 billion in the first half of the financial year. Exports entered the negative zone after five months, contracting 2.15 per cent in September to $27.95 billion due to a dip in shipments in key sectors, including engineering and gems & jewellery segments, even as trade deficit narrowed to a five-month low. Imports grew 10.45 per cent in September to $41.9 billion, according to commerce ministry data released Monday. The local currency depreciated over 15 per cent on a year-to-date basis till October 17.


Selling in heavyweights
Market participants appeared disappointed with second quarter earnings of oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries (RIL). The scrip slipping 5 per cent in morning trade to Rs 1,091. Among others Infosys (down 3 per cent) and YES Bank (7 per cent) also lost significant weight. HDFC, ITC and Asian Paints capped some of the downside. On Wednesday, RIL posted a record quarterly profit for Q2FY19, helped by strong profit from its petrochemicals and telecom businesses. However, its gross refining margin, or profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, fell to a three-and-a-half-year low at $9.50 a barrel.


Domestic growth worries
Sentiments were dampened after CLSA signalled an impact on economic growth due to current tightness in the credit market, though the impact is unlikely to remain way beyond the next two quarters, notwithstanding the cautious view on the domestic equity market."
27,2018-10-20,Asian Paints,"The quarterly earnings season has begun in full swing. However, price behaviour of certain companies seems illogical. The trend of analyst expectations and comparison of results with such expectations post the actual announcement has fooled the majority.

It is presumed that analyst expectations are godsend and if those expectations are meet, then it means a company has performed well during the quarter. But the reality of Mr Market is totally different.

For example, Reliance Industries’ Q2FY19 numbers were as per analyst expectations and the company delivered a bottomline growth of 17.4 per cent YoY and topline growth of 54.5 per cent YoY on a consolidated basis. Post the result, majority of the brokerages also raised price targets for the conglomerate by 20-30 per cent. Nonetheless, the stock substantially cracked 5 per cent, immediately after the results announcement denuding analyst estimates.

TCS reported a consolidated Q2FY19 net profit of Rs 7,901 crore, up 7.6 per cent QoQ, along with a healthy Ebitda growth of 13.3% compared with that in the previous quarter. The numbers were in line, in analyst terminology. Yet, the stock fell some 12 per cent in the ensuing period. Mindtree is another such example, which fell despite a 30 per cent QoQ profit growth.

From these facts we can infer that investors should read the results without any bias by comparing the QoQ and YoY numbers. In addition, if valuations itself are very high from a historical perspective, then no matter what, the prices will fall irrespective of good numbers. There is no point giving too much attention to analyst estimates or poll numbers.


Event of the Week
Nifty faced a tumultuous week even as a number of companies announced their earnings. Banking and housing finance companies such as DCB Bank reported a 25 per cent rise in PAT, whereas Federal Bank clocked 3.15 per cent lower NIMs than 3.31 per cent report for the year-ago period. But profits were slightly better.

Indiabulls Housing Finance on the other hand reported a 21 per cent YoY increase in PAT; Crisil posted 29% YoY PAT growth and NIIT a whopping 59 per cent YoY PAT increase. Technology companies have posted strong growth this quarter mainly due to rupee depreciation, but in spite of all these, stocks have corrected and will continue to correct as valuations are still high in the IT sector.


Technical OutlookThe Nifty 50 has turned very volatile with gaps visible on the daily charts. Previous week’s hammer formation and this week’s shooting star formation indicate confusion in the market. It looks like bullish and bearish tendencies are balancing out. The market is, therefore, expected to enter the consolidation phase till expiry. Downside is capped in the 10,000- 10,100 zone on the Nifty50 and on the upside, there is resistance at 10,900.

Traders are advised not to take positions till volatility reduces to normal levels, else stop losses will have to be wider and chances of whipsaw losses are very high.

Others

Expectations for the Week
The current phase of range-bound movement in the market is expected to continue in the following week. With the froth in some stocks beginning to be washed away, going forward we believe no new low prices will be reached, at least in the short term till expiry. However, volatility will remain high due to the macro uncertainty and rising fear of trade wars and oil price impact globally.

With the earnings season gaining momentum, it would be important to keep an eye on Asian Paints, Can Fin Homes, Bajaj Finance, Ambuja Cements, Bajaj Auto, Indigo, Kotak Bank, Bharti Airtel, Maruti, Piramal Enterprise, YES Bank, Dr Reddy’s and a few others for directional clues for the market.

The short-term mood will be mainly guided by corporate results. Therefore, investors are advised to be very selective in purchases and avoid any leverage at this juncture.

The Nifty50 ended the week 1.62 per cent lower at 10,303."
28,2018-10-21,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The week gone by induced further pessimism in the market, as the benchmark indices saw deep cuts amid concerns over financial health and liquidity crisis in the NBFC sector, rising oil prices and a fast weakening rupee.

The BSE Sensex dropped 417.95 points, or 1.20 per cent, for the week to settle at 34,315 on Friday, while the Nifty50 tanked 168.95 points, or 1.61 per cent, to end at 10,303. Friday’s selloff wiped off Rs 1.60 lakh crore of equity investors’ wealth.

Even some solid earnings numbers from blue chip firms like Reliance Industries and Infosys failed to lift the mood. Sustained capital outflow has created a gloomy atmosphere, dealing a body blow to risk-appetite. Every rise in market is meeting with a wave of profit-booking. Overseas investors have pulled out roughly over Rs 20,000 crore from the domestic markets so far in October.

Going into a new week, things do not look any better. Going by analyst observations, here is a list of factors that will influence market movement next week.


Liquidity and NBFC issuesA perceived liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) has made investors wary despite a slew of measures from the government and RBI to address the issue. After the IL&FS crisis, even the slightest indication of problem in an NBFC has led to a selloff. “RBI is trying to inject liquidity, but confidence needs to be restored in the system to ensure that it continues to function,” Sudip Bandyopadhyay, group chairman, Inditrade Capital, said in an interview with ET Now. “If the liquidity crunch is allowed to continue unabated, it may lead to solvency issues and that will be disastrous. We will have to see how that gets handled over the next 10-15 days,” he said. The efficacy of RBI’s decision to relax liquidity norms and allow more bank lending to NBFCs will be assessed in the coming days. 


F&O rolloverOctober series futures and options will expire on Thursday and rollover of positions will dominate proceedings through the week. “Friday's data showed maximum Put open interest was at 10,000 followed by 10,200, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,600,” said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. “There was meaningful Call writing at 10,400 followed by 10,600, while Put writing was seen at 10,200 followed by 10,100. The option band signified a trading band between 10,200 and 10,500 levels. On Friday, Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,314 with a loss of 1.24 per cent,” he said. F&O rollovers may increase volatility in the market.


Rupee remains a big worryThe rupee settled 29 paise higher at 73.32 against the dollar on Friday, amid selling of the US currency by exporters and foreign fund inflows. The domestic unit has been on a bumpy track of late owing to unstable crude oil prices, a stronger dollar, capital outflow and rising bond yields in the US. The rupee will remain a key factor to watch in the coming days. 


The course of crude oilCrude oil prices rose in international markets on Friday. Brent crude futures rose 49 cents to settle at $79.78 a barrel amid a surge in demand in China. The market is now focussing on US sanctions on Iran, which will come into force on November 4. Crude has a direct impact on the rupee’s health and ultimately it influences the mood of the market, as higher crude oil prices raises worries of a spike in current account deficit and fiscal deficit, distorting country’s macroeconomic mathematics. As per RBI estimates, every $10 a barrel rise in oil price reduces country’s GDP growth by around 0.15 per cent. 


Key Q2 earnings aheadThe earnings season is on in full swing now. ITC, Asian Paints, Adani Ports, Ambuja Cements, Kotak Mahindra Bank, YES Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Wipro, HCL Tech, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are among the heavyweights that will release their September quarter numbers during the week. The earnings numbers have been mixed so far. Any positive surprise should prove a booster dose for the market. 


ECB’s rate decisionThe European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday amid chaos around Brexit. While no change in monetary policy is expected as of now, the ECB will have to calculate the risk that Brexit poses to eurozone economy. “Brexit is the big elephant in the room for the euro area’s economy. A lot of people are trying to guess the nitty-gritty of interest rate increases that are still about a year out, but are ignoring one of the region’s key economic risks,” Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J Safra Sarasin in Zurich, told Bloomberg. 


Global macro-meterThe Bank of Japan’s core CPI will be out on Tuesday. The US new home sales report for September will be out on Wednesday. Besides, markets will closely watch third quarter GDP growth numbers of the US on Friday. On the same day, data on US’s real consumer spending will also be released. Italian budget will also be in focus this week. 


Technical outlook weakOn the technical charts, the bears appear on the driver's seat. “As per the weekly timeframe chart, Nifty has formed a negative candle with a long upper shadow, which indicates a sharp negative reversal from the recent highs. The weekly RSI is also sending out negative signals,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. Technical indicators still show more scope of downside, though in between a short bounce cannot be ruled out. The support for Sensex/Nifty during the week is seen at 33,350/10,000 and resistance at 35,100/10,550. Bank Nifty would have a range of 24,150-25,860, said Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher."
29,2018-10-22,Asian Paints,"Asian shares markets fell anew this morning amid earnings jitters and geopolitical worries around Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit. Let's check out what all might matter to Dalal Street on Monday:


Singapore trading sets stage for flat start Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded flat at 10,317 at 7.30 hours this morning, indicating directionless trade for the Nifty50.


Tech view: Nifty forms Spinning Top candle
A gap-down opening and a Spinning Top-like candle on the daily chart a day after a 'Bearish Engulfing’ formation does not bode well for the Nifty. Add a bearish candle on the weekly scale, the bears look firmly in the driver’s seat. The index may test the recent low of 10,138, while upside hurdle is seen at 10,450.


Asian shares slip
Asian share markets fell anew on Monday as investors braced for the peak of the US earnings season while angst over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit kept geopolitics front and centre. Adding to the air of nervousness was an early 0.4 percent drop in E-Mini futures for the S&P 500, while safe haven Treasuries caught a bid. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.25 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 1.0 per cent and South Korea stocks lost 0.7 per cent.


Crude oil prices stableOil prices were stable on Monday, supported by supply concerns ahead of the start of US sanctions against Iran’s crude exports, but held back by rising drilling activity in the US. Front-month Brent crude oil futures traded 4 cents below last close at $79.74 a barrel, while WTI crude futures were slipped 5 cents to $69.07.


US stocks settled higher on Friday
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index advanced 64.89 points, or 0.26 per cent, to close at 25,444.34 on Friday. The S&P500 index ended 1 point, or 0.04 per cent, lower at 2,767.78. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 36.11 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 7,449.03.


Moody’s cuts Italy’s rating
Moody’s on Friday cut Italy’s sovereign debt rating to one notch above junk status because of concerns over government budget plans, but in a move that could calm investor anxiety, it said the outlook was stable, Reuters reported.


Italy to reply to EU concerns
Italy has until Monday to explain to the European Union its breach of rules and faces the rejection of its budget, which may eventually lead to sanctions. Neither side has any incentive to back down for now, Reuters reported.


Key Q2 earnings todayAsian Paints, Hindustan Zinc, Kansai Nerolac, GSK Pharma, Inox Leisure, Jubilant Life Sciences and Oberoi Realty are among a handful companies that will announce their quarterly results during the day.

30,2018-10-22,Asian Paints,"Domestic equity market looked poised for a lacklustre start to the new week as geopolitical worries kept centrestage and dragged share markets globally this morning. Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded flat at 10,317 at 7.30 hours this morning, indicating directionless trade for the Nifty50.

Here is a look at the key stocks trending in news this morning.


HDFC Bank: Private lender HDFC Bank on Saturday announced a 20.6 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in September quarter net profit at Rs 5,005.70 crore. The numbers came largely in line with analyst projections.


Infosys: Top-level exits continue at Infosys, the country’s second largest company in IT services. Ken Toombs, global head of consulting at the Bengaluru-based entity, has become the fifth high exits since Salil Parekh took charge as chief executive officer in January.


Tata Motors: Tata Sons increased its stake in Tata Motors from 33.3 per cent to 34.2 per cent in September quarter at a time when its market capitalisation is eroding and valuations dipping amid uncertainties facing its UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover.


Jet Airways: The private airline is pruning its workforce and operations further as India’s second-biggest airline battles its worst financial crisis. At least 15 people at manager or general manager level in departments such as engineering, security and sales have been asked to leave in October.


TCS: The domestic IT major has restructured its industry service units, giving almost 200 employees control of them and quarterly target goals as it looks to free up senior executives to focus on long-term strategy.

Bharti Airtel: Brokerages say RIL’s buyout of DEN Networks and Hathway Cables will give Reliance Jio Infocomm a headstart in the ultra-fast fibre-to-home service turf, posing a real threat to Bharti’s home broadband and digital TV businesses, which bring in as much as 12 per cent of Bharti’s India revenues.


Indiabulls Housing Finance: The NBFC firm plans to sell all or part of its 18.7% stake in UK-based OakNorth Holdings within a month to a private equity fund. The deal, if it goes through, will help the company rake in over six times gain on investment in less than three years.

Essar Steel: The world’s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal has been declared the preferred bidder by lenders of debt-laden Essar Steel ahead of metals player Vedanta Group, bankers said, as the 14-month battle for ownership of the prized asset draws to a close.


Asian Paints, Hind Zinc: And in September quarter earnings, Asian Paints, Hindustan Zinc, Kansai Nerolac, GSK Pharma, Inox Leisure, Jubilant Life Sciences and Oberoi Realty are among a handful companies that will announce their quarterly results during the day."
31,2018-10-22,Asian Paints,"Shares of Asian Paints dropped into the red ahead of its financial results for the September quarter on Monday. 

The scrip was down 0.78 per cent at Rs 1,228.30 at around 9.40 am. The BSE Sensex was up 0.32 per cent at 34,426.

There are expectations that demand improvement post GST rate reduction would lead to a double-digit volume growth for Asian Paints despite a late Diwali. Rupee depreciation and rising crude prices will put pressure on margins on a QoQ basis.

Brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities expects Asian Paints to report around 8 per cent volume growth for the quarter through September.

“We would also see a positive impact of cut in GST rate this quarter. But postponement of the festive season would lead to demand shift in Q3 FY19. Total effective price hike of around 3.5-4 per cent should be seen for the quarter. On the COGS (cost of goods sold) front, prices of TiO2 and other monomers have continued to remain elevated.

 This coupled with a depreciating rupee will continue to put pressure on the gross margins. However, cost rationalisation measures will aid to some extent on the EBITDA front,” the brokerage house said in a report.

Edelweiss sees 10.5 per cent, 11.80 per cent and 9.90 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue, EBITDA and core PAT, respectively, for Asian Paints in Q2 FY19. 

Prabhudas Lilladher sees 12 per cent, 15.70 per cent and 15.80 per cent year-on-year rise in sales, EBITDA and adjusted profit after tax, respectively."
32,2018-10-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Shares of paint companies ended in the red on Monday after Kansai Nerolac Paints reported drop in profit for September quarter. 

Share of the company plunged 6.31 per cent after it reported a fall of 15.65 per cent in profit at Rs 121.99 crore for quarter ended September 30. It had posted a net profit of Rs 144.63 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

However, total income from operations increased by 10.97 per cent to Rs 1,307.87 crore for Q2FY19 compared with Rs 1,178.54 crore for the corresponding quarter previous year.

Also, Asian Paints slipped 3 per cent ahead of its financial results for September quarter. The scrip shed Rs 36.50 to close at Rs 1.201.45 on the BSE. Shalimar Paints and Berger Paints fell 2.65 per cent and 1.25 per cent, respectively.

The benchmark BSE Sensex closed 181.25 points down at 34,134.38."
33,2018-10-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Stock benchmark indices reversed their early gains during the last hour of trade today to settle in the red for the third session in a row amid lingering liquidity concerns, a fresh fall in the rupee and a jump in crude oil prices.

Selling in index heavyweight Reliance Industries weighed too.

The BSE Sensex closed down 181.25 points, or 0.53 per cent, at 34,134.38, coming off 614 points from day's high. RIL contributed to more than half of the decline in the Sensex.

IndusInd Bank was the worst Sensex performer as it lost 8.52 per cent.

RIL, YES Bank, ONGC, Asian Paints and Kotak Mahindra Bank were among other losers in the Sensex kitty of stocks. Each of these gave up 3.5-2.75 per cent.

ICICI Bank, NTPC, Bajaj Auto, HDFC Bank And Bharti Airtel emerged as Sensex gainers.

The NSE Nifty settled the day marginally below the 10,250 mark. The index shut shop at 10,245.25, down 58.30 points, or 0.57 per cent. In the 50-share index, 16 stocks settled in the green, 33 in the red and one remained unchanged.

Among Nifty's sectoral indices, only two - auto and financials - managed to register gains. Metals, PSU Bank and IT stocks were among the worst hit sectors.

On the BSE, the advance-decline ratio stood at 1:2, meaning rise in every stock was followed by a decline in two stocks.


Factors that dragged down the market today:


1. Liquidity woesThe negative outlook regarding liquidity in the stock market and a subsequent contagion for most NBFC and HFC companies unnerved markets once again today. 


2. Fresh fall in rupeeThe domestic rupee once again slipped against the dollar on Monday. The domestic unit lost over 10 paise from its previous close and 30 paise from its intraday high level. The rupee was trading at 73.43 against the greenback at the time of writing this report.


3. Brent back above $80Oil edged above $80 a barrel on Monday, lifted by nervousness over a worsening diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and the West, just two weeks before US sanctions potentially choke off Iranian crude supplies, according to a Reuters report.

Benchmark Brent crude oil futures rose 45 cents on the day to $80.23 a barrel by 0900 GMT while US crude futures rose 31 cents to $69.43.


Expert-speak:
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services: Despite a positive opening in the global market, the Nifty traded range bound and ended on a negative note due to concerns on liquidity and interest rate. Mid and small caps underperformed while mixed earnings from index heavyweights hit investor sentiment. There is a risk of earnings to downgrade in future since Nifty50-index earnings growth is less than 10 per cent in HIFY19, based on Q1FY19 review and Q2FY19 preview."
34,2018-10-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Market lost nerve today for the third consecutive day -- this time, over fears of a stubborn liquidity crunch -- as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty closed with losses despite positive Asian leads.

While the rupee turned shaky and oil prices ticked up globally, worries that the liquidity problem might have a contagion effect triggered a sell-off towards the fag end. 

""Rupee and crude oil factors are mostly discounted in the market, but the worry of liquidity crunch in the NBFC space and its contagion to other sectors such as real estate played the spoilsport,"" said Mayuresh Joshi, fund manager at Angel Broking.

""Market will inch further lower and banking and financials could lead the decline. Any decline below 10,100 in the Nifty would trigger a fresh fall,"" said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking. 

The Sensex plunged 181 points, or 0.53 per cent, to end the day at 34,134.38, with 10 stocks in the green and 21 (with Tata Motors DVR) in the red. The Nifty came off 58 points, or 0.57 per cent, finishing at 10,245.25, with 16 stocks advancing and 33 declining. One stock remained unchanged. 


Let's take you through the highlights of Monday's session:


Who dragged my Sensex?IndusInd Bank, Reliance Industries (RIL), YES Bank, ONGC, Asian Paints and Kotak Mahindra Bank were the top Sensex losers, down up to 8.52 per cent. RIL, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Infosys, Asian Paints and Tata Consultancy Services emerged as the top drag, in that order. 

By contrast, ICICI Bank, NTPC, Bajaj Auto, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki emerged as the top gainers in the Sensex pack of stocks. 


IndusInd Bank plumbs 52-week lowShares of IndusInd Bank touched a 52-week low of Rs 1,423.85 on the BSE. The scrip plunged 9.68 per cent intraday before settling at Rs 1,442.20 today, down 8.52 per cent. With this, the stock broke its near-term support at Rs 1,510.05 and Rs 1,452.65. The scrip has cut below its Parabolic SAR, which is seen unfavorable. The bank has posted 4.56 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 920.25 crore for the quarter to September. It had posted a profit of Rs 880.10 crore in the same quarter last year. 


Oil above $80Oil price jumped above $80 per barrel on a diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and the US ahead of impending US sanctions on Iran. A surge in crude oil prices weighed on the rupee, which fell around 15 paise against the dollar. The domestic currency closed 24 paise lower at 73.56 today. 


BSE Smallcap cracks 2%BSE Smallcaps underperformed the Sensex today as the sectoral index fell 1.97 per cent to 13,804.88. The BSE Midcap closed the day at 13,958.90, down 0.71 per cent.

Nifty may remain under pressure in the short term, but if it manages to cross and hold above the 10,200 level, then a bounce could be seen towards 10,250 and then 10,333.

48,2018-10-23,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A sharp selloff in global stocks, sustained capital outflows amid rupee's precarious health and rising clout of the US dollar kept the bulls at bay on Tuesday.

Indian market extended its fall to the fourth consecutive session, mirroring the weakness in global stocks. A mix of negative leads such as Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation, worries about Italian budget, the Brexit uncertainties and global trade concerns proved to be a dangerous cocktail.

In Asia, Hang Seng plunged 3 per cent while Shanghai Composite, Nikkei and Taiwan indices suffered losses of over 2 per cent each.

TVS reports flat growthTVS Motor Company today reported a flat growth in profit at Rs 211.31 crore for the quarter to September. The two-wheeler firm had posted a profit of Rs 213.16 crore in the same quarter last year. Analysts in an ETNow poll had estimated the profit figure at Rs 210 crore. Revenue from operations jumped 22.85 per cent to Rs 4,993.47 crore in Q2 FY19 over Rs 4,064.72 crore in Q2 FY18. The stock closed 3.75 per cent up at Rs 536.05 today.

Global stocks roll downGlobal markets hurtled towards their lowest level in a year today. Following a share decline on Wall Street, heavy selloff emerged in Asian markets which took European markets under its ambit. Emerging market stocks and currencies took a beating on Tuesday as concerns over Italy's budget, Brexit talks and Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's killing kept investors' appetite for risk in the doldrums, Reuters reported. 


Rupee in a tight spotThe rupee lost vigour today, which made market players nervous. The domestic unit swung between gains and losses throughout the day. After falling by 27 paise to 73.83, it turned flat, only to resume on a downward trajectory. A slight fall in crude oil after Saudi Arabia's assurance of playing a ""responsible role"" in energy markets brought a some respite to the domestic unit.

Routier aims to drive efficiency for all marketplace stakeholders, using an innovative blend of data analytics, artificial intelligence and end-to-end streamlined functionality available over the cloud.

Routier Co-Founder Adwait Vikram Singh said, “Routier has the potential to rationalize the logistics sector not only in India but also for the global markets.

India’s trucking industry is a perfect example of such an opportunity to deliver tremendous value and efficiency, and thus we are quite excited to be partnering with Routier in its mission to redefine the trucking logistics industry” said Robin Raina, Chairman, President and CEO, Ebix. 

Robin further added, “Routier recently secured multi-million dollar commitments from a few large multinational corporations, and thus needed the backing of Ebix in terms of technology expertise, manpower and working capital to implement and scale these and other opportunities. We are excited to invest in this pioneering effort at an opportune time, and look forward to building what could be a large marketplace for the trucking industry.”

With a market opportunity expected to reach $300 billion by 2020, Routier looks to drive productivity and transparency through a transportation sector long considered one of the most inefficient, claims the company’s statement."

What worked in favour of markets today?

1. Oil prices nearing $75Oil fell towards $75 a barrel to its lowest since late August on Wednesday, pressured by concerns that demand is easing amid ample supply even as US sanctions loom on oil exporter Iran, Reuters reported.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 80 cents to $75.64 a barrel at 0930 GMT. It fell earlier to $75.11, the lowest since August 24. US crude dropped 17 cents to $66.26.


2. Rupee bounces over 40 paise The domestic unit gained considerably against the dollar today amid a sharp fall in crude oil prices and selling of the greenback by banks and exporters.

The local unit jumped 42 paise on Wednesday, trading at 73.18 against the dollar at the time of writing this report.


3. F&O expiryVolatility rose during the day with the benchmark indices swinging between profits and losses in late trade as investors squared off their positions ahead of the expiry of October futures and options contracts.


Expert-speak:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services: Disappointed by the Q2 results of index heavyweights led by lower margins, market lost the early gains. But in the latter part, these losses was recovered due to sharp fall in oil prices and short covering ahead the F&O expiry. Additionally, a recovery in the rupee and drop in yield are expected to improve the liquidity situation supported by RBI's open market operations. 


Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking: After four straight sessions of losses, the Indian equity benchmark indices bounced back smartly to end the session on a positive note, amid huge intra-day volatility. A sharp correction in the crude oil prices and the rupee gains versus the dollar boosted sentiment. While the gains could extend in coming sessions, we prefer to remain cautious at higher levels. A sharp reversal in crude oil prices (down nearly 10 per cent from the peak levels) and a meaningful rupee appreciation (vs USD) over the last few sessions is encouraging. Global developments will be closely monitored. Further, stock-specific volatility will remain high on the back of the ongoing earnings season. Investors can accumulate fundamentally sound stocks on dips."

Let's run you through today's market highlights:

Oil prices at two-month lowOil prices fell near $75 a barrel to its lowest since late August on concerns of weak demand and ample supply after Saudi Arabia promised that it will keep oil market adequately supplied in the wake of US sanctions on Iran. Moreover, a fall in global equities due to weak prospects of economic growth amid fears of an intensifying trade war cast their shadow. According to Reuters, the International Energy Agency expects a slower oil demand growth for 2019 due to a slowing economy.


Rupee gains weightThe oil cool-off rubbed off on the rupee as the domestic currency closed higher today, offering more hope to market participants. Rupee's rise is a major relief for the market as current account deficit swells on a weak rupee, which distorts India's macroeconomic mathematics.

61,2018-10-25,Asian Paints,"Early in the new year, we will get an opportunity to buy super real estate developers at super cheap prices, 
Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

How worried are you about the global market rout this morning and would you say that there is a slight chance that we may fall less because we have already fallen so much?
Could well that we correct less than the brutal correction in the S&P 500 yesterday but overall, if you look ahead over the next 12 months, whether you look at the American or the Indian market, we are facing a similar set of circumstances of rising interest rates, rising cost of capital, a slowing economy and hence just as corporate profit seem to be topping out in America, in India also it is reasonably clear that in the second half of the year, earnings growth will conk off again as the broader economic slowdown around the NBFC funding freeze kicks in. 

So, there are a similar set of circumstances in the big markets around the world, rising cost of capital, slowing economies, expensive stocks and corporate earnings suggesting that they have topped out. 


What should investors do? Should one just sit tight and fasten the seatbelts because better days are coming or is this the time to take a serious cash call and protect your capital?
There are two sets of action that one should rationally take. The first is there are three large sectors in the Indian market which have reasonably low correlation with our macro economy, with our broader economic construct. These are; a) FMCG which has low correlation and is almost like an economy onto itself. b)The IT sector which is linked to the rupee more than the Indian economy and c)the pharma sector which is similarly linked to the rupee and the Indian economy. 

People like me have been cheerleading for 12 months. I think there is still juice in IT. Results are healthy, the weakness in the rupee is so profound that it will continue to give tailwinds and firms like TCS or an L&T Infotech give you perfectly sensible ways to make money there. 

In pharma, there are significant bargains to be had both in the front line pharma stocks and perhaps in the mid tier as well. 

FMCG results would be sound. It will be an island of safety. So, that is one way to deal with slowdown, one way to deal with the economic circumstances. The other is to pull back from wholesale funded financials. 

I know I have been saying this like a broken record for 12 months but there is still very little rhyme or reason for the price to book multiples that many of the NBFCs and HFCs trade at. Dewan is the only one which has pulled back to some sort of sanity in valuations. There is still sort of fantasy type valuations that most of housing finance companies and NBFCs trade at and if you have those in your portfolios, you really have to rethink your exposure to wholesale funded financials. 

The well-run CASA funded banks will have a good three-four year run in India It is not just an HDFC Bank or Kotak which has good CASA franchises. I would look at even smaller banks like DCB or City Union Bank carefully as valuations come off in the market.


TCS and Bajaj Finance numbers were great. At the top, bluest of the blue chip largecap stocks numbers’ have not been great but the minute I start coming down the ladder, numbers start getting weaker -- be it IT, banks or consumers. Are markets telling you something here?
Yes, markets are giving the message I suppose. The last five years gave us the hope that this will be the year when Indian earnings grow at double digits. But that is likely to be belied again. You are seeing softness in earnings now and remember that in the first two quarters of the ,year the NBFC slowdown had not yet hit. 

If the first two quarters earnings are turning out to be softer than many of us expected them to be, then almost certainly we are going to have the disappointments in Q3 and Q4 as higher raw material costs and a jump in funding costs hit economy sectors like auto, consumption in Q3, Q4. Earnings expectations will get pulled back partly because of what we are seeing in Q2 earnings and partly because people will do a little bit of forward looking thinking and say that consumption will slow down there.


Do you keep the powder dry and wait for the froth to settle down or do you start hunting for bargains in the current market?
For many of us, market timing remains a real challenge . Given that construct, I outlined one framework on your show two months ago. Say I am creating a 20-stock portfolio. In that 20-stocks, 10 of them are Robert Kirby’s coffee can type stocks where I buy high quality franchises and sit on them for extended periods of time. An example being Asian Paints. I know Asian Paints pulled back by 20% this year but it has had an incredible 25 years. It is a super company and nobody can second guess when one should buy and sell Asian Paints. So franchise like in Asian Paints or HDFC Bank is in my 10 structural holdings.

Then I have the other half of my portfolio, 10 other holdings where I try to play the economic cycle by toggling my micro outlook. Year ago, I started believing that IT was oversold. So in that other 10 of my portfolio, I had three or four IT stocks. I still believe IT is undervalued but I also believe pharma is undervalued. Pharma is in my cyclical side of the portfolio. Break your portfolio into two parts, 10 structural holdings which you buy, sit back and forget, letting them compound; and 10 holdings where you toggle with the cycle by moving into cash, out of cash, back into cash. Those sorts of calls are very hard for most of us to make and I tried avoiding timing the market in its totality. 


Is it time to really start diversifying? What is the prudent strategy for a sensible investor who wants to use the power of market dynamics and cycles and enjoy the benefits of asset allocations?
If you want to use the power of asset allocation, one sensible strategy to consider is building a broader portfolio beyond India. What has happened in our country because of the real estate pullback over the last four-five years has been that money has been furiously pumped into the stock market. This created by and large a structurally expensive market. Smart HNWs are using the $25,000 that they are allowed to take abroad to purchase good companies in Singapore, Australia and United States. Indians building worldwide equity portfolios is something that will happen over the next four-five years as people try to diversify their wealth beyond just the Indian stock market.


How would you look at the pockets which are not being fancied by the market -- aviation and metals? They are much cheaper than some of the beaten down names in the quality space?
Let us throw real estate into that pack as well because there is a bunch of industrial sectors where there has not been a lot of fresh capacity addition in the last three four years as we have gone through the capex slowdown. And as capacity utilisation is hitting 75-80%, some of these sectors are beginning to look very interesting. 

In metals, Arcelor Mittal’s entry is quite a big deal. It is something we should cheer as a country that Arcelor Mittal has finally found a bit of grip on the Indian market. Hopefully, it steps up competitive intensity in the steel market and gives us as consumers steel at better prices. I would not jump into the ferrous companies just yet. I will wait for Arcelor Mittal’s entry to fructify into more competitive intensity.

One space which is looking very interesting is residential real estate. There is a good chance that in the next three-four months, we see the final lurch downwards in residential housing as funding dries up for real estate developers. They were supported heavily by the NBFCs and the housing finance companies. As the real estate developers lose their final lifelines of funding, we can see another 20-30% correction in residential real estate house prices.

Early next year, residential real estate could be a sector where buying stocks might finally make sense. This is a sector worth looking at very carefully. RERA will lead to massive consolidation in residential real estate. We will probably end up with no more than 10 to 12 large pan India builders who dominate the landscape. Several of them are listed and following them closely over the next three four months as the funding freeze intensifies will be a very worthwhile exercise. This is a mega sector and large companies will be created in the next 10 years. Several of them are listed. We might get a really tasty opportunity early in the New Year to buy super developers at super cheap prices.


It is still a little early and still got two to three weeks to gauge, but what has been your reading so far of the earnings season?
The opening week was alright but over the last week, it is reasonably clear that raw material price intensification has led to meaningful margin erosion. Even a champion franchise like Asian Paints has seen meaningful margin erosion. As the quarter wears on, we will see results getting progressively weaker. 

Q1 was broadly in line with expectation, Q2 looks to be a tad softer than people expected it to be and in Q3, Q4, results will start softening as economic growth starts feeling the pressure of the funding freeze. IT results will be altight, banks barring IndusInd will be still alright but wherever raw material prices are kicking in, you are seeing operating margin pressure kick in which in turn suggests pricing power is very weak. This in turn suggests that the economy as it is in Q2 was not super strong. . So the 15-20% earnings growth that consensus had pencilled in for the current year for FY19, once again looks likely to be pulled back to 8-9-10%."

It was followed by Vedanta, Tata Motors, Adani Ports, YES Bank and HDFC. Wipro, on the other hand, jumped 3.30 per cent, leading the pack of Sensex gainers. Other than that, only Coal India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, PowerGrid, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto and Tata Consultancy Services could manage to settle in the green.


Rupee gives up The domestic unit settled 12 paise lower at 73.27 against the dollar today. Traders said increased demand for the US currency from importers and a lower opening of the domestic equity market weighed on the local unit. Despite steps taken by the government and the RBI, the rupee's slide remains unabated, posing a threat to India's macroeconomic mathematics. 


Global markets mixedA sell-off in the US stocks sparked panic in Asian markets and most of them suffered heavy losses. However, they managed to limited their losses as investors looked forward to corporate earnings. The Shanghai Composite closed the day flat. European stocks turned green ahead of a rate decision by the European Central Bank.


Maruti on a bumpy roadIndia's biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India on Thursday reported a 9.8 per cent fall in net profit for the quarter to September. Operating profit stood at Rs 2,710.1 crore, down 9.5 per cent over the same period last year, on account of increase in commodity prices, adverse foreign exchange movement and higher sales promotion expenses partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Shares of the company closed at Rs 6,724.70, down 0.65 per cent on the BSE today.

Top gainers & losers of the dayInfibeam Avenues (down 18.01 per cent), Dish TV India (down 17.17 per cent), MCX (down 14.17 per cent), Linde India (down 9.72 per cent) and Jubilant FoodWorks (down 9.71 per cent) stood as the top five BSE losers today. But SJVN (up 13.75 per cent), Intellect Design Arena (up 8.39 per cent), Kajaria Ceramics (up 7.59 per cent), InterGlobe Aviation (up 7.48 per cent) and Oriental Bank of Commerce (up 6.50 per cent) surged, defying negative market mood.


Over 1 lakh crore gone!Over 1.17 lakh crore investor wealth was eroded on Thursday as the cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies fell to Rs 1,34,07,102.28 crore, from Rs 1,35,24,629.12 a day earlier. 

Nearly 300 stocks at 52-week lows As many as 284 stocks, including Andhra Bank, Bajaj Auto, Bank of India, BEML, Bharat Forge, Ceat, DHFL, Grasim, Maruti and Tata Motors, hit 52-week lows on the BSE. Only 26 stocks, including Coastal Corporation, Jet Infraventure, Prakash Steelage, Rotographics (India) and Shukra Bullions, could touch their 52-week highs."
63,2018-10-25,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The global stock market rout spread to local benchmark indices on Thursday as both Sensex and Nifty pushed into deep red at the expiry of the October options and futures contracts.

The weakness in the domestic currency added to investors' misery. 

The BSE Sensex closed the day at 33,690, down 343.87 points, or 1.01 per cent, while the NSE Nifty shut shop at 10,125, a loss of 99.85 points, or 0.98 per cent.

Intraday, the NSE Nifty went below the crucial 10,100 mark and hit its lowest level since March 28.

On the 30-share Sensex, only six managed to settle with gains. Wipro was the best index performer, with gains of 3.30 per cent, followed by Coal India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, PowerGrid and M&M.

Bharti Airtel topped the losers' list. The stock ended down 6.60 per cent at Rs 295.85 ahead of its September quarter results later in the day.

Vedanta, Tata Motors, Adani Ports, YES Bank and HDFC were other laggards.

On the Nifty, 14 stocks advanced, 35 lost and one remained unchanged.

Barring the Nifty IT index, all major sectoral indices closed weak after a turbulent session. PSU Bank, pharma, realty, metals, media, and financial shares contributed to the overall pain.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices too closed the day on a subdued note, with losses of 0.58 per cent and 0.98 per cent, respectively.


What made market sentiment dull?

1. 
Rout in global equities
Global stock markets were firmly on track for their worst month since the financial crisis. Japan's Nikkei closed at it lowest in nearly seven months on Thursday while the broader Topix hit a fresh one-year low, dropping 3.1 per cent to 1,600.92. A rout in technology stocks on Wall Street in overnight trade triggered the global market selloff.

2. 
Uninspiring earnings
Indian companies are on course to miss their earnings target yet again. Out of the 51 companies on the BSE 500 index that have come out with their second quarter results so far, profits of 28 have missed analysts’ expectations, stoking worries about further delay in the much-awaited earnings recovery and sharp cuts in forecasts, ET reported.

This kept investors on edge as they were eyeing earnings revival to lift the domestic stock market.

3. 
F&O expiry
Volatility rose during the day as investors squared off their positions amid the expiry of October futures and options contracts. 

4. 
Rupee weakness
The rupee was trading lower on Thursday amid selling of currency by banks and importers. The domestic unit was 10 paise lower at 73.25 against the greenback.



What experts are saying:

Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking

""After a day of upmove, the selling pressure resumed on Dalal Street as the Indian equity benchmark indices ended the derivative monthly expiry session sharply lower by 1 per cent at 10,125, led by negative Asian cues and muted domestic sentiment. We maintain our cautious view on the Indian markets in the near term. While there could be some intermediate bounces, selling pressure could resume at higher levels. Movement of crude oil prices, currency and global developments would be closely monitored in the coming sessions. Domestically, the corporate earnings season so far has not been encouraging. With more results likely to be announced over the next two weeks, stock-specific volatility would continue to remain high. We advise traders and investors to remain selective in stock picking.""


Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

""Headwinds from global market and expiry-led volatility dragged the market to negative terrain. However, market tried to gain some support from the lower levels led by benign oil price and yield. The results season is gaining pace whereas the deviations in earnings as compared to consensus is influencing investors’ sentiment."""
62,2018-10-25,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Severe selling pressure threw investors off-balance today as domestic stocks suffered more losses.

The benchmark Sensex plunged 481 points to 33,553 and the Nifty broke below 10,100 as most sectors felt the heat on the last day of October futures and options contracts.

Weak leads from Asian markets following a sell-off in US stocks did not help matters. Rupee's slide despite softening crude oil prices hit sentiment hard. 

Weak prospects of economic growth and worries about corporate earnings were other major overhangs. Uninspiring earnings have done little to lift market mood, which is grappling with the NBFC mess and the liquidity crisis.

The NSE Nifty was 125 points down at 10,100 around 11:10 am while the BSE Sensex plunged 410 points to 33,624. Barring, Wipro, Asian Paints, TCS and ONGC, all scrips of the Sensex were in the red. 

Wondering what all caused the market downfall today? Here are the factors in detail.


Lacklustre earnings: September quarter earnings have failed to meet market expectations, dealing a blow to investor sentiment. So far, 209 companies have declared their second quarter results and cumulatively, they have reported a fall of 4.86 per cent in profit to Rs 45,943 crore. The profit numbers for the same quarter a year ago stood at Rs 48,288 crore. 


F&O rollovers: F&O rollovers have also injected a sense of caution. On the options front on Wednesday, maximum Put OI was at 10,000 followed by 10,200 strike while Call OI congestion was seen at 10,300 followed by 10,400 strikes. Call writing was at 10,300 followed by 10,250 strike while Put writing was seen at 10,000 followed by 10,200 strike. Option band signified an immediate trading range between 10,138 and 10,333 levels. Volatility index India VIX stood at 4.39 per cent. 


Weak Asian peers: Asian stocks took a beating on Thursday after a strong sell-off in the US technology stocks made Wall Street see its worst fall since 2011. Wall Street erased the entire gains of the year and a volley of factors, including rate hikes, trade war worries, higher equity valuation and concerns on corporate earnings played their role. 


Geopolitical uncertainty: Geopolitical concerns too spoiled market mood. While the worries of trade war still pinch, the conflict between the US and Saudi Arabia has brought fresh troubles for investors. The impending US sanction on Iran is another issue the world is tracking. All these factors have a say in equities and the oil market across the globe. Oil prices have been on a wobbly pitch of late, putting pressure on emerging market economies. 


Rupee's prolonged weakness: The rupee fell again on Thursday even as oil prices eased in global markets. The rupee dropped by 19 paise to 73.35 against the dollar early Thursday amid unabated foreign fund outflows. Traders said increased demand for the US currency from importers and a lower opening of domestic equity market weighed on the local unit. Despite steps taken by the government and the RBI, the rupee's slide remains unabated, posing a threat to India's macroeconomic mathematics.


Technical outlook weak: Although the Nifty reversed its four-day losing streak to form a ‘Hammer’ candle on the daily chart, the index remains vulnerable to selling pressure on every rise. “The index is witnessing a tug of war between the bulls and the bears near the 10,200 level. It needs to hold above 10,200, with a follow-up buying interest to head towards 10,280 and eventually 10,333-10,350 range,” said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.


Sustained FII outflow: Uninterrupted FII capital outflow in the wake of a falling rupee and rising bond yields in the US gave the bears more fodder. In October so far, FIIs have pulled out over Rs 35,000 crore from Indian equity and debt market. On Wednesday alone, the FII outflow figure stood at Rs 2,046.54 crore, as per provisional data available with the NSE."
60,2018-10-25,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic market widened its losses in Thursday's session as the benchmark Sensex plunged 481 points to 33,553.18 and Nifty broke below 10,100 on strong selling in most sectors on the last day of October futures & options contracts.

Wekness in Asian markets follwoing a sell-off in US stocks and rupee's slide even as crude oil prices softened in global markets, weighed on sentiment. 

Negative cues from other Asian markets after the US markets plummeted Wednesday as a sharp drop in tech shares along with weak prospects of economic growth and worries about corporate earnings hemmed up to cause market suffer losses. 

Unuinspiring earnings have done little to lift market mood which is grappling to overcome the concerns of NBFC mess and liquidity crisis.

The NSE Nifty index was trading 125 points down at 10,100, while the BSE Sensex was down 410 points at 33,624 around 11:10 am.

Barring, Wipro, Asian Paints, TCS and ONGC, all stocks were incurring losses in Sensex index at that time.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were down nearly 1 per cent at that time. 

Barring Wipro, NTPC and Mahindra & Mahindra, all stocks were in the red in the Sensex index.

Defying the bearish market sentiment, shares of Wipro climbed over 1 per cent, despite the IT major on Wednesday reporting a 13.81 per cent YoY drop in net profit at Rs 1,889 crore for September quarter, way lower than an estimate of Rs 1,962 crore analysts projected in an ET Now survey. 

Shares of Bharti Airtel were trading around 5 per cent lower in early trade ahead of its financial results for the quarter ended September 2018 later in the day.

IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Vedanta, Adani Ports and YES Bank too appeared among the top Sensex losers in the early trade. 

All sectoral indices on BSE were incurring losses, with telecom, realty, capital goods, IT and finance as the worst hit. 

Hatsun Agro Products (down 19.81 per cent), Manaksia Aluminium Company (down 16.67 per cent), Atishay (down 14.99 per cent), Bright Brothers (down 14.95 per cent) and Velan Hotels (down 12.43 per cent) were among the top losers on BSE. 

Arman Financial Services (down 9.49 per cent), SIL Investments (down 7.82 per cent), Golden Goenka Fincorp (down 6.39 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance(down 5.88 per cent) and L&T Finance Holdings (down 5.21 per cent) were among the top losers in the NBFC space."
59,2018-10-25,Asian Paints,"Indian companies are on course to miss their earnings targets yet again. Out of the 51 companies on the BSE-500 index which have come out with their second quarter results so far, profits of 28 have missed analysts’ expectations, heightening worries about further delay in the muchawaited earnings recovery and sharp cuts in forecasts.

Several blue-chips, too, have disappointed investors. Analysts said increase in input costs, lower volumes due to aggressive pricing or additional provisioning in case of some banks resulted in many of their profits falling below estimates.

With rising crude prices, weaker rupee and rising funding costs, analysts are likely to cut earnings estimates for FY19. “We expect sharp cut in earnings estimates in near term because of the poor show in the September quarter” said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India research, UBS. “Hope of earnings recovery in the second half of FY 2019 looks bleak now with the new developments like increasing rates, rising crude and liquidity crunch.” Top companies that did not meet earnings estimates include IndusInd Bank, ACC, Bajaj Auto, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, Ambuja, UltraTech Cement and Wipro. Shares of most of them have languished in the last two weeks.



Bajaj Auto stock fell nearly 5 per cent on Wednesday after its September quarter operating results missed street expectations. Last Wednesday, Reliance Industries had reported a 17 per cent rise in net profit, which have been lower than street expectations.

Earnings disappointments have added to the existing woes of investors, who have been worried about the impact of higher crude oil prices and falling rupee on the country’s finances. The tightening liquidity conditions, which is weighing down non banking finance companies, have contributed to the uncertainty.

“The fear of tight liquidity and higher interest rates is adversely impacting several domestic oriented sectors, which were the key to FY19 earnings recovery” said Gautam Duggad, head of research, Motilal Oswal Securities. “NBFCs will see downgrades after many years of strong growth”.

Analysts said further delay in earnings recovery could result in investors losing patience. Investors have been waiting for an earnings recovery for the last two years.

Market participants are now analysing the impact of the liquidity squeeze in NBFCs on the economy."
65,2018-10-26,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks extended losses to the second consecutive session on Friday as concerns over weak macro, lacklustre Asian cues and uninspiring September quarter earnings continued to weigh on the sentiment.

An official data released on Thursday showed that the fiscal deficit of the country has widened in the first half of 2018-19 to 95.3 per cent of the Budget Estimate (BE), mainly on account of slow growth in revenue collections. The deficit was at 91.3 per cent of BE at September-end of the last financial year.

Weak Asian peers also kept the mood subdued at home. Asian shares slipped again on Friday morning, deepening this week's markets rout, after disappointing results from Alphabet and Amazon heightened concerns over the outlook for US corporate earnings, global trade and economic growth, Reuters reported. 

Domestic currency rupee today opened 16 paise down at 73.43 against the US dollar following steady capital outflows and weakness in domestic equities amid rising geopolitical tensions. 

The BSE Sensex was 300 points, or 0.89 per cent 33,389.9 down at , while Nifty50 was 111 points, or 0.98 per cent per cent down at 10,013.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell up to 0.61 per cent in early trade, in sync with benchmark Sensex. 

In the Sensex index, only five stocks- Tata Motors, Adani Ports, Sun Pharma, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Steel - were in the green at that time. 

YES Bank, NTPC, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel and Vedanta were among the top losers in the Sensex kitty of stocks.

All sectoral indices on the BSE were incurring losses, with metal, power, realty and utilities declining over 1 per cent.

JSW Steel, Hindalco, Vedanta, Indiabulls Real Estate, Oberoi Realty and DLF were keeping the metal and realty pack down.

From the power sector, NTPC, Suzlon, Reliance Infra and Adani Power were among the top losers."

Where are We: Nifty bounced from the low of 10138 until 10710 level. However, the index failed to close the earlier gap which acted as resistance for the pullback. Higher time-frame charts, mainly weekly, depict trend line breakdown.

What is in Store: The benchmark index is now oscillating near the psychological mark of 10,000. These levels are place in the proximity of March 2018-lows and now the intermediate support lies between 9950 and 10,000. As breakdown is visible on the charts, the index could unfold a potential leg of down-move initially until 9,786 levels. However, a minor pullback cannot be ruled out. Intermediate resistance for the index is now placed at 10,200-10,300.

What You Could Do: Fresh trend line breakdowns are now visible on Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto and Britannia. Within the pharma sector, Cadila (at Rs 337) is poised for a breakdown initially till Rs 300 mark. Sun Pharma and Lupin are now giving up the previous gains and could possibly correct by 5 per cent-7 per cent. Metal stocks could possibly witness more correction. Jindal Steel & Power is below the threshold support of Rs 180 mark and could continue the current trend until Rs 140. Similarly, Vedanta could possibly continue the current trend until Rs 180 levels. However, within the IT sector Wipro could outperform as higher time frame charts remain positive. Intermediate support for the stock is at Rs 300-310 which could be considered for accumulation during the correction. Stock prices hold the potential to move beyond Rs 400 in a year.

71,2018-10-30,Asian Paints,"Though the domestic market had a lacklustre session on Tuesday, it remained technically important and was more-or-less on the expected lines. The Nifty saw a shaky opening, scaled higher to mark the day’s high but then remained listless while paring gains and finally dipping into the red. There was volatility, but the market moved in a defined and limited range.


Others
At the end, the Nifty50 ended the day down 52.45 points or 0.51 per cent. The technically important thing was that Nifty faced resistance precisely in the 10,180-10,250 zone. It did attempt to move past the 10,250 mark, but pared those gains.

As we step into Wednesday’s trade, this zone will remain critically important zone for Nifty and the market will have to move past this to avoid fresh weakness from creeping in. On Wednesday, Nifty is likely to see the 10,250 and 10,310 levels play out as immediate resistance. Supports should come in at 10,180 and 10,110 levels.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI stood at 38.3970 on the daily chart and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD remained bullish as it traded above the signal line. No major formations were observed on the candles.

Overall, Wednesday’s session will be technically important if Nifty has to continue with its attempt to form a temporary base near the current lows. If this technical pullback is to continue, it would be imperative for Nifty to move past 10,250 level. Even if the market does not change its trend, a technical pullback which takes Nifty past the 10,380-10,400 zone cannot be ruled out. Caution is advised for the day ahead.

73,2018-10-31,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Consumption, often touted as the biggest investment theme in the domestic market, has let investors and fund managers down this festive season.

There are clear signs of a slowdown in consumer demand, both in urban and rural India, and fewer investors are buying this theme on Dalal Street.


What went wrong?The premise for consumption as a preferred investment theme was based on hopes that rural demand would jump after MSP hikes, farm loan waivers and election-related spending in the runup to the 2019 general elections. But southwest monsoon ended up below normal this year, affecting farm output and food prices have remained sluggish, hurting farmer incomes.

Some analysts say MSP hikes are unlikely to aid demand due to poor procurement and infrastructure facilities. Among sectors , FMCG players are yet to pass on the recent hike in input costs. Their volumes might have peaked. 

Urban demand for consumer durables and automobile has slowdown down as many consumer-focused NBFCs are facing liquidity issues. Recent interest rate hikes and inflationary concerns due to rising crude oil prices have also dented outlook for consumption plays.


Data confirms slowdownNomura’s proprietary heat-map of high-frequency data is confirming early signs of a demand slowdown. The moderation is spearheaded by consumption – both rural and urban, the brokerage said.

“Traditional bellwethers of rural consumption – two-wheeler and tractor sales – have moderated to 5 per cent YoY in Q3 from 16-25 per cent in Q2. Higher fuel prices are also starting to bite urban demand – September witnessed a 3.6 per cent YoY contraction in passenger vehicle sales,” the brokerage said.


Q2 numbers & margin risksConsumer-linked firms have so far reported mixed numbers for September quarter. While Hindustan Unilever and ITC managed to meet Street expectations, Asian Paints disappointed the Street on the margin front. Risks on margins are elevated given the rising input cost dynamics, Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.

Data showed sectors such as consumer discretionary and consumer staples have seen a cut in FY19 price multiples. Consumer staples commands the highest valuation at over 40 times despite the expected price-to-earnings multiple for 2019 contracting 15 per cent since August 28. 


Unhealthy returnsAmong the consumption-linked equity indices, BSE Auto index has lost one-fourth of its 25 per cent of market value this calendar. The BSE consumer durables index is flat, while the FMCG index has delivered 6 per cent return since last Diwali.

Among mutual fund schemes, Sundaram Rural and Consumption Fund, which managed Rs 2,400 crore assets, has seen its NAV drop 12 per cent in last one year, compared with a 4.55 per cent fall its benchmark NIFTY 500 TRI. ITC, M&M, HUL, UPL and Britannia Industries were some of its biggest holdings of the fund as of September 30.

“Rising interest rates, short term issues on the liquidity front for NBFCs and rising cost of fuel were recent issues which could’ve had a toll on near-term demand viz., in discretionary segments such as auto. Oil inflation which flows into raw material cost of companies using the downstream products, could create pressure on profitability margins in the near term. Historically, consumer companies have demonstrated the ability to pass-on material cost inflation with a lag,” Sundaram Mutual Fund said in a written reply to ETMarkets.com query.

The mutual fund noted that its rural and consumption universe has a larger skew towards mid and small-sized companies where valuations have softened and have now moved to their long-term averages. The volume improvement and earnings growth trends across consumption categories, including staples and discretionary, continue to remain healthy all along, the mutual fund noted.

Among others, Reliance Consumption Fund, Quant Consumption Fund, UTI India Lifestyle and Canara Robeco Consumer Trends, too, have offered negative returns and failed to beat their benchmarks.

Mail sent to Canara Robeco Mutual Fund did not elicit any response.

“While we are not worried about a sharp slowdown in consumption demand, tapering is likely. Rural demand may remain stable to weak. State election spending and MSP implementation won’t be effective in raising demand. Urban and semi-urban demand may be dented due to limited NBFC lending,” said Phillip Capital.

This brokerage is factoring in weaker volume growth for automobiles (two-wheeler and commercial vehicles), consumer durables and FMCG firms in the second half of the financial year.

Consumer durables volume growth is expected to remain modest for at least a year. Auto volume growth is now seen at 8-9 per cent in H2FY19 against 13-14 per cent last year. FMCG volumes are already at peak, Phillip Capital said. 


No Diwali booster this time?There are lights and discounts everywhere, but showrooms are empty, making analysts wonder whether e-commerce onslaught or lack of demand is hurting retail sales this Diwali.

“It is no fun for retailers and businesses this Diwali. The festive demand has been underwhelming. There are the usual lights and offers splashed across windows, but (without exception) crowds are sparse. There aren’t any queues and there’s little or no buzz; most retailer conversations indicates as much,” said Edelweiss Securities.

Offline retailers are hopeful of a pickup in demand over the next weekend when the most auspicious shopping day of dhanteras falls.

Edelweiss Securities noted that among various segments, luxury apparel is taking big hit while mid-market apparel is doing just about okay for offline stores. This could be due to e-commerce discounts and easy financing. 

“Car sales have been slower than that of two-wheelers. But consumer durables stores are ready to outprice e-com offers and are seeing strong sales. Most retailers are optimistic (desperately hopeful?) about the next (last) and big weekend,” the brokerage said.


Marketmen still hopefulNilesh Shetty of Quantum Mutual Fund said the festival season has not gotten off to a great start, but his meeting with companies recently versus a year ago suggests the pricing power coming back for them. 

“Demand on the ground seems to be a lot better than it was a year ago. We are somewhere close to in the early stage of a pickup in consumer demand. I am not too sure about the second half of FY19, but it looks like we are at the cusp of a pickup in consumer demand from where we were a year ago,” he told ET NOW. 

Sundaram MF said that the near-term macro-led issues is expected to be transitory and its impact on market sentiments should get mitigated as confidence on consumption growth gathers pace in the coming quarter.
“Structural factors such as increased farm mechanisation, favourable demographics, increasing income levels and working population, premiumisation within categories, should help household consumption spending in the long run. Added to this, initiatives on financial inclusion have been the fulcrum to bring large strata of rural population into mainstream finance and increase institutional credit and create long-term drivers for consumption growth,” it said."
72,2018-10-31,Asian Paints,"Samvat 2074 — the period from last Diwali to this — has been a tough year for investors with the stock market tumbling from their highs. In the past year, the Sensex has risen 2.5 per cent while BSE’s mid- and small-cap indices have declined 14 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively. Many smaller shares have fallen as much as 50-70 per cent from their highs, eroding the value of several portfolios. The next few months are likely to be challenging as well. In such an environment, it would be prudent to hold stocks that could stay resilient in testing times. ET spoke to five brokerages for their top picks for Samvat 2075:


Axis Securities

Mold-Tek PackagingImproved volume outlook from Paints and Food & FMCG customers with growing pie of F&F aiding strong margin delivery. We believe, with rising contribution from F&F segment, better off-take from paints sector, full scale operationalization of RAK plant, new product launches and consistent increase in share of IML products, MTEP can report 31 per cent earnings CAGR over FY 2018-20. We revise our estimates and assign it a 20 times PE basis FY20E EPS.


TridentThe company is the flagship company of Trident Group, with business interests in home textiles and paper. The company is trusted partner to the top global retailers & fashion houses adding premium customers globally present in USA, UK, Italy, France, Japan, Australia amongst other countries. Company is in process to reduce its debt burden thus making its balance sheet lighter. The net debt/equity ratio is already at 0.7 and the net debt stands at Rs 2,000 cr with LT debt at Rs 1,539 crore at the end of Q2FY19. We expect the return ratios to improve as debt falls and efficiency parameters improve.


Titan
While, we are cognizant of rich valuations for consumer and retail stocks, we believe these will continue to sustain the premium levels for companies offering highest visibility of earnings growth over medium to longer term. Revenue growth opportunity of 20 per cent CAGR over the long term is immense and far superior to peers. Further, with an up-trending margin profile driven by growing revenue from SSSG makes us believe in the structural growth outlook of Titan.


HDFC Securities

Cummins India
The company is well placed to capture the broad revival in industrial and infrastructure capex in India, with its bestin-class product portfolio, wide distribution reach, and technological leadership. With the kind of technological leadership CIL has in the Indian market, along with a healthy balance sheet and strong parentage, it deserves a premium over its peers in terms of valuation. We feel investors could buy the stock and add on dips to Rs 597–605 for a target of Rs 817.


Cyient
A niche engineering services, strong client relationships, timely acquisitions to support its roduct solutions profile, strong financial profile with minimal debt, and healthy debt protection metrics and liquidity makes a case for investment in its stock. It has some deals in the negotiation phase, and the overall deal pipeline remains good. We feel investors could buy the stock at the LTP and add on dips to Rs 545–555 (11x FY20E EPS) for a target of Rs 748 (15x FY20E EPS).


Hindustan Oil Exploration
The company is debt free, with net cash balances of Rs 35 cr and Rs 53 cr invested in its subsidiary. Over the next two years, company expects significant ramp up in volumes which would ensure growth visibility going ahead. Given strong management, a robust balance sheet and stellar growth expected over the next two-three years, we recommend buy at Rs 130, and add on dips to Rs 108 with a target price of Rs 177 till next Diwali.




IIFL

Petronet LNG
The company is set to benefit from 17 per cent capacity expansion at Dahej terminal to 17.5 mmt by FY 2019 from current 15mmt. We expect revenue and PAT CAGR of 16 per cent and 19 per cent over FY 2018-20 respectively. The stock trades at 10.8 times FY 2020 estimated EPS with discount valuation to its 3-year average. We recommend Buy on the stock with a target price of Rs 256.


Mindtree
India’s eighth largest IT services company has strong digital capabilities. The stock has corrected almost 30 per cent since Sep’18 and trades at attractive valuations vs. peers despite better revenue and EPS growth profile. In our view, the correction has factored in the concerns related to recent softness/macros and we reckon that Mindtree is likely to outperform peers like LTI, Mphasis and Hexaware.


Motherson Sumi
The company has successfully acquired / integrated 21 companies till date. Hence, it is set to achieve FY 2020 estimated revenue target of $18bn. At current market price, Motherson Sumi trades at 15 times FY 2020 estimated EPS and we believe the recent correction is overdone. We expect consolidated revenue, EBITDA and PAT to register 16 per cent, 29 per cent and 47 per cent CAGR respectively over FY 2018-20. We value MSSL at 18 times FY 2020 EPS and recommend Buy with a target price of Rs 293.

Maruti Suzuki India: A household name, Maruti Suzuki is largest passenger vehicles company with an impressive market share of  nearly 50 per cent in domestic market with 1.65 million vehicles sold in 2017-18. The brokerage believes that the government’s higher focus on raising rural income and overall increase in per capita income are big positives for four wheeler passenger vehicle industry. But challenges in the near term remain in the form of rising interest rates, firm crude oil prices and a depreciating rupee. But the long term growth story remains intact.Next

Motilal Oswal

ICICI Bank
ICICI Bank reported better than expected set of numbers for Q2FY19. ICICI is in the midst of an improvement in the operating environment and is showing healthy signs of earnings normalization. With challenges related to management transition getting addressed, the bank is now focusing on growing its core operating profits.


Britannia Industries
Rapidly expanding distribution, continuing investment in R&D, rapid pace of new launches and significant expansion of its own manufacturing indicate the immense confidence that management has on growth prospects. Opportunity beyond biscuits is also substantially high. Continuing premiumization, significant incremental cost savings and a favorable commodity cost outlook mean further EBITDA margin expansion prospects are bright as well.


Exide Industries
OEM and replacement demand remains healthy in both automotive and industrial segments. Also, there is a gradual shift away from unorganised to organised players. We believe that the battery industry should benefit the most and grow at a CAGR of 10-12 per cent over the medium-to-long term. We expect Exide to continue gaining market share, backed by new product launches for existing and new applications, and a sharp focus on customer service and marketing infrastructure.


Religare Broking

Asian Paints
The Indian paints industry is estimated to grow at a healthy pace of 13 per cent CAGR over the next two years. Further, the recent rationalization in the GST rates in paints could benefit the organized players in the long run. Moreover improved product mix and operating leverage should provide cushion to margins which would mitigate concern of rising crude oil price. We estimate revenue and PAT to grow by 10.9 per cent & 12.2 per cent CAGR respectively over FY 2018-20, driven by steady capacity addition, wide distribution reach and continued efforts towards innovative launches.


Ashok LeylandWe believe Ashok Leyland stands to benefit from the upcycle in the commercial vehicle industry given its strong position in the M&HCV and LCV segment. Further, implementation of BS-VI emissions norms from April 2020 would also lead to pre-purchases in H2FY20. Further, the proposed implementation of CV scrappage policy reduces concerns of volume growth post FY20 as it is likely to create an additional demand of ~2-2.5 lakh vehicles. We believe with positive industry growth prospects and Ashok Leyland’s strong brand presence in the CV segment and its focus on diversifying to less cyclical businesses makes it one of our preferred picks.


Godrej Consumer
Led by demand uptick and company led initiatives towards constant focus on product innovation, increasing penetration & distribution reach and sustained brand building efforts, we estimate GCPL’s consolidated Revenue and PAT to grow by 12.8 per cent & 16.8 per cent CAGR respectively over FY18-20E. Improving mix and cost efficiency measures should result in steady margin gains. Strong brand equity, low leverage, robust cash flows and healthy dividend pay-outs justify premium valuation. We recommend a Buy on the stock with target price of Rs 897."

5,2018-11-19,Asian Paints,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."
3,2018-11-19,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: Shares of paint manufacturers have been shining bright even as the broader consumption sector reeled under an economic slowdown.

Strong earnings visibility and consistent performance have kept investor sentiment upbeat on the counter. However, the strong outperformance may now pause given the rich valuations, said analysts.

Stocks of the top paint companies outperformed the 30-share benchmark Sensex in the near term as well as long term, making them prominent wealth creators, and darling of asset managers.

Berger Paints and Asian Paints are currently trading around record high levels. Berger Paints has delivered 50.29 per cent return for last one year, 275 per cent for five years and 2,223 for last 10 years. Asian Paints has jumped 33.44 per cent for last one year, 162.14 per cent for last five and 947.81 per cent for last 10 years.

Kansai Nerolac and Akzo Nobel India have also strongly outperformed Sensex over these periods. Akzo Nobel shares hit a record high earlier this month.

In the comparable periods, the Sensex gained 14.84 per cent, 43.90 per cent and 134.66 per cent, respectively.

Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, says the paint industry has very high entry barriers, which is why the top three established players –Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Akzo Nobel – are able to hold profit margins and the return on capital very well.

“The fundamental distinction between the paint industry and other industries such as airlines is that entry is easy in the latter’s case and so new entrants have come in and wiped out profit margins for established players such as Jet Airways, Kingfisher and now IndiGo,” Mukherjea said.

“In contrast, paints as an industry is any incredibly hard space to enter, and the top three incumbents have ruled the roost for last 20 years. They have consistently high margins and return on capital,” he said.

“Paints firms allow incumbents to benefit from the growth they see in their top line,” he said.

The Indian paints sector, estimated to be a Rs 50,000 crore industry, is classified into two main segments: decorative - which accounts for 75 per cent of the industry’s value, and industrials, which accounts for the remaining 25 per cent.

The industry consists of a mix of both organised and unorganised players, but former holds a major share of the market. Till financial year 2017, organised players had a market share of about 65 per cent, which has risen to 80 per cent post GST implementation. The top players in the organised sector are Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Berger Paints and Akzo Nobel, which together account for about 68 per cent of the market share.

In financial year 2019, the paints industry expanded at the rate of 12 per cent in volume terms and 15 per cent in value terms.

In general, the growth of the paint industry depends on a number of factors such as disposable income in the hands of public, urbanisation, economic development, monsoon rains, raw material prices, growth in infrastructure and recovery in real estate and auto segments, Care Ratings said in a report.

Care said government initiatives towards infrastructural development, schemes like Housing for All and a reduction in GST from 28 per cent to 18 per cent on the paint industry are likely to boost the demand for paints.

“Post RERA and GST implementation, unorganised players are not able to continue the business at the same pace, and demand is shifting to organised players,” said Rusmik Oza, head of fundamental research at Kotak Securities.

“The repainting segment is not slowing down, even though there is a slowdown in the new homes segment. The companies have good pricing power. So, a hike in input prices is being passed on, and GST rates have also come down, which bodes well for the sectoral leaders,” Oza said.

He, however, raised concerns that the stocks may have run up a bit too much, making valuations stretched.

Asian Paints’ price-to-earnings ratio at 80.1 makes it the highest valued on the S&P BSE Sensex index, according to Bloomberg.

“The valuations are too rich and not sustainable, and there could be a phase when they could underperform in the near to medium term until the real estate sector and the economy pick up,” said Oza. “Their fortunes will still be linked to real estate sector,” he added."
4,2018-11-19,Asian Paints,"One can incrementally add companies where earnings are depressed and where there is scope for a cyclical recovery in earnings and some potential for PE rerating and which over the next two-three years, could generate alpha, says Mahesh Patil, Co-CIO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Earnings are here, markets are here.Earnings or markets are always anticipating future earnings.


But they are not coming.This year again, earnings have been downgraded. We were looking at the beginning of the year but as you move forward, the base becomes favourable. So, the next year earnings looks very good. That fact is there are some challenges. In the last two quarters, we have seen the GDP growth slowdown materially and that has heard the earnings growth across though the tax cuts have given a kind of prop. Despite the downgrades, I think the earnings growth this year is still looking at around 15% growth, which is not bad.


But has the sentiment changed from where it was a month back? Two things happened on the global front. As a result of the easy monetary policy, globally a lot of central banks have become very dovish. Global liquidity and money supply have started to increase again after contracting last year when US was tapering. We have seen the US going into quantitative easing (QE). The European Union is again talking about fiscal stimulus. So, the money supply globally has improved and that is giving rise to a feeling that there will be a revival in global growth. 

That has changed globally and you can see money supply coming in. Money is flowing back into the emerging markets and in the last two months, FII flows have been positive. On the domestic side, there has clearly been a slowdown. It is doing its bit now. There is a clear acknowledgement of the slowdown and various efforts have been made to address the slowdown including recent tax cuts or attempts to address the NBFC problems by providing more liquidity into the system. All that is giving hope. Equity is not about the current but it is about looking into the future. While the current earnings are bad and economic growth print this quarter will probably be the slowest, still things will start to improve from here. 

Rate cuts are also being slowly transmitted. Altogether, the market is feeling the worse is behind us and things will start to improve.


But the higher frequency data is disappointing. Inflation was higher at 4.5% largely because of vegetable prices. The SBI economist is making a case that the GDP is going to go below 5%in Q2. Telecom is in absolute disarray, leading to stress in the banking sector. On top of that, auto companies are saying that the festive uptick is over.What is that data point which gives you confidence that look the worst is behind us and there is light at the end of the tunnel?The market probably is slightly ahead. If you look at what caused the slowdown in the economy in the last two quarters, a), the government’s spending contracted quite a bit in the last two quarters because of elections and that money started to flow back into the system. We have seen the government starting to make disbursals, so that supply from the government side is slowly starting to come in. 

The rural economy has been fairly slow. The commentary from some of these consumer names has seen a slowdown even for auto names. The excess monsoon has created some kind of a havoc because of the reiterating monsoon. This season might still not be that great but it bodes well for the rabi crop and the water levels are good. 


While the current earnings are bad and economic growth print this quarter will probably be the slowest, things will start to improve from here.-Mahesh Patil
The rural economy should start to look up in the second half. That would help consumption a bit. We have seen rate cuts of around 135 bps in this calendar year. The transmission has been slow and for a lot of companies and corporates who want to borrow, the rates are still fairly high, spreads are still very high. That will slowly start to normalise. 

The problem in the NBFC sector is still not over but enough remedial measures have been taken over there and so there is no contagion effect. Also the good news is that wherever there have been companies which have been faced problem because of the global risk appetite coming back, there is money coming back. We have seen lots of investors -- whether PE funds or other investors -- coming in and trying to buy some of these distressed assets.

Some of these NBFCs are facing challenges on the liability side. As investors come in, that should slowly settle down a bit. We will see interest rate transmission starting to happen and that will help to stimulate some amount of demand on the retail side. These are some of the positives.

I agree that we will not see a sharp recovery from here. It will be a very slow and gradual recovery. Market at this point are probably factoring most of the stuff and we might not see a big upside from here from a near-term perspective. But globally, because of the easy money and low interest rates, valuations are fairly high. So, market could get into consolidation phase.


What has the strategy been in Aditya Birla? Where have you increased or reduced your exposure in the last month or two?In the financial services sector, in the last four-five months we have increased our exposure in the insurance space because companies there have steady earnings visibility. Valuations have now again been kind of priced in but we see a steady compounding over there.


What is the right way to value an insurance company? When you look at the IRDA data, which talks about new premium selling, there is a decline from 20% to 7% for three months in a row. Is that temporary and if som then why are markets excited about insurance stocks?When you look at the headline numbers -- just like a top line in a company is the sales numbers -- it is showing weakness because ULIPs are linked to the market. They are probably not growing as much as the adjusted premium equivalent, APE data. We call it equivalent to a top line for a company that is showing some weakness. But what is happening in insurance is that the more profitable products which is more protection, the growth is fairly strong there. Since there is under-penetration in that category, a lot of companies are now focussing on driving protection products where the ROE is much higher. So, the mix is improving and as a result, the operating profit growth is much stronger while the sales top line growth is weaker. In a normal parlance, if you compare with any other company, that is what is looking good and it is a more distribution product on the protection side. 

As banks drive distribution, that is providing a steady growth to the earnings or the operating earnings for the insurance companies. That is how you value those companies not on the top line but on the ROEV.


You are bullish on telecom. What are you expecting with regards to the pricing environment and how things will shape up?It has reached a point where for a couple of players, the overall profitability has come to a level where because of the government intervention also, there is a scenario where operators are willing to take price hike. It is going to be a long wait though because each company would have different dynamics depending on how the operating ratios are and how the debt burden is. That will decide in the longer term which companies will survive. 

Having said that, clearly we have seen the players. The largest player who was aggressive in the market has taken some indirect price hikes and that has given room for the incumbents to also take price hikes and it looks like finally the price war has bottomed out. If somebody has to earn a decent return on capital, there is room for more price increases down the line and that would be positive for the sector in terms of news flow and in terms of growth, because we are not going to see more growth coming in because of increase in penetration. 

We have driven penetration sufficiently. Obviously people will migrate from 2G to 4G and so data customer base would increase and that will drive the increase in ARPU going forward. We are fairly constructive on this sector. IT has to be considered on a case-to-case basis, but directionally it looks like the EBITDA numbers and growth will improve from here.


Where have you reduced exposure?We had reduced exposure in metals earlier because though there is some kind of risk on that could see some upside in the metal space, but by and large overall global growth outlook will still remain fairly tepid. We were very positive on metals last year but we have reduced weightage over there. We are underweight that sector. 

We have slightly reduced weightage in the consumer side also because of the valuations, though there is nothing too wrong over there in terms of a slight slowdown in growth. However, though we are down on consumer staple, we are still positive on consumer discretionary, consumer durable names. During the early part of the year, we reduced our exposure in autos but we are re-evaluating that as we are seeing some kind of bottoming out in terms of volume de-growth that we have seen in the last one year.


You have clearly said you are sticking to the Nifty companies, which you still see as growth companies going forward. You are also selectively looking at midcaps but gradually over the next year or two. How should one read that?In the last one and a half years, the market rally has been fairly narrow. A few stocks have done well and so there is a valuation divergence across the largecaps and also within the midcap space. It is still early days. Unless the domestic economy gains significant traction, we would not see the mid and smallcap stocks really participate in a big way. So, it is not going to be across-the-board but picking selectively because of the marked lack of interest in small and midcap space. Quite a few stocks are available at reasonable valuations. It is more a stock specific valuation call, which we are looking to add in some of these stocks.

If we see the domestic recovery starting to play out, then there will be wider participation in the mid and smallcap space across the board. One should still stay away from companies with high leverage or promoter concerns. The risk in the mid and smallcaps still remains fairly high. We are not seeing a broad-based rally at least in the near term but if you take a three-year view and try to build up a portfolio, I think there are enough pockets of value in the small and midcap space.


Big companies like Bajaj Finance, HUL, Asian Paints have gained market share. Small companies have suffered cost of capital, inflation. Are markets telling you that these may be expensive companies but they are the only ones growing in this downturn? What is wrong in just sticking to those 10-15 stocks?I would agree. These companies will continue to do well in terms of earnings, but somewhere down the line, as the markets and the cycle with liquidity and risk comes back, you would tend to move down the spectrum and other companies where multiples, earnings are depressed because of the slowdown that we have seen. 

You are looking at companies where you could see big returns over the medium to long term, companies where there is a potential of high earnings growth and PE rerating. Some of these larger companies have steady earnings growth. Because the earnings have been right and PE multiples are fair, there is no PE rerating scope. They will continue to grow at the pace of earnings which would be around 10-12-13-14%. It is not a time to move out from some of the large names, we are still having them in the portfolio. 

Incrementally one can add companies where earnings are depressed and where you could see a cyclical recovery or otherwise in earnings and some potential for PE rerating and over the next two-three years, these could generate alpha."
2,2018-11-19,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The average stipend offered to students of Indian Institute of Management Indore by companies offering summer internships this year stands at Rs 1.68 lakh per month, up 12% from Rs 1.5 lakh last year, officials said.

Female students on an average have received 24% higher stipend than their male counterparts in the summer internship placements, officials said. The highest stipend offered was Rs 4 lakh, the same as the previous year.

IIM Indore has the biggest batch strength of 589 students in the class of 2021, including 258, or 44%, girls.

“Placing the largest number of students across all IIMs for the summers is a big task,” said Himanshu Rai, director of IIM Indore. “Our students are among the brightest in the world, and the summer placement offers are a testimony to that.”

More than 160 recruiters, including Amazon, Google, Boston Consulting Group, Ernst & Young, Deloitte USI, Hindustan Unilever, Aditya Birla Group, Goldman Sachs, and OLX participated in the placement process this year where 21% of the batch received offers for profiles in analytics and ecommerce domain.

There were 39 companies visiting the campus for the first time, who including Adani Group, Capgemini (ELITE), Diageo, GEP Consulting, Microsoft, Reckitt Benckiser, Salesforce, Walmart Labs and Xiaomi.

Companies offering roles in analytics and ecommerce included Blackbuck, Cisco, Media.net, Salesforce, Udaan and Walmart Labs.

Recruiters in the BFSI domain included Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Edelweiss, HSBC and State Street.

Prominent recruiters in the consulting domain this year included Avalon Consulting, Bain Capability Network and PwC.

In the sales and marketing domain, companies like Aditya Birla Fashion Retail, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, Dabur, and ITC participated."
8,2018-11-20,Asian Paints,"SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give at least a 30% upside from present prices, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

On Aviation StocksThere has been a relative slowdown of the economy but a lot of it is getting addressed. The cost of money is definitely headed lower which means ease in travel and very lucrative rates maybe a thing of the past. Rates may start to head up. We have a buy on both the stocks on declines. There is regular bouts of profit booking which comes when IndiGo was Rs 1m750 and SpiceJet was Rs 145 . But again, these are the two listed companies. Personally, I prefer to travel by Vistara.

But on declines, this is a very consumer centric industry where 2020 should bode extremely well, given that we are very optimistic on the return of the consumer, the economy doing well and aviation as a conduit for that. 


On Telecom
Our clients have been laughing their way to the bank. We have been long on Bharti and Reliance as a disclosure and we are riding it. We think there is going to be a short term bout of profit booking which may last for two-three days but this is one sector which is going to bely most expectations. Most of the underpinnings are over. ARPUs are going to rise and we think there could be a fair package for both Vodafone and Bharti from the government.

We will work on that but we definitely think the government is going to give some relief. On the consumption side, you can see that we have been saying that ARPUs may have bottomed out and we thought that data is definitely going to get more expensive. A disclosure, Bharti, Reliance are two of our top picks. They continue to be in our portfolio and this week has been exceptionally strong for all investors who have held those shares on our account.

We are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months.-Sanjiv Bhasin


On PSU Banks
The weaker or the most hated sectors -- telecom and PSU banks are bouncing back. The Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel is a path breaking decision and the SBI chairman, smaller banks have said that write backs will be a part of the course as most of the provisioning is done. So, I am extremely positive on PSU banks. There is a Rs 70,000 crore of recapitalisation, which means almost 5.5 lakh crore of book will grow in the next three years.

We think you cannot go wrong given that yields are softening. They are awash with cash and they are going to definitely start the lending cycle on the retail side. So SBI continues to be our top pick. Along with that, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give you at least a 30% upside from present prices. 2020 may actually see PSU banks lead from the front


On Divestment 
The divestment candidates like Concor, BPCL & SCI have moved up very smartly.We think this is going to be a path breaking reform by the government. Strategic selloff last happened in 1999 and after that there has been a total hiatus. The government has decided that they have no business to be in business and that is a very positive move.

BPCL, Concor and SCI should set the cat amongst the pigeons. We are extremely positive. I think the valuations they will get will also be fairly impressive, given that all three businesses are monopolies. We have to see in the next three months, how fast the divestment takes place. The finance minister has already indicated that they should be done with it before March and it should see re-rating of the entire PSU basket. 

The government has the intension to bring down their holding to 26% in a lot of other companies like IOC and BHEL. These are all very good entry points because the unlocking of value will be huge as and when it takes place.


On Pharma Stocks
Pharma has been a very big underperformer. This is just about time where smart money is seeing rotation. By the way, pharma numbers, particularly the likes of Glenmark were very smart looking and now people have realised that pharma has consolidated enough and the worries of the FDA issues are now going to be on the backburner. Plus, generic pricing in the US may be back and they are spreading in geographies across the world. The local businesses for all of them have looked up so we are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months. 2020 could see pharma hugely outperform as a sector.


On Trends in Consumption SpaceThere are three parts. Firstly, these stocks have been the prime of most of the mutual fund portfolios. Nestle, Lever, Colgate and Asian Paints have taken the cake, even though numbers were not that sparkling. But they have been very expensive stocks and have been getting more expensive. For us, the game changer is these two three events which the government has done -- corporate tax cut, strategic disinvestment. The pass through effect of money where the mistrust is now getting allayed and you should see much easier pass through of money from banks as PSU banks start to lend very actively on all three -- discretionary, staples and durables. 

The broader basket will definitely outperform. We are not making a case for Nestle or Lever at these prices. We think in fact if the Nifty sustains over 12,000 and if we hit new highs which is just round the corner, then the broader market consumption should do extremely well. That means discretionaries like auto and select other FMCG stocks could be outperformers in 2020."
7,2018-11-20,Asian Paints,"The first requirement to spot tomorrow’s big gainers is an ability to identify the right industry in times of distress. When stocks from across midcap and smallcap segments are witnessing heavy selling, select counters from certain niche segments are hovering at record high levels despite the economic slowdown.

These stocks come from unusual sectors such as insurance, asset management, paints, footwear, retailers and cable sectors.

Starting with the insurance industry, shares of heavyweights like ICICI Prudential Life, HDFC Life, ICICI Lombard General Insurance and SBI Life scaled their record high levels over the past fortnight.

What is driving the sector?

Shyamsunder Bhat, Chief Investment Officer, Exide Life Insurance, says unlike NBFCs or banks, the insurance sector does not have NPA, liquidity or solvency issues. Almost all insurers are well-capitalised and with reasonably comfortable solvency ratios.

“This is one of the reasons we have seen investors come to the insurance sector. Investors are appreciating the value that this sector offers, which is what is reflected in these multiples,” he told ETMarkets.com.

In the asset management space, HDFC AMC and Reliance Nippon have proved their mettle. Both HDFC AMC and Reliance Nippon scaled fresh all-time highs of Rs 3,770 and Rs 378.10 on November 14.

“A very big trend is playing out in the insurance and AMC space. It has all the makings of a very large trend,” Atul Suri, Marathon Trend-PMS, told ETNow.

MSCI, the world’s biggest index compiler, last month added Berger Paints, HDFC Asset Management, ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life to its India index.

Paint companies Akzo Nobel (Rs 2,275), Asian Paints (Rs 1,833) and Berger Paints (Rs 534) are doing a colourful job in financial portfolios with their recent record performance.

The paint industry consists a mix of both organised and unorganised players, but the organised players occupy a major share of the market amid the ongoing liquidity crunch and slowdown.

“Post RERA and GST implementation, unorganised players are not able to continue their business at the same pace, and demand is shifting to organised players. The repainting segment is not slowing down, even though there is a slowdown in the new homes segment. These companies have good pricing power. So, the rise in input cost is being passed on, and GST rates have come down, which bode well for the sectoral leaders,” said Rusmik Oza, head of fundamental research at Kotak Securities.

With a 50 per cent year-to-date rally, Relaxo and Bata are buzzing on Dalal Street with their strong outperformance against the benchmark Sensex, which advanced 11 per cent during this period.

Footwear players are planning to strengthen their presence in the domestic market. Bata India in October said it would make its presence stronger by adding 500 stores in next five years, focusing mainly on smaller markets. The company recently reported a 30 per cent YoY rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 71.30 crore for the September quarter.

Dolat Capital, which has an ‘Accumulate’ rating on Relaxo, believes the company is likely to increase its distribution reach in southern and western markets going ahead.

“Store addition and premiumisation are likely to accelerate growth. We continue to believe that the company has attractive product offerings and has the ability to premiumise portfolio at the lower end of the pyramid,” it said in a report on November 5.

Shares of Polycab India and KEI Industries are trading around their all-time levels in the cable sector. Financial stability and demand for their products seem to be key to their success. Polycab posted 115 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 191.82 crore in Q2FY20 over RS 89.20 crore reported for Q2FY19. KEI’s net profit jumped 83 per cent YoY to Rs 76.02 crore during the quarter under review.

Brokerage firm Angel Broking has a ‘hold’ rating on KEI with a target price of Rs 661. The brokerage expects KEI to report net revenue of around 18 per cent CAGR at Rs 5,872 crore during FY2019-21E mainly due to higher order book execution in the EPC segment, growth in EHV business and higher exports.

On the bottomline front, Angel Broking foresees around 29 per cent CAGR to Rs 300 crore over the same period on the back of strong volume growth.

Phillip Capital says Polycab’s product categories, strong business model, superior reach and brand recall offer investment comfort – especially in a competitive economic environment.

“Over the next two years, RoCE and RoE will be 24 per cent and 18 per cent, and operating cash flow will be Rs 760 crore. Currently, we expect earnings growth of 29 per cent CAGR over FY19-21,” it said.

Shares of Trent and Avenue Supermarts are also in demand.

Edelweiss Securities says Trent provides an opportunity to invest in four strong brands – Westside, Zudio, Star Bazaar and Zara. “Rolling forward, we retain 12-months’ forward price-to-equity (PE) multiple of 50 times to Westside, 35 times to Zara and price/sales of 1.5 times to Star Bazaar to arrive at a target price of Rs 590,” the brokerage said. Trent traded at Rs 500 on November 15.

All the above-mentioned stocks scaled their new highs between October 30 and November 15."
6,2018-11-20,Asian Paints,"We are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Mukherjea also says getting high teens to low 20s returns consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


There is every reason why one should not buy telecom stocks. In the next 10 minutes, we can find 15 reasons why one should not buy telecom stocks yet Bharti is at a 52-week high. What is going on?I guess there are probably enough people out there who are hoping that that the industry consolidates around two players and Bharti benefits from that from being one of those two players. I do not see any other logical way to understand this other than the fact that a number of investors out there are making a punt that they are in a two-player industry. Bharti will get its fair share of spoils. I cannot give you anything more substantive than that, I am afraid.


Can we imagine our life without power? The answer to that is no. But have shareholders of power companies made money? The answer is “no,” at least in India. Do you think telecom is like power? You need telecom but for minority shareholders, telecom companies will struggle now?Most regulated industries in India are similar -- whether you look at airlines, telecoms, power, infrastructure or real estate. Wherever the regulatory construct is such that the regulator or the government calls the shorts in terms of who gets in, who stays out and what are the rules of the game, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make any money. That is the rule of thumb I followed in my 11 years in India -- stay away from sectors where the government or the regulator determines the rules of engagement. In such a sector, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make money be that telecom, power, real estate or airlines.


ETNOW sources seem to be indicating that today the cabinet is going to decide on disinvestment in BPCL, Concor and SCI. Earlier also, the finance minister had indicated that disinvestment process is going to come to a close and she hopes to close in on that by the financial year end. Would you say though that the best is already in the price somewhat?I am not so sure how easy it will be to make money from high quality privatisation plays such as BPCL and Concor. Both are actually very good quality assets but I am not so sure how easy it will be for minority shareholders to make a punt on them and make money. What is more encouraging, what is more upbeat for the generally is that the government is clearly saying that in the next 6-8 months, we will move towards privatisation or large stake sales. That is probably the most bullish step forward towards privatisation we have seen in 14-15 years. The last major privatisation was made by NDA-1, a good 20 years ago. Beyond the stock specifics, this momentum in selling class assets is very encouraging for the market as a whole.


Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real.-Saurabh Mukherjea


What is the overarching theme that you are going with in the current environment? Is it domestic focussed names, is it valuation? Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real. 

Secondly, we look for companies where the products are as close as is possible to be essential for day-to-day life in India. We are trying to avoid companies where the product or the purchase is discretionary in nature. 

Third thing is barriers to entry. Clean accounts, essential products are very good to have but you need to have barriers to entry to make sure competition does not come and take your profits away. And when we find such companies we go and buy as proactively as we can without losing sleep on what was the PE multiple yesterday morning, what it will be tomorrow morning. We found in India around 20 such stocks; half are already in our portfolio and hopefully in the next year or so, we might find a couple of more stocks like this. 

As and when the economic environment becomes less hostile, we might become a little bit more adventurous in our stock picking. Over the last couple of years, it has been very tightly defined mantra, clean accounts, essential products, very high barriers to entry.


Sunil Singhania said buying a good business and buying a good stock are two different things. D-Mart is a great company, Indigo is a great company, a classic compounder which you own. Something like Aventis is a great company but if you are buying them at PE multiples of 50, 60, 70, the chances of making double digit returns for next three years are very rare. Do you think those classic compounders which you like and which are based on previous history, return ratios, ROE and ROC, they are outpriced right now?Sunil Singhania is a long-standing a guru, a friend, I have learnt from him in the years to come and we hope to learn a lot from him in the years to come. I learnt from him two years ago as to how to think about setting up an independent asset management business. Sunil is saying if you try to do what we are doing in India and try to do this in America, you will get slaughtered. 

In most efficient markets like the UK, USA, Germany and Japan, it is very difficult to maintain return on capital at 40% or even 30% over an extended period of time. Most glamorous well known American or Japanese firms will have return on capital of barely 15%. If they get to 15%, they will be celebrated on TV channels in America, on the covers of magazines and so on. 

Our country is unique amongst the world’s 10 largest economies in that we are the only large economy which has around 20-25 companies whose ROC is a million miles above their cost to capital for decades on end. When we say million miles, I am saying 40% ROC for a very extended period of time. If you can keep return on capital so far above the cost to capital for an extended period of time, it gives you a mountain of free cash flow and if you keep reinvesting that money in the business (as we have seen in India over the last five, 10, 20 years and even last year), you get a very high chance of keeping earnings growth around 20%-25% mark.

If we take one example of the several in our portfolio, this is exactly what Asian Paints has done for the last 30 years. Asian Paints 20 years ago was trading at exactly the same PE multiple. Asian Paints over the last 20 years has given close to 100 times returns. Nestle 20 years ago was trading at pretty close to the same multiple. Nestle over the last 20 years has given close to 80-90 times your money back. I do not know about the next three weeks or next three months, but I am pretty confident that if we carry on focussing on this type of company with very high barriers to entry, with return on capital being well above the cost to capital, we chug back plenty of free cash flow into the business. Whether you are Asian Paints, Pidilite or Dr Lal Path Labs, you reinvest the free cash flow back into the business. 

In a poor country like ours, the growth potential is immense. Even in a downturn, you are seeing these companies -- Asian Paints, Dr Lal Path Labs and even Page Industries -- which is a big part of our portfolio, give you volume growth between 9% and 19%. That gives you a sense of how far we have to go in terms of development to our country. 

PE-based investing has a big place in everybody’s portfolio. In the west, PE-based investing, value investing as it is better known as, is the definitive way to manage money by and large. It works in India as well. There is a small set of companies in our country which are able to keep return on capital very high and thus earnings growth is very high and if there you invest even at 100 times PE shown over the last three years and in my books I have shown over the last 20 years you still make very healthy returns, high teens, low 20s returns. 

If I make high teens, low 20s returns for our clients consistently, that is a pretty decent outcome for them. We are not claiming we can do 30-40% return by timing the market or by getting the PE multiples right, but high teens to low 20s consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India.


You are completely staying away from power, metals, real estate pockets. If we do see an overall pullback which we have already started to see when it comes to the market regardless of the fundamentals or growth indicators, do you see more participation across the board?The most interesting one will be auto and as we all know October has been a pretty decent month for the auto sector where everybody is trying to figure out whether October is the beginning of the auto revival or whether it is a flash in the pan. What we have started to do in some of our client’s portfolio is, selectively buy one of the two-wheeler companies. I am not at liberty to disclose the name but we are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios not because we expect the two-wheeler revival to have begun a month ago and from now on it will grow, but given the quality of the franchise, the high ROCs, high cash generation the sheer quality of the corporate governance, we felt that the two-wheeler company was just too deliciously cheap to be ignored. 

We will see if the two-wheeler company carries on showing us that even with low volume growth they can hold up their business, you might buy some more. I am not so sure cars and trucks are going to recover quite as quickly as two-wheelers. I think two-wheelers are likely to recover quicker than cars and trucks because their ticket sizes or purchase are smaller. But this is probably the biggest sector if one wanted to play a potential economic recovery. More than cement, steel or real estate, two-wheelers and the auto would be the industry to look at. There are several good auto ancillaries which are absolutely smashed in terms of valuation. Again, these are cash generative companies with strong balance sheets. So, auto, auto ancillaries would be my favourite play on economic recovery as and when we get visibility on that."
9,2018-11-21,Asian Paints,"One-off deferred tax gain supported bottom lines for much of India Inc during the September quarter. But that should not take away credit from those which managed to grow bottom lines on the strength of top line expansion.

September quarter earnings season broadly turned out to be better than expected, which took BSE benchmark Sensex to its record high mark. Sensex scaled a fresh all-time high of 40,676 amid the ongoing earnings season.

This was one of the better earnings seasons anytime in last three or four years, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Adviser.

“A number of companies have beaten Street expectations. I am evening out the earnings growth because of the tax adjustments which a lot of companies have done because we had the tax cuts in the middle of the quarter. A lot of companies adjusted that in the second quarter,” he said.

For instance, despite a drop in top line, Tata Steel reported a 6 per cent increase in consolidated net for the quarter at Rs 3,302 crore, thanks to the new tax regime.

JSW Steel posted 22 per cent rise in consolidated net profit, mainly due to a writeback of deferred taxes and accrued incentives from previous years. But the company’s revenue from operations actually declined 18.5 per cent to Rs 17,572 crore from Rs 21,552 crore a year ago.

But Mavani also points out that going by pre-tax profit or Ebitda number, a large number of companies also managed to grow on their own, actually showing margin expansions that beat Street expectations.

Data available with Ace Equity on November 6 showed 71 firms listed on BSE as largecap, midcap or smallcap reported over 100 per cent rise in net profit in Q2.

Even some of them like Dr Reddy’s Lab reported over 100 per cent expansion in net profit despite a 25 per cent rise in Q2 revenue. Others like SBI reported manifold rise in bottom line due to a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

SBI posted nearly six-fold rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter, supported by a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

Bottomline of the public sector lender grew 485 per cent to Rs 3,375 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 576 crore in the same period last year. Gujarat Gas, GSK Pharma, Indian Bank, Jindal Saw, NIIT, JK Tyre, Deepak Nitrite, Motilal Oswal Finanical Services, Bank of Maharasthtra and Avani Feeds were among other major players that reported over 100 per cent profit growth in Q2.



Besides one-time tax gains, other income, improving asset quality and corporate-related actions supported bottom lines of select companies during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services reported 3,297 per cent profit growth at Rs 142.3 crore in September quarter against a Rs 4.5 crore in the year-ago period, while Indian Bank reported Rs 359 crore profit on increasing income and improving asset quality by controlling loan slippages and other factors, a top bank official said.

A sharp drop in provisions for loan writeoffs in the home finance arm during the quarter supported the bottom line of the Mumbai-based firm. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said a strong momentum was seen in the market is due to healthy Q2 earnings from big corporates. “This positivity is likely to stay in the short to medium term as concerns of the market are fading with tax cut,” he said.

Out of top 71, five players reported over 100 per cent sales growth, 25 others posted 10 to 70 per cent increase sales. Others reported up to 10 per cent rise or fall in net sales during the quarter.

Some 73 firms from across sectors such as consumer food, TV broadcasting, banking, NBFC, plastic products, power generation and engineering, among others, reported 50 to 100 per cent bottom line expansion.

The list included players like Multi Commodity Exchange, Bandhan Bank, SRF, GTPL Hathaway, Kukuyo Camlin, Varun Beverages, EIH, Petronet LNG, PSP Projects, Torrent Power, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, UltraTech Cement and Aarti Drugs.



“Corporate earnings have been subdued or below expectations over the past few years. However, we are starting to see a revival in corporate earnings growth, and expect it to pick up pace from H2FY20. This will help to drive the markets going forward,” said Sampath Reddy, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.

He said the recent corporate tax cut would provide a boost to corporate earnings over time. “We believe a bottom-up research-oriented process, coupled with growth at reasonable price (GARP) approach will help deliver superior returns over the long term,” he said."
10,2018-11-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Extending losses for the second straight session, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty slipped on Friday dragged mainly by IT and telecom stocks as investors exercised caution and avoided long positions amid mixed global cues.

Analyst said that fall in IT stocks amid reports of changes in US work visa requirements aimed at protecting American workers fuelled the overall weakness in the market. Also, concerns over delay in US –China trade deal and Fed minutes fueled negativity in global markets.

Analysts said that market participants are waiting for fresh triggers on developments around the US-China trade deal and India’s July-September GDP data due next week. The GDP data which is due on 29 November is likely to indicate whether the slowdown in the Indian economy has deepened. Analysts expect markets to remain rangebound in coming days and feel midcap stocks may see more traction.

Meanwhile, NTPC was among the top gainers on BSE gaining nearly 4 per cent in trade after Morgan Stanley upgraded the power major to ‘Overweight’ from ‘Equal-Weight’ with a target price of Rs 152.

Global markets
On the global front, Asian shares made a slight recovery on Friday after hitting three-week lows on the previous day, with gains limited by investors' uncertainty over chances of US-China striking a preliminary deal soon to end their trade war.

European stocks too opened on a positive note in morning trade after a bout of selling this week on US-China trade deal worries."
11,2018-11-24,Asian Paints,"Benchmark equity indices settled the week flat on US-China trade concerns, premium valuations and lack of fresh triggers after the Q2 results season. The 30-share BSE Sensex added just 2.71 points to end at 40,359 for the week ended November 22. The 50-share Nifty gained 19 points to 11,914.

Here are the top stocks and sectors that created all the buzz during the week gone by.

Top gainers of the week
As many as 22 stocks in the BSE500 index delivered over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week. They included Vodafone Idea (up 78 per cent), UCO Bank (43 per cent), Tejas Networks (38 per cent), Corporation Bank (27 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (24 per cent). Aditya Birla Capital, ITD Cementation, DishTV, IRB Infra, eClerx Services and Coffee Day Enterprises advanced between 15 and 25 per cent.


Top losers of the week

Gayatri Projects lost 36 per cent, followed by Reliance Capital (23 per cent), Reliance Infra (22 per cent), Indiabulls Integrated Services (18 per cent) and Time Technoplast (15 per cent). Caplin Point, Reliance Power and Jain Irrigation were among other stocks that fell over 10 per cent.


IPO update: CSB Bank sails on Day 1
Kerala-based CSB Bank’s IPO got fully subscribed on the first day of bidding on Friday. The initial public offering (IPO) received bids for 1,20,87,450 shares against the total issue size of 1,15,54,987 shares, reflecting 1.05 times subscription, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange. The quota reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed 10 per cent, while that for retail investors was subscribed 5.60 times.
In another development from the IPO-mart, realty firm Puranik Builders has filed fresh papers with markets regulator Sebi to raise an estimated Rs 1,000 crore through its initial share-sale.


Telecom stocks ring louder
With a 7.85 per cent rally, the BSE Telecom index emerged the biggest gainer on the exchange. It was followed by Healthcare (up 3.06 per cent), Power (up 0.97 per cent), Metal (up 0.82 per cent) and Bankex (up 0.16 per cent). On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”


Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.
Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team. However, on the other side it added that net cash in the balance sheet fell to Rs 1,480 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 3,240 crore in Q4FY18.


Other Nifty’s top gainers/ losers
With a gain of nearly 9 per cent, Sun Pharma emerged second biggest gainer in the Nifty pack for the week. Bharti Airtel (up 7 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 6.82 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 6 per cent) were among other major gainers in the 50-share pack.

RIL nears Rs 10 lakh cr valuation
The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark helped by the continuous rise in its share price. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike. With a market value of Rs 9.80 lakh crore, share of the company signed off the week with gains of over 5 per cent at Rs 1,546."

3,2018-12-05,Asian Paints,"At the first sign of upturn, the IPO guys would be coming in, the PE guys would want an exit and that is the time where you 
  
  
  can get some good companies, Basant Maheshwari, Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Is this a good market where you should get greedy or should one not get greedy and accept that volatility is back?
The market right now is one where you have to protect your skin. We have seen a lot of issues over the last 45- 60 days and people who have survived that should actually be not on the back foot in that sense. But you cannot be adventurous in this kind of a market, especially with six months to go for the election. I am not saying that we are going back to October like situation and the worst is behind us but don’t expect the market to do any heroics or give us anything on a platter for the next four, five six months till the elections are there.


You believe the best and the worst of the market is behind us. I understand that the worst is behind given how crude markets have behaved but why the best, do you not believe that we are likely to see those previous highs again or for that matter even build on them further?
I think two things; first the best is contingent on who comes to power in May next year. I think the present government would be voted back but before that I do not see any magic happening. Globally our problem is when US does very well, nobody wants to invest in India and when US does not do well, we say oh, there is a global slowdown. So we have to actually pray to God that the US does only so well and not very well or not very badly. It is quite a complicated thing. 



On the side note, you should invite Donald Trump to one of your show. He is the best guy to tell you about the best and the worst. He handles the entire global market capitalisation through the Twitter account. It has become so difficult for anybody to take a guess as to what is going to happen. But on a serious note, good companies, the fundamentally strong ones growing at 25-30% will do well but there is only a handful of them. There are just 15-30 such companies in India and they are not cheap. Except for that, it is going to be tough.


With the risk of elections coming in 2019, how should one prepare their portfolio for the volatility that may come by? 
The market is already preparing for that. A stock like Hindustan Unilever goes and hits an all time high, consumer names are doing well; FMCG standard names are doing well; the private banks are again back in the vogue. 

The market is telling you that people want to invest but they want to be invested in areas where there is lesser risk of capital erosion. And because 80% of the money always remains in the stock market, it is the incremental 20% that creates a bull phase and a bear phase. It is that 80% which is now deciding to switch into stronger and more stable names. They are not the fancy ones where you can say this one is going to do well or grow at 40% or it looks cheap on a DCF basis but that’s about it. 

The writing on the wall right now looks to be consumer, FMCG, high pedigree expensive stocks, areas where you can after six months say okay I had put in 100 and at least I am still left with 95-97. That is the trend and the trend to create real magic is not now, not especially in the last year of the elections. There are so many things moving; the Fed suddenly says we will pause the rate hikes. RBI can provide one trigger if it cuts the CRR today. The crude is down, we are okay on dollar, the Fed has indicated that it might not be so aggressive in raising rates. So what stops the RBI from cutting down rates? The inflation is falling and we need not be so textbook oriented all the time! There is a time to think out of the box and that time is now.


You have a strong association with NBFCs. What are the NBFCs you still own and which are the ones you do not own? Historically you have owned HFCs and retail dominated NBFCs.
We own the top-notch NBFC in India and we have owned it for a long time now. That is still above the January level. Above the March level, that is down 15% from the top. We bought lots of it when the markets were cracking. Actually we own just two NBFCs and one of them is Bajaj Finance. It is not a recommendation but we own it till our neck and we think this is going to capture market share in the next three-four years. So, you can be bullish on NBFCs, you can be bullish on private banks but you do not have to own all the NBFCs. 

When a situation like this comes up, the leader gains market share because the raw material for the second line and the third line players would not be coming and the raw material for these guys is the cash that they borrow. Even if the raw material comes, the yield on that raw material would be 10%, 9.8%, 10.2%. Obviously, the economics would not work in their favour. We are fine with what we own in the NBFC space.


We are still debating about the real estate recovery. HFCs are clearly not finding favour. Anything that has to do with housing is going through a slump.
We still own PNB Housing.. We have not quite added on to it but we still own it. We have owned it right from the IPO time. It went up and came down like stone but we still have it. It t is going to get sold and that is the bigger overhang. The overhang is about the HFC space being muddled in all that but the bigger overhang is about the stake sale. 

I hope it happens sooner rather than later. Once that happens, things should be fine. That is the hope at least.


The HUL deal has really got you. You believe that real benefits will come over the next two to three years. You are very bullish on HUL at Rs 1,700.
No. I am bullish on HUL as a company. It should do well as a stock if you want to take a punt. It has just hit an all-time high. You could make some money if you are a trader out there but if you are an investor, you better buy a company that sells the products of an HUL, which is a retailing groceries chain. That’s how we play it. 


You have bought quality between 2010 and 2018. It has seen an extraordinary run up. Do you think some of the expensive, good quality companies could enter into a long process of time-wise correction in the next two-three years and companies like D-Mart, Page, Asian Paints or Bajaj Finance just remain flat? 
Yes, they would but for that the growth has to really plummet. If a 30% growth company goes at 25%, the stock price does not come down because at the same time, the 15% guy is now growing at 10%. It is always a relative game. If you think that these companies would grow at a lower pace and these are the only companies that are going to be impacted by growth, then obviously the stock price will go into a sideways mode depending on whether the company is cash flow positive or cash flow negative. 

Everybody gives the grand example of Hindustan Lever not doing anything for 10 years from 2001 to 2011-12. During that period, the stock price held itself because the company used to deploy its free cash flow, it dividend payment and the dividend actually held the stock. But then we also have to understand that during those 10 years, Hindustan Lever found it very difficult to even grow at 10% CAGR. So obviously when the growth comes down, we will be the first one to jump off the ship. But then you own a stock only for what it does to you. Of course, the stock does not know that you own it but yes if it does not do well, you want to jump off the ship and move on somewhere else.


That growth is getting recalibrated. Look at Page Industries, Eicher Motors. Growth seems to be contracting and the stocks plummeting, In a matter of six-seven months stock ki hawa nikal gai?
That is true but who tells anybody to go and buy Page at Rs 36,000? There was a lot of time to buy Page. We bought Page in 2009. We sold out in 2015. I made 40x there. We bought it for Rs 350 and sold it at Rs 14,000. From 14,000, it went to 36,000 and now it is back to 25,000. I would not buy it even at Rs 20,000 or Rs 18,000 or Rs 40,000. It does not fit my criteria of buying a company which is growing at least 20%. Page initially was growing at 35%. Then it came down to 30%, then to 25,000, 22,000 and now it has come down to 12,000.

Look at HDFC Bank. Initially it was growing at 35%. From 35% it came to 30%, 30% came to 25-26%, 25-26% came to 22% and now it is at 18%. No recommendations. So growth for these kind of companies do not collapse from 40% to 10%. That happens within infra stocks because you do not get an order, because the Bharatmala is under threat, because something else has happened. 

In a capex driven company, growth can suddenly plummet from 40% to 10% or even minus 5%. It can also happen to a pharma company which is dependent on certain generics or certain molecules or whatever. But in a stable business, growth normally slips, it never plummets. 

As long as growth slips, you will have enough time to come out. I am not saying that most of the companies that we own are going to grow at this rate for the next five years, but the moment we see that the growth has started to slip, we will come out of it and buy something better maybe.


I know given how uncertain the next six months are going to be most of the primary market issuances have been delayed. But anything from the upcoming primary market issuances that you are particularly looking out for?
No, nothing right now. But Apollo Pharmacy should be looked at. It is a stable business, selling medicines and I think they are going to hive it off and come with an IPO. You want companies like that which are scalable. It is in extension of the retailing play, but it all depends on the price at which it comes out, the kind of growth they do.

When the markets are down, nobody comes with an IPO. But the real money is made buying IPOs if you can get a good one. So at the first sign of upturn, the IPO guys would be coming in, the PE guys would want an exit and that is the time where you can get some good companies. We will see when it comes."
2,2018-12-05,Asian Paints,"There is needless angst in India about EPS growth staying weak even as the economy grows at 7 per cent. Such a phenomenon is actually a good thing for the Indian economy – it highlights a shift to a more competitive, pro-consumer paradigm which sets the stage for efficiency improvements in the economy.


A decade of weak EPS growth and strong GDP growth The November 12, 2018 article on a leading business daily said over the past decade the annual earnings growth of listed Indian companies has been a mere 4.1% whilst nominal GDP growth has been around 12.9% over this period. The Business Standard report alongside a similar article from a foreign brokerage prompted plenty of hand wringing about what has gone wrong in India.


Competitive Advantage 101 can explain what is going on Using a relatively simple model of competition, it is possible to understand what has happened in India. In a competitive economy only two types of firms are able to generate healthy profits (defined as ROCE in excess of cost of capital):

1. Companies who have sustainable competitive advantages either on the demand side (i.e. they have access to market demand – thanks to product differentiation or branding or customers’ switching cost - that their competitors cannot match) and/or on the supply side (i.e. cost advantages that allow a company to produce and deliver its products or services more cheaply than its competitors). These cost advantages could be due to proprietary technology or due to privileged access to raw materials or due to experience or some combination of these. [Source: “Competition Demystified” by Bruce Greenwald and Judd Kahn] Sustainable competitive advantages of this sort are evident in India in sectors FMCG, Banking, Pharma and light electrical manufacturing.

2. Companies who do not have sustainable competitive advantages but have made themselves highly efficient by squeezing costs relentlessly over a long period of time. You can see this paradigm at work in India in sectors like Cement and Steel where there is very little to distinguish one company’s product from the next.

It follows therefore that if a firm does not fall into either of these buckets, it is in trouble. Examples abound in India eg. Idea in Telco, Jet Airways in airlines, several NBFCs, several private sector banks who don’t have CASA franchises, lots of construction companies, several cement companies, etc.

Until a decade ago these weaker players would keep chugging along due to: (a) soft loans from PSU banks; and (b) implicit gentlemen’s agreements in their sector which would put a floor on prices and therefore on profits. Whilst this would keep the weaker players alive, the Indian consumer/taxpayer was worse off as she would pay higher prices/taxes (which effectively were subsidies to keep the inefficient players alive).

For reasons which we don’t fully understand, this paradigm was disrupted around a decade ago and we entered a more competitive era in Indian business wherein weaker firms were either bankrupted or forced to sell out. What we have seen over the past decade is not just weak EPS growth but also a steady decline in the Nifty’s pre-tax ROCE (from 20.5% a decade ago to around 15.5% now). This has happened alongside better products and more competitive pricing for the consumer who has flocked to buy these products thus boosting consumption growth even as capex growth stays muted. The most vivid illustrations of these are:

· The domestic airline sector where the planes are full, the airports are heaving but no airline makes any money due to intense competition.

· The domestic taxi market where the streets are full of Ubers and Olas and consumers are getting a good deal but neither Uber nor Ola nor their taxi drivers make money (defined, again, as ROCE > WACC).

Thanks to greater competition, we have transferred the profits of weaker companies into the pockets of the consumers (primarily, middle class consumers; workers at the bottom of the pyramid face a challenge which is discussed further on in this piece).


Other than consumer, who are the winners in this uber-competitive paradigm?
1. As EPS growth becomes a permanent challenge in a more competitive economy, efficient firms who have built strong moats will continue to trade at high premiums to their peers. We continue to believe that firms who consistently generate double digit revenue growth whilst delivering ROCE>WACC will continue to be attractive stocks to buy and hold.

2. Well managed moated sector leaders like Dr Lal Path Labs and Asian Paints realise that if they hike prices, whilst their profits grow faster, life also becomes easier for their less able rivals. Hence price hikes from market leading companies has become increasingly rare. Similarly, in banking the leading private sector banks are not increasing their lending rates materially even though the cost of 3-month money market paper is up almost 200bps this year. These banks realise that by not hiking their lending rates, they can squeeze the less able lenders out of the game. As this dynamic becomes widespread in India, it becomes easier for the RBI to control CPI inflation and give a positive real rate of return on bank fixed deposits. That in turn should encourage the ongoing “financialisation” of the economy.

3. With economic growth being faster than growth in corporate profits, the funding for growth initiatives has to – by definition – come from bank loans, private equity and from the capital markets [for the overwhelming majority of companies, retained profits won’t be sufficient to fund capex]. This dynamic should interplay with the previous bullet and bring to the stock and bond market a broader range of Indian companies.

4. As weaker companies are driven into the NCLT process, stronger, more efficient rivals will be able to acquire their capacities at attractive valuations. This will (and is producing) a concentration of economic power hitherto unseen in India. Whilst many fear that this would ultimately lead to an oligarchy wherein politicians and promoters collude to screw the consumer, as yet there is no evidence of the same largely because any attempt to gouge the consumer is likely to trigger new entry.

All of this being said, there are three big negatives associated with the new paradigm of competition in India:

a) As firms seek efficiency, in almost every industry one is seeing a replacement of people with machines/automation. For example, Maruti’s EPS growth has risen by 15% per annum over the past decade but its headcount has only risen by 10%. HDFC Bank’s EPS growth has risen by 23% per annum over the past decade but its headcount has only risen by 9%. For Indians – blue or white collar- who don’t have jobs, this development spells trouble.

b) Less able firms – many of who are SMEs – are being squeezed relentlessly in a more competitive economy. Increasingly, their response is to either shut shop or to sell out to more efficient rivals who then get rid of the labour and hold on to the revenues.

c) Indian stocks have seen an EPIC re-rating over the past decade as market cap has compounded at 15% whilst EPS has grown at only 4%. During this period, the cost of capital was falling globally courtesy QE. Now that the US 10-year bond yield has doubled from 1.6% in September 2016 (a 50-year low), the P/E multiple of the Indian stockmarket looks increasingly unsustainable.

1,2018-12-05,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Weak global sentiment, caution ahead of RBI policy decision and rupee's fall weighed on domestic equity market, dragging the benchmark Sensex over 200 points lower in opening trade.

Caution crept in the market ahead of RBI rate decision which morphed into bearish mood owing to weakness in Asian peers. 

Asian stocks came under pressure, tracking a fall in the US equities as a flattening US Treasury yield curve stoked investor worries about global economic growth. 

Besides, doubts over the ability of the US and China to find a substantial solution of trade dispute during the temporary cease-fire period agreed at the G20 summit kept investors on edge.

However, as per media reports, the US President on Tuesday talked about the possibility of an extension of the 90-day trade truce with Beijing but said tariffs may be reverted if the two sides could not resolve their differences. 

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was 207 points, or 0.57 per cent, down at 35,927, while the NSE Nifty50 index was 63 points, or 0.58 per cent, down at 10,807.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell in line with the benchmark Sensex and were trading 0.45 per cent and 0.50 per cent down, respectively, at that time.

Out of total 31 stocks in the Sensex index, 26 were incurring losses and only five - ONGC (up 0.72 per cent), NTPC (up 0.56 per cent), Adani Ports (up 0.40 per cent), Asian Paints (up 0.32 per cent) and State Bank of India (up 0.07 per cent) - were trading in the green zone. 

Tata Motors fell 2 per cent, leading the pack of Sensex losers in the early trade. It was followed by IndusInd Bank, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra and ITC.

Shares of Tata Motors slipped after rating agency S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit rating of the company and its British arm Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc.

Barring oil & gas, all sectoral indices were in the red on BSE. Gains in Indian Oil Corporation, ONGC, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL and Oil India were keeping the sectoral index up.

Shares of oil marketing firms climbed amid weakness in global crude oil prices as swelling US inventories and a plunge in global stocks dragged oil prices down."
4,2018-12-06,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: Indian advertising veteran Piyush Pandey will be the new worldwide chief creative officer of the Ogilvy Group, one of the world’s oldest and largest advertising companies, effective January 1, 2019. He is also the first Indian to assume the role of worldwide creative director.

Pandey, who is currently the executive chairman and creative director for Ogilvy South Asia, is one of Indian advertising’s most famous faces globally. Speaking exclusively to ET, Pandey said his new role “is a responsibility and not a medal. There are things to do and I will be getting on with the job. I have been given a fantastic team — internationally — to work with. I will try my best to help achieve the Next Chapter for Ogilvy.”

When asked what it was that tipped the balance in his favour he said “Only John Seifert can answer that question.” Ogilvy’s chief executive officer John Seifert said in a statement, “Piyush is a true industry icon who is uniquely suited to lead our global creative efforts. Creativity has and will always be at the heart of the Ogilvy brand and culture. Piyush is the perfect leader to shepherd that legacy as we continue to focus on making brands matter as the leading creative network in the world.”




2018 has been a year of many firsts for Pandey. He became the first Asian along with his brother Prasoon Pandey (film director) to be honoured with the prestigious Lion of St. Mark award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In the audience was the full Pandey clan and many clients who travelled to the glitzy French Riviera town solely to support and celebrate with Pandey.

Under Pandey’s charge, Ogilvy India also won the country’s first Grand Prix in the Creative Effectiveness category this year, for the Savlon Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks campaign. But he began his winning spree at Cannes back in 2002 with two Gold Lions for the famous antismoking campaign that featured a Marlboro Man lookalike with a dead horse. Pandey has had an illustrious career in advertising that began over 35 years ago. Ogilvy is the only company he has worked for, after a stint working in the teagardens in Eastern India.

In an earlier interview, when Brand Equity asked about his talent for producing creative campaigns that have “worked” for brands, Pandey said, “I have always told my people that we are not artistes, we are commercial artistes. We have been commissioned by somebody to improve his commerce.” He is also credited with giving the country’s advertising its distinctive Indian roots and feel, after a long era of mainly Western and English influenced work. A proud “Jaipur boy”, he received the Padma Shri award, the fourth highest civilian award in India, in 2016.

Some of his most iconic work has been for brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Asian Paints, Fevicol, Rajasthan Tourism and Gujarat Tourism, among others. Perhaps the most memorable is the Cadbury dancing girl on a cricket pitch. His other iconic campaign was ‘Mile Sur Mera Tumhara’ (1988) for the National Literacy Mission. He has also worked on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaigns, including its 2014 election campaign.

A cricket-aficionado, any conversation with Pandey is peppered with cricket analogies. In fact, he credits his cricketing days for teaching him lessons on how to lead and how to be led. Both, he tells us, are equally important. These lessons will be put to good use as Pandey gears up to lead the WPP-owned agency’s over 100 offices globally."

8,2018-12-07,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Marking a turnaround in fortunes, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty staged an impressive comeback on Friday, led by banks, financials, FMCG and auto stocks.

The reversal of course came after three straight sessions of losses. 

Earlier on, sentiment got a leg-up on reports that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is looking to buy 10 per cent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

Crude oil prices lay low due to ambiguity over a cut in output by Opec. A stronger rupee had a big bearing, too. 

Asian and European markets were in a better shape after US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled that the three-year tightening cycle is coming to a close. IMF chief Christine Lagarde's comments that the US is not likely to see an economic contraction in the near term added to the buying momentum. 

However, there were worries that the US-China relation may turn into a sordid saga due to the arrest of a senior Huawei executive.

7,2018-12-07,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities got a shot in the arm on Friday, reversing their three-day losing streak, as strength in global markets, a strong rupee and depressed crude prices made the pitch conducive to go higher. 

A surge in Kotak Bank shares on reports that Berkshire Hathaway was planning to pick up stake in the lender too lent a hand. The lender, however, in a BSE filing clarified that it was unaware of any such plans.

Healthy buying in banking, financial and auto stocks added to the rebound.

Investors went the distance after US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled that the three-year tightening cycle is coming to an end. IMF chief Christine Lagarde's remarks the US is not likely to see an economic contraction in the near term put more life in stocks.

In a session that was otherwise marked by high volatility, the Sensex and the Nifty logged significant gains in the last hour of trade.

The BSE Sensex ended higher by 361 points, or 1.02 per cent, at 35,673 while the NSE Nifty settled the day shy of the 10,700 at 10,694, up 93 points, or 0.87 per cent.

Kotak Mahindra Bank was the top Sensex gainer, up 8.53 per cent, after reports emerged that Warren Buffett led Berkshire Hathaway was looking to buy a 10 per cent stake in the company.

Adani Ports, Bajaj Auto, Infosys, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp were in pools of green on the Sensex.

Sun Pharma was the worst index performer, down 2.03 per cent. Coal India, YES Bank, NTPC, Tata Steel and Power Grid joined Sun on the losers' list.

Midcap and smallcap stocks underperformed the benchmark Sensex. BSE Midcap ended up 0.27 per cent while BSE Smallcap closed with a loss of 0.23 per cent.

Among BSE sectoral indices, utilities declined the most with 1.05 per cent, followed by oil & gas, telecom, metals and pharma.

On the BSE, the advance-decline ratio stood at 2:3, indicating that for every two stocks that gained, three fell. This suggests underlying bearishness in market.

On a net basis, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth of Rs 72.47 crore Thursday. However, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 389.78 crore, provisional BSE data showed.

Let's check out the market movers and shakers on Friday.


Strong gains in rupee
The domestic unit rebounded after posting significant losses in Thursday's session and gained nearly 45 paise against the US dollar, given a sharp decline in global crude oil prices. Weakness in the US currency supported the upmove in the rupee. The rupee was trading 70.65 against the greenback at the time of writing this story.


Crude oil prices ease
Oil prices fell on Friday as Opec discussed a potential exemption from cutting output for Iran and the producer club sought to get heavyweight supplier Russia on board, Reuters reported. 

International Brent crude oil futures fell below $60 per barrel, trading at $59.53 per barrel at 0750 GMT, down 53 cents, or 0.9 per cent from their last close. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.05 per barrel, down 44 cents, or 0.9 per cent.


Financials grab eyeballs

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.2 per cent. That followed a 1.8 per cent drubbing on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei added 0.8 per cent, Reuters reported.


Expert-take:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 

""Indian equity market had turned cautious during the week, profit booking was evident in anticipation of the final outcome of the state elections, a precursor of the general election. Domestic market rebounded today along with global market, which has lightened up, hoping for a resolution of US-China trade war. OPEC's decision to delay the final resolution to cut oil output caused prices to fall, boosting sentiment in India."""
9,2018-12-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Adani group of companies took a severe beating in the morning trade on Monday amid an across-the-board selloff.

12,2018-12-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity indices Sensex and Nifty took big blows on Monday on the eve of Assembly poll outcome on the assessment that the road for the ruling BJP in 2019 will be bumpy.

The results of elections of five Indian states are due on Tuesday. Exit poll results have already painted a picture of tough numbers for the BJP. 

A selloff in global stocks on growth worries and a flare-up of tension between the US and China made investors jittery. 

An upswing in crude oil prices after Opec and its allies agreed to cut production dragged the rupee lower, making the situation even worse. 

The Sensex crashed 714 points, or 2 per cent, to end at 34,959.72, with only Coal India (0.76 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki (0.49 per cent) holding up.

Nifty has started forming lower top lower bottom on the daily chart, which confirms the downtrend. The weekly chart shows that the index is tumbling down as a follow through of a Dark cloud cover formation in the last week. All these observations suggest that the bears are having an upper hand on the index. In terms of the Fibonacci retracement, the Nifty has so far retraced 50 per cent of the November bounce. Subsequent level on the downside will be the 61.8 per cent retracement mark i.e. 10,362. The larger picture shows that the Nifty is poised to test the recent low of 10,005,"" said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, senior technical analyst of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas."
11,2018-12-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Stocks got a sinking feeling on Monday as the possibility of the ruling BJP not measuring up to expectations in the just-concluded state elections, the results of which are due tomorrow, did not sit well with investors. 

A global selloff compounded worries on Dalal Street. 

A jump in crude prices post Opec's decision to slash oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day and a fall in the rupee to its weakest since November 20 were other headaches.

In percentage terms, the BSE benchmark Sensex crashed 2 per cent, ending at 34,959.72, down 714 points. The NSE Nifty ended at 10,488.45, down 205 points, or 1.92 per cent. 

Selling heat was so much that only Coal India and Maruti managed to settle with marginal gains in the Sensex kitty of stocks. Kotak Mahindra Bank, down 6.56 per cent, was the worst hit.

Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank slipped after the private lender upped the ante on the promoter shareholding issue as it moved the Bombay High Court seeking legal relief on Monday. 

Other stocks that joined Kotak Bank in the losers' list were Reliance Industries (down 3.95 per cent), Asian Paints (down 3.48 per cent), Tata Motors (down 3.45 per cent), Adani Ports (down 3.41 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 3.16 per cent).

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were as badly hit as the Sensex, declining 1.84 per cent each.


Top market drags for today:


Exit poll volatility
Exit poll results didn't augur too well for the BJP, as was expected. ""Unfavourable exit poll results for the ruling party has impacted the sentiment of the market today and this dullness will continue as tomorrow’s final outcome confirms their losing strength,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said. 

Investors are eyeing the polls in five states - Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Mizoram -- to look for clues as to how the BJP would fare in the general elections due next year.


Global stocks in pain
Globally, losses on global stocks snowballed on Monday, with European markets following Asian peers lower as fresh signs emerged of slowing growth worldwide and fears grew that simmering US-China tensions would derail chances of a trade deal. MSCI's index of Asian equities outside Japan slid 1.5 per cent to a near three-week low, Shanghai shares retreated 0.6 per cent, Reuters reported.


Oil prices tick up
Brent crude oil futures rose on Monday after producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated suppliers last Friday agreed to a supply cut from January. Despite this, the price outlook for next year remains muted on the back of an economic slowdown, according to Reuters. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.03 per barrel at 0748 GMT, up 36 cents, or 0.6 per cent, from their last close.


Rupee hits 3-week low
The rupee slipped to 71.45 against the dollar, its weakest since November 20. It did recover to 71.23 in intraday trade but was still 43 paise down against the previous close of 70.80."

17,2018-12-11,Asian Paints,"The BSE Sensex Next 50 on Tuesday stood up to severe selling pressure in broader markets because of sudden resignation by RBI Governor Urjit Patel. 

The index rose 0.16 per cent to 30,828.73 at around 10.25 am while the benchmark Sensex cracked 0.81 per cent to 34,677.83.

As many as 26 stocks of the group were in the green, with PFC rallying 3.20 per cent, followed by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (2.78 per cent) and Marico (2.53 per cent). 

LIC Housing Finance, Piramal Enterprises, Bosch and Punjab National Bank climbed up to 2.50 per cent.

18,2018-12-11,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian stocks made a sharp pullback on Tuesday as the election results did not turn out to be as unfavourable as expected for the ruling BJP.

But the sudden exit of Urjit Patel as RBI Governor did create a sense of anxiety among market participants. 

In a session marked by high volatility, the Sensex settled up 190 points, or 0.54 per cent, at 35,150.01. The Nifty50 ended the day at 10,549, up 60.70 points, or 0.58 per cent.

After posting over 500-point loss in the opening trade, triggered by Patel's unexpected resignation, the Sensex recouped losses as the election outcome started to trickle in. A better-than-expected performance by the ruling BJP, against the ominous exit poll predictions, buoyed mood. 

Besides, some short-covering contributed to the gains.

“A major short-term unknown, the assembly elections, is over. The market may see a reaction but the possibility of a crash looks feeble,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder and MD of Equinomics Research & Advisory. 

In the Sensex kitty of stocks, barring 10, other constituents ended with gains with YES Bank leading. The private lender jumped 8.50 per cent to Rs 179.40. It was followed by Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank that gained up to 6 per cent. 

HDFC Bank tanked to its two-week low today, the worst performer, which was followed by Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp, Adani Ports, ICICI Bank among others.

Barring telecom and oil and gas, all sectors ended higher on the BSE. The Consumer Durables index led the charge, with Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, Goods and Services, FMCG, Basic Materials and IT in tow.

Midcap and smallcap shares trumped the Sensex in terms of gains and closed 1.54 per cent up each.



Take a look at the factors that moved market today.


State election outcome
The domestic markets had already discounted the state election results on Monday. Moreover, the BJP though lost elections in key states, the number of seats lost was lesser than what most exit polls had predicted. 

""Despite all the negative news bunching up together from RBI Governor resignation to election results, we have seen market nicely holding back that probably reflects the fundamentals of the Indian economy and Indian market. If with all this bad news market is not breaking but recovering, that should give some confidence to optimist and bulls that bear market is not yet ready to begin in India,"" said Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC in an interview to ET NOW.


Short covering in markets
Some short covering was witnessed during the day that led to the recovery in markets in intraday trade.

There could have been traders who have taken position based on exit polls or what they think the results are likely to be and sort of sometimes shorts take positions ahead of the event and they tend to cover it up when the actual event happens. So one day event is just a reflection of what is happening technically in the market, said Nilesh Shetty, Quantum Mutual Fund in an interaction with ET NOW.


Recovery in rupee
The rupee recovered nearly 76 paise in intraday trade to 71.68 after plunging to four-week low in opening trade. The domestic currency was trading at 71.83 against the greenback at the time of writing this report. 


Oil under pressure
Oil prices were under pressure on Tuesday amid worries over global stock markets and doubts that planned output cuts led by producer club OPEC will be enough to rein in oversupply. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60 per barrel at 0746 GMT, up 3 cents from their last close.


Expert-take

Subdued sentiment due to RBI governors resignation and overhang of state election results prevailed at market opening even though US markets staged a smart recovery from intra day lows. The negative trend was short lived as markets had already discounted the state election results yesterday and short covering was witnessed during the day leading to markets turning positive. Among sectors, pharma and PSU banks saw a smart recovery. - Viral Berawala, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund"
19,2018-12-11,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The stock market on Tuesday belied all fears and ended with a smile as state election results gave the ruling BJP the much-needed breather.

Early on, selling picked up as RBI Governor's resignation created a flutter and a sense of disquiet.

Global cues improved after reports that the US and China discussed a road map for the next round of trade talks.

All sectors were in the midst of a selloff, with the benchmark Sensex plunging over 500 points. But it recouped all the losses in the second half by settling up 190 points, or 0.54 per cent, at 35,150. The Nifty shut shop with a gain of 61 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 10,549.

Midcaps and smallcap beat the Sensex, with gains of 1.54 per cent each.


We run you through the highlights of today's session:


Rs 1.50 lakh crore addedTuesday's gains meant over Rs 1.50 lakh crore were added cumulatively to the valuation of BSE listed firms. Total market capitalisation of BSE companies jumped to Rs 1,39,43,347.55 crore, from Rs 1,37,92,970.08 crore on Monday.


Sensex movers & shakersYES Bank, with a gain of 7.29 per cent, led the pack of Sensex gainers. It was followed by Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, State Bank of India, Axis Bank and ITC. On the flip side, Hero MotoCorp, falling by 1.58 per cent, finished the day as the top loser. Bharti Airtel, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Adani Ports were among the top losers of the Sensex. Out of 31 stocks (including Tata Motors DVR) on the index, 20 ended with gains and 11 suffered losses.


Oil & gas lone sectoral loserBSE Oil & Gas was the only sector in the red, with a loss of 0.21 per cent, because of losses in HPCL, Indian Oil Corporation and BPCL. Gains in ONGC, Reliance Industries, Castrol India and GAIL capped the fall of the index.


Consumer durables shinesThe BSE Consumer Durables index jumped 2.60 per cent, which saw Rajesh Exports fall 0.03 per cent. Symphony, TTK Prestige, VIP Industries, Voltas and Titan Company emerged as the top winners, in that order.


Kotak Bank, Bosch above 200-DMANIIT Technologies, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bosch, Power Finance Corporation, Biocon, Mawana Sugars, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and HeidelbergCement India featured among stocks that witnessed positive breakouts and traded above their 200-DMAs. However, Mahamaya Steel, NRB Industrial, JB Chemicals and Bedmutha Industries industries appeared in the list of stocks that traded below their 200-DMAs.


Potential upside for 76 stocksMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 76 counters, including YES Bank, Biocon, Glenmark Pharma, NIIT Technologies, TVS Motor, PVR, Bosch and Creative Casting, on the BSE. However, HDFC Bank, BPCL, IL&FS Investment Managers and Simplex Infrastructures, featured among the 66 stocks that showed bearish crossovers.


Overbought & oversold stocksMomentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 58 stocks in the oversold zone on BSE. Among the stocks that remained in the oversold zone were IL&FS Transportation, Natco Economicals, Alchemist, Rama Paper Mills, Punj Lloyd and Arvind.

Nifty makes Strong Bullish candleThe bulls made a strong comeback in the second half as the Nifty formed a Strong Bullish candle on the daily chart. But to maintain the bullish trend, the NSE barometer needs to sustain above 10,333, say analysts. ""To retain the bullish bias, the Nifty50 needs to sustain above 10,333 and a breach of this shall resume the downswing with initial targets of 10,191,” said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.


264 stocks hit 52-week lows
As many as 264 stocks hit 52-week lows on the BSE.

On the other hand, 19 stocks, including Generic Pharmasec, Gujarat Poly Electronics, A Infrastructure and Virgo Global, hit 52-week highs."
21,2018-12-12,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty registered a positive opening on Wednesday, thus extending the rally to the second consecutive session.

Market appeared to have emerged from the volatility that engulfed it on Monday and prevailed till the first half of Tuesday's session owing to assembly poll jitters and Urjit Patel's resignation.

Headline indices, however, settled with gains on Tuesday and extended the upward swing on Wednesday as buying emerged in most sectors after the ex-finance ministry official Shaktikanta Das took charge of the Reserve Bank of India and assembly poll results gave a clear picture that Congress had taken control of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and staked claim to form the government in Madhya Pradesh.

Positive news about US-China trade deal also infused optimism in the market. 

In an interview with Reuters, the US President Donald Trump said talks were taking place with Beijing by phone and he would not raise tariffs on Chinese imports until he was sure about a deal.

As per Reuters, he also said he would intervene in the Justice Department's case against a top executive at China's Huawei Technologies if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal. 

Following the development, Asian stocks climbed higher. 

The equity barometer Sensex jumped over 200 points in early deals and Nifty crossed 10,600. 

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was 210 points, or 0.60 per cent, up at 35,359, while the Nifty was 59 points, or 0.56 per cent, up at 10,608.

India’s macros have eased off since Oct’18, with crude oil prices cooling off and currency along with bond yields rallying from their recent lows. With the state elections overhang now behind, we expect the focus to revert to fundamentals. We continue expecting elevated volatility going into CY19, Motilal Oswal said in a note. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices climbed up to 1 per cent in morning trade.

Barring Coal India, Asian Paints, NTPC and Infosys, all components of the Sensex index were trading with gains. 

Shares of YES Bank jumped over 4 per cent, leading the pack of Sensex gainers at that time. It was followed by Hero MotoCorp, Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki.

All sectoral indices on BSE were in the positive territory at that time, with realty, auto, telecom and metal gaining the most."
20,2018-12-12,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: Shares ended firm on Tuesday after a roller-coaster, over-500-point swing, as investors felt the ruling BJP’s losses in key state elections were not as bad as feared. Bank stocks rose sharply as the unexpected resignation of Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel spurred hopes that the central bank, under a new leadership, would relax some of the stringent regulations and rules governing lenders.

Shares dropped more than 2 per cent in early trade when BJP was trailing Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, but recovered after the race in two of the three states became close and investors felt BJP had not been routed as feared. Congress just about crossed the majority mark in Rajasthan, swept Chhattisgarh and had an edge over BJP in Madhya Pradesh at the time of going to press.

“The market was panicking initially after the RBI governor’s resignation. It was also felt the election results could unleash havoc. But the market recovered as the results were not as bad as expected,” said A Balasubramanian, chief executive officer at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC.

The Nifty rose 60.70 points, or 0.6 per cent, to end at 10,549.15 while the Sensex gained 190.29 points, or 0.5 per cent, to close 35,150. The India volatility index (VIX) fell 11.5 per cent to 18.08 with all Nifty sectoral indices ending in the green.



At 2.5 per cent, the Nifty PSU index surged the most while the BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose 1.5 per cent each. Foreign portfolio investors dumped Indian shares worth Rs 2,421 crore on Tuesday — the biggest net sale by these entities in a month. Local funds net bought shares worth Rs 2,256 crore, according to provisional data.

Yes Bank ended up 7 per cent at Rs 177.40 and was the top gainer on the Sensex, followed by Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, State Bank of India, Axis Bank and ITC — which gained 2-6 per cent.

“The long-term view on India does not change as the macro fundamentals remain solid and the bullish secular themes are still intact,” said John Praveen, senior portfolio manager at QMA, a PGIM company.

Praveen said the RBI governor’s resignation does raise short-term concerns about whether the government will continue to undermine the central bank’s independence and credibility, and whether tensions between the two sides will impede monetary policy and the banking regulator’s ability to address the issue of bad loans.

Late on Tuesday night, former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das was appointed the governor of the Reserve Bank of India.

Markets are likely to trade with a negative bias in the coming weeks given the global headwinds after the higher-than expected production cut by Opec and the resurgence of US-China trade tensions after the arrest of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei’s CFO.

“The market had discounted the election results in the 600-point fall on Monday, so there was no further decline on Tuesday,” said Ravi Muthukrishnan, head of institutional research at Elara Securities. But he added that the markets are expected to be “volatile with a downward bias” in the short term."
22,2018-12-13,Asian Paints,"If some other government comes, it is not going to be the end of India because India is a responsible democracy. 
  
  But I desire, wish, hope that we have a BJP government, big bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprises, tells Nikunj Dalmia of ET Now at the India Economic Conclave in Mumbai on Thursday. Edited excerpts:

In the beginning of the year you had said said crazy PE multiples for midcaps not a good sign. What is your view on midcaps now? 
I can identify very small number of midcap companies which I can distinctly say dominate the businesses that they are in. I am quite sure now people had forgotten about 40 or 50 PE at 7-8% interest rates. And I still hold to my statement


You still feel the crushing fall that we have seen in midcaps in general. Selective stories are different but as a category, midcaps are slightly shaky and they are still expensive?
The midcaps have come off a lot, but they cannot have the kind of valuation that largecaps have for the simple reason that they do not carry the quality of businesses that the largecaps have or domination or the size or the cash flows. I think at some point in time, the market was too excited about midcaps, now that has mellowed.


You also spoke about the fact that this year is going to be a year of extra volatility. 2017 had spoilt us because we had not seen volatility but 2018 was a volatile year.Why is there so much of up and down in global liquidity markets and other asset classes this year?
Worldwide volatility has ruled the roost. I think a lot of volatility is because the actual exchange of the assets in relation to the trading is very few. Look at Yes Bank. Some 10 crores shares are traded today and actual shares which exchanged hands is 80 lakh. So obviously, when 80 lakh is increasing to price of 10 crore, at least temporarily, that leads to volatility. Also I think. it is because of nervousness, uncertainty and then when markets go down, stop losses are hit. So volatility is here to stay. 


'I would like Modi to be PM again'

 It is also that time in the cycle when we start worrying about elections and given what we have got in terms of state outcome election results, what is your view on the market? 
With uncertainty because it is very difficult to predict the election in 2019. BJP had a stellar win in 2003 and in 2004 June, they lost the national election. I personally feel the MP and Rajasthan outcomes are very good for the BJP because you have 15 years of incumbency. You have a real identical vote. In Rajasthan, you have a history of change of government every five years. The BJP has not lost as badly as the Congress lost in 2013.

They say that lots of presidents in America lose the congress but they still win, they get re-elected. It happened with Obama, it happened with Clinton. I would not take this election result to be the final guide to the 2019 result. I will still bet my money on a BJP government led by Mr Modi. Having said that, India is greater than personalities. I would very much like Mr Modi to become prime minister of this country again.

I am BJP supporter and I will remain one. But the question is if some other government comes, it is not going to be the end of India because India is a responsible democracy and we have had no single government in power, party in power in parliament for the last 24 years from 89 to 2014. So it is not that the world is going to fall if a non-BJP government comes in. But I desire, wish, hope is that we have a BJP government. 


You always mentioned over the years do not look at the news whether it is good or bad, try and figure out what is in the price, what are the markets betting on? In your assessment from the election outcome, what are the markets betting on?
Well markets have now forgotten the election. The election will again come into the markets in February-March and markets are betting on the fact that most people are taking the Indian economy wrongly. I look at it differently. 

We have had five years of sub-potential growth. You had five years of sub-capital expenditure. You have had a deep banking crisis. I think IL&FS was the peak of the banking crisis. I do not see any other institution that is now left to be recognised in any huge manner in the NPAs. Capital investment is reviving. Consumption demand is good. 

The Indian economy is ready to take off. With reduction in oil prices, the macro is very good. We have historical low inflation. We have a problem of plenty of food, not that there is no food. In 1966, we had to beg the US for wheat. Today we have so much wheat we do not know what to do with it. The prediction was that GST will lead to at least 1.5% extra GDP growth. Everybody is talking of the problems of GST. Nobody is talking of the benefits. 

The economy is surely on upward trajectory and that is what the markets are recognising. Two things her; first, the economies are in upward trajectory and second is there is loads of local money still waiting to come. Based on these two facts. I still remain bullish.


I would like to share the anecdote which Mr Jhunjhunwala shared with me in 2008 or 2009. He said “ Watch my boy! A tsunami of domestic flows will come to India.” I think we have seen that. The SIP flows what have come to India and the kind of domestic investor belief which is coming to India is unparalleled and for me that is rise with India.
It is nothing. The SIPs are a billion dollars a month at the moment. This will reach 2-3-4 billion dollars and remember the SIP investor is not coming to make equity returns. He is comparing it to public provident fund, to insurance and insurance. You are paying 40% commission for the first year and 15% later on.

If the person who is investing in SIPs, gets 12% to 15% compounded returns, he is going to be very happy. I do not think there will be much volatility in the SIP flows. The path is only upward. 98% of the money is made in the stock market is by being a bull not necessarily a big bull but being a bull.

I made one of the biggest fortunes in my life by short selling in 1992


So you have always been a bull ever since you joined stock markets?
No, I made lot of money by short selling. Harshad Mehta was a dream. I made one of the biggest fortune of my life by short selling in ‘92. In fact, I will tell you an incident. We started short selling from 4200. So BSE CEO Mr Mayya would call me and say you are short selling, I will take your badge. Again he called me at 3,500, at 3,000 and then he called me when the index was 2,200. I told him Mr Mayya, wouldn’t you have been happy if you had joined me, instead of firing me at every stage?


But did he call you after that at all?
Yes we have short sold so many times.


It is usually said that you can either be a good trader or you can be a successful investor. In your case you have been a greater trader and a successful investor. How do you manage both these aspects?
Well if you have a wife and a mistress and you manage both well, you can do both trading and investing well. And how do you manage that? You keep them apart. One should not know anything about the other. 

Investment is a fall or rise in valuable investment unless it is extreme or it is some event laden which has significance. The daily values have no significance to me at all. Trading is momentum. Trading is 
le fatafat, de fatafat. Maro aur bhago. (Trade and run). You have to follow the crowd in trading. In investing you can be a bit contrarian, still make a lot of money. Trading is my friend and trading the ROEs are highest. The cash flows are great. I love trading. Given a choice I would like to make all money out of trading. But that is not possible. You lose money also. I have lost money so many times.


You talk about wife and mistress. Now, in trading you have a stop loss. You can get out. In a marriage there is no stop loss.
There is a stop loss. See we will have to end the marriage to know there is a stop loss or no. So fortunately we do not have to go to that stop loss here.


Let us talk about the fact that you are positive on the economy. Now for any economy to grow, you need a vibrant credit market. You need lots of liquidity. Given that there is cash crunch, , do you think that the credit numbers could hurt the economic growth?
Utpal my partner was just telling me that now you have to be clean, you have to be straight and there is no lack of credit for worthy borrowers. So I do not think that credit crunch is going to be there. Temporarily maybe there was some credit crunch. May be it is there in December, but you are going to be able to get money from January. 

The only thing is because we are a nation with a current account deficit, we need foreign capital. So we have to watch that. I do not think this is matter of NBFCs and banks. 


In September when we spoke last you said after years I have become bullish on corporate banks and you said the NPA problems are behind us. Corporate banks have done reasonably well. Do you think the NPA problems is genuinely over for some of them, at least the good corporate banks?
The recognition is over for most of them or for all of them. The provisioning will depend on the individual banks. But there will not be any large recognition left now. All the possible gorillas in the room have already been locked. 



Nikunj Dalmia: But the way the NCLT and IBC cases are moving, some would argue that though the process, the approach and intent may be right, the end path is still not very clear.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: End path is good. You are auctioning the assets. You are getting the price. But I agree with the banks that you cannot club the auction of 25 power plants altogether and sell them at any price. Apart from that, the IBC process is working very well. If Alok Industries could be settled, everything will be settled here….



Nikunj Dalmia: The bull run in the consumer space continues. HUL has just gone and acquired a $3.5-billion brand. These stocks are trading at multi-highs despite what is going on. When we spoke last, you said consumer stocks were expensive. The case of PE expansion is going to be limited but earning expansion could be there. What are your thoughts now?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: I hold my statement. As investor, I look for two-, three- or four-year angle. There will be period when it could go up or down. India is going beyond $2000 per capita income, the level beyond which discretionary spending just blows out. If you go to China and see what has happened to some of these consumer companies, you will go crazy. So, the market’s not pricing in only today and tomorrow, it is pricing in a lot over a period of time.


Nikunj Dalmia: Your view on pharma was also positive. Your thoughts were that the price erosion in generic is getting over and there is evidence of that now. But the uptick has not started. Companies are saying the worst is behind us but we do not know when the best will start.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Yes but they are just testing patience. I am bullish on pharma in general, though not on every company.


Nikunj Dalmia: Are you bullish because you think it is a rupee trade or do you think the business environment for pharma has changed?


Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: The Indian market is growing at the rate of 12% to 15% a year. It is very high ROE market. Growth is there. In America also, I personally feel the generics market has bottomed out and there are large entry barriers there. You got to have size in order to enter that market and Sun Pharma made its biggest money in their dermatology centre. Dermatology at one time was such a area where people were making losses. This led to a situation where a lot of people withdrew.


Nikunj Dalmia: We have all the ingredients of good macros now and they were there about a year ago as well. Interest rates were low, crude was behaving itself but earning recovery remained elusive. When I looked at the Diwali numbers for cars, there was an element of slowdown.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: There was a slow down in cars but in trucks the slowdown was more because of financing problems. Consumer products otherwise have done well. Consumer utilities, discretionary spends, all have done well. Bullishness may not be in the numbers but I feel we are on recovery path.



Nikunj Dalmia: If you look at what all happened in last two weeks, there was change of guard at RBI, confusion over Brexit, big selloff in US markets and a trillion dollar market cap erosion in the Apple and the Facebooks of the world. Yet, the market is firm like a rock.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Kya kare yaar (What to do?). It is like a wall. You have to keep banging your head . Your head will break, the wall would not.



Nikunj Dalmia: So you think the wall will break and markets will go on the upside?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: I mean, do not argue with the markets and your wife. the consumer products have got such high PEs because most of them are showing earnings growth. Take the case of Asian Paints. It has not done well in the last two years but it is priced at the top because people just do not want to leave quality. They want to stick to anything that has given them good return over 10-15-20 years.


Also the earnings are very much influenced. I do not understand the earnings of all these oil marketing companies. Then there is telco. You have PEs of 6 to 70 in the Nifty. I do not know but you can make an average. However, the last quarter’s earnings were not so bad. They were one of the best in last 8-10 quarters.



Nikunj Dalmia: When the present government came to power, everyone thought that there would be big reforms in the PSU space. But frankly, that has remained one pocket of consistent wealth destruction.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: It will be there in the second term. Another problem is we are sitting in Mumbai, all prosperous people. We want the PSUs should be sold. But there is so much political opposition amongst the people that they do not want the PSU to be sold. Politically, it is a big hot potato. But it will happen some time.


Markets above individual parties and personalities 



Nikunj Dalmia: In 2004-2005, there was a circuit down in the market after the change of government. Then in 2009 there was circuit up in the market…

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: In 2004-05, there was circuit down and in five years, our index doubled. The Sensex went from 6,400 to 4,500 and then to 21,000 in four years in a government supported by the communist parties without whom the government would have fallen. In 2009, when Congress got 210, they no longer needed communist support and the index went up by 40% in two days and stayed there for next five years. That is why I am saying the markets are above individual parties and personalities. 

Nikunj Dalmia: You have always believed in identifying mega trends. PSUs across-the-board in 2000, retail after that. You bought into pharma very aggressively. What would you say is a five- year mega trend in making for India?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Good banks. If India has to grow, there has to be 15% credit growth and out of the pie, in 70% there will be very little growth, which is the public sector. Now PSUs also would not see the kind of aggressive growth they were seeing. 



Nikunj Dalmia: Is there scope for PSU banks to come back or will there just be trading bounces?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Aare mai bolta hu shadi kar lo, kis se karna hai aap choose karo. (You have to choose the one you want.)


Nikunj Dalmia: In 2013-14, you said boss itna sasta market ho gaya hai ki aisa lag raha hai chori ka maal (The market has become so cheap that everything looks stolen.)

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Biwi ka bangar beech ke share le lo. (Sell your wife’s bangles and buy shares)

Nikunj Dalmia: Would you like to do that or would you advice anyone to sell.?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: I do not think market is as cheap as it was in 2013. In 2013, we would say Eeny, meeny, miny, mo and buy whatever you wanted. now I do not think market is so cheap that I would sale my wife’s bangles and buy shares.


Nikunj Dalmia: What is your message for an investor who just taken a leap of faith and is doing SIP on a monthly basis? 
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Do not expect more than 12% to 18% from equity markets. This is not the Mahalaxmi Race Course. If you invest in a SIP, I am confident over a period of 8-10-15 years, you will get it. Do not try to be over-smart and I think SIPs should form an integral part of everybody’s savings.


Nikunj Dalmia: In terms of level of commitment, are you fully invested?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Always. Bayaj nahi banta hai to raat ko nind nai aati hai (I can’t sleep at night if I don’t get any interest).


Nikunj Dalmia: But suddenly you will have to pay long term tax now?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: I do not mind paying taxes. Bhar nai hi padega to kush ho ke bharo (If you have to pay taxes, do it happily.).


Nikunj Dalmia: What is easy to predict -- market volatility or the mood of your teenage daughter?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Well more difficult to predict to my daughter’s reactions. She is my only princess and she can always emotionally blackmail me.


Nikunj Dalmia: If there is one thing you would like to not change about yourself and one thing you would like to change about yourself, what would that be?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: My personal habits. I wish I had never smoked a cigarette, never drank a peg of whisky in my life. If I am able to do that, I will be the greatest man on earth, the happiest man.


Nikunj Dalmia: But what is that one thing you would not like to change?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: I think I would like to take success with all humility and we got to empathise with people, not sympathise. We must realise that all success is temporary and transient. It should not change yourself as humans. We should treat everybody the same way as we were before God gave us any success. That is most important. 

I would never like to forget Hum kaun? Rakesh Jhunjhunwala share bazaar road chaap. Do not try to be what you are not and do not try to act too sophisticated. Worst mistakes are made in the best of times. So when your success comes, do not extrapolate it. That is always going to be the same. 

You are what you are because God chose you to be what you are. So remember it is all his doing.


Nikunj Dalmia: If a bio-pic has to be made on your life, who should play you?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: I am the actor. The actress I want to choose is Sharmila Tagore. Sharmila Tagore is my youth year.


Nikunj Dalmia: If Ayesha just walks in and says Sir, please give a tip before going…

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Tips are hazardous for health.


Ayesha Faridi: He said no banks, read between the lines.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Actually what happens is suppose I tell you something. First of all, you cannot make money on borrowed knowledge. I give you some tip. You go and buy it. Some circumstances change. I will sell. But I won’t remember who all I gave the tip to. Then you have SEBI. If I recommend something, they will come with their big magnifying glass. Then you have to spend Rs 50 lakh on lawyer, five months in a year. So, why give any recommendations?


Nikunj Dalmia: But banks look good to you?

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala: Yes I think banks look good."
23,2018-12-14,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Market took a pause after three successive sessions of bullish run and tumbled in early trade on Friday in the wake of weak global sentiment arising from the concerns of slowing global growth.

A set of data that showed a slowdown in China's economy fanned worries that the world's second largest economy was witnessing an economic slowdown.

China’s November retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as domestic demand softened further, underlining rising risks to the economy as China works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States, Reuters reported. 

Besides, participants assessed European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to end the 2.6 trillion euro bond, with a promise of further economic stimulus, which portrayed an ambiguous picture of confidence about growth and concerns over rising uncertainty.

From market leader Maruti Suzuki to luxury vehicle maker Jaguar Land Rover, automakers have lined up steep discounts to lure buyers and clear year-end inventory, ahead of the impending price hikes in January. 

Most public sector bank stocks were trading with gains after reports that the government is considering additional capital infusion of up to Rs 30,000 crore in public sector banks.

From the sectoral indices on BSE, energy, pharma and consumer durables were under pressure, but telecom and realty pack were catching investors' attention."

Where we are: The Nifty closed the week at 10,805 with a gain of 111 points on weekly basis and formed a bullish piercing kind of candle pattern, which is bullish reversal by nature.

Currently, the index is hovering below its strong resistance of 10,950, and any decisive break above that level can push index towards 11,200.


What is in store: The index managed to close the week above its 200 DMA on the daily chart, suggesting strength. Overall, the index is trading in a rising channel pattern on the weekly chart and the recent bounce has happened after retesting a lower band of the channel. We can expect the bounce to extend towards 11,200 zone if manages to sustain above the resistance of 10,950.


What could investors do: The current chart structure looks positive and investors can use the buy-on-dip strategy. Also, we suggest keeping more of sector and stock-specific approach while investing. We still like FMCG and auto space. So, we recommend using buy-ondip strategy in both the sector stocks, such as Colgate Palmolive, Godrej Consumer, Dabur, M&M, Maruti and Bajaj Auto. Also, some of the technical picks, where investors can catch the dips for 15-20% return in the short term, include TCS, Apollo Hospitals, Hexaware and Asian Paints.

Rupee at near 3-week high

The rupee was at 70.89 against the dollar, after hitting 70.84, its highest since December 7. The 10-year government bond yield fell below 7.4 per cent as crude oil declined.


Oil drops on oversupply concerns
Oil prices fell 4 per cent on Tuesday, dropping for the third consecutive session on reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record US and Russian output combined with a sharp sell-off in global stock markets. US crude oil fell $2.04, or 4.1 per cent, to a low of $47.84, its weakest since September 2017, Reuters reported.


Possibility of fewer Fed rate hikes
The US Fed meet starts today, with the FOMC decision due on Wednesday. Although it is widely expected that the Fed will raise rates this month, analysts are calling for two more hikes in 2019 compared with three in September on worries over a potential recession there, according to a Reuters poll.

39,2018-12-20,Asian Paints,"The Indian Premier League’s large advertisers, their media-buying representatives and the tournament’s broadcast rights holder are said to be keen that the country’s biggest annual sporting event be played on home soil in 2019 rather than move overseas, as it has in previous general election years.

The IPL was held overseas in 2009 and partially so in 2014, in South Africa and the UAE, respectively. Apart from the April-May general election, the World Cup in England and Wales is scheduled to be held between May 30 and July 14. The IPL is typically held in April-May.

“Advertisers are unable to leverage home ground advantage when matches are shifted overseas. IPL being the biggest sports property of the year, advertisers naturally want to leverage the best from it,” said Sam Balsara, chairman, Madison Group, which buys media for Godrej Group, Titan and Asian Paints, among others.

IPL broadcast rights holder Star India, which earned an estimated Rs 3,000 crore from IPL this year, is also urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to host the tournament here, said the head of another leading media-buying firm. Star India didn’t reply to queries.

Apart from brand launches and new campaigns, IPL teams sign up ground sponsorships, which could be hit if the tournament moves outside the country. IPL dates and venues haven’t been announced yet as the BCCI is awaiting the election schedule. “In a scenario that some matches of the IPL move out and if the timing of the matches is protected to coincide with Indian prime time viewership, the broadcast revenues may not be impacted much,” said Ashish Bhasin, chairman of Dentsu Aegis Network, which represents large advertisers such as Maruti, Mondelez and Mastercard. “But the leverage of the home ground, which advertisers benefit from, will most certainly be compromised. Overall excitement levels will go down if some matches of the tournament move out; this impacts on-ground business in pubs and bars, besides other related events.”

According to a Times of India report on Wednesday, BCCI chief executive Rahul Johri said it wants the tournament to be held in India but there was no certainty on this.

“I really don’t know yet. The IPL will happen for sure but where it will be staged depends on the general elections,” the paper cited him as saying.

The report also quoted him as saying that the IPL could be held earlier than April-May. BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary said on Tuesday, after the IPL player auctions, that the board is trying “its best to ensure all matches of the 2019 IPL take place in India”.

“The IPL is among the biggest advertising properties of the year, and if matches are held out of the country, it definitely impacts us as the local buzz, which we can leverage, goes missing,” said Parle Products category head Mayank Shah. “This has been the case the last two times some matches of the tournament were held out of the country.” Parle was among the bigger advertisers of the IPL last season.

Of the Rs 3,000 crore Star India earned from the T20 tournament last year, Rs 1,800 crore is estimated to have come from television and digital advertising.

When the IPL moved to South Africa in 2009, several advertisers such as Reebok and Havells cut back budgets or pulled out. While sports gear maker Reebok reworked its on-ground promotion budget, home appliances maker Havells India cancelled on-ground promotions altogether. The speculation is that if some matches of the IPL do move out next year, these could be held either in the UAE or South Africa."

42,2018-12-20,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A less than expected dovish US Fed comments sent the US and Asian equities lower, thus leading to a weak start for the domestic benchmark indices back home.

The US Fed hiked rates for the fourth time this year, by 25 bps, despite a stock-market selloff. The Fed trimmed the number of rate hikes they foresee in 2019, to two from three and the policy makers signalled they may soon pause their monetary tightening campaign. Powell dashed investor hopes for a more dovish policy outlook.

Asian peers Hang Seng, Nikkei and Shanghai were trading in the red in morning deals. 

Moreover, rupee shed 28 paise against the greenback post US Fed's rate hike decision.

Around 9:30 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 178.19 points, or 0.49 per cent, lower at 36,306.14, while its NSE counterpart Nifty declined 56.90 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 10,910.40.

44,2018-12-20,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A sharp fall in oil prices, rupee's strength and steady FII inflows helped stock markets recoup early losses to an extent and end flat on Thursday. 

Jitters in global markets after a less-than-expected dovish US Fed commentary rubbed off on domestic bourses, which kept up heat on the indices back home.

After starting over 250 points lower, the BSE benchmark Sensex ended the day down 53 points, or 0.14 per cent, at 36,432 while the NSE Nifty settled at 10,952, down 15.60 points, or 0.14 per cent.

Among sectors that bled were telecom, metals, FMCG and basic materials. Capital goods, industrials and oil & gas advanced.

Let's check out the factors that drove today's show. 


Global markets on defensive
Nikkei closed at a 15-month low while Chinese stocks hit two-month lows today. European shares too wallowed in the red at the open after US Federal Reserve dashed investor hopes of a more dovish policy outlook even as signs grow that global economic growth is stuttering.

European shares fell 1.2 per cent, with bourses in Germany, Britain and France all hitting their lowest since December 2016. MSCI's global equity index fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding 0.4 per cent as it headed for the fifth straight day of losses, Reuters reported.

These jitters in markets world over affected Indian markets, too.


Slump in oil
Oil prices fell on Thursday to erase most of their gains from the day before, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy. This decline in crude oil prices helped market gain some footing although it was unable to wipe off all of its losses.


Steady FII inflows
Foreign institutional investors were net buyers to the tune of Rs 1,209.21 crore on Wednesday, thus buoying sentiment back home. 


Sharp recovery in rupee
The domestic currency rebounded nearly 66 paise from intraday low of 70.68. The currency was trading at 70.02 against the dollar at the time of writing this report. A sharp fall in crude helped the currency recover.


Expert-take:
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Market opened on a negative note due to selling in the global market influenced by FOMC downward revision in US GDP growth to 2.3% from 2.5% in 2019. However, towards the closing, market managed to recoup some losses supported by further slid in oil prices and strengthening in rupee. Additionally, the Fed slashed the interest rate hike trajectory for CY19 to two from four in 2018, which is positive for an emerging market to attract liquidity."
45,2018-12-20,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A sharp drop in crude oil prices and a bounce in the rupee helped Dalal Street fight a global depression over a less-than-dovish posturing by the US Fed and pare early losses. 

Nifty ended the day 16 points down but formed a bullish candle on the chart, signalling that early Thursday’s blip has not damaged the winning momentum too much.

At one point during the session, BSE Sensex slipped as much as 281 points, but pared most losses. The 30-pack eventually settled 53 points, or 0.14 per cent, down at 36,431 while Nifty closed 16 points, or 0.14 per cent, lower at 10,951.

Midcaps and smallcaps managed mild gains, with BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices ending 0.07 per cent and 0.12 per cent higher, respectively. 

Let’s have a look at the stocks that created maximum buzz during the session: 


Sensex almost evenly poised
Out of the 31 components (including Tata Motors DVR), 16 Sensex stocks settled in the green and 15 in the red. YES Bank (up 3.93 per cent) led the index gainers, followed by Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra and Asian Paints, while the SBI (down 2.18 per cent) lost the most, followed by Wipro, Vedanta, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki. 


Telecom, metal worst hit
With a 1.17 per cent loss, the telecom pack emerged as top loser among the sectoral indices on BSE. It was followed by the BSE Metal index, which slipped 1.10 per cent. Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and Sterlite Technologies proved top drags on the telecom index. Similarly, Vedanta, Hindalco, Tata Steel and JSW Steel were top drags from the metals pack. 


ONGC board approves share buyback
Shares of ONGC logged a nominal gain of 0.13 per cent at Rs 148.65 on BSE after the company’s board on Thursday approved buyback of 25.29 crore shares, or 1.97 per cent of equity shares, for Rs 4,022 crore. In a regulatory filing, the company set the buyback price at Rs 159 apiece. 


Bharti Airtel falls 2%
Shares of the telecom giant slipped 1.89 per cent to Rs 316.15 on BSE after the company in a BSE filing said its board formed and authorised a 'Special Committee of Directors for Fund Raising' to comprehensively evaluate various options of fund-raising. Besides, the company also announced some management changes.


Bank recap plan fails to lift PSU stocks
Most PSU bank stocks did not react positively to the government’s capital infusion plan. The Nifty PSU Bank index closed 1.80 per cent down, with eight components declining out of 12. Major PSU lenders SBI, Canara Bank, PNB and Bank of Baroda all ended the session lower. Analysts said the ongoing political obsession with farm loan waiver has dented investor confidence on this basket.


GST cut hope sends tyre stocks soaring
Tyre stocks Govind Rubber (up 6.43 per cent), JK Tyre (up 5.88 per cent), Goodyear India (up 2.31 per cent), TVS Srichakra (up 1.56 per cent), Krypton Industries (up 1.27 per cent) gained across the board after reports that the GST Council is likely to slash tax rates on automobile tyres to 18 per cent from 28 per cent at its next meeting on Saturday. A drop in crude oil prices also proved a sentiment booster on the counter, as crude-related products are a key raw material in tyre manufacturing. 


Overbought and oversold stocks
Momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 43 stocks slipped into the oversold zone on BSE. They included GTL Infrastructure, Arvind, Rolta India, Regency Investments and Ganesh Films India. While 35 stocks, including Zenith Healthcare, Alexander Stamps, Shriram AMC and Adi Rasayan, turned overbought. 


96 stocks show potential upside
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 96 counters on BSE, signalling bullish setup on these counters.

The stocks included Bharat Forge, Lupin, L&T, Gati, Dilip Buildcon, Pidilite and Apollo Hospitals. However, 50 stocks including Infosys, Nalco, Mindtree, Natco Pharma and Ramco Systems showed bearish crossovers, indicating that they may slide further. 


Nifty forms a bullish candle
The Nifty index negated the formation of higher highs and higher lows that it had formed in last two sessions and formed a bullish candle on the daily chart. Before closing 15.60 points, or 0.14 per cent, down at 10,951, the index scaled an intraday high and low of 10,962 and 10,880, respectively."

49,2018-12-21,Asian Paints,"Equity investors on Dalal Street lost over Rs 2 lakh crore on Friday as a sudden downturn in the benchmark indices cut combined market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies to Rs 143.39 lakh crore from Rs 145.56 lakh crore.

Analysts called it mean reversion for the market, which had outperformed its global peers for the past one month. Indian equity indices, which usually enjoy a positive correlation with Dow Jones, have been moving in contrasting direction since November 12 (See graph). Growing concern over economic slowdown has sparked the major selloff on Wall Street over the past two months, that has left the Nasdaq on the verge of slipping into the bear territory. (See chart)

Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here are six top reasons that has dragged the market: 

1) Smart money has started booking profits, taking money home. Amid the global uncertainty, foreign institutional investors are not taking any risk going into a long holiday.

2) Market is reverting to mean after outperforming for several days. Stocks that logged significant gains over the past few days have seen major corrections, signalling profit booking.

3) Global equity markets continued to remain under pressure after the US Federal Reserve indicated that it was set on its path to hike interest rates next year despite signs that global economic growth is stuttering. The threat of a US government shutdown further inflamed investor unease over the economic outlook. On Wall Street, the Dow declined 464 points, or 1.99 per cent, to 22,859 on Thursday, while the S&P500 plummeted 40 points, or 1.60 per cent, and the Nasdaq 108 points, or 1.63 per cent, to 6,528.

4) The rupee came under fresh pressure on Friday and slipped 56 paise to quote at 70.26 against the US dollar in afternoon trade.

5) Energy stocks are under pressure as crude oil prices have tanked sharply in global markets over the past few days. While crude prices did look up on Friday on Opec signal for higher cuts, the outlook remains grim. Crude prices fell some 5% on Thursday.

6) A strike by All India Bank Officers' Confederation impacted trading volumes in foreign exchange and debt markets, although private banks are not affected by the strike. The protest is against bank merger, which they say will lead to job cuts and allow private lenders to dominate the industry."

Also, some analysts say a surge in liquidity in the market may create fresh inflationary pressure in the economy.


Expert Take:Market analyst 
Ajay Bagg
a said he is clueless what went wrong. “I do not know right now what led to this kind of basket selling. Maybe, it is because of the holiday-shortened week ahead, the coming year end, probably smart money is booking some profits. Otherwise, there are not enough fires to cause such sharp movement. If this had to happen, this should have actually happened on December 11, 12, not now. It is a like delayed action. None of us can figure out why that is happening today, and not a week earlier,” he said.

However, 
Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, said the correction is a great buying opportunity for investors. 

“It is a perfect buying opportunity. We think there was this feeling of why India is outperforming and certain people may have come and booked profits, but we think this is routine. India is going to be an outperformer and we think next week, globally market should recover. So we are looking forward to a very bright Christmas and very happy new year and we think 11,000 is going to be retested by the d of December,” he said.


Joseph Thomas, Head of Research at Emkay Wealth Management, said the market witnessed selling pressure, mainly due to fears of lower global economic growth in the coming year. 

“OECD forecasts pegged the growth rate lower at 3.70 per cent against 3.90 per cent projected earlier. Growth estimates for China have been downgraded by international agencies from 6.60 per cent to 6.30 per cent - lowest ever growth in a decade, both of which point towards a slowdown with far reaching implications for financial markets. The markets came down by almost 1.83 per cent (Nifty) and 1.86 per cent (Sensex), and the broader market also came down, giving up quite a major chunk of the gains made in the last one week. IT and auto stocks suffered over 2 per cent loss as concerns over a stronger rupee hurt IT stocks,” he said."

58,2018-12-29,Asian Paints,"The fast-moving consumer goods stocks could be re-rated over the next few months as falling input costs and rising demand pans out well for their margins, according to analysts at Jefferies.

However, given stretched valuations amidst steady demand trends, the brokerage remains cautious with select buys such as ITC, Dabur, Nestle, Asian Paints and Jubilant Foods in the sector.

After an increase in raw material prices over the past few months, input prices of both food and non-food items have corrected. In the backdrop of price increases in the past 4-5 months, the correction is good for the margins of FMCG companies, said the brokerage.

Jefferies raw material basket was down by 3.2% over a month, led by 2.5% month-onmonth dip in food-based raw materials and 4.7% MoM drop in non-food based raw materials. Correction in input prices was led by non-food based items as crude oil prices corrected 22% MoM, LAB prices used for detergents dipped 11% MoM, mentha was down 8% MoM, and palm oil corrected further by 13% MoM. Among food-based raw materials, coffee prices corrected by 14%, rice bran by 7%, and sugar by 6%.

Jefferies found risk-reward less compelling for HUL, Britannia and Godrej Consumer, given their very rich valuations. Its preference is more for ‘potential turnaround’ set of companies on improving fundamentals going into FY19 such as ITC, Dabur and Nestle. Jefferies still remains on the sidelines and less convinced with risk-reward on Marico, Emami, Colgate and UNSP. Within discretionary space, Jefferies likes Asian Paints and Jubilant Foods.

Jefferies checks suggest that promotional intensity remains rational across all key categories which is also a function of a rise in input prices in the past few months."

1,2019-01-01,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The New Year may have started on a dull note for domestic equities, but a smart bounce in the benchmark indices during the last four sessions has made many stocks look strong on technical charts.

On NSE, 63 such stocks may advance in the coming days, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The technical indicator has signalled an upward crossover, meaning a bullish signal, on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. Many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

The list includes a host of blue chips such as ICICI Bank, HCL Technologies, Lupin and Ambuja Cements.

Others included Jayshree Tea, PVR, Phillip Carbon, Mahindra CIE Auto, Aegis Logistics, Future Lifestyles, Godrej Agrovet, Vinati Organics and SP Apparels, among others.





The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 30 stocks showed a bearish crossover on the daily charts. They include Tata Steel BSL (erstwhile Bhushan Steel), Asian Paints, CESC, Mercator, Omaxe, Sunteck City and Ducon Infratech.




The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst
cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ call using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, it is ruling below its breakout point of 10,920. If it breaches this level, it will unfold the next leg of rally towards 11,050, 11,200 levels.

Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking believes the index may find support in the 10,840-10,800 range.

Meanwhile, daily strength indicator RSI continued to remain flat in the overbought zone, indicating absence of strength. But momentum oscillator Stochastic continued to scale up, signalling that the upside momentum may continue in the near term, said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Technical & Derivatives Analyst at Axis Securities.

UNDERSTANDING MACD
A close look at the stock chart of HCL Technologies shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has showed a downward momentum and vice versa.

On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.49 per cent lower at Rs 957.80 ."

It has not been a bad year for India 2018 even though the midcaps gave us a rude surprise on the downside. Can 2019 be rewarding despite the elections?
As I have been saying for the last 12 months, the Indian market still remains overvalued in totality. 9,500 is roughly where the Nifty should be. Whether it will get to fair value or not is a different matter. If you ask me, this is again going to be a year for stock picking. It is difficult to see why there will be a broad-based rally in the market. I know everybody will obsess endlessly about elections but as I have said before, I am not so sure politics really has that much of a bearing on our stock market as people think it has. 

So, it will be year of stock picking and specific segments which I think looks very interesting for making money continue to be exporters who benefit from a weaker currency, private sector banks who benefit from the slide in the NBFC fortunes and more generally, the consumption story especially small ticket consumption where you do not have to borrow money to buy the products. There will be pockets to make money but I am not so sure that the Nifty as a whole will bring you that much joy in the next 12 months.


You are bullish on exporters because of weak currency. But don’t you think the currency arbitrage which worked very well for IT and pharma companies, may not be a trigger for 2019?
There are two parts to it – one is that we know on a factual basis that a year ago we were at say 63-64 on the dollar. We are now around 70. Most of the IT services companies fully hedge their currency exposure. So the last 12 months they have not really seen the benefits because they have hedged their exposure out. The benefits of the weaker rupee only now will start fructifying for the IT services firm. 

My reckoning is even without any further depreciation, even if the rupee stays at 70 to the dollar, you will start seeing the benefits of the weaker rupee flow through now. 

Second, it is relatively clear looking at the gyration in the rupee that for exporters to be competitive, you need around 75 to the dollar and that obviously suggests that there is further tailwinds for IT companies, the pharma companies, the export pack as a whole. 

It is very difficult to see how our current account deficit will go back to semblance of normality without rupee reaching 75 to the dollar and the fact that the FPI inflows (bond and the equity inflows) are moderating as the cost of capital rises in America. This make it even more imperative that the CAD goes back towards say 1-1.5% of GDP level rather than the current levels closer to 2.5%. So 75 to the dollar feels like equilibrium, which suggests that there is further juice in playing the export story around IT and pharma.


The slowdown in the lending has taken its toll on auto sales as well. This played out in December sales figures. Would you say that the worst is already priced in and is it time to start buying on dips, or maybe keep it to names like Bajaj Auto?
It is not just the slowdown in lending, It is specifically the challenges facing the NBFC sector which have hit auto very hard. Because of the nature of their business model, the NBFCs are far more enthusiastic financiers of trucks, cars and bikes than the typical high street banks are. My reckoning is that NBFCs stay under the pump through this year. 

Whilst the worst of the IL&FS scare is behind us, there are reasons to believe that money will stay dear, cost of capital will stay high for the NBFCs and market share will shift to the banks. So, while the auto slowdown will abate as the year progresses, seeing 15%, 20% growth in truck volumes and 20% growth in car volumes is not something we should expect to see in 2019. 

That was a specific feature of the early part of 2018. It will probably go back to high single digits growth on cars and trucks but the high teens, early 20s numbers that we were seeing in car and truck volume growth will be a long time coming. This is year of a high single digit growth in auto volumes rather than double digit growth.


You have been making a point, stick to the compounders’ list. In 2019, has there been any additions to your classic compounders list?
Abbott Labs is a company we have been looking at quite carefully for a while. It seems to have all the classic characteristics of a great compounder, strong proprietary technology, proprietary IP, superb cash flows. It is a company we are looking at quite carefully, perhaps we will add it to our portfolio at some stage this year. 

The other element to think about is the fact that what you are seeing in largecap consistent compounders, firms like say HDFC Bank or Asian Paints and so on. There is a reasonable chance you can see the same phenomenon on getting repeated lower down the market caps spectrum. 

I think there is a good chance that well-run smallcaps can have a very good year. Raw material price pressure, raw material cost pressures have abated and that typically is a great time for smallcap stocks to see improvement in operating margins. So well-run smallcap companies will find 2019 to be a fertile year and we are spending a fair bit of time looking for consistent compounders down the market cap spectrum, well-run small cap companies with good franchises.


We may hope to catch the next smallcap but in reality it is very difficult, isn’t it?
There is a very peculiar feature in the Indian markets. The Sensex churns by around 25 to 30% over a 10-year period. But the BSE 500 churns by almost twice as much over a 10-year period. What that suggests is it is relatively easy for a well run smallcap company to enter the BSE 500, have a good four-five-year run where growth is say 20-25%. The companies enter the BSE 500 and then they struggle big time to get anywhere close to the Nifty. 

So our stock market is a play of two halves, on the one hand you have giants like Asian Paints and HDFC Bank with formidable competitive advantages cranking out huge shareholder returns over long periods of time and then you have well run small cap companies who are able to grow rapidly to a point but not beyond that. And in between these two extremities there is a sort of whole load of mediocrity which is basically the bulk of the BSE 500. 

My job in a way is to think one of the HDFC Bank and Asian Paints consistent compounders, great companies which can crank out superb returns over long periods of time but on the other hand, look out for promising small companies who can have a four-five-six-year run and end up dominating the small niche in the Indian economy. 

So I was referring to the smaller strategy of looking for companies which can dominate small niche in the Indian economy. They might never be an HDFC Bank or an Asian Paints but they will have a four-five-year good run and that is what I am trying to also discover, This is a good year for that because raw material prices have abated and that is typically a good climate for smaller companies to have a decent run.


Where else within smallcaps do you find value? 
The other area to look at quite carefully is playing a capex recovery but rather than trying to do it through say an L&T type of construct or buying Axis Bank shares, one can look for B2B companies which will benefit from a revival in the capex construct in our country. To give an example, take a company like GMM Pfaudler, which makes glass line vessels. Their vessels are used by the chemical industry, the pharma industry and therefore if we have an economic revival and chemical demand spurts upm then GMM Pfaudler with experience should experience a revival in top line growth.

Similarly, if you look at a company like Alkyl Amines which makes aliphatic amines, again if you have an industrial revival in our country a dominant supplier of a niche chemical could see a good run. So try to look for well run small cap companies which dominate a niche in our B2B economy and our industrial economy might be a more interesting way to play a potential capex recovery on the other side of the election rather than trying to buy the sort of the no-brainer type of stocks which is what the typical investor will run out to do.


How would you be looking at the exporters this year? They were a big play into 2018 especially the IT stocks. How would they fare in 2019?
IT remains a prominent part of my portfolio. I had turned bullish around 17-18 months ago and as you were just discussing in the early part of this interview, if the currency remains at 70 and perhaps goes towards 75 to a dollar, there is good reason to believe IT exporters will continue having a decent run in. I would add pharma to that list. A stock price recovery in pharma is long overdue. Domestic demand has been very robust for the last four, five years. The worst of the FDA action is behind us and if the currency stays at 70 or indeed moves towards 75, there is a long overdue recovery in Indian pharma stocks as well.


We have seen a massive outperformance in the Nifty because of TCS and to a large extent Reliance. They have done well and there was a macro scare. This kind of factor played out in 2013 when rupee went down, crude was volatile, interest rates went higher. We saw a very strong rally in midcap and smallcap stocks. But now mid and smallcap valuations are not cheap. So will only experts like you be able to get few midcaps right? But but that is only 15% of the market?
I am glad you brought this point out. I think there is two different ways in which you can think of a small and midcap rally; the first way the classic small and midcap rally in any market is typically when money becomes really cheap, cost of capital drops, everybody gets really excited, the animal spirits come out and people start looking for exciting small and midcap companies even though the fundamentals of these stocks might not be the greatest. 

I do not think 2019 is going to be a year for that sort of a rally. The cost of capital keeps going up in our country and maybe we will get the odd RBI rate hike before the election but by and large, the cost of capital globally will carry on grinding up and we too will be part of that journey and hence it would be difficult to see a small and midcap rally driven by risk appetite. 

The other reason that small and midcap companies can more selectively have a good run is their fundamentals improve either raw material prices abate or demand picks up a little bit and they see operating margin expansion. On the back of operating margin expansion you see selective small and midcaps rallying. 

I think this is more the latter sort of year, not the former sort of year. I find it difficult to believe that suddenly we will see cheap money sloshing around India and everybody will start having a punt at small and midcaps. It feels more like the latter sort of year where well run small and midcap companies have a good run on the back of better profitability, better profit margins in 2019.


Will you buy two-wheelers if there is right now only gloom and doom in a Hero MotorCorp or Eicher Motors? If interest rates which is a raw material for consumer to buy cars and two-wheelers remains low, will auto demand come back?
Let me answer the easier question first. FMCG is set for another good year, partly the demand base for FMCG is in good shape, election oriented spending and so on. But also raw material prices abating is good news for FMCG stocks. I know valuations are elevated there, but I do not think FMCG stocks will suffer on account of rich valuations. 

If I had to buy a two-wheeler stock, if someone held a gun to my head and said you have to have a two-wheeler stock, I would go for Bajaj because the export-oriented element of the Bajaj franchise puts it on a better wicket than Hero or indeed Eicher.

If I had to buy a two-wheeler stock I would look at Bajaj. For a long time now, TVS Motors continues to be a company which has gone from strength to strength, their BMW bike is shaping up pretty well and I think TVS will continue to be an interesting stock to have. 

But amongst the frontline two-wheelers, if someone held a gun to my head, I will look at Bajaj Auto. The export franchise could be the main thing which draws investors towards them. The domestic piece on two-wheeler consumption will remain challenged as cost of money stays high in our country."

The Nifty50 index failed to hold above 10,900 and drifted sharply towards the 10,735 mark on Wednesday. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and negated the formation of higher highs of last four sessions. It remained highly volatile during the day and again moved closer to its 50-day EMA.

Nifty has been moving in a rising channel and finding multiple hurdles near the 10,950-10,985 zone from last couple of session. Now, it has to hold above 10,777 to witness an upward move towards the 10,850-10,888 zone, while on downside, support exists at 10,650-10,600 zone.

On the options front, maximum Put OI was at 10,500 followed by 10,000 level while maximum Call OI was at 11,200 followed by 11,000 level. There was Call writing at 11,000 followed by 11,200 levels, while Put writing was seen at 10,500 followed by 10,600 level.

The option band signifies a broader trading range between 10,650 and 11,000 levels. India VIX moved up 6.97 per cent to 16.39. VIX has again spiked, which is not giving any comfort to the bulls.

Bank Nifty failed to surpass its previous day’s high and witnessed selling pressure at higher levels. It formed an Inside Bar on the daily scale and managed to close above the 27,000 mark. Now, it has to hold above 27,000 to witness an upward move towards 27,350 and then 27,500 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 26,850 and then 26,666 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 1.23 per cent at 10,825. Long buildup was seen in BEML, Federal Bank, Asian Paints, IGL, BEL and Sun Pharma while shorts were seen in Eicher Motor, TVS Motor, Hindalco, Jet Airways, Tata Steel, Ashok Leyland and M&M.

4,2019-01-03,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks suffered losses for the second successive session on Thursday, mirroring the nervousness in global markets after a revenue warning from tech-giant Apple stoked fears of slowing global growth. 

Most global markets took a beating, as investors rushed to safe haven assets after the iPhone maker said weak sales in China was to hit company's quarterly numbers. 

Europe's major indices, including UK's FTSE100, Germany's DAX and French CAC40, declined about 1 per cent each, while their Asian peers Nikkei 225, Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng all ended in the red. 

Back home, investors sold across sectors in the absence of any positive trigger. December earnings season kicks off next week and analysts believe healthy prints from blue chip companies can change the bearish trend.

Sensex took a 378-point, or 1.05 per cent, hit to shut shop at 35,513, with only five stocks – HCL Tech, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever and Bharti Airtel – ending in the green. The Nifty50 closed at 10,672 with a loss of 120 points, or 1.11 per cent. Among the 50 Nifty stocks, 42 slipped into the red.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed 1.03 per cent and 0.58 per cent lower, respectively.

Let's take a look at the key highlights of Thursday's session:


128 stocks signal further fallAs many as 128 stocks, including SBI, Dena Bank, Jet Airways, Tata Steel, M&M, Tata Chemicals, Tech Mahindra, M&M Financial Services, IRB Infrastructure and Exide Industries showed bearish crossovers on the momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, charts on BSE, signalling that these stocks may slide further in the coming sessions. Meanwhile, 56 BSE stocks including Balrampur Chini, Welspun India, Fortis Healthcare, Aditya Vision and Country Club Hospitality & Holidays showed bullish crossovers on MACD charts.


Rs 1.27 lakh crore gone in a dayThursday's rout caused BSE-listed firms lose over Rs 1.27 lakh crore cumulatively from total market capitalisation, which fell to Rs 1,42,14,112 crore from Rs 1,43,41,828 crore at Wednesday’s close. BSE-listed firms have lost over Rs 2.66 lakh crore in the two-day selling spree. 


Eicher Motors plumbs 52-week lowShares of Eicher Motors plunged 4.65 per cent to touch its 52-week low of Rs 20,180 on BSE, before settling 4.30 per cent lower at Rs 20,253. The stock continued to weaken after Eicher’s two-wheeler brand Royal Enfield reported a 13 per cent drop in December sales at 58,278 units against 66,968 units in the year-ago month.


ONGC slips 3% on OVL listing planShares of ONGC fell 2.98 per cent to Rs 143.20 after the company said the government has not yet asked it to reconsider listing its overseas arm ONGC Videsh (OVL) on bourses. Earlier, the company’s board had deliberated on the demand from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) for listing of OVL, but felt market conditions are not right for an oil & gas exploration and production company to list, adding that there were several complexities involved in getting the firm listed. 


NMDC falls on price cutsShares of mining firm NMDC cracked 3 per cent to settle at Rs 94 on BSE after reports that the company had undertaken price cuts in key products. ETNow reported that the company had cut prices of iron ore fines by Rs 300 per tonne and that of lumps by Rs 350 per tonne. NMDC product prices are at a nine-month low now. The move has come in the wake of Odisha miners ramping up production significantly, utilising their environment clearance capacity for the year.


Dena, Vijaya Bank plunge; BoB flatShares of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank plunged 19.78 per cent and 6.76 per cent, respectively, while those of Bank of Baroda (BoB) ended flat on BSE, as investors judged the swap ratios for the merger between the three banks to be favourable for the latter. The Union Cabinet approved the merger on Wednesday. The three boards approved swap ratios at 110 BoB shares for every 1,000 Dena shares and 402 BoB shares for every 1,000 Vijaya Bank shares.


Nestle India pares gainsShares of Nestle India came off day's high of Rs 11,499 to settle at Rs 11,191, up 1.36 per cent, after the Supreme Court revived a class action suit filed by the Central Government against the company’s Maggi noodles, while setting aside an NCDRC order. The company had moved the apex court against the tests ordered by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). 


Wipro planning share buyback?Market is abuzz with speculation that IT major Wipro may announce another share buyback this quarter. However, this will be subject to regulatory approvals and an NCLT decision on the merger of four of its businesses with the tech major, a TOI report suggested. The company’s last buyback was for shares worth Rs 11,000 crore. The stock closed 0.09 per cent higher at Rs 325.40 on BSE.


M&M Financial to raise fundsMahindra & Mahindra Financial Services plans to raise up to Rs 3,500 crore through a public issue of NCDs, PTI reported. One NCD issue for Rs 500 crore (base issue size) opens on January 04 and will close on January 25. The stock failed to benefit from the news and settled 1.52 per cent down at Rs 458 on BSE.


Dena Bank, Exide below 200-DMAsDena Bank, Adani Enterprises, GAIL, M&M Financial Services, Exide Industries, HEG, JSW Energy, ACC and Biocon featured among stocks that witnessed negative breakouts and traded below their 200-DMAs. 


Who dragged my SensexHDFC, Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), HDFC Bank and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) emerged top drags on Sensex pack. M&M, with a loss of 3.04 per cent, led Sensex losers in terms of percentage points. ONGC, Vedanta, Tata Steel, L&T, HDFC and NTPC lost over 2 per cent each.


Metal pack top sectoral loserThe BSE Metal index, with a loss of 2.35 per cent, finished as top loser among the sectoral indices. All 10 index components settled in the red, with Jindal Steel, SAIL, NMDC, Vedanta and Tata Steel ending the session as top losers in that order, falling between 2.59 per cent to 7.05 per cent."
5,2019-01-08,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Healthy gains, led by bank, auto and metal stocks, helped equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extend gains to the third successive session on Tuesday, as global cues remained positive amid hope of US-China trade deal and a softer Fed rate regime. 

The market had to endure choppiness during the first half of the session owing to bouts of profit taking after crude oil prices rose in global markets and the rupee fell against the US dollar. 

However, bank and auto heavyweights rescued the market amid healthy buying in the later part of the day, lifting Sensex into the green zone.

Sensex settled at 35,980 with a gain of 131 points or 0.36 per cent, while NSE’s Nifty finished 30 points or 0.28 per cent higher at 10,802.


We walk you through the highlights of Tuesday's session:

Tata Elxsi posts tepid gainsThe IT player reported 5.13 per cent YoY rise in December quarter profit at Rs 65.99 crore. But the numbers failed to excite investors and the scrip closed 0.60 per cent down at Rs 973.35 on BSE.


ICICI Bank touches 52-week highExtending its gains into the third consecutive session, shares of the private lender settled 3.46 per cent higher at Rs 380, after touching a 52-week high of Rs 381. Investors have lapped up corporate lenders in recent days as many of these stocks had fallen sharply amid company-specific issues and liquidity tightness in the economy. Analysts are also estimating better earnings from some of these lenders for December quarter.


JLR numbers lift Tata Motors Shares of Tata Motors closed 2.34 per cent higher at Rs 179.35 after Jaguar Land Rover reported 16.23 per cent increase in India sales at 4,596 units in 2018. The company had sold 3,954 units in 2017. The 2018 numbers were the highest calendar year volume till date for the company.


Gruh Finance, Bandhan Bank plungeShares of Gruh Finance suffered a massive loss of 16.39 per cent to Rs 256 while those of Bandhan Bank cracked 4.80 per cent to Rs 477, a day after the latter agreed to acquire the housing finance firm through a share swap deal. Global brokerage Macquarie maintained a ‘neutral’ rating on Bandhan Bank with a price target of Rs 540. It termed the acquisition of Gruh Finance as a wrong decision from minority shareholders’ point of view. Shareholders will be paying 13 times for Gruh against 4.5 times paid for Bandhan. 


PFS surges 4% on SBI credit facility Shares of PTC India Financial Services (PFS) closed 3.66 per cent higher at Rs 18.40 on Tuesday after the company said it had received a sanction for credit facilities of Rs 1,400 crore from State Bank of India. This arrangement also includes a partial credit enhancement (PCE) facility of Rs 400 crore, which will support Rs 2,000 crore bond issuance. 


Sugar stocks get sweeterMost sugar stocks rallied amid reports that the government was mulling a new ethanol package before the Budget. ET Now reported that the new package may be twice the size of the package announced in September. Besides, sugar mills will be provided with loans to enhance ethanol production and to set up new distilleries. Shares of Uttam Sugar Mills (up 7.17 per cent), Shree Renuka Sugars (up 5.93 per cent), Simbhaoli Sugars (up 5 per cent), Dharani Sugars & Chemicals (up 5 per cent), Dhampure Specialty Sugars (up 5 per cent), Ugar Sugar Works (up 4.97 per cent), Dhampur Sugar Mills (up 4.84 per cent), Empee Sugars & Chemicals (up 4.58 per cent), Piccadily Sugar and Allied Industries (up 4.39 per cent) and Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar (up 3.66 per cent) all logged gains. 


Spurt in OITata Elxsi, with a change of 35.57 per cent, led the pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on NSE. It was followed by Ceat (29.07 per cent), V-Guard Industries (28.22 per cent), Kaveri Seed Company (26.71 per cent), United Breweries (21.39 per cent) and ICICI Bank (20.25 per cent).


Ambuja Cements, PNB above 200-DMAsAmbuja Cements, Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank, Biocon, Tech Mahindra, Uttam Sugar Mills and Adani Enterprises were among the stocks that witnessed positive breakouts and traded above their 200-DMAs. On the flip side, NIIT Tech, Triveni Turbine, Gulf Oil Lubricants and MTNL were among the stocks that traded below their 200-DMAs.


100 stocks ready to fall
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 99 counters on BSE. Among the stocks were MMTC, PowerGrid, Apollo Hospitals, Goa Carbons, Rain Industries, Crisil, Oriental Carbon, Ponni Sugars (Erode) and Rane Holdings. However, as many as 57 counters, including SBI, Asian Paints, Grasim, Godfrey Philips and Emami Infrastructure, showed bullish crossovers."
6,2019-01-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Frontline indices Sensex and Nifty trod a shaky road in opening trade on Thursday, tracking mixed Asian cues as investors restricted their bets seeking more clarity on the US-China trade talks that concluded on Wednesday.


Investors are on wait and watch mode and holding their bets ahead of crucial December quarter numbers. 
Bandhan Bank and TCS are the two companies whose number will influence the mood of the market today. 

After falling about 86 points, Sensex climbed 56 points within the first 10 minutes of trade, taking a swing of 142 points. 

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was flat at 36,209, while the Nifty index was 11 points down at 10,844.



The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were outperforming Sensex by trading 0.37 per cent and 0.28 per cent up, respectively, at that time. 

Asian shares took a breather on Thursday after an extended rally, as markets awaited more news on US-China trade talks that have raised hopes of a deal to avert an all-out trade war between the economic giants, Reuters reported.

Oil prices fell by 1 per cent in global markets, giving a leg up to the Indian rupee. Dollar's weakness against it peers on account of increased selling of the greenback by exporters and banks, too, improved the rupee slightly.

After opening 6 paise down, the rupee was trading 12 paise higher at 70.35 against the US dollar in early trade today.

Tata Motors, YES Bank, NTPC, Tata Steel, ONGC and Infosys were trading among the top gainers in the Sensex index.

IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Asian Paints, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and PowerGrid were among the top Sensex losers. 

Shares of IndusInd Bank declined a day after it posted a 5.21 per cent YoY rise in profit at Rs 985.03 crore for December quarter. The stock fell after several brokerages, including Citi cut its target price on the stock, while maintained the buy recommendation. 

Credit Suisse has cut FY19E EPS by 12 per cent on the stock.

IT heavyweight TCS is set to announce its December earnings today. 

Centrum Broking expects TCS’ revenues to grow 1.8 per cent QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms and dollar revenues to grow 1 per cent as cross-currency headwind is likely to cut it by 80 bps. “Ebitda margin may be at 28.5 per cent for Q3FY19, which represents a 60 bps improvement QoQ on a sequential basis. We expect EBIT margin for Q3 to come in at 27.2 per cent, up 70bps QoQ,” the brokerage said."

  20% upside by this Diwali, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:



Why have Reliance and TCS suddenly started outperforming? 
No, not only Reliance and TCS. There were Asian Paints, ITC and L&T also outperforming. It is telling you that smart money is buying industrials and select IT stocks. Of course, TCS has been a prime portfolio pick, but capital goods stocks, industrials are going to be the outperformers and that is where real money will be made. 

So, whether it is power capex or construction, that is where you will see a lot of delta being created on the long side. And it has been the old folly, buy the fear sell the greed and that is evident when you hit that 10,500-10,600 mark when fear is there but it is also the best time to stick our neck out. This time greed is going to expand. 11,200 in second half of January is well on its way because you have a global tailwind now in the shape of equities raring to go and feeling missed out. We are seeing huge inflows into equity. 


Yes Bank has sent two names to RBI. ET Now has learned that there are two internal candidates. If eventually, Rana Kapoor is replaced by an internal candidate, what do you think will happen to the stock? Also if the successor of Rana Kapoor is an external candidate, what do you think will happen to the stock?
In the short run, Yes Bank has become a trading stock at 160-200. If you do get a positive which the market likes -- an internal candidate -- maybe you get 220 on the upside. But we will wait for the results, the divergence patterns and so on. 

On the down side, it seems to have a lot of buying around that 170 levels. On a fundamental count, it is a good brand and it is a good portfolio stock but you need to weather the storm because it has been in the eye of the storm given that over ownership from foreign institutions at Rs 400 has seen it hit Rs 170. 

I would say status quo and not so much change. The positivity has to come from the divergences and the management guidance on the way forward. 


What is your expectation from TCS given the strong 40% plus up move that we have already seen in the stock all of last year? In the last six months, TCS has been more sedate. Would you say that if the numbers are weak along expected lines and if the stock does correct, it is an opportunity to buy assuming that 2019 has the same kind of momentum as in 2018?
Well that is a good point. It has been the darling of the markets for the last one year but this year it has only flattered to deceive. I think it is richly valued, you have got the bonus, you have got the buyback all in the price. Firstly, I do not see IT being an outperformer. 

Secondly, the rupee as a headwind is now a tailwind or maybe there is status quo and thirdly you have got guidances from Apple and Samsung all over the place for a huge disappointment. As a fallout of that, TCS will definitely be impacted marginally on some businesses. 

At the end, I want to chase industrials where I can get that extra delta. So, we are looking at a whole gamut of stocks including corporate banks like ICICI, Axis, SBI, L&T and Asian Paints. We are also looking at power, PFC, REC, NBCC, NCC. That is where real money is going to be made. TCS is going to be a prime space as a portfolio pick but do not expect market-oriented or below market oriented returns for TCS in this year. 


Do you believe sub 20,000, Eicher is getting to a value zone? Would you buy it right away or would you wait for some more correction in the stocks?
Yesterday, the standout part about IndusInd Bank’s numbers was that credit growth has expanded and their CASA ratio plus the net interest income were very strong. They have given you a very strong pipeline. IndusInd is the largest player in the commercial vehicle segment and that also along with Mr Vinod Dasari’s observations on Ashok Leyland at Rs 94, Eicher at Rs 20,000 and Mahindra & Mahindra at Rs 715 are all three value buys for a 20% upside by this Diwali."

We are talking about outlook 2019 but a good investor, before analysing the way forward, always analyse the way back and then reflect back and assess their mistakes. What has been your basic understanding for 2018 because that was a gut-wrenching year for all asset managers. From gold to oil, from timber to coffee, every asset prices has come down.
We met at the start of 2018 and at that time, nobody saw any risk on the horizon and that actually came to play in 2018 when people were not really looking at risks and instead only focussing on returns.

People were buying anything and everything under the sun. That was a huge mistake and it played out in 2018 very well. We suffered from the “recency bias”. It is something that has happened recently and we tried to play it out. We tried to create pattern from that into future. In 2018, we were suffering from what happened in 2017. After what we have seen in 2018, with so many mid and smallcap stocks ravaged and bad businesses actually being thrown off guard, investors have lost a lot of money. That has become the base now and so people are looking very cautiously. Our brains are not wired to emerge as rational investors. We are behaving the same way ever since. I do not see any changes as far as behaviour is concerned and as far as the way markets move in 2019 as well. A lot of mistakes were made in 2018. It will be better for investors as all of us reflect on the mistakes, try not to make the same mistakes and learn from other people’s mistake. 


We are starting the year with some known risks, ie. election, Fed and recognition is also coming that valuations are stretched. The sensible guy would say that this is not the time to buy gold at the price of silver. I am getting good businesses where I am buying gold at the price of diamond. There is a bit of caution this year and that is a differentiating factor.
 Look at this. It takes around 365 days for the earth to orbit around the sun once and it has no relation to the financial markets. But after every orbit, we sit down and talk about what is going to happen till the time the next orbit happens. So, risks are definitely on the horizon. Volatility is a very normal thing for stock markets and despite the fact that volatility is normal and we are going to see more volatility this year, I think it is a normal part of being a stock market investor. 

But the problem is you always get surprised by such volatility. The valuations are still not really in line with what you expect even as a long-term investor. I remember Charlie Munger who says that if you invest in a business with 6% to 8% return on capital and you pay a very cheap price for it and you hold it for 40 years, you are not going to make more than 6% to 8% rate of return annually. But if you buy a business with around 18% to 20% return on capital and you pay an expensive looking price for it and you hold out for 40 years, you are going to make a lot of money out of that. 

The idea for investors for all years and especially for this year is to just keep looking for those good quality businesses which may not be really extremely cheap because good quality businesses do not come cheap. Rather, if they are reasonably priced, even expensive looking, you just buy them and hold them for long term.


That would be consumption right now?
Consumption obviously comes to mind. Then there are businesses where the leverage on the balance sheet may be coming down. They are improving their business per se. Overall for India Inc, the growth has not really happened but there are pockets of small and mid-sized companies which are doing better than what they were doing 10 years back. Look at those opportunities.


When you say reasonably priced, is there a benchmark to qualify reasonable? Eicher Motors came down 15-20%. Maruti came down 10-15%. If any good quality stock comes down 10% and on a long-term chart you will be able to map the kind of cracks that it has seen over a period of time. Is that a good benchmark to go by?
Rather than looking at the return, what is the amount of fall that the stock has seen? I would rather look at it in simple terms and simple parlance. I would rather look at the price to earning ratio for a stock, because a stock which falls from say Rs 100 to Rs 50, may still be expensively priced. 

If I were to just give a simple number, PE is not the right number always for stock valuations. If I have to look at PE numbers, I would look at something priced at 30-35 times as expensive looking in this country assuming that the business is very high quality. But a stock, which even after a fall, is priced at 70-80-100 times price to earnings, I am not going to look at it even if the stock has fallen by 70-80%.


One of the greatest companies on earth, Apple, which has a monopoly, cash, no debt and which is obsessed with getting the consumer right, is trading at 12 time. It makes you wonder what is the benchmark for valuations.
No, things are different outside. Even Apple has been in less than 20 price to earnings for a long period of time. Given the fact that we do not have a lot of options to invest in India in terms of quality businesses, Indian companies have been priced extremely high, especially high quality businesses. There is a huge difference between the US markets and the Indian market.


In India you can buy feeder funds now. That means, an Indian retail investor can buy into four, five, ten good companies companies via a good mutual fund portfolio. If you have a basket of five big Indian companies and five big US companies, which way would you do your capital allocation for next five years? 
Assuming the valuations are right, I would pick probably two Indian companies and three international companies out there in a five-stock portfolio.


You can look at ten…
So make it four and six.


Four Indian?Yes, we can always move the number around. Probably, 5 each would be good.


One more followup on that valuation point is HDFC Bank is trading at 4-4.5 times price to book because everywhere the benchmark is not price to earnings. If it comes down to 3-3.5 times, there is also concern on growth slowdown. How do you draw that balance because then you are paying a cheaper price for slower growth?
You are saying the valuations came down because growth is also coming down. In the long term, a stock’s valuation tracks the growth rate. If I am looking at a business where the growth has come down, I am still looking at the point whether the company is recuperating the growth over a longer period of time. 

I am not looking at a quarterly or an annual decline in growth rate. I am looking at where this company is going to stand maybe 10 years down the line. I am going to buy the stock if I believe that the company is going to be materially better 10 years down the line.


You will buy at 3.5 times?
Yes, for HDFC Bank, I am not so sure but yes it is a good number.


We will have a big unknown in 2019 and that would be the election outcome. What is that one event according to you which could derail the DII inflow that until now has kept the market intact?
Election is the biggest thing that is going to happen this year and that will drive the domestic institutional money into the stock markets. We saw in 2018 that despite the fact that a lot of FIIs pulled money out from India, a lot of DIIs invested and ended with a 0% rate of return for the Sensex. 

DII money in 2019 would be largely dependent on what happens in the elections. Apart from that, nothing is really looking up at this point of time.


HDFC Bank was always expensive and for the quality of management it may remain expensive for a long time. But it has given perhaps the most satisfactory returns on a five, 10 and a 15 year period. On the other side you have got a company like D-Mart, which is expensive and is still giving returns. How does one judge what is right and what is wrong? Some of these are great businesses but price sometimes stops you from buying it. Is that a mistake?
It is a mistake in some sense but we are suffering from hindsight bias here because we are looking at returns from HDFC Bank and D-Mart in hindsight. I would like to bring in Nassim Taleb here who gives an example of a game called the Russian Roulette and he says that this game involves you putting a gun to your head with five empty chambers and only one bullet. Your rate of survival is 5/6 which is 83% on the first shot. The probability of you surviving is huge but what is consequence of you not surviving that shot? You become a statistics, you are dead. 

In the same way, when you are trying to have a foresight on stocks, it is not only important to look at the probability of Asian Paints or HDFC Bank being successful in the future because they have been successful in the past, it is also important to look at the consequences of what happens when there is a one year decline in HDFC Bank or D-Mart’s growth rate, or some new competition comes in. 

So hindsight is good but having a foresight and looking at probability and consequences is a much more important way of looking at and buying such businesses.


What has worked in the past may not work in the future and the classic example here is that after World War I, dividend investment made a comeback. Buffet brought in this entire concept of moat investing. We had the TMT investing which made a comeback. Ten years ago, which was when China was expanding, companies with high debt and growing order book were doing very well. What could be the outsize theme for the next five, 10 years?
I would stick with businesses that have survived over the past 20-30 years. I am not the kind of investor who is looking at fashionable or new era stocks. Of course, there are a lot of opportunities over there.


What about disruption then?
In which sense?


For example, if some of the great brands just cease to exist?
Yes, definitely. I am looking at businesses which are simple. I remember drawing a household picture for my daughter when I was trying to explain her stocks and we outlined around 50 stocks which we interacted with on a daily basis in our households. 

A lot of them were technology in that sense but most of them were not technology. I would still go with businesses which are not prone to disruption. Nobody has any call on what happens in the future. There are so many simple industries that are getting disrupted. But if you stick with businesses which may not be prone to disruption in the future, your risks are taken care of and probably your returns are also going to be taken care of if you buy then at the right valuations.


So not Apple but an HUL?
I would rather put my money on an Apple than on HUL, assuming Apple is a consumer business and not a technology business.


What are you seeing in terms of debt levels and management of debt within the financial sector and some of the utility space? How is the health looking there and are you spotting opportunities?
I do not really understand financials. I stay away from utilities which are regulated by the government. I would not be able to comment on that.


Give me a parting thought, a thought that you have discovered in 2018 as an individual or as an investor and something you want to apply this year?
I turned 40 in 2018 and I realised that after at a certain age in your life, you need to subtract things from your life rather than add things. So 2018 and 2019 is where I want to focus on subtracting more things and this is something which I learned in 2018 when I was turning 40. So focusing more on things which I have already learned, focusing on fewer things and I think trying to do them well is what I would do.."
9,2019-01-11,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Kotak Securities has a buy call on Kansai Nerolac Paints (KNPL) with a target price of Rs 520.

The current market price of Kansai Nerolac Paints is Rs 450.40.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Kansai Nerolac Paints price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage-

Raw Material situation has improved: Paint Industry uses two key raw material including crude derivatives (60 per cent) and Titanium Dioxide (30 per cent). The paint Industry was experiencing increase in prices of raw material for entire FY18 and till end of October 2018. However with correction in crude price to $57/barrel (-29 per cent in the last 2 months), prices of crude derivatives have also decreased. Even prices of pigments like Titanium Dioxide, Iron oxide and Zinc oxide have shown softness in prices in the last two months. Rupee appreciation has contributed to cost deflation for the company in Q3FY19. Correction in raw material prices is positive for paint companies and can provide an uptick to gross margins in H2FY19 in a strong demand environment.


Decorative segment expected to remain strong: KNPL has maintained a low double digit or high single digit volume growth rate in the decorative segment for the last 12 quarters driven by: (1) New product offerings - New product launches which are eco-friendly, lead free, low VOC etc. (2) Aggressive marketing by KNPL- KNPL is one of the largest spender on Advertisement, which is around 9 per cent of the decorative segment revenue as against 7 per cent of Asian Paints and Berger. (3) Improving geographical reach – north India is the strongest market for KNPL, now the company is focussing on West and South (which are strongholds of Asian Paints). (4) Huge Dealer Base – Company current has 20,000+ dealers which is growing at 10 per cent CAGR. These dealers are serviced through 102 depots. (5) Aggressive sales pitch and higher dealer margins.

Connecting directly with the customers through initiatives like tinting machines- 75 per cent of the dealers of the company have tinting machines 7) Other factors like increasing disposable income, shortening painting cycle to 5 years (from 10 years over a decade) and increase in per-capita consumption to 3.3 kg (from 1.5 kg over a decade)


Automobile demand (PV- passenger vehicle) to improve in FY20: Industrial segment contributes nearly 45 per cent to KNPL’s revenues with automotive segment contributing 75 per cent of the industrial segment revenues. KNPL's strong dominance in automotive paints segment is supplemented by its parent Kansai's association with global OEMs that have a strong presence in India. Automotive production was weak in 8MFY19 with volume of 26.4 lakh units (against 27.2 lakh units in 8MFY18 and +3 per cent YoY) which compelled SIAM to reduce growth forecast for passenger car sales from 11 per cent to 9 per cent for FY19. Going forward, demand for PV can improve led by—(1) improvement in penetration of PV, especially in the bigger cities; (2) benign interest rate environment; (3) falling crude prices; (4) appreciating rupee and (5) stable raw material prices. KNPL which derives almost 35 per cent of its revenues from the automotive segment should benefit from this.


Facilities and capex: KNPL has four manufacturing facilities situated at Lote in Maharashtra, Bawal at Haryana, Jainpur in UP and Hosur in Tamil Nadu with an Installed capacity of nearly 431,000 tonnes with utilization rate of nearly 75 per cent. We estimate the company to spend another Rs 7 bn over FY18 to 21E to add another 106,000 tonnes. Healthy addition of capacities is a lead indicator that the demand for paints is going to remain healthy over the next few years.


Valuation and outlook: We estimate that branded paint demand will remain robust in a country like India where per capita consumption is very low and 30 per cent paint market is still unorganised. Management of KNPL also indicated that the volume trends remain strong for the company in the decorative segment and expect the trend to continue in medium term. Automotive demand is expected to look-up in FY20. We also estimate the gross margin of the company to improve with easing RM inflation and appreciating INR. In view of the impact on gross margins, strong demand in the decorative segment and improvement in the industrial segment, we increase our EPS forecast for FY19E to Rs11.1 (from Rs10.8) and FY20E to Rs 12.6 (from Rs 12.4) and assign a higher PE multiple to the stock in an improving macro as well as micro environment. The stock remains one of the favored companies in the consumer space with a strong brand, credible history, sound management and BS and a strong outlook. Maintain BUY with an increased target price of Rs 520 (from Rs 485) at 41x FY20E earnings (from 39x)."
10,2019-01-12,Asian Paints,"Real estate may be down and out, but the companies that decorate them are showing a lot of promise.

The home décor industry did take a hit over the past two-three years, as demonetisation, GST rollout, RERA implantation and persistent weakness in the real estate sector. 

But the industry’s growth expectations and valuations have since been reset downward and growth drivers such as accelerating consumer spend on home décor, renovation and the government’s housing and infrastructure push are projected to lift demand for them in the medium term, analysts say. 

This makes a case to zero in on companies from paints, plywood, sanitaryware, marble as well as tiles sectors. Barring Berger Paints (up 22 per cent) and Asian Paints (up 18 per cent), none of the companies from these sections delivered positive returns to investors in last one year. 

Among the top losers, Shiva Granito Export, Asian Granito India, Nitco, ASI Industries, Restile Ceramics, Somany Ceramics, Murudeshwar Ceramics, Alfa Ica (India), HSIL and Shalimar Paints tanked between 50 per cent and 75 per cent. 

Shares of Ambition Mica, Greenlam Industries and Stylam Industries are down 48 per cent, 28 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, for last one year.

“Home décor stocks have corrected in the wake of earnings disappointments and moderating valuations. Smaller players (second- and third-tier) have been particularly hit hard as negative operating leverage dented profitability more sharply than the industry majors. Since margin expansion is likely to remain slow due to competitive intensity and weak demand outlook, earnings risks for smaller players remain high,” says Edelweiss Securities. 

However, the brokerage says despite near-term pressure, growing consumption pattern and rising aspirations of the middle class augur well for the industry.

Meanwhile, benefits from the dismantling of the unorganised sectors following GST implementation should start flowing in now.

The domestic home décor industry consists of many small players, which were earlier partially or completely exempt from tax. Under the GST regime, all these players have come under the tax umbrella and, therefore, they have to pay taxes creating big cost disadvantage for them, and forcing many such units to close down. 

“Our channel checks suggest 40 plants have been shut down in the tile segment, while many small plywood players are making a beeline for outsourcing opportunities being actively explored by large organised players. The plywood industry is showing tell-tale signs of a shift from unorganised to organised players given the consistent uptick in volumes,” said Edelweiss Securities.

Edelweiss says organised plywood players would eventually gain market share from unorganised players via aggressive product launches in the mid- and low-end segments. Laminates’ margins, too, should start improving with stabilisation in input cost.

The brokerage has ‘buy’ ratings on Century Plyboards and Kajaria Ceramics at the current market prices.

Equirus Securities also has a ‘long’ outlook on Century with a March 2020 target of Rs 209.

“Century should see gradual margin improvement from the second half of FY19 with an expected drop in crude-linked phenol, formaldehyde and resin prices from Q4FY19 and possible reversals of MTM losses related to forex borrowings due to rupee appreciation. However, the MDF business would likely see increased competitive intensity at least for the next 1.5-2 years, leading to lower MDF revenue growth and below-expected segment margins. Hence, we cut our FY19/FY20 sales estimates by 2 per cent,” said Equirus Securities.

Coming to paint industry, the sector is expected to report robust high double-digit decorative paints volume growth in Q3FY19 driven by strong festive season sales. While crude oil prices declined recently from over $85 per barrel in early October to under $60 per barrel, average price in Q3FY19 still remains higher by 20 per cent YoY. Given raw material inventory, ICICI Securities expects margins to remain weak in Q3FY19 despite price hikes. 

With the price hike in December 2018, paint companies took four price hikes last year in the decorative paint segment aggregating 7-7.5 per cent to offset the increase in raw material prices. 

“Despite the price hikes, we expect value growth in Q3FY19 to be marginally lower or 1-2 per cent higher than volume growth,” ICICI Securities said in a report.

The brokerage has ‘hold’ ratings on Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Akzo Nobel and Pidilite.

Indiabulls Ventures has a ‘buy’ call on Asian Paints with a price target of Rs 1,530. 

“Asian Paints’ decorative paint segment has been doing good and with lower crude prices will aid to margins expansion. Also, with the hike in MSP prices, urban development, farm loan waivers we expect rural disposable income to increase which will further aid demand,” the brokerage said in a report."
11,2019-01-15,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity market registered a positive opening on Tuesday amid hopes that benign domestic inflation numbers may push the RBI to cut rate in February policy review.

India’s headline inflation rate based on the consumer price index (combined) eased to an 18-month low of 2.19 per cent in December, down from 2.33 per cent in November and 5.21 per cent in December 2017, according to official data released on Monday.

Wholesale inflation softened to an eight-month low of 3.8 per cent in December from 4.64 per cent in November.

Positive Asian markets also lifted the mood. Major Asian markets jumped higher as Beijing signalled more measures to boost a slowing economy.

Market cheered the rise of rupee against the US dollar. The rupee opened 18 paise higher at 70.75 against the US dollar. 

Dollar was weighed down for the fourth successive week as most market participants remained cautious as the US government shut down entered its 4th week.

Sensex jumped over 300 points and Nifty climbed over 80 points in early trade, backed by healthy gains in heavyweights, including Reliance Industries, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, YES Bank and Tata Consultancy Services. 



Around 9:44am, the BSE Sensex was 297 points up at 36,151 and Nifty50 was 87 points up at 10,825.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rose about half-a-per cent, in sync with the benchmark Sensex. 

YES Bank, Infosys, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, Hero MotoCorp and IndusInd Bank were leading the pack of gainers, rising up to 2 per cent.

All sectoral indices were in the green on BSE, with energy and IT rising over 1 per cent. 



The IT pack was hogging the limelight even as the domestic currency strengthened against the US dollar. Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Tech were among the top contributors of the rise in BSE IT pack. 

The BSE Energy pack was lifted by gains in shares of RIL, BPCL, ONGC, Coal India, Indian Oil Corporation and HPCL."
12,2019-01-15,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Market may be looking to break free, but the reality is technical indicators do not appear strong enough to take the Nifty beyond the crucial 10,760-10,870 on the higher side.

As such, 69 stocks on the NSE could see correction in coming days, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The technical indicator has signalled a downward crossover -- a sign of bearish signal -- on these counters, hinting at possible downsides. 

Many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding credibility to the emerging trend. The list includes banking stocks Bank of Baroda and Syndicate Bank, NBFCs Ujjivan Financial and PTC India Financial, aluminium maker Nalco and paint major Asian Paints.

Sun TV Network, ICICI Lombard, Suven Life Sciences and JSW Energy are a few other stocks that look vulnerable on the technical charts.



MACD -- the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages -- is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. 

A nine-day exponential moving average called the signal line is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. When MACD crosses above the signal line, it throws up a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 28 stocks showed bullish crossover on the daily charts, which include Jet Airways, J&K Bank, Fineotex Chemical, SRF, Hikal, GHCL, Zee Learn and Mukta Arts.



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend, say analysts.

Nifty50 traders, meanwhile, are advised to be patient and wait for a decisive move.

“We sneaked below 10,733 on an intra-day basis, but could not close below it on Monday. Going ahead, this remains to be a key support on a closing basis, followed by 10,692 and 10,628. We are closer to the moment (breakout) and probably in a day or two, things will get clear. Be patient and keep following stock-specific moves,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

The Nifty50 broke the crucial daily moving averages and the rising trendline on Monday.

“It attempted a bearish breakout from the distribution triangle on intraday basis, but closed within the pattern. The stage looks set for the index to exhibit a downward breakout,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan.

As advance decline ratio completely favoured the bears, traders will be better-off to adopt a neutral stance till indices register a directional move, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Bank of Baroda shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show a downward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.50 per cent higher at Rs 121.60."
13,2019-01-15,Asian Paints,"In 2019, hopefully we will go through with some air pockets, some speed bumps but nothing close to a disaster, 
Ashwini Agarwal, Portfolio Manager, Ashmore Investment Management, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


It looks like all the concerns in the world for US markets are over and Indian markets are chugging along. It is good to see that flows have stabilised. But is this as good as it gets because in terms of news, in terms of bond yields, in terms of rupee stability, in terms of liquidity we have got everything on our side?
You are absolutely right. A lot of things have fallen into place and that is why the market seems to have done very well in December and the early part of January. But the one big concern which is looming globally and in India as well is sustenance of growth. 

The growth rates are under pressure globally as well as in India. In India, we have two additional headwinds in the sense that fiscal deficit for the government has been running higher than expected. There is a limited amount of headroom for the government to spend more money and on the demand side, we are seeing a significant slowdown in demand arising out of lower agricultural incomes, thanks to poor food crop prices as well as the NBFCs being unable to lend and finance a lot of consumer products like automobiles for instance or even new homes in some instances. 

The slowdown is something that we need to keep a watch on but yes I agree that on the positive side, the risks of an unruly selloff seem to be more contained now as compared to how we were looking at things in October or November.


What is the way forward now? 2018 frankly was not a stock picker’s year. It was a year where if you bought largecap stocks like TCS, Reliance and HUL, you hit a homerun.
I believe in India, it is always a stock picker’s year. Even last year it was a stock picker’s year. Midcap IT did phenomenally well. There were certain other areas where the market gave a nice opportunity to make some money. Of course, the broad selloff in the small and midcap stocks did hurt the traditional stock picking and here there will be a lot more opportunities this year because in the mid and smallcap space, valuations are beginning to look very interesting. Earnings growth and margin improvement appears to be on the cards. 

You will see a lot of stock picking opportunities in the mid and smallcap space. Even in the largecap space, there will be some amount of rotation because if you look at companies and valuations, you will see extremes both on high valuations as well as on low valuations. There is a set of companies that nobody wants to invest in and there is a set of companies everybody is deeply invested into, where valuations are very high. So, the valuations disparity appears to me as a place for stock picking. So, 2019 will offer more choice by way of stock picking than 2018 did. 


There is all talk and hype around the big Brexit vote tonight. There is a lot of talk as to whether or not there is a going to be a hard Brexit, soft Brexit. Nobody knows which way this deal is going to really go. Do you think this could spell chaos in global markets and thereby rub off on us also?
I do not think so because the Brexit part is being very closely watched. Let us see what happens today. But our sense is that that the event is very significantly priced in. Number two, on the global side policy makers across the board have started to take notice of softer growth and that is starting to get priced into the market place via lower interest rate and that is something that people are starting to work towards. 

Both those things tell me that a big selloff globally is probably not something that I should worry about at this point in time. We also think that the weaker dollar which should be the story for 2019 is overall a positive for the emerging market story. We see fairly good traction in China in terms of policymakers’ desire to boost the local demand and economy. I hope that we will see more constructive data flow out of China as the year progresses. 

The numbers have not been anything to write home about till now but hopefully as the year progresses things will improve. We hope these kind of slower growth and pressures will help rapprochement between the US and China. Overall, we feel 2019 should be a year which is not a very big accident but hopefully we will go through with some air pockets, some speed bumps but nothing close to a disaster. Let us see how it goes but it is all open out there.


Last evening, we got the retail inflation data. It has cooled to an 18-month low. On Friday, the IIP cooled off to a 17-month low. Is the premise getting stronger for a February rate cut by the RBI?
Yes, we think that there is enough room for a monetary stimulus to be introduced. We do not think there is any room for the government to provide more fiscal stimulus to the economy. But in terms of real interest rates being high, that is a valid concern and we hope to see a rate cut in February. 

Having said this, the read through on inflation is also quite mixed because while the headline CPI and WPI numbers are coming in lower than expected, the core inflation continues to be reasonably stable. As the low food prices get built into the base effect, inflation later in the year will start to look up. While we expect maybe one or two rate cuts in the first half of this year, the room for very aggressive monetary easing is also fairly limited from a medium-term perspective.


One of the points to highlight in terms of an investment philosophy is that NBFC rebound will drive auto sales. Do you think that valuation adjustment that we are seeing in autos is now a compelling buy with liquidity crunch getting resolved?
I sincerely hope so because the liquidity concerns around NBFCs have largely dissipated. The growth will remain softer for the next couple of months but after that, hopefully the liquidity in the system will allow the NBFCs to start growing again and if that happens, we should see knock on effect on auto demand. 

Structurally, I do not see any reason why we should be significantly bearish on auto demand in the long run in India. Transportation is a key personal need. We do have some improvement in public transport infrastructure happening in some of the large cities but by and large it is woefully inadequate in all parts of India. 

Personal transportation will continue to drive demand for two wheelers and demand for cars. In trucks as well, we see a reasonably stronger 2019 especially ahead of the April 1, 2020 deadline for the new emission norms. So I think there will be some build up in demand later this year. 

Normalisation of NBFC finances will be a driver for auto demand in our view and as you mentioned, stocks have corrected in certain areas. They do look quite attractive to us.


It could be the reverse also on the auto demand front. As new emission norms kick in, for the first six months, more than demand you could see discounts because they will have to get their inventory out. So, next six months auto companies will not make money because they would be throwing bikes and cars at a price which is much below the average margins?
It is possible. I have not looked much more deeply into this situation as to when does the new products start rolling out and whether there would be hefty discounts offered to clear inventory?

However, I do not believe that the inventory is so deep and so large in the system that heavy discounting will take place. Also, my case for a recovery is a little back ended towards the end of 2019 rather than in the first half. The next few months could continue to be soft for autos because NBFCs have not started to grow yet. The auto trade in my view is a 2019 trade but with a back-ended view. It is probably not going to play out in the first quarter and maybe not even the first six months. But honestly we do not know whether there will be this aggressive discounting.


Another point that you have highlighted is cherry picking in pharma as outlook is improving. In what ways are you seeing signs of change in the sector? 
There are two parts to pharma; one is that the pricing environment in the US has been so severe in the last two years that unless the pricing environment improves, you will start to see product shortages emerge. 

We are hearing this from a multiple number of CEOs of pharma companies both in India and overseas. This was mentioned by two CEOs during the earnings conference calls for the September quarter in India and of late, you have seen similar noise bites coming out of the US. To me, that provides some hope that at least on the US pricing side you will start to see some improvement. 

Second, you will start to see some follow through of the weaker rupee starting to seep through to earnings. Last year, that pickup was relatively small because a lot of the revenues were hedged and last year you also saw a significant amount of cost pressure on account of higher raw materials that is also starting to normalise.

The third facet is that regulatory issues are going to be an ongoing challenge. The USFDA is very clear that they want a certain level of compliance with anybody that is addressing the US markets. The Indian companies have sort of upped their game to a point that these regulatory headwinds will become less sporadic rather than widespread. That is at least my hope because we see a lot of companies telling us that the goalpost had changed at some point in time and we took time to catch up but everybody is very serious about making sure that they do not fall foul of what the regulations expect of them. To that degree, we will see fewer accidents in the future than we have seen in the past. That’s what I hope.


Where in this market do you think there is still a situation of a great business going through temporary distress? 
There are several areas in the small and midcap space where you have very good companies where stocks have sold off 40-50-60% over the last year, where balance sheets are improving, earnings trajectory is improving, valuations are at minus one standard deviation of a past five-year historical trend and therefore we see significant amount of value. 

In the frontline space, there are select areas where valuations are quite attractive. The outlook is unclear though. Take the PSU banks for example. You could argue that these are not the best-run businesses in the country but the valuations are absolutely undemanding and if the credit cost normalisation follows through, then you could see a significant amount of improvement in stock prices as the year rolls along. 

Obviously there is a worry here that MSME loans could turn out to be the new problem that the public sector banks have to deal with. Let us see how that goes along. But that is yet another example of where something is definitely changing for the positive which has not been recognised by the market as of now.

 Unfortunately, we are also dealing with delays in the NCLT resolution of bad assets, we were hoping that we would see a lot more progress on that by now which has held back some of the write-backs, if we see that in the first quarter of this calendar year we could see some positive surprises here. That is another area in the large cap space where you could see some improvement. 

Another area could be metals. We do not track metals very closely, I found it very difficult to predict what happens to metal prices but I think fundamentally from a book value perspective a lot of stocks are beginning to look very cheap so there may be some opportunities out there. 

Last but not the least, oil market companies are now trading at valuations they were trading at prior to this whole deregulation unfolding three years ago. So we are back to a point where deregulation has been given up for dead and you do not have a lot of downside here. Let us see how the market treats them as we go ahead.


What about the reverse part? What would you not buy in this fall? Eicher has corrected, Page has corrected, Asian Paints has corrected. Would you be tempted to go back to the classic compounders?
Well there will be some opportunities in deep corrections, there is no denying that but given our value framework, we find it very difficult to buy these really expensive stocks. But one of the reasons why these growth stocks have done spectacularly well over the last five years is because growth was very hard to come by. 

Wherever you saw some degree of assured growth valuations did not almost matter and in my opening comments I did mention that growth is coming through as the overarching concern all across the world. So, if we again get into a growth funk in 2019, then you may see the names that you mentioned come back very strongly because of the assured growth that is coming through. 

From our portfolio and our value investment style perspective we do not like very expensive valuations whether it is in the consumer staples space, whether it is some of the names that you mentioned or some of the really toppy valuations for assured growth that the market has been very happy to pay for the last several year. It does not work for us in terms of how we think about stocks and opportunities."
14,2019-01-16,Asian Paints,"Traders have been stacking up on shares of paint companies over the last two trading days. Asian Paints has seen its trading volumes jump by 30 per cent on Monday and Tuesday compared to its average of the past 10 days. Trading volumes in Kansai Nerolac has spiraled 270 per cent during this period. 

The chatter on the Street is that the chief financial officer of a leading paint company told analysts last week that volumes growth in the third-quarter would be sharp because of festive buoyancy and reconstruction based demand in Kerala. 

Organised players are also recapturing market share from unorganised players after the reduction in GST rate for paints. Many of the traders are betting on surprises in the December quarter results."
15,2019-01-16,Asian Paints,"The Nifty FMCG Index has gained one percent so far in 2019 after rising nearly 12 per cent last year. The 15 member index trades at nearly 40 times its one year forward earnings which is also the 5-year average. It is still 7 per cent below the lifetime high level of 33,167 and analysts do not expect it to reach 33,610 in the coming one year. That implies a 9 per cent return. 

Here’s a list of high price-to-earnings stocks and where do analysts see them one year from now. 


Hindustan UnileverTrades at 52-times expected FY20 earnings, which is above the 5-year average of 44 times. The stock is 4 percent below the lifetime high and analysts expect a 5 percent return for investors in the next one year. 


Asian PaintsTrades at 50-times expected FY20 earnings, which is close to the 5-year average of 51 times. The stock is down nearly 6 percent from the 52-week high and analysts expect the stock to decline 4 percent over one year. 


Nestle IndiaTrades at 56-times expected FY20 earnings, which is below the 5 year average of 64-times. The stock is 3.5 percent below the 52-week high and analysts expect it to remain flat during the next 1 year.

16,2019-01-16,Asian Paints,"There is a whole lot of passive-isation happening in the largecap space, Manish Sonthalia, Chief Investment 
  
  
  Officer and the Director of the India Zen Fund, Motilal Oswal AM-PMS, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

How are you dealing with the market volatility? On one side, there is the promise that good companies will make a comeback but on the other side, there is serious price erosion in Eicher, Page Industries or Asian Paints. You focus on quality at reasonable price, but that theme is getting challenged.
There are no shortcuts and you do not change your strategies when the mood of the market changes. It is as simple as that. The long-term trajectory on earnings on these companies remain perfectly intact if you are not seeing a major sector rotation like the capex cycle picking up. The valuations are not going to fall because there is simply too much of capital to be deployed.

When stocks are cheap, they are cheap for a reason and we have seen many of these names lose 70%, 80%, 90% of the market cap on the garb of them being cheap. It is better to buy quality provided you understand the business and the free cash flow generation ability on these businesses for long periods of time. One will have to live through the volatility and I do not think changing strategies really work. 


There was a disruptive change in a company like Eicher a year and a half ago and business slowed down. If a quality company which has got excellent cash flow also corrects by 30-35%, it just makes you wonder!
The whole point is that if the stock has gone up from say Rs 300-400 to Rs 32,000 and it has come down to Rs 20,000, now the valuations are 20 times one year forward numbers. All these years, the valuations were 40 times, 50 times one year forward numbers. The move from Rs 500 to Rs 20,000 has got established and of course it went to Rs 32,000 and has come down to Rs 20,000, but is it cast in stone that the volumes are never going to cross 60,000? I would not believe so. 9,25,000 guidance obviously is due to reasons like insurance hikes, ABS and BS transition and these would have an impact on the cost price and that is having an impact on their demand. 



Of course, these would be temporary. You have a very strong marriage season this year and UP is one of the very big new markets for Eicher which is coming in. I would tend to believe that even if you see a de-growth for Eicher this year, if we look at FY21, a 15% type volume growth is very much doable, without taking into perspective anything on the export front.

Nothing really is happening on the export front and so valuations have come down. The stock has now moved from Rs 500 to Rs 20,000. At 20 times one year forward numbers, you cannot really argue that the valuations are expensive. During the journey from Rs 500 to Rs 20,000, it appeared the valuations were very expensive. It went to Rs 32,000 and that is why it has seen a correction of 35%.

But from here on, if the 15% growth comes through, then you will see a slow and steady upmove in Eicher. You would require six months of timeframe to gauge whether a product has really succeeded or failed. The initial euphoria is always there when a new product is launched. 


For shorter-term investors, it is really a game of patience. Why would you put your money into Eicher? What is the timeframe when you see that a meaningful growth visibility would come back for Eicher because right now clearly that is a miss?
There is nothing called short-term investing. It is always short-term trading. Let us assume that somebody is looking at the next one and a half to two years. Even buying at these prices should make you money in these levels but if anything very significantly different can happen between now and the next six months, a lot of it will be dependent on how this whole money into the rural parts of the economy flows through because we are looking at an election year. All these things are ifs and buts for the short term. 

But definitely once all these transition measures are taken, it is not that the journey for motorcycles in terms of volume growth is over. Of course 11-12% volume growth over the last decade will weigh down to something like 7% odd and within that, the 350 CC plus segment definitely has some room. 

Of course, there is going to be increased competition but it is an evolving story. I would not believe that Eicher is done with. It is just a stop in a long journey ahead for us but there are no shortcuts for the next six, nine months. If one wants to fillip through for the next six-nine months, he or she may be free to do so. You can get out but nobody is going to tell you when to get in and you will only realise that in hindsight that the price would have moved up and you would have exited at a lower price.


Are you saying that there will be no margin hit on fuel sales for oil marketing companies. What is your view largely on the oil and gas sector?
They are making some very decent margins on the marketing side now. But this Re 1 cess absorption or Re 1 duty absorption has taken the faith away from all oil marketing companies. In terms of PE re-rating, the amount of market capitalisation loss that one has seen in the oil and gas sector is not funny. It is just Re 1 and that too for a few days and that has eroded close to Rs 2 lakh crore worth of market from the state owned oil marketing companies. 

Of course coming to fundamentals, there is deep value. There is no doubt about it. You are trading at valuations of one time price to book and maybe three, four, five, at best six times price to earnings depending on how much of inventory losses come through on account of the crude correction as well as the forex impact. 

I would tend to believe that companies like HPCL, etc, would make something between 5500 odd crores, everything said and done for the next three years at least and then you are looking at a capex for all the oil marketing companies. Net-net. I would want to believe that there is some very deep value in oil marketing companies but sentiments have got soured purely on account of PE de-rating and it would take some time for the PE to re-rate.

Also there has to be an assurance coming from the government side on this front because investors do not want to believe this whole confusion about decontrol and control, just because of that Re 1 duty absorption that was forced on OMCs for a couple of days. Then oil really tanked and they are now making some supernormal margins on the marketing side but the damage has been done. Fundamentals are perfectly intact.


What about financials? The general consensus is that you should now buy corporate banks as they have CASA, money to lend. Retail banks are expensive, consumer is slowing down and NPA delinquency will start. Would you buy corporate banks?
I believe this and in fact we have bought ICICI Bank. We have taken money off Bajaj Finance. This is an environment where banks will be at an advantage over non-banking finance companies and you are right when you are saying the retail focussed banks have really done very well over the last few years. They may go through time correction. There is nothing wrong with that but even for the corporate banks that we talk about --Axis and ICICI Bank -- 40-50% of their book is still retail. 

I firmly believe that the corporate NPA cycle has peaked and valuations are 1.5 times price to book for ICICI Bank. Remember. they have some invaluable subsidiaries with them; the life insurance business of ICICI or the general insurance business of ICICI Bank. Insurance is an infinite ROA business. You require capital for a period of 10 years and after that it is free cash flow machine forever. 

If core banking book starts to revive, and you are getting at 1.5 times price to book, it is certainly better than a Bajaj Finance at six times price to book where 40% growth will not come. Bajaj Finance management are guiding 20-25% growth rate and for that to pay a six times price to book and a 40 PE seems slightly out of sync. So, there is definitely a case for corporate banks. We have incorporated one of them in our portfolio.


There was a bit of a macro risk in 2018. Only select largecaps managed to outperform. Now that macro fears have receded, how do you think the general mood will change?
2019 is going to be an year of the emerging markets. Everybody is fixated on a growth in a trade war environment between US and China. The US Fed is now starting to sound very dovish and no balance sheet shrinkage seems to be coming in from the European Union. 

With WPI and CPI numbers well below the RBI trajectory, we are looking at a rate cut situation rather than a rate rise situation. The interest rates cycle for the moment may look slightly toppish and in that sort of an environment, money flows from developed markets to emerging markets. Emerging markets are to be bought when there is chaos all around and there is chaos around all emerging markets in 2018. One would have to figure out who has fallen more. 

In this sort of an environment when so much of domestic capital has flown into the largecap space and so much of domestic capital has been taken out of the mid and smallcap space, if one is talking about a revival in corporate profits -- 50% of corporate profits is represented through Nifty50 stocks but the balance 50% is represented through the broader markets and they have seen a massive correction. 

The small cap index itself is down some 30% for 2018. That sort of cut with the earnings cycle reviving would want me to believe that there is more money on the table in the case of mid and smallcaps as opposed to the largecaps because the latter will give 9-10-11-12% type of returns and everything has been priced in for the next one or two years.

There is nothing called cheap in the markets in the largecap space -- be it consumer, private banks, or metals space. But there is value across the table in the mid and the smallcap space. One only needs courage to put money out here but there is greater comfort in mind when it comes to largecap investing and not so much so in case of mid and small cap investing. There is a whole lot of passive-isation that is happening in the largecap space. If that be the case, then how is one supposed to generate an alpha? It will come in the mid and the smallcap space so that is the area to focus on in 2019."
17,2019-01-16,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Stock benchmarks oscillated between profits and losses throughout Wednesday, only to end flat with a positive bias amid optimism in global peers. 

Most markets overseas jumped, giving a shrug to the Brexit deal defeat for British Prime Minister Theresa May, who faces a no-confidence motion. 

The legislative heat is expected to force the UK to delay its departure from the larger European Union.

A spurt in oil prices and loss in the rupee capped the upside. Investors decided to keep their powder dry ahead of key quarterly earnings tomorrow, chiefly being those of RIL and HUL. 

The BSE Sensex settled little changed, up 3 points, or 0.01 per cent, at 36,321 whereas the NSE Nifty inched up 4 points, or 0.03 per cent, to close at 10,890. 

Bank and IT stocks contributed much to the Sensex's rise. FMCG was the top drag. 

YES Bank jumped the most, by 2.66 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, ONGC and SBI. 

Bharti Airtel, Vedanta, Asian Paints, HCL Tech and Bajaj Finance lost their way, declining over 1 per cent each.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices too fell up to 0.14 per cent. 

Telecom, FMCG and metals indices topped the sectoral losers' list, dropping up to 0.82 per cent. Meanwhile, oil and gas, information technology and healthcare indices posted gains.

Graphite India and HEG rose 8.33 per cent and 4.16 per cent respectively, were one of the top BSE gainers. Shares of graphite electrode producers such as Graphite India and HEG surged after Japanese graphite electrodes producer Tokai Carbon raised electrode contract prices. 

Jet Airways, on the other hand, came under selling pressure and slumped over 8 per cent amid uncertainty over an open offer. The scrip closed 7.95 per cent lower at Rs 271.


What made markets play steady today?

1. 
Global shares find their footing: World equity markets overcame the crushing parliamentary defeat for British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal. Stocks were also lifted by signs that China will take more steps to bolster its slowing economy and the US Federal Reserve may pause its run of interest rate rises, according to Reuters.

The broader Euro STOXX 600 was up 0.3 per cent while indices in Germany, France and Spain all firmed up.

Earlier in the day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.2 per cent, with South Korea's Kospi and Hong Long's Hang Seng both scaling six-week highs.

2. 
Rise in oil prices: Oil prices hardened today after climbing about 3 per cent in the previous session over expectations that Opec-led supply cuts will tighten markets despite signs of a global economic slowdown. Brent crude oil futures were at $60.83 per barrel at 0748 GMT, 19 cents, or 0.3 per cent above their last close.

3. 
Rupee's rising pain: The domestic currency witnessed another weak session and shed some 23 paise against the dollar to hit intraday low of 71.25. The rupee weakened for the third consecutive session today. 

Expert-take:
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

""Market was range bound as impasse over Brexit deal and continued partial shutdown in the US government drove sentiment. Narrowing trade deficit and selective buying in banks and pharma stocks helped market end on a flat note. Investors remained focused on earnings season to get cues on sectors which may provide positive growth momentum."""
18,2019-01-16,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty closed flat on Wednesday as gains in shares of Infosys, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank were offset by losses in HDFC, ITC and Hindustan Unilever.

After opening in the positive territory, the market witnessed selling amid mild weakness in global stocks.

However, analysts are of the view that markets have nearly factored in the fall of Brexit deal as most Asian and European stocks showed resilience in the later part of Wednesday's session.

The absence of any fresh trigger caused market to end lacklustre and the upcoming earnings of Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank may give a direction to market in days to come. 

Sensex ended 3 points up at 36,321.29, with 13 stocks up and 18 down. The NSE Nifty settled 3.50 points up at 10,890.30 with 22 stocks in the green and 28 in the red.


Let's take a look at highlights of Wednesday's session:

Sensex movers and shakersYES Bank climbed 2.66 per cent, leading the pack of Sensex gainers. It was followed by IndusInd Bank (up 2.02 per cent), Infosys (up 1.38 per cent), ICICI Bank (up 0.68 per cent) and ONGC (up 0.62 per cent). On the flip side, Bharti Airtel (down 1.38 per cent) lost the most in the Sensex kitty. Vedanta (down 1.33 per cent), Asian Paints (down 1.21 per cent), HCL Tech (down 1.02 per cent) and Bajaj Finance (down 1.01 per cent) were up next among the losers in the Sensex kitty.


Graphite India, HEG surge up to 8%Shares of graphite electrode producers, Graphite India and HEG surged on Wednesday after Japanese graphite electrodes producer Tokai Carbon raised its electrodes contract prices. Graphite India closed the day at Rs 752.50, with a gain of 8.33 per cent, whereas HEG closed gained 4.15 per cent to Rs 3,687.85 on the BSE.


Merged entity IDFC First Bank debutsShares of IDFC First Bank, merged entity of Capital First and IDFC Bank, made a positive debut on the bourses. The stock opened at Rs 47.05 and closed the day at Rs 48.25. The merger between the bank and the NBFC, announced on January 13 last year, was completed on December 18, 2018.


SBI gains on fundraising planState Bank of India (SBI) is raising at least $1 billion by selling bonds to overseas investors in what is the largest such sale from the country since January 2018. The state-owned lender is issuing the bonds in two tranches, one a three-year and another a five-year, as its seeks to shore up funds in the new year. The proceeds could go beyond $1 billion if demand is strong. The stock closed with a mild gain of 0.58 per cent at Rs 302.75 on BSE.


Jet sinks on Etihad woesShares of Jet Airways plunged 7.95 per cent to Rs 271 on the BSE amid reports that lenders to Jet Airways may have to offer big discount, as much as 49 per cent over its Tuesday’s closing. Etihad Airways has offered to invest in debt-laden Indian carrier Jet Airways at Rs 150 per share, along with an immediate release of $35 million after certain conditions are met, CNBC-TV18 reported on Wednesday. Earlier, an ET report suggested that Etihad Airways CEO Tony Douglas has set a slew of tough pre-conditions, which include the complete exit of Naresh Goyal and his family from the management of the Indian carrier.


Cummins slumps on UBS' bearish outlookCummins India stood among the third worst performer on the BSE. UBS expects margins of the company to contract 90 basis points sequentially in Q3 as against street expectations of margins sustaining at Q2 levels. They also remained concerned on the medium-term trajectory, as commercial real estate supply peaks, the prolonged liquidity crunch impacts residential real estate, and manufacturing takes time to recover. The scrip closed 4.15 per cent down at Rs 841.75.


Vakrangee extends winning streak to 5th dayRising for a fifth straight day, shares of Vakrangee closed 4.91 per cent up at Rs 45.90 on the BSE.

Moreover, the launch of Nextgen Vakrangee Kendras has also raised investors interest in the stock. The company has launched over 3,300 Nextgen Vakrangee Kendras across India. These outlets are spread across 20 states, over 340 districts and more than 2,000 postal codes of the country, of which more than 70 per cent outlets are from tier 5 and 6 cities. 


HT Media slips 1% on profit slumpShares of HT Media closed 1.05 per cent down at Rs 47.20 after it reported a 68.66 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 42.91 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.

The top half of students got an average annual cost-to-company (CTC) package of Rs 23.73 lakh, a 13% increase from last year.

The highest domestic salary offer, from Amazon, was Rs 40.5 lakh compared with last year’s Rs 38.5 lakh. Last year, the highest international offer was Rs 52 lakh. The institute said that while it received an international offer this year as well, all students had been placed by the time.

Seven students from the 373-strong batch chose to opt out of placements, with the remaining 366 getting 390 offers from 107 recruiters.

“We have seen a significant surge in the pre-placements offers, as well as a lot of niche roles being offered by consulting and finance clusters,” said IIM Kozhikode placements chairperson Shovan Chowdhury.



Amazon, Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte, EY, Goldman Sachs, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), JPMorgan Chase & Co., Optum and PwC were among the major recruiters.

There were about 20 new recruiters this year, including Bain & Co, Citrix, Exide, Everest Management Consulting, HSBC Securities, IQVIA, OfBusiness and State Street.

Around 30% of the offers were made by the consulting cluster. McKinsey & Co., BCG, Bain & Co., Avalon Consulting, Cognizant Business Consulting, Deloitte, Everest Management Consulting, EY, Feedback Infra and PwC made as many as 117 offers.

Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) accounted for 21% of the offers.

21,2019-01-18,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty ended Friday's session almost flat as gains in Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC were offset by losses in Sun Pharma, Larsen & Toubro and Bharti Airtel.

Losses in select heavyweights from pharma, capital goods, telecom, bank and auto counters weighed on Sensex even as global cues remained broadly positive.

Rupee's weakness against the US dollar following the rise in oil prices further dented the mood.

Sensex inched up by 13 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 36,386.61, while Nifty closed the day at 10,906.95, up 2 points or 0.02 per cent.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices underperformed benchmark Sensex, falling 0.79 per cent and 0.73 per cent, respectively.

For the week, both Sensex and Nifty climbed by 1 per cent each.


We walk you through the highlights of Friday's session:

Sun Pharma m-cap falls below Rs 1 lakh croreShares of Sun Pharma plunged as much as 12.12 per cent to touch its 52-week low of Rs 375.40, before finishing the day at Rs 390.75, down 8.52 per cent.

Friday's fall eroded the market capitalisation of the company by about Rs 8,736 crore. As on Friday's close, the m-cap of Sun Pharma was at Rs 93,751.44 on BSE, compared with Rs 1,02,487.3 crore a day earlier. 

Shares of the company cracked after media reports suggested that a whistleblower had filed a second complaint against it. Sun Pharma, however, clarified in a regulatory filing on Friday that the company had not received the alleged ""172-page whistleblower complaint"" and it was ""not privy to the contents of the document being referred in the said media article"".


RIL buoyant on brokerages thumbs-upShares of Reliance Industries settled 4.34 per cent up at Rs 1182.95 on the BSE, a day after it became the first Indian private company to report a quarterly profit of more than Rs 10,000 crore. CLSA retained 'buy' call on the oil-to-telecom behemoth with a target price of Rs 1,500. Citi also kept 'buy' call on RIL with a 12-month target price of Rs 1,300. Macquarie maintained ‘Outperform’ call on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,315. 


108 stocks signal potential fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 108 counters on BSE. Among them were Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Phillips Carbon. On the other hand, 48 stocks, including ONGC, TCS, HDFC, Asian Granito India and JK Cement featured among 48 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on the BSE.


HUL settles with minor lossesShares of FMCG heavyweight Hindustan Unilever finished 0.37 per cent lower at Rs 1,743.70, a day after the company reported a 9 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 1,444 crore for the quarter ended December 31. The stock failed to perform even as some brokerages were upbeat on the company's earnings.

Global brokerage CLSA maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 2010. “HUL should grow earnings organically at over 15 per cent with upside in FY21 from the GSK deal. The commentary was fairly positive as demand conditions seem stable including in rural,” CLSA added.


Rallis India's Q3 profit fallsTata group firm Rallis India reported a 45 per cent decline in consolidated profit at Rs 13.76 crore for December quarter on higher tax outgo and other expenses. Total income, however, rose by 7 per cent to Rs 423.25 crore from Rs 393.86 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Shares of the company closed the day 4.62 per cent down at Rs 165. 


Cyient settles lower after a dull Q3Shares of IT consulting and software firm Cyient declined 1.52 per cent to close at Rs 618, a day after its earnings numbers failed to excite Dalal Street. The company hit a bump, which was attributed to degrowth in semiconductor and communications businesses wherein some of the key expected deals got pushed out to next quarters. 


Jet Airways slipsShares of Jet Airways fell 1.21 per cent to close the day at Rs 281.35 amid a media report that the debt-laden carrier's lenders might write-off up to a fourth of its debt. As per Reuters, lenders to the airline were considering a plan to resolve its debt issues, top creditor State Bank of India said on Thursday, while media reports said two main shareholders have yet to resolve their differences. 


Telecom pack top sectoral loserHit by losses in shares of Bharti Airtel (down 6.42 per cent), Vodafone Idea (down 4.48 per cent), Tata Communications (down 2.30 per cent) and Bharti Infratel (down 0.80 per cent), the BSE Telecom index emerged as the top sectoral loser with a loss of 3.83 per cent. Only three stocks - GTL Infrastructure (up 4.69 per cent), Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) (up 4.19 per cent) and Sterlite Technologies (up 0.73 per cent) - managed to close the day in the green.


Sensex movers & shakersAmong the 31 stocks (including Tata Motors DVR) in the Sensex index, 12 stocks settled in the green zone, but 19 suffered losses. Among the gainers, Reliance Industries (up 4.34 per cent) led, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 1.41 per cent), HCL Technologies (up 1.02 per cent), ONGC (up 0.79 per cent) and Asian Paints (up 0.68 per cent). On the flip side, Sun Pharma, with a loss of 8.52 per cent, led the pack of losers in the index. Bharti Airtel (down 6.42 per cent), Larsen & Toubro (down 2.07 per cent), Axis Bank (down 1.77 per cent) and YES Bank (down 1.59 per cent) finished as the top losers in the pack in that order.

20,2019-01-18,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Markets ended flat with a positive bias in a volatile session on Friday, with RIL lifting mood post a strong Q3 show. 

Upbeat global sentiment did not help matters much as benchmarks lay low for the most part of the day, only to settle with marginal gains. 

Speculation ahead of Budget 2019 kept investor sentiment fragile. Pharma stocks registered hefty losses, led by Sun Pharma, a major drag on the index. 

The Sensex edged up 13 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 36,387 while the NSE Nifty closed the day at 10,907, up 2 points, or 0.02 per cent.

For the week, the 30-share Sensex gained 378.77 points, or 1 per cent, and the Nifty rose 112 points, or 1.02 per cent. 

In the 30-share pack Sensex, 12 stocks climbed while 18 slipped. Reliance Industries contributed over 150 points to the Sensex's total tally. However, losses in Sun Pharma, L&T, Airtel and ITC threw a spanner. 

RIL was the top index gainer, climbing 4.34 per cent, after the oil-to-telecom behemoth posted better-than-expected Q3 results. The firm reported 8.82 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated profit at Rs 10,251 crore. RIL became the first Indian private firm to post Rs 10,000 crore quarterly profit. The numbers came in after trading hours on Thursday.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, HCL Tech, ONGC, Asian Paints and Vedanta were other big names that ran up by a big margin. 

Sun Pharma with a decline of 8.52 per cent was the worst index performer. The stock plunged after reports suggested a whistleblower has filed a second complaint against the pharma major. 

The drugmaker, however, clarified in a regulatory filing on Friday that it had not received the alleged ""172-page whistleblower complaint"" and is ""not privy to the contents of the document being referred in the said media article"". 

Telecom index was the worst hit in the sectoral space, followed by healthcare, capital goods and realty. BSE Energy surged the most. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap underperformed the benchmark and slipped 0.79 per cent and 0.73 per cent, respectively.

The advance-decline ratio on BSE stood at 1:2, indicating underlying bearishness in the market. 

Globally, stocks rose to their highest in more than a month on Friday after a report suggested progress in resolving the trade dispute between the US and China. 



Expert-take:
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Domestic indices failed to absorb the rebound in global market as plunge in pharma stocks and weak rupee dragged down sentiment. Additionally, investors are looking forward to the fiscal path ahead of the government’s interim Budget next month, which added to volatility in 10-year bond yield. Global headwinds continue to dictate a rangebound movement in the market while any green shoots in quarterly earnings provide opportunity to accumulate.

Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking
Markets have been struggling in a range for over two and a half months and we expect this phase to end early next week. Indications are mixed from sectoral indices. Thus we reiterate our view to continue with stock specific trading approach. Participants should keep a close eye on global markets and earnings season for cues.

Satish Kumar, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking
All sectors except IT traded lower. Pharma stocks remained on top of the selling radar as sentiment got dented amid the corporate governance issue on Sun Pharma. Despite this, market made a smart recovery into the green in the late afternoon session mainly driven by accelerated buying in index heavyweights like Reliance, Wipro and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Market will keep a close eye on earnings and trade talk development on US-China in coming sessions."
22,2019-01-19,Asian Paints,"Markets crawled up on the back of global cues and some good corporate numbers during the week gone by.

Nonetheless, market breadth was not encouraging and participation was weak. While there seems to be a lot of optimism from a short- to medium-term perspective, but it is not supported by ground realities, especially for the universe of smallcap and midcap stocks, which are still languishing for want of buyers.

The market is unlikely to move higher till at least the first week of February when policies from both Union Budget and MPC will be known and are likely to give direction to the market. It remains to be seen whether the Budget will be pro-public or pro-corporations, and it will be an important trigger to determine the market’s next leg. 

Additionally, resolution of trade wars and US shutdown has impacted economy, but the same doesn’t reflect in stock prices. Sooner or later, stock prices will align with global realities.

In quarterly earnings, margins of big companies have taken a hit, be it Infosys, TCS, Reliance or D’Mart. But RIL has reported an 8.8 per cent increase in PAT for the quarter with robust growth in consumer business and Jio’s PAT, which rose 65 per cent. FMCG major HUL delivered double-digit volume growth and a 9 per cent rise in bottom line. Federal Bank and MCX delivered a 28 per cent and 124 per cent PAT growth, respectively.


Event of the Week
The Jet-Ethiad deal was yet another hot topic of the week, as Jet Airways had become a ticking bomb threatening to explode just like Kingfisher. Last three years’ numbers of Jet and Kingfisher were similar before Kingfisher’s degenerated into bankruptcy. Hopefully, this time due to IBC, the bankers will have an upper hand. But if a quick resolution isn’t arrived at soon, the shareholders will suffer the most.

Equity value of Jet is anyway already in the negative given the accumulated losses and a huge mountain of debt.


Technical Outlook
Nifty50 is facing strong resistance at 11,000 level. It is hovering near its 200 DMA and has seen a failed triangle breakout, which means there are higher chances of it falling further. Volatility is low, which indicates that Mr Market is readying for a move. Additionally, the oscillators have also turned neutral near zero. Traders must see whether the triangle breakout sustains or turns out to be a false alarm.

Waiting for a confirmation would be safer rather than be out guessing. The ongoing market correction is likely to continue, which will give traders false breakout signals. This is the time to avoid trading and sit on the sidelines till a clear trend emerges.




Expectations for the Week
Stock prices are likely to move sideways with a downward bias. Although they may rise abruptly but that should not be considered as a buying opportunity. An ideal buying situation would emerge when the worst of things happen and stock prices react negatively.

Currently, ground-level realities are tough, but stock prices are not reacting negatively. Also, Q3 earnings of companies such as Asian Paints, Kotak Bank, Biocon, Edelweiss, Yes Bank and Maruti are expected next week, which will keep the market on the tenterhooks. But in general, the market is expected to remain under pressure. Investors are advised to wait and watch rather than go bottom fishing.

The Nifty50 closed this week 1.03 per cent higher at 10,907."
23,2019-01-20,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Healthy macroeconomic numbers in terms of softer retail inflation and narrower trade deficit, along with improved global sentiment helped Indian equity benchmarks log decent gains last week. 

However, Dalal Street did witness bouts of choppiness during the week, as third quarter earnings failed to provide any decisive move to the market, and the weakness in rupee, following rise in global crude oil prices, continued to weigh on sentiment. 

Still, thanks to gains in select heavyweights, including Reliance Industries, headline index Sensex climbed about 377 points, or 1.05 per cent, to 36,386.60, while the NSE Nifty50 clocked a gain of 112 points, or 1.04 per cent, to 10,907, last week. 

Going into next week, corporate earnings, global sentiment, macro triggers and fund inflows will dictate market mood. 


Let's take a look at factors that will influence Dalal Street next week: 


Earnings pick up pace: Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Bharti Infratel, ITC, Ultratech Cement, YES Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, HDFC Standard Life Insurance and InterGlobe Aviation are among companies that will report their December quarter earnings this week. 


Global sentiment: US stocks rose last week, giving a fillip to their global peers, amid buzz that Sino-US trade tussle may see an amicable resolution soon. However, the road to a trade deal looked bumpy. On Saturday, a Bloomberg report suggested that the Donald Trump administration is preparing an executive order that could significantly restrict Chinese state-owned telecom companies from operating in the US over national security concerns. Global markets would hope such a move does not jeopardise the prospects of a trade deal between the two countries. 


The Brexit saga: After facing a crushing defeat on her Brexit deal, British Prime Minister Theresa May will present her new deal before the lawmakers for their approval. But, experts are skeptical that her plan, which has just minor modifications, will be cleared easily. As per Reuters, markets now reckon the March 29 deadline of leaving the European Union will be extended to give parliament more time to negotiate the manner of exit or even to organise a second referendum. Markets may have factored in the standoff on Brexit, the growing chaos may dent investor sentiment globally. 


China's GDP numbers: All eyes will be on China's fourth quarter GDP print as well as investment and retail sales for December. Weak factory output data and export data prompted China to announce fiscal stimulus measures. Now, another weak set of numbers may make investors run away from riskier equities, triggering a selloff in emerging markets. 


Crude's course: Oil prices are on an upward trajectory, underpinned by Opec-led supply cut. Opec on Friday issued a list of oil production cuts by its members and other major producers for six months starting on January 1 to boost confidence in its oil supply reduction pact, Reuters reported. If crude oil prices continue to rise, it will put pressure on the Indian currency, raising the risk of inflation. Market will certainly not take it lightly at a time when it is hoping a rate cut from the RBI in its next monetary policy meet just weeks away. 


Davos meet: The annual World Economic Forum in Davos is scheduled during January 22 to 25. Although experts are not expecting any major trigger for markets, it will surely remain in the limelight as trade dispute, Brexit and outlook on the global economy may heat up the Alpine meeting. However, the US President Donald Trump, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and British PM Theresa May will not be in Davos, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte will be there along with global political and business leaders and civil society figures to discuss the theme of this year's meet- the fourth industrial revolution. 


Technical outlook: The Nifty50 on Friday settled flat to form a small bearish candle on the daily chart. The index seems to be forming a multi-week Ending Diagonal, whose last leg is unfolding on the upside, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. 

“At this juncture, technical oscillators are looking mixed. Traders can retain their positive stance as long as Nifty sustains above the 10,800 level on a closing basis and look for a directional move to emerge on a close above 10,980 level,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in."

The Nifty50 finally managed to surpassed the 10,930 level on Monday, and gradually rallied towards the 10,987 mark. The index formed a bullish candle on the daily chart and managed to hold above 10,880-10,900 zone .

Now, till it holds above 10,850-10,880 area it can witness an up move towards 11,080 and then 11,176 levels, while on the downside, supports exist at 10,850 followed by 10,777.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,700, followed by 10,800, strike while maximum Call OI was at 11,000, followed by 11,200 strike. Put writing was seen at 10,900 followed by 11,000 strike, while Call unwinding was seen at all the immediate strike price.

Option band signifies a higher shift in trading range between 10,750 and 11,080 levels.

India VIX moved up sharply by 8.69 per cent to 18.06 level. Volatility has to cool down further to get a decisive range breakout.

Nifty Bank traded 27,400-27,600 range for most part of the session and formed a Doji Candle on daily scale, which suggests indecisiveness at higher levels. Now, it has to continue to hold above 27,350 to witness an up move towards 27,750 then 28,000, while immediate support exists at 27,250-27,150 zone.

Nifty futures closed positive higher by 0.34 per cent at 10,964 level. Built-up of long positions were seen in NIIT Tech, IGL, United Breweries and Asian Paints, while shorts were seen in Jubilant Foodworks, Idea, DCB Bank and HeroMoto Corp.

32,2019-01-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Losses in metal, bank and auto heavyweights amid weak global cues made domestic equity benchmarks snap five-session winning streak on Tuesday.

The market traded in the negative zone throughout the day, as gloom in global markets extended to the domestic bourses.

Emerging stocks and currencies slid, as fears of slowing global growth spooked investors and made them move towards safe haven assets.

Optimism stemming from third quarter earnings faded and market reacted to the global sentiment due to the absence of fresh decisive triggers back home.

Sensex closed with a cut of 134 points, or 0.37 per cent, at 36,444.64, while Nifty settled 39 points, or 0.36 per cent, lower at 10,922.75.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 0.09 per cent and 0.49 per cent, respectively.


We walk you through the highlights of Tuesday's session:

Who dragged my SensexHDFC twins, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Larsen & Toubro emerged as the top drag on Sensex. However, the pack of losers was led by Vedanta, down 3.50 per cent. It was followed by Tata Steel (down 3.13 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (down 3.08 per cent), HCl Tech (down 2.18 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 2 per cent).


Metals meltThe BSE Metal pack suffered a loss of 2.31 per cent, emerging as the top sectoral loser, on fall in shares of Jindal Steel (down 4.53 per cent), Vedanta (down 3.50 per cent), Tata Steel (down 3.13 per cent), Hindustan Zinc (down 2.76 per cent), JSW Steel (down 2.46 per cent), SAIL (down 2.23 per cent) and Hindalco (down 1.88 per cent). As per Reuters, base metals prices dropped across global markets with benchmark London copper extending a sharp drop from the previous session, after economic growth in top metals consumer China slowed to its weakest in 28 years.


Sun shines againNotching up gains for a second straight day, India’s largest drug maker Sun Pharma closed 4.95 per cent up at Rs 418.05 after the company clarified that it neither gave any loan nor guarantees to Suraksha Realty.


A dull Q3 showAsian Paints on Tuesday posted 14.60 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated profit at Rs 635.60 crore for the quarter ended December 31. Consolidated revenue of the company increased 24 per cent to Rs 5,293.99 crore in Q3FY19 over Rs 4,267.49 crore in Q3FY18. But the numbers failed to excite the market as the stock closed the day with a loss of 0.99 per cent at Rs 1,406.55 on the BSE.


In fast laneShares of TVS Motor closed 2.94 per cent up at Rs 553.85 after it reported a 15.57 per cent increase in standalone net profit at Rs 178.39 crore for the third quarter. Revenue from operations was at Rs 4,663.98 crore, up 26.09 per cent against Rs 3,698.67 crore on a yearly basis.


A volatile rideAfter surging almost 20 per cent in early trade, shares of Prabhat Dairy nosedived and closed the session with a loss of 14.29 per cent at Rs 79.75 on the BSE. The stock came off even as its Rs 1,700-crore stake sale deal was much bigger in value than the company’s total market capitalisation of around Rs 900 crore.


Ashok Leyland declinesShares of Ashok Leyland closed 2.92 per cent down at Rs 88 after global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Sell’ rating on the stock and also cut the target price to Rs 75 (Rs 85 earlier). India’s truck industry is currently in the fifth year of an up-cycle where historical upturns in the last four decades have lasted four years on average, said CLSA. The foreign brokerage expects competition to intensify in a downturn given Ashok’s improved ability to fight against Tata and the latter’s high focus on regaining its lost market share. 


Kotak firms up post Q3 nosShares of Kotak Mahindra Bank closed 1.92 per cent higher at Rs 1,291.60 as leading brokerages maintained their bullish stance on Kotak Mahindra Bank after the lender posted a 23 per cent rise in profit at Rs 1,291 crore for December quarter on higher net interest income.


Shining brightShares of Havells India jumped 4.95 per cent to Rs 711.40 even as the company reported a nominal rise of 0.67 per cent in standalone profit at Rs 195.67 crore. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 194.36 crore during the October-December quarter of the previous fiscal. Total income during the quarter under review stood at Rs 2,551.4 crore as against Rs 1,993.53 crore in the year-ago period.


151 stocks signal potential fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 151 counters on the BSE, indicating that these stocks may drop or extend their fall in coming sessions. Among the stocks with bearish crossovers were Prabhat Dairy, Praj Industries, Hindalco, ONGC, HDFC, 8K Miles Software and Grasim Industries.

On the other hand, 46 stocks, including TVS Motor, Havells India, Petronet LNG, Dabur India and Shalimar Paints, showed bullish crossovers on BSE.


Oversold and overbought stocksMomentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 37 stocks in the oversold zone on the BSE. Shares of Vivimed Labs, Arvind, Sadhana Nitro, Sandhar Technologies and Ashari Agencies entered into oversold territory.

29,2019-01-22,Asian Paints,"Jio is adding more fancy for Reliance rather than oil and gas segment which has a muted outlook for FY20, Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Motilal Oswal Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

What has changed for Reliance that in last two days it has added Rs 35,000-crore market cap?
Nothing as such. But the ongoing outlook for almost 28 crores of Jio subscribers is now turning positive. They are very much optimistic and the layout of the capex is still on; plus the outlook on the oil and gas sector, especially refining margin is very stable as is crude oil in terms of dollar.

Overall, Jio is adding more fancy for Reliance rather than oil and gas because the outlook seems to be muted for next financial year so far. One needs to watch out how it turns out in the second half. But Jio is the one which is providing the strong outlook.


I agree that Jio is looking strong but what came out in the numbers which has given a Rs 100 move to Reliance? They have not said anything new on Jio. Your institutional team also feels that Reliance is fairly valued.
Overall, it is fairly valued. Gross refining margins in dollar terms is $9.5-10.5. But the valuation front on the global comparison is the one where it is still quoting at a not so premium but slightly discounted price to global peers. That way we are comparing it and on the EV to EBITDA front, with the margin in place and profitability grew by 25% YoY to Rs 10,000 crore for first ever time in a quarter. That 25% growth rate is still sustaining and that is why the largest market-cap company is still available at a reasonable valuation.


Do you think the market would be convinced by Sun Pharma reactions to whistleblower allegations?
Prima facie, the way stock price has reacted from Friday and yesterday, it seems that prima facie it has not been taken as a positive, even on the clarification which needed to be made public before any third party raised issues. It will not be viewed so positively by the investors even after that clarity which is coming. It is not that 100% justification needs to be there and it is not available at this point in time. Investors would like to avoid further addition but would have preferred more clarification.


While we are expecting sequential margin recovery in Asian Paints, would a delayed festival season act as a dampener when it comes to volumes?
 
 
 
 The numbers for Asian Paints are due today and delayed festive season impact probably would be there. But crude prices were not so volatile and variation was 10% on YoY basis. If we compare it sequentially, it was not much. So volume growth needs to be watched out for. PAT numbers will not be so exciting. It will be plus/minus 3% to 5% on YoY basis. 

Overall, we believe that crude price fluctuation was not there and festive season was in November this time, but there is not going to be so much of difference because October, November both fall under Q3. We are expecting muted numbers from Asian Paints."

Emkay Global Financial Services sees a year-on-year growth of 14 per cent and 11 per cent in net sales and profit of Asian Paints. 

The brokerage house expects strong traction in domestic decorative paints to drive 11 per cent volume growth. It also estimated realisation growth of 3.5 per cent factoring in the recent price hike.

“Margins would recover QoQ on price hikes, but still will be lower YoY as a result of raw material price inflation,” the brokerage said in a report. 

ICICI Securities expects 10.80 per cent, 17 per cent and 12.20 per cent YoY jump in consolidated Ebitda, sales and profit after tax of the company. 

It further said high double-digit decorative paints volume growth would drive top line of Asian Paints whereas gross margin may contract by 133 basis points YoY due to elevated raw material costs. 

The cost was 0.33 per cent down at Rs 1,416 at around 9.45 am while the BSE Sensex dropped 136 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 36,442.

34,2019-01-23,Asian Paints,"Investors should look at increasing exposure to a whole range of consumption oriented companies not necessarily 
  
  
  just FMCG, Dipan Mehta, Portfolio Manager, Founder Director, Elixir Capital, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What is on your radar? Are you convinced that the slowdown in auto is just an aberration because if consumer companies are coming up with strong volume growth? 
Yes, of course. I would say that a lot of consumption-oriented companies, be it in FMCG, auto, building materials, home improvement or appliances, have all been increasing their end product prices by 3-8% on account of increase in input costs. 

And now that commodity prices have started to cool off, we are seeing a slight reduction in margins for consumer companies like Asian Paints or Havells India. But this is certain to get reversed over the next couple of quarters.

These are great tidings for consumption-oriented, domestic-focussed companies. The high valuation may act as a bit of a barrier but at corrections, investors should look at increasing exposure to a whole range of consumption oriented companies not necessarily just FMCG. There are many other sub-sections within the consumption space.


Why did Reliance add Rs 100 post numbers?
The quarter’s performance was very well received by the market. Now, there is a growing expectation that the telecom and retail businesses have reached scale and at some point of time, value unlocking will take place where minority shareholders will get shares of these two entities in the form of splitting of the company.

The last time that happened was when the two Ambani brothers parted ways. Tha twas a huge value unlocking opportunity from Reliance Industries when the other companies got divested. At that time also, it was telecom and some of the other minor businesses which got divested. Something similar will happen this time around and I think that should be a great value creating exercise. 

However, one should keep in mind that valuations are on the higher side for Reliance Industries and the size is just too huge for the company to keep on delivering significant double digit type of earnings growth rate. It is best to price in high single digit growth rate for the entire company as a whole on a consolidated basis and keeping that in mind I think it is more or less fully priced unless there are some surprises on the performance front. 


What do you make of the consumption story going forward? So far, we have good numbers and the demand outlook remains quite intact. Do you believe that that will be the case for all the consumer majors including ITC?
ITC is in a different bracket and it is not really an FMCG company, it is a tobacco company and it has got some FMCG and hotel and other businesses. But all these have a very small contribution to the overall profitability and the earnings of the company. Tobacco broadly is a pretty much mature segment. The volume growth rates are low single digits and it is hampered by a lot of government taxation and there are other challenges as well in terms of imports of cigarettes, the indirect channel. So I am not that positive on ITC and have not been so for many years. The stock has underperformed to that extent. But ITC could have a trading bounce based on results, base effect may be favourable and you could have a few positive numbers coming through from their other divisions.

By and large, real FMCG companies like HUL, Britannia, Godrej Consumer and Jyothy Laboratories are the companies where maximum value will get created going forward. I would like to focus on those pure play FMCG companies rather than ITC.


But on the valuation front, ITC is available at a sharp or a steep discount to what other companies are commanding. Post GST, the uncertainty on tax front has got sorted out.
That is true but the underlying growth is not there in cigarette consumption. While we are extremely bullish on liquor companies and breweries, the same kind of growth rates do not get translated into tobacco.

It could be because of sort of regulations, the warnings which have been given, demographic trends but the underlying volume of its largest business remains extremely low single digit.

It is not that the market is now classifying it as a FMCG company because FMCG companies are trading at 50 times plus and ITC is available at a 40% discount as far as PE multiples are concerned. And the real difference is because it is not truly an FMCG company, it is a tobacco company and its growth rate is amongst the worst as far the consumption oriented business is concerned. 

Unfortunately, despite decades of trying to diversify away from tobacco, the company management has not been able to do so and even up to this point of time, the FMCG business does not contribute significantly to its bottom line, the hotel business has been languishing and the agro business also has not shown consistent growth. Compare ITC’s FMCG business to Godrej Consumers or Britannia’s FMCG business or Jyothy Laboratories or Nestle. Those companies have grown in size and scale and improved on their operating profit margins and created fabulous brands and value for their shareholder. On the other hand, ITC’s FMCG business has just about been trying to breakeven. Their return on investment is also amongst the lowest in the industry and that is the reason for a kind of a long-term avoid on ITC. 

The stock could see a trading bounce and go up by 25-30%. But it is not a great long term story compounding story."
39,2019-01-24,Asian Paints,"Phillip Capital (India) has a buy call on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,575.

The current market price of Asian Paints is Rs 1,405.70.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Asian Paints price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage-
Volume growth of 20 per cent+ was pretty impressive and was much ahead of consensus expectations, which led operating performance beat on all fronts. APNT delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth on the back of 1) strong festive season, 2) GST reduction improving price competitiveness vs unorganized sector and 3) premiumization trends sustaining. Management highlighted performance was broad-based across segments/regions.

We expect healthy domestic demand to continue at least for next couple of quarters on the back of market share gains across segments (particularly distemper) on account of improved price competitiveness vs unorganized sector and higher fiscal spending ahead of general elections, 2019 shall aids growth. However, management cautioned that consumer demand environment remains uncertain ahead of General election.

Industrial coatings (particularly automotive coatings) continue to remain subdued on back of weak auto sales. Challenging macroeconomic environment (Egypt, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh), high RM costs (APNT lacks pricing power since it is not a leader in most of the markets) and partial availability of forex to buy raw materials (Ethiopia) has been denting International business performance. We expect performance for Industrial and International business to improve in FY20 as pre-buying ahead of BS-VI Implementation (from FY21 onwards will aid auto demand) and RM correction coupled with price hikes in foreign markets are likely to improve operating performance respectively.

We increase our EPS estimates for FY20-21 each by 6 per cent as most of the concerns relating to input cost inflation (crude down 27 per cent from its recent peak) are behind us and improving demand scenario. Our optimism is based on: (1) improving consumer sentiment, (2) reducing re-painting cycle, (3) focus on distribution expansion in tier 2/3 cities, and (4) government focus on creating physical/social infrastructure in rural areas ahead of 2019 general elections shall give a boost to volume growth. We believe that the recent reduction in GST rates on paints to 18 per cent from 28 per cent shall improve the organised sector’s competitiveness and accelerate the process of premiumization for the organized paint industry. We maintain BUY and increased our target price to Rs 1,575 (45x FY21 EPS) vs Rs 1,430 (45x Dec-20 EPS)."
35,2019-01-24,Asian Paints,"Brokerages have retained their bullish view on Asian Paints following its December quarter result, which saw the company surprising the Street on the volume growth front which grew in double digits. Target prices have been revised up by 7-34 per cent, with many brokerages rolling forward valuations.

Asian Paints on Tuesday posted a 14.6 per cent increase in consolidated profit from the year ago level at Rs 635.6 crore. Consolidated revenue increased 24 per cent to Rs 5,293.99 crore.

Shares of Asian Paints ended down 0.7 per cent at Rs 1,397.10 after gaining as much as 1.7 per cent intraday. The stock has gained 22.7 per cent in the last three months.

Macquarie, which revised up target price the most among brokerages, also upgraded the stock to 'outperform' from 'neutral'.

Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Jefferies, Kotak Institutional Equities, and Morgan Stanley revised target price higher by 7-25 per cent. CLSA retained the ‘outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,565. Both Jefferies and HSBC retained ‘buy’ ratings and target price at Rs 1,600.



“Asian Paints reported one of the strongest quarters in eight years with volume growth of 20 per cent YoY, much above our and consensus estimate of 14 per cent,"" said Deutsche Bank.

“Although APNT’s (Asian Paints) robust volume growth of 20 per cent in 3QFY19 was largely driven by festive sales, its four-quarter moving average volume increased to 13 per cent YoY, much above the industry growth of 10 per cent YoY,” the bank added.

Morgan Stanley said price hikes and the benign input cost environment increase the visibility of over 20 per cent earnings growth for FY20-FY21.

Some brokerages such as Citi, Kotak Institutional and Credit Suisse have increased target prices but retained ‘neutral’ or ‘reduce’ rating. “We believe medium-term upsides are well reflected in stock valuations, particularly post the run-up in the last 3 months,"" said Citigroup."

38,2019-01-24,Asian Paints,"Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now that one should look at 
  

 Bharti Airtel, Bharat Forge, Ujjivan and IDFC Bank First now. Edited excerpts:

The extraordinary volume growth reported by FMCG companies have been surprising. If FMCG companies are reporting such strong set of numbers, why are auto companies suffering?
It is just a one-month or a two-month hiatus since there was this talk of GST deadlocks and secondly, there was some problem with insurance premium and so on. But it is something which had a huge base effect and that is causing the slowdown. 

However, like you rightly pointed out, the consumer sector is driving growth and yesterday for the first time in almost one year, ITC showed a 10% growth on cigarette volumes. So, yes volumes are back and it is just a matter of time before auto is be up and running. 

Yesterday TVS Motors results were way ahead of the Street. The pessimism is overdone. If you are a slightly longer term investor and are looking for good bargains, then you are getting a whole hog of those in the autos. I would be relatively bullish after the budget and the other combined twin event of the election which could spur a lot of growth on the rural side, where again autos would be the indirect beneficiary.


What are some of your top bets? We know you are big on paints.
Yes, we have been very bullish on Asian Paints all the way from Rs 1,150 and we think that this is a unique stock where the market share decorative painting is getting stronger. They have indicated that the best effect of the price rise will also be met within this quarter. 

We have been bullish on Reliance, Asian Paints, Axis Bank and also a midcap called Mindtree at around Rs 800 level. It has seen a lot of interest given that L&T Tech is now trying to buy a stake. A whole host of stocks have done well. One of my top picks is ITC and I can reiterate that yesterday’s fall should be a buying opportunity. The cigarette volumes have pleasantly surprised on the upside and once we get a price hike, other businesses which are doing exceeding well will add up. So ITC becomes a star for 2019.


When old timers real performers start selling out some of the core holdings in and around quality names, one wonders why. Is this redemption or this is an indication that they are looking at changing their portfolio orientation?
I cannot speak for the fund but definitely some churning may be on the cards. It could be some sort of lightening of positioning ahead of valuations and so on. I cannot comment on certain stocks because they are under our institutional coverage. 

Look at Airtel, Sunil Bharti Mittal says the worst of pricing maybe over, it is time for prices to come back. They are divesting a lot of their assets to improve return on equity. Look at Bharat Forge which is now a global player and where again you have seen valuation weaken because of the North American crisis. Look at Ujjivan where again you have seen very strong NIMs and asset quality improvement. Look at IDFC Bank First, again a marquee idea, where Vaidyanathan is going to lead from the front. 

So, there is a whole host of sectors where blue chips or midcaps can emerge as huge wealth creators and that could be the churn which is going on. We know that impact cost in some of the marquee names have a huge effect on entry and exit and hence the market will be looking at some of the weakness getting prolonged.

We are relatively very bullish on some of these ideas. Davos has told us that a couple of large entrepreneurs are seeing extreme bullish signs in the near future."
40,2019-01-24,Asian Paints,"The circumstances are such that a rate cut is the most likely outcome in RBI's February policy review, Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, told ETNow. His advice: Invest in companies where accounts are clean, the management is competent and are generally well run. Edited excerpts:


For me, the surprise this earning season is not IT and banks, it is actually consumer names. Double digit volume growth from ITC, Asian Paints and again from HUL. Autos are slowing down, but consumer companies are doing exceptionally well.

It's a question of consumption not being financed by borrowing. Obviously for auto and to some extent electrical items, consumption is financed by borrowing. Wherever consumption is not financed by borrowing, I think things are in a pretty reasonable shape in our country. FMCG is an obvious beneficiary. I would even say for things like apparel, you can see volumes are brisk. There is enough juice in the economy. Those who do not need to borrow money for small ticket consumption are going out there and buying things and hence, the bumper FMCG numbers.


Do you think at a time like this, when you already have high price consumer names delivering that one on the back of growth, visibility continues to invest more in those stocks versus the investment-led themes where again there is a bit of uncertainty. The Budget push is expected to drive interest in those stocks or themes as well. But given the volatility the portfolios might face, it is better and safer to still be with the high price names that are delivering.

With the obsession about valuations, we might get the wrong end of the story here. Begin by asking yourselves what is the outlook for India over the next one or two years. The outlook is of an economy which is decelerating since Q1 where cost of capital is gradually inching up even if the RBI cuts rates in February. Generally, cost of capital, the 10-year bond yield and the 3-month CP are pushing upwards amid a currency which will stay with the 70 handle potentially pushed towards 75. 

That is the broad picture for the next one or two years and I am not so sure elections really are that relevant in this picture. Whichever government wins, you end up with this gradual economic deceleration due to rising cost of capital and a weak currency. In that context, export-oriented sectors, well-run private banks, small-ticked consumption, FMCG consumption, to some extent elements of consumption such as apparel where you do not have to borrow to buy, are in a good place to be. 

We will see a revival in the capex sector one day, but that revival in the capex sector comes after the election and that comes after there is some sign that cost of capital might start trending down in our country. As yet, there is not any sign that cost of capital in India will suddenly start trending down.


Time and again, you have made a case that you should buy exporters. As of now, IT companies are not admitting that there is a problem. But pharma companies have started admitting that the generic pricing power pressure is here to stay. Against the backdrop of a global slowdown, a little bit of pricing power going away for key sectors like pharma, what happens to exporters as a category? 

There are two elements to consider. Yes, you are right. The global economy is not sort of roaring away anywhere. If anything, global growth is decelerating and you are right in highlighting that. What is clear, however, is our export sector is very currency sensitive. We do not really have a very tech heavy export sector. Even our IT services are actually low tech exports. We have already seen in the last couple of quarters the benefits of the currency slide help the IT companies. 

Pharma companies with say Dr Reddy’s, the Vanguard are already showing signs of finding their former competitive spirit. If the rupee does not slide which it did not, that punishes Indian pharma globally. India pharma is a price sensitive export and the rupee staying at Rs 64-65 for four years was deeply damaging for Indian pharma. The slide to 71 of the rupee will help pharma. 

There are first signs that help will come through. Domestic demand for pharma obviously continues to hold up pretty well, given FDA's attack on Indian pharma. There is long overdue revival there. Beyond that, beyond IT and pharma, it is selective smaller companies say Balkrishna Industries and LG Equipment where you could see competitive Indian company with world class products benefiting from a weak rupee. IT's and pharma's front line names will benefit from the slide in the rupee. IT benefits are already evident. Pharma benefits will come.


Address all the curious questions which haunted the stock on corporate governance or once bitten twice shy investors will not come back in a hurry.

Well, corporate governance in India is not really a sector-specific problem, unfortunately. For decades now, minority shareholders have borne the brunt of the fact that promoters are able to get away with doing things which could not have been possible in other countries.

That remains one of the big issues in Indian investing. Which is why for as long as I have been on your channel, I have emphasised that invest in companies where the accounts are clean, the management is competent and is generally a well run high quality company. Regardless of the sector, look for comfort on governance and accounts because it does not matter what the guy is making, what the promoter is making. If he wants to steal money from you, you are not going to make any money buying those shares.


Advocating a 50 bps rate cut by the RBI in one shot would mean that would be a complete U-turn in a matter of about 4-5 months.

I am not advocating that the RBI should cut rates, my reckoning is that the RBI will cut rates given everything that has transpired in the final six months of 2018. It will be surprising if we do not see some degree of easing from the RBI. 

I am not so sure cutting rates by 25 bps is going to bring some enormous relief to the Indian economy at this juncture because what is happening is the money market is tightening up as risk aversion kicks in both in the 10-year bond yield. In the short term money market, you can see things are tightening up, FII investors in the bond market and domestic investors in the bond market are becoming more apprehensive and in that context, the central bank cutting by 25 bps will not have a huge impact on the economy.

But the circumstances are such that a rate cut looks like the most likely outcome in the February policy review.


I do not have any data to prove that there is a turn in insurance or ULIP, but is this something which markets are not prepared for because now we are taking domestic liquidity for granted. The general view on Street is that domestic institutional investor will always get money, they will never get redemptions and ULIP money is permanent?

Well I think, it is ULIP or indeed the MF flows. December was a wake-up call for everybody and I agree with you that the notion that the Indian retail investor will keep pumping money into MFs or ULIPs. I think the notion has got overplayed a little bit. 

Yes, there is a structural trend towards financialisation in our country as people realise that putting their life savings in real estate and gold is not a particularly clever idea but obviously that structural trend will have rounded cycles and to that extent, a lot of people did enter the stock market because they had belief in Prime Minister Modi. 

As we approach the elections, that sort of investment sentiment around a specific political personality is obviously bound to be shaky. 2019 could well be the year where we realise that yes, there is a structural trend towards financialisation but it does not mean it is a one way bet of high inflows into MFs and ULIPs month after month.


What is your sense on the range for the market into the elections? I know the immediate focus is the Budget, but if you take the bird’s eye-view, you scan through CY2019, how would you divide the first half performance versus the second half?

I will stick to what I have been saying on your channel for the last 12 months or so. Fair value for the Nifty is around 9,500, given the still weak earnings outlook. 

Whether we get to that number in the run-up to the election or say after the July budget, which I think will be a contractionary budget regardless of which government is in power, is a slightly secondary question, what it suggests is that we have a market which is 10-15 per cent overvalued. Therefore, buying the market in totality I do not think is a particularly good idea at this juncture. 

You are better off doing selective buying of high quality companies, the consistent compounders, clean, well run companies. If you want to play sectors, then play the sectors which can thrive in a weak economy like IT, pharma, small ticket consumption and private sector banks."
42,2019-01-25,Asian Paints,"No broad-based sharp uptick in private capex cycle is seen in foreseeable future, Gautam Chhaochharia, Head of 
  
  
  India Research, UBS Securities, tells ET Now. At a top-down sector level, industrials, infrastructure midcaps are a total avoid.Edited excerpts:


The new buzz on the town is that whenever there is a new CEO in a private bank, the stock gets rerated. We saw that happen to Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and now Yes Bank. From an institutional investor standpoint, should one buy private banks now because the PSU banks are losing market share and the top three private banks now have new CEOs?
We have been overweight on private corporate banks and we still remain overweight there. CEO change is just one factor, the fundamental factors matter a lot more. Within the broader private corporate banks, we are emphasising those banks which have a retail liability franchise. 

So, while we are overweight in the overall space, the focus is on the ones which have retail liability franchise. The banks which do not really have a retail liability franchise are more wholesale funded in our view and remain vulnerable. That is the differentiation we are emphasising to investors and one has to look at what is priced in into individual stocks etc.


Are you bullish, are you bearish, are you in a wait-and-watch mode? What is your house view for 2019?
We are still cautious on the broader markets. We have looked at different scenarios of markets post elections. We have also analysed and tried to see what kind of policy environment will be there post elections in different scenarios and then look at what the ranges could be in that environment.

Looking at those scenarios, the risk reward still seems unattractive. Our base case for Nifty is 10,000 by December 2019 which suggests about 7-8% downside from the current levels. The risk-reward is still not supportive for us to get constructive and there are two simple reasons for that; first, the first half of the year is obviously the politics part which will keep uncertainty high; second, looking at various policy options, we are seeing an increase in populism narrative ahead of elections. It could also mean the policy space is constrained for the first six to 12 months for any new government to really kickstart the economy. 

So, that is the other thing to keep an eye out on from a market’s perspective. And keeping both in mind, we would also remember the valuations. While the markets have corrected a bit, the de-rating has not been that dramatic at the Nifty level, though we have seen some de-rating at the midcap level. That keeps us cautious on the markets here.


The word on the street is populism and how the budget is likely to be doled out this time around. How do you think the overall political scenario is going to impact the equity markets? What are your expectations?
This is likely to be a vote-on-account as it always has been because irrespective of whatever the budget talks about, it is a finance bill. It has to be passed by the parliament, but obviously the government can talk about the policy scenarios going ahead. So, they could talk about what they might do post the elections but largely it will be a vote on account. 

Secondly, the political scenario as we said is uncertain as of now. We do not know what will happen, but it is important to think about how markets react to different government formation scenarios. I will give you two simple examples; In the last four, four-and-a-half years, we have seen earnings growth being muted, But the markets have rerated strongly and have done very well because the narrative on policy, reforms, macro stability has been very strong and positive for the markets.

In the late ‘90s, during the Third Front government, the policy was actually fine. They did not really do anything stupid on fiscal deficit. The reforms trajectory was largely continued. We had some bold tax measures also, but the Indian markets derated and underperformed the regional market because the markets worried about uncertainty on both political as well as policy part. So that narrative also is relevant. What kind of government we get post election, may or may not necessarily mean a dramatic shift in the real policy environment but the market sentiment and narrative may get hurt depending on who forms the government. Therefore, that matters for the markets.


We talk about high valuations in FMCG companies, about overcrowded trades in some of the consumer staple stocks. Looking at the volume growth, 10% for HUL on that large base, 20% for Asian Paints on that large base, 7-8% from ITC which is now a behemoth and also in the FMCG space, it just makes me wonder whether it is time to remain bearish on staples? They may be expensive but that is where the growth is?
So again, valuation reflects the lack of options in the broader markets. While we still have strong inflows and liquidity and this is a phenomenon globally, not just in India. 

Having said that, the volume uptick in staples has not been a surprise at least to us. Our evidence lab work, in the middle of the last year ahead of the festive season had suggested that while we might see volume disappointments in automobiles and the staples, we should see an uptick as volume trajectory normalises for most of the companies. But one to be stock selective and not take a broad-based staples approach. The focus on rural India from the government side has been inching up over the last year, year-and-a-half so that is also possibly helping the staples deliver good volumes.


Do you think FY20 would be a better earnings year for corporate India than what we have seen in FY19? 
Earnings obviously matter because returns are a mix of earnings and multiples. When we talk about narrative, it hurts multiples negatively and obviously theoretically, earnings can make up for that but FY20 will definitely be a better year than last six years. As for FY19, for corporate India and for the Nifty, it will be back to double digit earnings growth finally. We are forecasting top down around 15-16% growth for the Nifty but again, a large part of it would be driven by normalisation in the financials NPL cycle. 

If we strip out the financials NPL driven recovery, then the underlying growth is still in single digits. Optically, it will be good for the markets but even at 15-16%, we will see roughly 9% cut to street estimates. So earnings cuts will still be quite sharp in the next few months but at a top down level, it would still be supportive for the markets.


What is you view on the overall capital goods space? Could we see the overall private capex cycle benefitting a lot of capital goods companies in the quarter? Do you expect some more reforms doled out in the upcoming budget which could benefit this space
So, that is one sector where we have a contrarian view. We do not see any uptick of a private capex cycle. Small uptick of a low base, normalisation yes but no beginning of a private capex cycle as such. 

When the populism narrative is rising ahead of elections, the space left for helping capex obviously gets constrained. We are already seeing signs of that in various government infrastructure initiatives already. 

Secondly, our capex analyst has done some interesting bottom-up work, which suggests that the signs of capex recovery either in terms of capacity utilisation, news flow or commentary by corporates actually represents roughly 20% of private capex. 

So if you break up private capex into different sectors, roughly 20% of that is likely to see an uptick and roughly 50% to 60% of the private capex is in sectors where we do not see any visibility of capex cycle recovering anytime soon. So yes, the 20% will help optically private capex coming off from a low base to recover a bit, but no broad-based sharp uptick in private capex cycle is seen in the foreseeable future.


Fundamentally what could go wrong this year? 
Fundamentally, it is not elections but the populist narrative going into elections that could become overbearing and take away the policy space. We have already seen parties talking about pan-India farm loan waivers, other doles, etc. All of this could help or may not help politically but it definitely means the space left for policymakers to drive a stronger economic recovery post election becomes constrained. 

That is really a worrying point from my perspective for markets because otherwise India was quite well set post elections. All the pain of GST, DeMo is behind us. The banking sector finally seems to be coming back on track and would have been supportive of growth. If we had a conducive policy environment post elections, we could have seen at least some form of cyclical recovery in India but this populism narrative is a dampener and could dampen that recovery for the first year for the government at least.


How should investors approach the broader end of the market? Should one go stock specific in mid and smallcaps?
Absolutely. As an asset class, we still remain underweight on midcaps just like last year because while we have seen valuations correct, relative valuations of midcaps to largecaps do not really give us comfort enough to jump in at this level. Even if we strip out the loss-making small and midcaps, related to largecaps, they remain more expensive than they were in 2007-08. So, risk-reward is still not attractive for the broader asset class of small and midcaps. But yes, stock specific opportunities are there definitely.


What would you avoid in this market? What are the themes that you would be bearish on or underweight on?
We are underweight in general cyclicals, given the policy space being constrained and the uncertainty around the elections which includes capex, industrials, etc. Definitely we are underweight midcaps and still avoid them. There the risk reward is still not attractive. Also, while we have neutral stance on various sectors like autos, etc, there are enough stocks there where the correction or derating has not happened enough or we do not see any visibility of recovery to get positive yet, At a top-down sector level, avoid industrials, infrastructure midcaps."
41,2019-01-25,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: Several companies catering to retail consumers have reported higher sales volume growth for the December 2018 quarter reflecting a sustained demand across various segments of consumption.

Asian Paints, Kajaria Ceramics, Reliance Retail, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Consumer Care, and Interglobe Aviation are some of the prominent companies that have shown strong volume growth. In addition, some of the companies increased product prices by 2-5 per cent sequentially.

Asian Paints, which commands over half of the market share in the paints business, recorded volume growth of 20 per cent. This was not only better than the 14 per cent growth estimated by analysts but also the strongest in any of the quarters in eight years. The festive demand during Q3 and reduction in GST rates on paints were key growth factors. It hiked prices by 7.3 per cent in the past nine months.



In the building-products segment, Kajaria Ceramics posted volume growth of 16 per cent, the highest in the last 16 quarters. The company’s management expects double-digit growth to continue in the coming quarters. It hiked prices of ceramic tiles by 2-3 per cent.

The passenger growth of Interglobe, India’s largest aviation company, was above 20 per cent for the fourth consecutive quarter. Its average ticket prices improved by 6 per cent year-on-year to ?4,176, the highest rate in five quarters. The company has guided for 30 per cent capacity addition in the March 2019 quarter. Its capacity in terms of available seat kilometres rose by 29 per cent and 33 per cent in the September and the December quarter.

HUL recorded double-digit volume growth for the fifth consecutive quarter supported by rural growth, which was 1.3 times the growth in urban markets. Its average realisation grew by 3.8 per cent year-on-year. Bajaj Consumer Care reported volume growth of 9.4 per cent in almond hair oil segment, the highest in the last 15 quarters.

The volume momentum in consumer goods has also resulted in advertisement growth of media companies. For example, Zee Entertainment’s advertisement growth was 22 per cent in Q3. Nearly 60 per cent of ads came from the consumer oriented companies.

Reliance Retail, the country’s largest retailer by revenue, reported 89 per cent growth in revenue for the December quarter and 108 per cent growth in the past nine months.

The festive season sales and new store openings resulted in high revenue growth and its operating area rose by 42 per cent to 20.6 million square feet in the first nine months of FY19."
43,2019-01-26,Asian Paints,"The domestic equity market continued its whipsaw movement with a downward bias and shallow depth during the week gone by.

Secular sectors like FMCG have delivered good numbers, but cyclicals have disappointed the market.

Moreover, retail players have surprised everyone by delivering double-digit growth. Organised players have indeed gained at the cost of SMEs and MSMEs, which can be seen from their quarterly numbers.

This was also the vindication that GST and demonetisation have impacted a large population, which is also what is worrying the government since elections are around the corner. Hopefully, the Union Budget next week will assuage such concerns of the middle class. However, being a populist Budget, it might not be welcomed by the market given the effect it might have on corporate profitability. Nonetheless, all eyes will be on it for clarity on policy initiatives.

The political fever is hitting a high day after day, wherein economics has taken a back seat in all the decision-making processes of the government, which will further keep the market under pressure. In addition, very little has come out on the efforts to settle the trade dispute between the US and China, which has cast doubt on the resolution.


Events of the week
Uncertainty is at last over on YES Bank’s CEO issue with Ravneet Gill taking over the reins by March 1, 2019. This will not only provide stability to the lender’s share price, but will also be welcomed by market participants. Whenever such changes have occurred in the past, like in the case of Jubilant FoodWorks, SpiceJet, the market has always rewarded the stock and, hopefully, YES Bank too will get the same treatment.

On the earnings front, Asian Paints stole the show with a 14.6 per cent increase in PAT. Indigo reported a 75 per cent drop in bottomline. Ultratech Cement with a 15 per cent de-growth in PAT and ITC posting a mere 3.9 per cent growth in PAT disappointed!


Technical Outlook
After a failed attempt to move higher, Nifty50 has now given a bearish signal by penetrating the triangle on the lower side. The indecisiveness of past few weeks seems to have been resolved and it is expected that prices would head lower steadily. However, a break below the 10,650 on the Nifty50 would further confirm much lower prices with the 10,300 level on the Nifty being a possible scenario.

Sell on rise should be the strategy for traders. Individual shorts can be initiated on stocks that have slipped below their 100-day moving averages.

Expectations for the Week
Mr Market is overcrowded with a lot of uncertainties given the global geo-political scenario, little clarity on the US-China trade settlement, EU slowdown, indecisiveness over BREXIT, US government shutdown and the domestic political conundrum, which will certainly scare away the bulls. Due to these uncertainties, the bulls are not going to commit money in a big way, which will keep the indices in the negative or sideways trading zone. Next week’s Interim Budget and, thereafter, the monetary policy will give provide further clarity to investors.

Currently, the market has taken a negative stance wherein the velocity is expected to remain muted. Investors should stay on the sidelines but keep money ready for deployment on any panic.

The Nifty50 closed the week 1.16 per cent lower at 10,870."
47,2019-01-28,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Index heavyweights played spoilsport on Dalal Street on Monday, dragging the benchmarks lower by over a per cent lower. This was the second day of fall for the key indices.

Markets shrugged off favourable macro cues in the form of plunging crude oil prices and a strengthening rupee. Other Asian and European peers too slipped ahead of the crucial US-China trade talks and Federal Reserve's policy meeting.

The BSE Sensex shut shop with a loss of 369 points, 1.02 per cent, at 35,657 while the NSE Nifty came off 119 points to settle at 10,661.

Market at a glance:


Who moved the Sensex?
Among Sensex stocks, only seven advanced while 23 slipped. TCS was the top gainer, rising 2 per cent. Coal India, L&T, Power Grid and Asian Paints followed. YES Bank was the top index drag, falling 5.46 per cent. Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Hero MotoCorp and Sun Pharma slipped up to 5.40 per cent.


IL&FS fears still persist
Most of the financial stocks bled on fears of continuing exposure to IL&FS. Even housing finance companies witnessed a similar fate, with Deewan Housing Finance slipping 11.64 per cent. 


Canara profit soared, but stock fell
Canara Bank posted a 152 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 318 crore for the December quarter as against Rs 126 crore reported in the corresponding quarter year ago. However, the stock slipped 5.23 per cent in today's session.


ZEE Entertainment rebounds
The shares of ZEE Entertainment rebounded today after the company said it has reached a deal with lenders on pledged shares. The company said 96-97 per cent of the lenders have agreed not to invoke shares if the shares fall further. After the agreement, the company has not pledged further shares as collateral after Friday’s sharp fall, said CEO Punit Goenka said in an investor call. The stock closed the session 16.64 per cent higher.


Mid, smallcaps have a sob story
Midcaps and smallcaps shed nearly 2 per cent in today's session and underperformed the benchmark Sensex. Midcap index closed 1.84 per cent lower while smallcap index was down 1.99 per cent.


Sectoral view
Basic materials, healthcare and finance each shed over 2 per cent. Only IT and teck managed to close in the green today. 


Factors behind the fall


Weak global markets
Major European bourses fell, mirroring a retreat for Asian stocks as concerns over Chinese growth outweighed any boost from the tentative end to the US government shutdown late last week. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul all losing ground, according to Reuters. 


Crucial US-China trade talk
The crucial US-China trade talks are scheduled to take place later in the week and the investors have assumed cautious positions until any further announcement. 


Financial stocks bleed
Financials and bank stocks plunged the most today as fears of IL&FS default continue to plague market. IB Ventures was the worst drag in the NSE Financials index while all stocks ended in the red in the Nifty private bank index. 


Poor Q3 show
The December quarter earnings failed to impress investors and this acted as one of the major forces behind a dent in investor sentiment. Among key results, HDFC, Axis Bank, HCL Tech, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv are among top companies expected to report quarterly numbers.


Expert-take:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 
""Market slid below 10,700 mark as uncertainty over global trade negotiation and US Fed policy later this week added volatility. Any progress in US-China trade deal and a dovish view from FOMC meet amid global growth concern may provide respite to the investor’s dilemma. Additionally, weak set of earnings from auto major and selling in banks marked the tone of domestic indices.""

Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking
""Domestic benchmarks opened on a negative note with the market breadth in favour of the sellers. A majority of the sector indices were trading in the red while mid-cap and small-cap shares underperformed its larger peer. Market breadth was in the ratio of 1:4 in favor of the sellers and the market ended 1% lower. The rupee appreciated against the dollar as crude prices declined by 1.8 per cent to trade at $60.5 per barrel. The upcoming week will be crucial because of the Budget presentation, US Fed policy meet and the resumption in the US-China trade talks.""

Viral Berawala, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund
""Global markets sold post comments by the US president that another shutdown is an option if agreement with Democrats is not reached. Indian markets also reacted to this negative cues with all sectoral indices in the red with Nifty Pharma being the biggest loser followed by Bank Nifty. Markets are also worried about the government straying from its fiscal consolidation path in the interim Budget."""

49,2019-01-29,Asian Paints,"India's main stock indices have remained resilient compared to many other markets since last Union Budget but that does not paint the real picture. Beneath the surface, there has been a dent on investor wealth.

Indian companies excluding top 10 stocks have lost whopping Rs 23.22 lakh crore or 19% of the market capitalisation due to macro-economic uncertainties, US-China trade war and expensive valuations. In the 50-share Nifty, 26 stocks are currently trading 20% below their 52 week highs. When an index falls 20% continuously, it is said to be in a bear phase. Again 32 of the Nifty 50 stocks are currently trading below their 200 day moving averages.

“There is still demand for high quality large-cap stocks though their valuations are expensive, but others are in bear market especially mid and small-cap stocks” said Sanjiv Prasad, senior executive director, Kotak Institutional Equities. “Till we get some clarity on domestic macro and political uncertainties and there is some convergences in multiple, this trend will continue” he added.

Three stocks Maruti Suzuki, Indian Oil and ONGC lost between Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 86,000 crore each in market cap in the last one year. Other big companies such as Coal India, Bhartil Airtel, Vendata and ONGC have seen erosion of market cap between Rs 45,000 crore and Rs 75,000 crore since February 1, 2018.

Rampant selling seen from the foreign institutional has been one of the major reasons for the underperformance of the large section of stocks. FIIs sold nearly Rs 36,000 crore worth of Indian equities in 2018.

 “We are not completely under the bear grip, but yes investors have lost money in the last one year because of various uncertainties both from domestic as well as from global factors” said Raamdeo Agrawal, joint MD, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “Only few stocks are performing which holding back indices and this trend would continue till earnings across the sectors bounce back”

Stocks such as Reliance, TCS, HUL, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserve, Asian Paints and Wirpo contributed nearly Rs 6.63 lakh crore to the market capitalisation since February 1 last year. But for these gains, the benchmark indices would have probably in a bear market.

The Sensex and Nifty have lost 1% and 3% respectively in the last one year compared to 18% fall in MSCI Emerging Market Index. During year 2016 and 2017, Indian benchmark rallied 30%.

“The surge in the market seen through 2017 was based on hope, not fundamentals. The expectations reached such staggering levels that when they were not met, things came crashing down” said Raamdeo Agrawal."
48,2019-01-29,Asian Paints,"The effect of a crash in the Zee group companies, including Zee Entertainment and Dish TV shares, was visible in the stocks of companies where promoters have pledged their holdings. Zee Entertainment and Dish TV lost nearly 30 per cent on Friday due to the sale of the pledged promoter shares in Dish TV.

The biggest losers on Monday were the shares of Adani Group companies – Adani Power and Adani Ports and SEZ. Promoter holdings across Adani group companies are pledged. A high debt in the group companies led to panic in the two group company shares, which fell 19 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. Shares of Indiabulls group companies – Indiabulls Real Estate and Indiabulls Housing Finance, Reliance ADAG group companies and DHFL reported similar falls. Shares of these companies were down 5 per cent to 12 per cent.



In some cases, the promoters have raised money in the unlisted holding companies through which they hold shares of the listed companies. The underlying collateral is mostly the shares of the listed companies. Any likelihood of the holding company not able to meet its debt obligations may lead to selloff in the counters of the listed companies. For instance, Wadhawan Global Capital, Cyquator and Geetanjali Trading and Investments the holding companies of DHFL, Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints, respectively, have raised money from mutual funds."
50,2019-01-30,Asian Paints,"If investors on Dalal Street are jittery about share pledges, they have good reasons to be so. India Inc promoters had shares worth Rs 2.50 lakh crore pledged with their lenders at the end of December quarter.

That works out to about 2 per cent of total market capitalisation of BSE500 stocks at current market prices and was higher from Rs 2.40 lakh crore worth of share pledges recorded as of December 31, 2017.

Among Nifty50 companies, promoters of Zee Entertainment had pledged 59.40 per cent of their holdings as of December 2018. It was followed by Adani Ports (45.50 per cent), JSW Steel (43.60 per cent), IndusInd Bank (26.40 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (12.70 per cent) and Asian Paints (11.90 per cent). 



Zee Entertainment, JSW Steel, Sun Pharmaceutical and YES Bank saw promoters increase share pledge levels between September and December quarters.

Zee Entertainment last week hogged limelight after lenders sold some of the pledged shares. 

An elevated level of shares pledging is not considered good as a downturn in market can lead to invocation of such shares, leading to oversupply and severe correction in stock prices, while in extreme cases, it can even trigger a change in a company’s shareholding pattern.

Promoters of 50 BSE500 companies had pledged over 25 per cent of their holdings by the end of December quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed. At the top, promoters of CG Power & Industrial Solutions had pledged 100 per cent of their holdings, whereas those of Sterlite Technologies and Gayatri Projects had pledged over 90 per cent of holdings. 

For a lay investor, share pledging does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is in financial distress. Banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoters’ shares to advance loans.

Among other companies, whose promoters have pledged more than 80 per cent of holdings with their lenders were Jindal Stainless (Hisar), Jindal Stainless, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Power, GMR Infrastructure, Dish TV India and Max Financial Services. 

In the case of Coffee Day Enterprises, Suzlon Energy, Max India, Apollo Hospitals, Reliance Capital and Bajaj Consumer, promoters have pledged between 70-80 per cent of their holdings. 

In a bull market, share pledging may not be that important a factor for investors to consider. But when market sentiment turns risk off, it does. A high level of share pledging is undesirable and may signal a situation of distress. A decline in the level of share pledging may suggests a drop in stress. 

Among BSE500 companies, Eveready Industries, Indiabulls Real Estate, Coffee Day Enterprises, Jain Irrigation, Infibeam Avenues, and Jindal Steel and Power saw promoters increase share pledge levels by 13-45 percentage points in Q3 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.



The extent of pledging is definitely a matter of concern for an investor. Pledging in a capital-intensive company is highly risky. Promoters generally pledge for a mix of both for their personal needs as well as for reinvestment in their businesses. Pledging should always be a matter for concern. In a bull market, no one sees the level of pledging. Technically, promoters only know everything about their companies. Investors should always be wary of promoters’ share pledge levels. Temporary pledging of 10 per cent or so or for the first time is okay, but if it is a habit to pledge shares quarter after quarter, then that is definitely a warning sign, says Hitesh Agrawal, Head of Retail Research, Religare Securities.

Companies like Fortis Healthcare, Suzlon Energy and Advanced Enzyme saw a drop of over 10 percentage points in promoters’ share pledge levels during December quarter.

 “Generally, share pledging cannot be taken as a good sign. Promoters pledge shares either for their personal use or for the company’s needs. So, the objective of pledging is crucial,” said Sanjeev Jain, AVP, Ashika Stock Broking.

In some cases, banks normally ask promoters to pledge their shares as margin in case they are doubtful about the health of their businesses. “Investors need to watch the size and period of holding of such share pledges. Pledging in large volume is not a good sign. In a bad market, lenders may sell the pledged shares if the promoter does not meet the margin shortfall, which may mount pressure on stock price,” Jain said."
54,2019-01-31,Asian Paints,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,550.

The current market price of Asian Paints is Rs 1,405.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Asian Paints price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage-

Solid volume traction; pricing provides strong revenue visibility: APNT’s volume growth over the last 10 years has been an average 11 per cent, which is one of the highest in consumer space. It also has a consistent price hike history with an average price hike of 4 per cent the in the last 7 years. We expect APNT to witness 13 per cent volume growth in FY19E following solid traction in 3QFY19, which saw 24 per cent YoY revenue growth with the decorative segment registering nearly 20 per cent YoY volume growth. APNT hiked prices by 4.1 per cent in 3QFY19 to offset higher input prices. With these price hikes, the weighted average price hike for FY19 is seen at nearly 5 per cent with nearly 2.5 per cent flowing into FY20E. Thus, revenue visibility will continue to remain very strong in FY20 as well. We believe APNT will continue to register solid double-digit volume growth in FY20E/FY21E on the back of highly diversified portfolio and a healthy demand environment.


Significant capacity addition in FY19; operating leverage gains to follow: APNT’scapacity addition in FY19 is 0.6mn KL/year, which translates into a capacity enhancement of 53 per cent, which is quite significant. Further, its operating cost and depreciation expenses significantly increased in 3QFY19 with operation of Mysuru plant, which added 300,000KL/year capacity in September 2018. Notwithstanding significant capacity addition, APNT’s EBIDTA,PAT and Sales grew by 17 per cent YoY, 12 per cent YoY and 24 per cent YoYin 3QFY19. Strong revenue traction is expected to continue in FY20E and FY21E, which will aid will be 18 per cent CAGR in earnings growth through FY19-21. APNT incurred Rs10bn capex in FY19 out of which Rs8bn capex was towards capacity enhancement. However, capex is expected to decline in FY20E/FY21E.


International & automotive segment sluggish; industrial segment seems encouraging: APNT’s international segment delivered a sluggish performance in FY19 owing to challenges in countries like Sri Lanka, Egypt & Bangladesh, as it does not enjoy market leadership to exercise pricing power. Ethiopia is witnessing raw material challenges because of lack of forex availability. Though its domestic automotive segment is seeing sluggish growth, industrial segment is seeing good traction. Home improvement business is still a small segment contributing 2 per cent to APNT’s revenues but has the potential to add significant value in the long-term.


Outlook & valuation: At CMP, the stocktrades at premium valuation of 45x FY20E earnings. However, it has the requisite pricing power to deliver sustainable revenue growth, going forward. On reverse DCF valuation basis, the CMP implies 13 per cent CAGR in revenue for the next 20 years, which is lower than the last 15/10-years CAGR of 16 per cent/15 per cent, respectively. We value APNT at 45x FY21E earnings."
53,2019-01-31,Asian Paints,"Midcaps and a large part of select PSUs can be huge outperformers but it is going to stock specific. There is scope 
  
  
  to be contrarian in a number of sectors, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

At the beginning of the year, the view was that US markets will remain under pressure, emerging markets will come back and the rally would be led by India. But now, everything has gone up and we are feeling left behind. Why is India underperforming the world with such good macros?
Consensus generally tends to get proved wrong. Now, we were of the view that the Dow is due for a very strong rally and the dollar should weaken. Yesterday bond yields hit 2.68%, which tells you that Donald Trump has won over the Fed chairman and now there is dovishness which seems very good news for emerging markets. 

For India, there is this overhang of NBFCs and disclosures by DHFL, Zee. but being an Indian, we know this is part and parcel of all market moves. We are extremely positive. We think the results from select largecaps and midcaps have been extremely flattering and this could prove to be a lull before the storm. We will go up from 11000 to 11200 in February and I can reiterate that by 15th of April, you should be close to new highs. 

That aside, the midcaps and a large part of select PSUs can be huge outperformers and so it is going to more stock specific, but I do not rule out a 500-700 point rally in February.


A 500-point rally, did I hear you right? What could be the trigger, what will take us 2-3% higher on the Nifty?
Two things; a) you will get over the budget where there could be some surprise packages in the form of tax exemption and b) the RBI turning extremely dovish and a rate cut coming. We know that we are in the realm of low inflation, low yields and the RBI trigger, liquidity and foreign flows on a strong rupee will all be the caveats for February being a very good month. 


Let us talk about some of the policy sensitives. You highlighted how the accommodative stance from RBI would help the policy sensitive or the rate sensitive sectors. Could there be a contrarian opportunity in real estate?
Yes. Real estate assets have never been cheaper and stocks have actually been underperforming miserably. Once we get through these elections and see stability, it is a given that real estate prices as fixed assets should get a lion’s share of the money rather than gold. I am very bearish on gold. I would say that fixed assets will do well including real estate. 

Our top pick continues to be Godrej Properties followed by Sobha and maybe a Prestige Estate. These are three stocks where we can actually put a lot of money and be confident because the churning has separated men from the boys. Real estate can stand to gain by the middle of this year and later from there. 


The ICICI Bank numbers are good. The ADR shot up by about 8-9% overnight but the stock has also moved 40% in this fiscal itself. How much scope does it have to move forward from here?
That is a good point. Smart money has been buying ICICI right from the time both the two agony aunts of Axis and ICICI left and if you were contrarian there, you have really made a lot of money. I still think we are headed much higher. Rs 700 is something which I do not rule out in the next one and a half years on ICICI and Rs 800 on Axis Bank. These are going to be prime plays on the corporate lending side and we have seen a cleansing of balance sheet. 

I can even add that State Bank should be a big outperformer in this trio of stocks. Another stock which I am very bullish on is IDFC First Bank. That will be the star of 2019 and Mr Vaidyanathan will see that bank is a huge outperformer in the next one year.


What is the call on IT, especially the bigwigs?
We have had two stocks as contrarian plays; MindTree and HCL Tech. We stand by that and Wipro is the dark horse which has out beaten all. We think these three should be the best combination to play on the IT side. 


You have advocated Maruti but what is the view with some of the two-wheeler names in the wake of the expected big allocation for the farm sector? Will that trickle down into consumption numbers for autos, the two-wheelers?
We have seen autos go through the proverbial problem of competition like in telecom. Bajaj Auto stands out and they have given away part of the margins to get market share and that seems to be working. But I think this is just the lull before the storm, this has been a very strong sector for the last three years and this quarter we have seen problems because of insurance overhang of NBFCs.

I still think that both Bajaj Auto and Hero are looking very good on the two-wheeler side. You even have Eicher and TVS. So, if you bought a basket of stocks and went for a SIP. rather than one outright purchase, you can make a fair amount of money. 

Consumption is going to come back once you get lower rates. Following the NBFC fiasco, most of the other banks started to lend very aggressively and insurance is now on the back burner. So. I am relatively bullish on autos. 

As a contrarian one of my top picks is Ashok Leyland. It is the third largest bus maker in the world. It will have 50% market share in India and you have seen state governments now get on the prologue of electric vehicles where Ashok Leyland has a first over there. Also in the LCV, MHV side. I think they are going to show strong numbers March quarter onwards. So at Rs 80-82, this is a very good bargain buy with a target of 125 to 135 by next Diwali. 


What has gone wrong for Godrej Consumer? HUL is growing at 10% plus, ITC is growing at 8-9% plus. Other companies which have reported numbers so far, are not bad including Asian Paints. Why is Godrej Consumer the odd one out?
It could be a one quarter hiatus and I do not see that lasting. I think they will be back. We have seen the strong numbers in durables particularly the likes of Havells, Bajaj Electrical, Voltas and like you mentioned, the discretionaries and the sales of Asian Paints, ITC. 

Godrej Consumer definitely deserves to be bought. It is a pedigree name, the brand is doing extremely well and it is just a matter of time where higher costs will start to reduce and margins will expand. I think this quarter onwards you should start to see much better traction on volumes.


But the management has said that 2019 will be a bad year for them! Do you think this is an indication of what is happening to the sector per se or this is isolated to Godrej Consumer?No, it could be isolated to them because there is competition which has brewed up over there and like I said, they are a very conservative management. They under promise and over deliver and that is what stands out for Godrej. 

However, consumption is a mixed bag. We have seen autos weak but we have durables doing extremely well. A company-specific move may be on the cards but definitely the broader band of peer groups are doing extremely well. So ITC continues to be our top pick over there and we think that they are going to just expand much more on the other businesses which is evident in the numbers on paper, hotels and the FMCG."

Piyush Goyal, India’s interim finance minister, will present the interim Budget on February 1, in the absence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is currently undergoing treatment in the US.

The Interim Budget, to be followed by a full one in July, is expected to project economic growth at around 7.5 per cent for the next financial year, while expanding capital spending on railways, roads, ports by 7-8 per cent, and estimating a 15 per cent increase in revenues, PTI reported quoting sources.

But the main focus of the Budget will be on the rural sector and urban middle-class. The government is likely to announce relief measures for farmers, benefits for unemployed youth and dole out higher tax exemptions for the middle class and small businesses, the PTI report said.

According to ICICI Securities, as the thrust of spending moves towards revenue expenditure in the form of farm relief or tax relief for the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, capex growth is likely to remain stagnant. The spending pattern of the government going ahead would augur well for consumption stocks with large rural footprint, while it will be negative for stocks driven by hopes of capex revival.

CLSA believes the impact on capex will be even greater if a farmer support scheme is implemented."
51,2019-01-31,Asian Paints,"India’s main stock indices have remained resilient compared to many other markets since the last Union Budget. But that does not give you the real picture. Beneath the surface, there has been a dent in investor wealth.

Indian companies excluding the top 10 performers have lost a whopping Rs 23 lakh crore, or 18 per cent of market capitalisation, due to macro-economic uncertainties, US-China trade war and expensive valuations.

In the 50-share Nifty, 26 stocks are currently trading 20 per cent below their 52-week highs. When an index falls 20 per cent continuously, it is said to be in a bear phase.



“There is still demand for high quality large-cap stocks though their valuations are expensive, but others are in bear market especially mid- and small-cap stocks” said Sanjiv Prasad, senior executive director, Kotak Institutional Equities. “Till we get some clarity on domestic macro and political uncertainties and there is some convergences in multiple, this trend will continue,” he added.

Three stocks — Maruti Suzuki, Indian Oil and ONGC — have lost between Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 86,000 crore in market cap in the past year. Other big companies such as Coal India, Bharti Airtel, Vedanta and Tata Motors have seen erosion of market cap between Rs 40,000 crore and Rs 70,000 crore since February 1, 2018.



Rampant selling seen from the foreign institutional has been one of the major reasons for the underperformance of the large section of stocks. FIIs sold nearly Rs 36,000 crore worth of Indian equities in 2018.

“We are not completely under the bear grip, but yes investors have lost money in the past year because of uncertainties both from domestic as well as global factors” said Raamdeo Agrawal, joint MD, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “Only a few stocks are performing, which is holding back indices. This trend will continue till earnings across the sectors bounce back.”

Ten stocks such as Reliance, TCS, HUL, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Nestle, Axis Bank, Asian Paints and Wirpo contributed nearly Rs 6.52 lakh crore to the market capitalisation since February 1 last year. Without these gains, the benchmark indices would have probably been in a bear market. The Sensex and the Nifty have lost 1.2 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively, since February 1 compared to 17.46 per cent fall in the MSCI Emerging Market Index."
3,2019-02-01,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A farm friendly Budget with a push for consumption cheered equity markets on Friday as key benchmark indices rose half a per cent. 

However, this rally did not turn out to be a smooth one. At one point, both Sensex and Nifty ruled firm by more than 1 per cent, with the BSE index swelling more than 500 points during the day. 

As the fine print of the Budget got clearer, the BSE Sensex slipped into the red, only to settle higher by 213 points, or 0.59 per cent, at 36,469. Its NSE counterpart Nifty added 63 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 10,894. 

Finance Minister Piyush Goyal proposed to double the threshold tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh and increased the standard deduction to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000 in an attempt to woo middle-class voters.

The government also set aside Rs 75,000 crore per year for farmer income and unveiled direct income support for smaller farmers.

Fiscal deficit for the current financial year is expected to be 3.4 per cent of GDP, slightly higher than the earlier target of 3.3 per cent. 

According to analyst C K Narayan, this Budget is more ""realistic"" than expected. That is precisely why the bulls took over. 

""The tax relief to the middle class with high propensity to consume will certainly boost consumption, economic growth and corporate earnings. This augurs well for the markets,"" said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.

BSE auto, consumer durables, FMCG and realty indices climbed up to 2.62 per cent.

Hero MotoCorp, Maruti, HCL Tech, Asian Paints and Bajaj Auto were on the winner's list.


Market at a glance:

> Auto leadsAuto stocks Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki were the top two gainers on the Sensex. Hero MotoCorp rallied 7.48 per cent while Maruti Suzuki rose 4.96 per cent. Other auto stocks like TVS Motors and Bajaj Auto too gained as auto stocks welcomed the announcement of farm package in Budget, along with income tax exemptions.


> Black day for VedantaOn a day when the Sensex recorded stellar gains, Vedanta reeled under poor December quarter numbers. The stock plummeted 17.82 per cent after the company posted a 26 per cent drop in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,574 crore in Q3 FY19 against Rs 2,114 crore in Q3 FY18, hit by lower commodity prices and disruption in its copper smelter operations at Tuticorin. 

Also, Vedanta's subsidiary Cairn India Holdings bought a stake for Rs 1,431 crore in Anglo American from Volcan Investments, a family trust of promoter Anil Agarwal. This move drew flak from analysts and market experts and investors stayed away.


> DHFL sufferedShares of DHFL cracked 24 per cent to touch 52-week low of Rs 103.35 on the BSE, only to end the day 17.96 per cent lower. With this, the stock extended its losing run to the fifth straight session. There have been allegations of financial mismanagement against the company. 


> Good day for minnowsIt turned out to be a good day for mid and smallcap indices too as both ended the day with gains. BSE Midcap closed the day 0.56 per cent higher while BSE Smallcap climbed 0.17 per cent. 


> Sectoral WatchBankex, metals, basic materials and finance are the only four sectors on the BSE out of the total 19 that slipped. Heavy selling was witnessed in banking and financial sectors. Meanwhile, the metal index slipped on account of heavy losses in Vedanta. Barring Hindalco, all other metal stocks ended in the red. 


> Jet set go!Jet Airways has agreed to most conditions set by Etihad Airways for offering a lifeline to the debt-laden carrier, according to a Business Standard report. The stock reacted positively to this development and soared 7.79 per cent to finish the day at Rs 255.90. 


Expert-take:

Rajnath Yadav, Sr. Research Analyst, Choice BrokingSentiment got a boost as the budget proposed financial incentives to rural people and a tax rebate to middle class salaried people. However, market pared most of its gains in the late afternoon session amidst accelerated selling in some financial stocks. Despite the high volatility, benchmarks did not enter into negative territory and broader indices also ended the session in green.

1,2019-02-01,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Interim Budget 2019 is hours away and Dalal Street is all glued to Parliament.

While many analysts described Thursday’s bounce in domestic stocks as a pre-Budget rally, history suggests Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal’s Interim Budget is unlikely to create a major euphoria in financial markets.

Domestic stock indices have gained over 1 per cent on Budget Days on only two of last 12 occasions (including Interim Budgets of 2009 and 2014). That said, volatility, as suggested by fear gauge India VIX, is likely to decline as the dust settles. 

Sensex and Nifty50 have fallen 1 to 6 per cent on four occasions in last 12 and risen more than 1 per cent on two. The best return for Sensex on a Budget Day in last 10 years was in 2017, when it had jumped 1.76 per cent. In 2010, it climbed 1.08 per cent.

Among its worst losses on Budget days, the Sensex tanked 5.83 per cent in response to the full Budget of 2009 and 3.42 per cent in reaction to the Interim Budget tabled earlier in February that year. The index had declined 1.52 per cent in 2013 and 1.19 per cent 2012, data compiled from AceEquity shows.

India VIX, which signals volatility in Nifty for the following 30 days, has plunged between 5 to 17 percentage points on all Budget days. It fell 17 per cent in 2017, 13.3 per cent in 2015, 11.4 per cent in 2018 and 10.5 per cent in 2011. 




Sensex flat since last BudgetThis morning, the BSE Sensex would have been at the same level it was on the Budget day last year, but for the Thursday’s bounce, which lifted it 665 points to

36,256. During this period, Bajaj Finance rallied the most at 50 per cent. 

Other blue chips like Infosys, Reliance Industries, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consultancy Services, Asian Paints, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HCL Technologies and HDFC Bank have gained between 2 per cent and 27 per cent in this period. 

On the flip side, Tata Motors, with a fall of 56 per cent, has emerged the top loser in the Sensex pack. Among other prominent losers were YES Bank, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Bharti Airtel, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, ONGC and Bajaj Auto, which cracked up to 25 per cent




Sensex performance under various GovtsBSE benchmark Sensex has delivered 45 per cent return since the BJP-led government came to power in May 2014. NDA Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s first Budget was unveiled on July 10 that year.

The index delivered 43.4 per cent return under P Chidambaram between July 2012 and May 2014, and 94.5 per cent under Pranab Mukherjee between January 2009 and June 2012.

In UPA I, 30-stock pack gave 83.3 per cent return between May 2004 and November 2008, during Chidambaram’s earlier stint. Prior to that, it returned 50.9 per cent under BJP Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha between July 2002 and May 2004.


Piyush Goyal to table Budget this time
Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal will table the Interim Budget in Parliament this time, and there are speculations that the Modi government will use this occasion to dole out sops to alleviate rural stress ahead of the general elections.

Farm distress would be a key focus of the Interim Budget, said Pankaj Murarka, Founder at Renaissance Investment Managers. The Budget is likely to significantly increase rural outlay and provide a roadmap for universal basic income. 

""Agricultural and FMCG sectors would be key beneficiaries of increased rural outlay. Besides, tractor, two-wheeler and passenger vehicles segments should benefit from the government’s increased rural thrust,” Murarka said."
0,2019-02-01,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: The good news: Consumer demand remained robust in the fiscal third quarter, leading to consumer goods companies posting multi-quarter-high volume growth. The bad news: the Street is not content with this.

High valuation of consumer goods stocks is the main reason for the market’s negative stance.

For instance, Hindustan Unilever delivered a strong performance in the October-December period, posting double-digit volume growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and improvement in margins. However, the stock is down 2 per cent since the company announced results last week. Colgate Palmolive India posted 7 per cent volume growth and flattish gross margins. Its stock is trading nearly 4 per cent lower since then. Jubilant Food-Works on Wednesday reported strong same-store growth of 15 per cent and an EBITDA margin of 18.4 per cent — the highest in seven years. Its stock nevertheless closed almost flat.



Strong festive demand, smoothening of GST issues, normalisation in demand after the Kerala floods and healthy rural consumption ensured that companies sold more of their products in the December quarter.

While the strong volume show didn’t elicit a positive response on the bourses, a negative show on profitability was aptly penalised. ITC posted strong growth in cigarette volumes, but faltered on margins. The stock is down a percent since the company announced results. Same was the case with Asian Paints, Pidilite Industries, Bajaj Consumer Care and Jyothy Laboratories. Shares of all these companies took a beating following their Q3 results announcements.

Given this context, a pronounced underperformance became a trigger for a sharp decline. Godrej Consumer Products is a case in point. The stock declined more than 8 per cent on Wednesday, after reporting a lowerthan-expected performance.

The Street seems to have factored in the growth story for consumption stocks and is in no mood to buy into them at the current valuations.

Farm loan waiver, higher spending in an election year and the likelihood of a good kharif harvest are expected to keep rural demand buoyant in the near term. With the GST woes behind the sector, the market would rather focus now on profit growth, reflecting the pricing power and cost control of companies. Most FMCG stocks, except ITC, are trading at high valuations. It will be difficult for these stocks to eke more returns amid an overall volatile market sentiment. Good performance in the short term has been factored into the current valuations — hence any negative surprise is a reason to sell the stocks."

Edited excerpts:


Do you think the interim budget was more like a full budget?
The short answer is yes. It was more like a full budget than a interim budget. Therefore, clearly there is more analysis about the budget. But the longer term influential trend of the budget does not seem to be more than a few days. 

Of course, the fiscal deficit concerns -- what has been projected in the budget -- seemed a bit fuzzy. There is scope for trying to equalise inequality in the Indian economy. All these things will have more lasting impression. But what they did in the first budget – the GST, the insolvency and bankruptcy code - there is nothing like that. What struck me over the budget is the vision Piyush Goyal laid down for 2030. Of course, it is very far reaching. Whether they come back to power or not, but they talked about things that I think someone in North Block should be talking about -- artificial intelligence being at the cutting edge of transportation revolution, how do we make India first a $5-trillion and then a $10-trillion-dollar economy, how do we send astronaut in the space. 

The India of 2030 will have to start thinking about those areas and I am very glad someone in North Block at least put the big grand picture vision statement even though we did not get much details at this time.




Markets or smart guys like you understand the importance of events but you also know that in the overall scheme of things, whether it is budget or election really does not matter. Do you think we should stop getting fixated – A) about the budget adjustment and B) more importantly about the upcoming elections?
I think so. I do a presentation where I say India grows at night. What I mean is that when I came to the stock market in 1989, the Sensex was about 800 at that time. Today it is closer to 36,000 on the level. So India has gone up some 50-60X during the last 25 years. All kind of events have taken place in last 30 years which had negatively impacted the stock market -- from Kargil to DeMo to the global financial crisis. But the index always finds its way higher. The underlying truth is that rather than being fixated on macro events or forecasts, investors should find a great business run by credible people at a price they understand,

What Warren Buffett has taught us many years ago is still true. I mean you do not think yourself as buying a price but piece of a business and generally you will end up better because you have been able to compound your money.


If I look at the global lay of the land from Ray Dalio to Howard Marks, Stanley Druckenmiller, the so called global gurus are quite bearish about what could happen to the world and what could happen to the America. If American stock markets start correcting, I cannot imagine what will happen to the world!
Good point and let me tell you Jim Grant who writes Grant’s Interest Rate Observer made a point in his column in Barron’s this week that if you want to forecast, do it in the shower because no one will listen to you and do not risk coming on public television!


And nobody will remember you also.
But think how difficult it is. The Dow had the worst December in 90 years -- since 1930. In January, it had the best January since 1987! So it was down 9% one month, up 7% the other month. Who knows what is going on? But a couple of things seem certain as you go through all these mess out there, that this huge 30-year bull run in bonds may be over. So collapsing from higher 14-15% to under to actually 1.2% in July 2017, that bull market is over.

Interest rates are held higher. If they held higher, it is generally not very good for equities because they act as reversed force of gravities. In the next year or two, interest rates in America will head higher. When they head higher, there will be huge displacement of money going back to developed markets from emerging markets. We do not know how these things play out at this point. But the broader point is that markets correct and then they move back up. So, you remain invested.


If interest rates move higher, do you think the impact on corporate America this time or the market cap this time could be limited? The real euphoric rise has happened in FAANG stocks — Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Netflix. These are zero debt companies and some would argue that they will move independently of what the interest rate regime is.
They are. They are not only zero debt companies, they are also zero working capital companies. They are actually phenomenal but also valued very highly. Interest rates generally are not good for the stock market. Oil prices rising generally are not good for the stock market. These are things you learnt over last 40-50 years. The market can tolerate some degree of laxity in terms of interest rate or even oil prices. But if you have a 35-year bull market, the end of interest rates going down, that is almost two generation shift that took place. 

I was a child of the 70s and grew up in a very high inflation, high interest rate environment at the Dow. I remember after the first interest rate crack business, there was this article saying ‘Will interest rates spike back up?’ In fact, they headed down for the next 30 years. So, these things work in cycles and we have clearly hit the low point. I do not think we are going to go below 1.6 or 1.2 whatever the low of the US 30-year treasury bill was. They are probably headed higher. 

In India, I there was some hope that the RBI would reduce interest rates in the next meeting. I think it is becoming increasingly unlikely because of the fiscal spending that the government has undertaken. Almost one trillion rupee, Rs 70,000 crore for the farm budget, Rs 30,000 crore personal tax. It is very unlikely they will reduce interest rates in this or the next cycle. We are also at fairly high interest levels.


The macros are favourable for us, things have improved on the margin and yet Indian markets are underperforming the world. Why?
There are two things. First, the NBFC crisis, in my opinion is not over. It is a slow moving train wreck going through the system and liquidity. I do not know this very well but my analyst friends tell me it is extremely tight. Money is very hard to get even for corporate India at this point. Liquidity is the mother’s market or bull market. If there is no liquidity, we are going to be squeezed out here. We will depend on the kindness of strangers, foreign portfolio investors to pour money as they have been doing for the last few days to hold up the market. 

My best case scenario is that we will chug along like this, the market may go and test its all-time high. But based on poor volumes and perhaps even negative breadth, we are not going to make a 10:1 advance decline ratio and breaking out to new highs. We probably will just go and test that area before the general election, but as I said, with very poor volume comes very poor breadth.

The macro situation in terms of oil prices is good. Oil is at $60. But we are getting into period of uncertainty with regard to elections, fiscal targets, private sector investment getting crowded out. It does present a challenging picture and particularly in respect of global slowdown. Indian export figures have been nothing write to home about.


Is the bull market in mid and smallcap stocks over now? 
That seems to be the trend right now but I for one look largely at smallcap and midcap stocks, trying to find hidden gems. It is hard to be bearish at these points, at these levels on these companies. Will they underperform? Maybe they will underperform for another six months or so. I am not sure about that but contrary to more popular opinion, I am not bearish about that sector of the market that saying we should never invest in those stocks. 


As an investor are you fully committed in this market?
I am. My cash levels are very low. We sold a little bit and I remain invested and long-term bullish. These things happen in the market out there. At least the evidence does not suggest that the bull market is over. It suggests you are going through a very painful consolidation period out there. Bull market tops are made with a lot of leverage, lot of euphoria. As someone said, when small men make long shadows, that is when you start worrying. I do not see any of the signs yet. It is very painful and I am not trying to diminish the pain that the street is feeling or the damage to the portfolio, but it does not seem to be like we have made a top of the 2013 bull market.


But in 2017-18, we saw almost a rising tide phenomenon in small and midcap stocks. Was that not a sign that we may have peaked out a year ago?
You only know in hindsight at 2020 but in my judgement, after going through all this, I do not believe so. Yes, there were some excesses in that space which corrected but unless the largecaps top out, a bull market cannot get over because they constitute 60-70% of the market cap of our country today. You would have to see euphoria in those sections and I do not see any euphoria at all in that sector.


For the longest time, if I asked anyone what is a good business, they would says it is HDFC Bank or an Asian Paints or an HUL. Some would say all three. These are great businesses but the problem is they are too expensive. How does one approach this kind of dichotomy in the market?
At what point do you actually step in and buy these shares? I do not think I have a clear answer. Over the last 30 years, I have learned one thing, you always want to look out for good businesses at a valuation you understand and run by decent people. I would not worry too much about interest rates going higher or the fiscal deficit expanding to 3.5% or things like that. I have no control over that but I do control some good goods and services. 

Typically, if we are even starting a new bull market cycle, there will be new leadership in the market and that would come from some of the small and midcap stocks. In 2013, no one had heard of Bajaj Finance. Today it is probably one of the premier finance companies and despite the issues in the NBFC sector, the stock is standing firm. You have got to keep looking for new ideas, people approaching businesses in a new way.

Clearly technology, app-oriented businesses will do well in the next few years. Keep looking for other opportunities I am sure they will show up. I am almost 100% sure that new opportunities will show up you just have to have a good pair of eyesight.


Where do you think a new sector has potential to get created and then you will hunt for it?
The media business, in the last 10 years, has moved away from broadcast to streaming, which is a phenomenal change because almost nobody watches live broadcast anymore. They all watch it stream on YouTube at their convenience but there are a few businesses that remain immune to that. If you look at say sports programming, the news cycle, maybe they will not feel the pressure and there will be interesting apps based on that. So you could take a look at somewhere out there.

We have liked quick service restaurants because as more women work outside the house, as more people want more hygienic food, easy availability, internet on demand, air conditioners etc, quick service restaurants will answer that challenge. We have very little competition in that area. It is a very difficult business and people who are there right now and going to scale up the business will probably make good bets.


You have always maintained that as an investor you should always focus on one thing; price, you need to buy them cheap. PSUs across-the-board - engineering companies, metal companies, banks -- all are cheap. Right now, are you hunting in the PSU banks or PSU stocks?
I am, to be honest. There are a couple of things I would say about the PSU basket, the government has a very aggressive disinvestment programme. Last year, it was Rs 80,000 crore. This year, they are budgeting Rs 90,000 crore. They are going about it the wrong way, taking it from one pocket and putting it in another pocket. 

There was some press item today which said that we are going to do a strategic disinvestment of 28 PSUs this coming year. I do not know if that will happen because every government in the last 15 years has tried it and failed. They could not do Air India even. So, I am not very hopeful it will happen yet but they need to do that. You cannot have national assets being frittered away. MTNL, BSNL value just collapsed and nothing was done about that. If the government is serious about fiscal responsibility, it needs to, These are national assets which need to be handled with more care. So, I am looking at PSUs because in some of them, particularly, in the newly listed railways sector, there is very little competition. This business always goes to them. They are very cheap whether you look at the price to earnings multiple or dividend yield multiple, We have made money in the past on PSUs. So, e are not averse to them but the basket as a whole that does not look as attractive as it used to look a few years back.


You and your friends have bought a lot of PSU stocks. Are you spotting and smelling that huge poker opportunity in PSUs go all in?
I would not use that word quite aggressively because we are a bit dismayed by the capital allocation process of the PSUs. I do not think PSUs should be used as milch cows by the government. Increasingly, the government seems to be doing that -- whether it is with the RBI, which is also a PSU in some ways or with the actual PSUs. The government is just raiding their coffers to meet its spending priorities. I do not necessarily like that. I do not think there is enough spine in a lot of them to stand up to the government and say we are autonomous corporation you cannot tell us how to use our money. 

If something is so cheap that the prospects could look good for the next two, three years, I am still buying them.


Disruption is here to stay. As an investor, you need to spot something which is durable and has a moat around it. Which are some of those ideas which have a moat and a unique edge?

 Quick service restaurants should be one. Airlines will be the other. They have not really played out. I have been bullish on airlines and we have done very badly out there but if you look at the Indian picture, one of the leading carriers now has about 50% market share in India. The other competitors are going by the wayside. Maybe they are buying market share currently and ignoring profitability, but 50% market share for the market cap they have is phenomenal. Also the business is not prone to technological disruption. You will still want to go to a wedding in Delhi, to a holiday in Calcutta or a conference in Chennai. The business still lends itself to fairly good economics. 

United States had multiplicity of carriers. That got whittled down to four or five and then these became extremely profitable and so noticeable that even Warren Buffett had invested in them. The same thing is happening in India. 

I don’t think almost nobody after Mallya and the problems with Jet would want to open an airline. So, the players that we have would be fairly stable and they will consolidate. At some point, they will start increasing pricing pressure. Already there is a lot of problems when you fly from Bombay to Delhi because you do not have great capacity. That means prices will go up and that would help them. We are going through a transition period but over the next five, 10, 15 years I think airlines will make a really good investment hypothesis."

Most of them also reported highest-ever sales for a quarter. While not all of these companies are a outright ‘buy’ calls, analysts do fancy most of these counters, earnings reviews by analysts showed. 

This season Reliance Industries became the first private sector firm to report Rs 10,000 crore quarterly profit. The number of analysts recommending a ‘buy’ rating on the stock has jumped to 12 from nine a month ago, Reuters data showed. Analysts recommending a ‘sell’ rating on the scrip fell to two from four. The scrip has topped Nifty50 performance chart, rising 17 per cent in last one month.

RIL’s consolidated profit for the quarter stood at Rs 10,251 crore, beating Street estimate by 7.7 per cent. Sales were highest ever at Rs 1.71 lakh crore.

At FY20 PE multiple of 13.6 times, the scrip looks attractive, says YES Securities.

“RIL is our top pick in the oil & gas space, as we see benefits from refinery-petchem integration playing out in a tough macro environment and RJio and retail scaling up operations,” IIFL Institutional Equities said in a note.

Analysts are painting a rosy picture for Asian Paints too.

The number of brokerages recommending ‘outperform’ rating on the stock has jumped to 15 from 12 a month ago. The company’s record profits and sales were fuelled by nearly 20 per cent volume growth, which was the highest the company has witnessed since FY11.

“Though near-term headwind in the form of general elections could pose a challenge, Asian Paints’ long-term theme of market shift from unorganised to organised hands and premiumisation remain intact,” Reliance Securities said.

Bajaj Finance managed to impress Street with a 54 per cent jump in quarterly profit. JM Financial said the NBFC is well-positioned to deliver sustainable profit growth driven by strong customer acquisition, increasing rural footprint with diversified product offering, rising contribution of fee income, superior asset quality and a well-capitalised CAR of 21 per cent. 

Analysts have showed faith in ITC, as the scrip has slipped 2 per cent in last one month. Citi says Dalal Street may be missing the point that the margin lever for a business is price, and not volumes. Cigarette volume recovery builds the base for price hikes, they said, adding that the company’s diversification drive will pay off soon.

“High cash generation has enabled ITC to invest aggressively in other fast-growing businesses, enabling it to diversify into other, non-stringent segments. We expect revenues and earnings to grow at a CAGR of 10.2 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, in FY18-21E,” said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock. 


Others
Tata Group firm Titan is another stock analysts are positive on. This jewellery maker has given guidance for 22 per cent growth in jewellery business in FY19. The number of brokerages recommending an outperform rating on the stock has increased to 17 from 14 a month ago. Calls recommending a hold rating on the stock have fallen to 3 from 5.

Brokerages are not that bullish on another Tata Group firm, TCS.

December quarter sales and profit of India’s most-valued listed firm came in at Rs 37,338 crore and Rs 8,121 crore, respectively. The target price for the stock has been cut by up to 16 per cent, as the software major’s margins failed to cheer investors despite record sales and profit.

Another IT firm Wipro has seen brokerages raise price targets on higher-than-expected margin growth in December quarter. But increased price targets are not enough to trigger ‘buy’ calls. Most brokerages have either retained ‘sell’ or ‘neutral’ rating on the stock due to muted guidance for fourth quarter, as growth continues to lag peers.

The numbers of analysts giving buy ratings on the stock has fallen to one from two a month ago, while analysts with ‘hold’ ratings has jumped to 17 from 15 and those with ‘underperform’ rating have risen to 10 from 9.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid and HDFC Bank are a few other companies which have reported record profits.

Among the Nifty constituents, Maruti Suzuki, Ultratech Cement, YES Bank, SBI, IOC, Bharti Airtel and NTPC missed our PAT estimates, while L&T, Axis Bank, ITC, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech exceeded our projections, Motilal Oswal said in a report."

8,2019-02-08,Asian Paints,"KOLKATA: An average annual package of Rs 20 lakh straight off the campus has become the new normal for the graduating class of 2019 at many leading B-schools, rather than just the top handful.

This placement season, at least four business schools — Management Development Institute (MDI), Gurgaon; Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Kozhikode; Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT), Delhi and Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Mumbai — have crossed the Rs 20-lakh average salary mark for the first time, in an indication that companies are willing to write big cheques for top talent even in a lacklustre market.

This compares with an average annual salary of Rs 9.3 lakh that management grads get in India, according to the Campus Salary Hiring and Employment 2018 report by online assessment platform Mettl.

It is based on data from 31tier-I and 49 tier-II business schools, where the average salary at tier-I colleges was Rs 15.38 lakh and at tier-II, Rs 5.34 lakh.

“If you’re good, everybody is chasing you, right from a startup to top consults and multinationals,” said Ketan Kapoor, chief executive, Mettl. “Every company wants the same talent and because they want to make sure that talent is of a certain calibre, the pedigree of the institute matters. That’s why graduates from leading institutes command a premium.”

Average salaries were Rs 22.7-24.4 lakh at the top three IIMs — Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta — in 2018.

Increase of 20-25% in Cos Paying Rs 20L

Among non-IIMs, SP Jain Institute of Management and Research (SPJIMR) and Xavier School of Management (XLRI) have average salaries of above Rs 20 lakh.

“Graduates from the top business schools tend to remain insulated, or much less affected, even when the overall job market isn’t doing great,” Kapoor said.



At institutes that breached the Rs 20-lakh average salary mark this year, there has been an increase of 20-25% in the number of companies paying such packages. At MDI Gurgaon, this year, 55 companies paid salaries of Rs 20 lakh or above, compared with 46 last year. At TISS Mumbai, there’s been a 25% increase in such companies over last year.

At IIFT Delhi, there’s been a near 78% increase in the number of companies paying over Rs 20 lakh, from 27 last year to 48 this time. The number of offers in this bracket has also jumped 54% from 87 in the 2016-18 batch to 134 this year, said Harkirat Singh, corporate and placement adviser, IIFT. Average overall compensation hit the Rs 20.07-lakh mark at the institute this year.

Campus placement sources say Airtel, Amazon, Asian Paints, Avendus, Bajaj Auto, Citibank, Colgate Palmolive, Dell EMC, Deloitte India, Flipkart, ITC, Lodha Group, L’Oréal, Mahindra & Mahindra, Marico, Nestlé, Reckitt Benckiser, Reliance Industries, Samsung R&D, Oyo Rooms, Rivigo, Swiggy, TAS and Uber are among those paying salaries in excess of Rs 20 lakh.

“Consulting and BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sectors were the top paymasters in this year’s placement process,” said Kanwal Kapil, dean of placements, MDI Gurgaon, where the average salary for the 345-strong batch of 2017-19 was Rs 20.13 lakh.

Shovan Chowdhury, placements chairperson, IIM Kozhikode, agrees. “Historically, consulting firms have been among the best paymasters and this year, there’s been a huge upsurge of offers from such companies,” he said. The mean salary for the 2017-19 batch at the institute rose nearly 16% to Rs 20.6 lakh from last year’s Rs 17.8 lakh.

While there’s been a near 20% increase in the number of companies paying upwards of Rs 20 lakh, there’s been a big jump in the number of such offers as well, said Chowdhury. Companies offering above Rs 30 lakh at IIMK include McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Microsoft and Colgate Palmolive."
12,2019-02-11,Asian Paints,"It has been proved that no other asset class has the ability to beat equity in the long run, but its performance is subject to several risks. Besides the internal or company-specific issues, external factors like change in government policies, market sentiment, competition and economic growth have a significant influence on a company’s long-term performance. For instance, MTNL, which once enjoyed a teleservices monopoly in Delhi and Mumbai, has lost more than 92% of its value in the past 19 years due to its operating inefficiencies and increased competition.


Invest for longer terms to cut your losses

For investment tenures of five years and more, the loss rate of BSE500 is zero.
 
Note: 5-year or 10-year periods between 2000 to 2018. Investment at the beginning and exit at the end of the year.

Given the internal and external risks to companies, it becomes imperative that investors evaluate the risk-return profiles of companies before investing in them. Also, the likelihood of losses from equity investments goes down with the increase in the investment tenure. Data for the past 19 years—2000 to 2018—shows that the historical loss rate of BSE500 index goes down to zero as the investment tenure goes up to five years or more. Historical loss rate is defined in terms of index returns and is calculated by dividing the number of years in which the index has delivered negative returns by the total number of investment years. The historical loss rate can also be used to identify low risk-high return stocks. Fewer negative returns and surging stock prices over a given period of time implies that the company has strong business fundamentals and has been meeting its shareholders' expectations.

We tried to identify companies with minimum historical loss rate across time scales. Companies with a market-cap of greater than Rs 500 crore were analysed and historical loss rates for 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year investment periods were calculated. Some 451 companies with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore, whose share price data was available since 2000 were analysed. Calendar year data was used from 2000 to 2018 and the stock prices for the first trading day and the last trading day for each of these 451 stocks were extracted. To compute the historical loss rate for stocks, the stock price returns from the first trading day to the last trading day across the four time frames are worked out.


Stellar past, promising future for some
These stocks haven’t seen negative returns over 3-, 5- and 10-yr periods since 2000. 
 
Stock prices as on 5 Feb 2019. Source: Estimates, analysts’ views and target prices from Bloomberg rest from ACE Equity.

Looking at the historical loss rate for one year, an investor entering at the beginning of the year and exiting at the end of the year would have had 19 one-year tenures to invest and exit. Science and tech company 3M India has delivered negative returns for three 1-year periods out of 19 and therefore, its historical loss rate works out to 15.8%. Similarly, there were 17 three-year periods—1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002, 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003 and so on—the last being 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018. Had you invested in Asian Paints for any of these 17 (3-year) periods, you would never have booked a loss. The historical loss rate of Asian Paints is zero over the 3-year period. Similar calculations were done for 5- and 10-year time scales.

We filtered out stocks whose historical loss rate was less than that of the BSE500 index loss rate across 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, leaving us with 41 companies. These companies not only have lower risk but are fundamentally sound and have significant future growth potential. Of these 41 companies, 38 are covered by Bloomberg analysts and these have 827 analyst recommendations. Out of these, 71% are buy, 19% are hold and 10% are sell recommendations.

Bloomberg analysts estimate the average return on equity (ROE) of these shortlisted companies for 2018-19 to be 20.7%. Comparatively, the estimated ROE of BSE500 index for 2018-19 is 11.7%. In the past five years, the aggregate marketcap of these 41 companies has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.4%, while the BSE500 companies grew at a CAGR of 15.3%. Out of these 41 companies, we finally selected companies with zero historical loss rate across 3-, 5- and 10-year time frames, leaving us with six companies. No company had zero historical loss rate for the 1-year time scale."

15,2019-02-13,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Ignoring decent gains in its Asian peers, Indian equity benchmark Sensex suffered losses on Wednesday, extending losing streak to a fifth successive session, on selling in bank, energy, auto and metal stocks.

Stocks opened in the positive territory as macroeconomic numbers in terms of retail inflation and industrial production boosted market mood. 

However, a fresh spell of selling emerged in the latter half of the session, which caused the market to end the day in the red.

Experts say other than the uninspiring December quarter earnings and anxiety around general elections, the pressure in NBFC and banking spaces were still making investors jittery.

“The issue surrounding the NBFC sector is still not out of the way and auto and infrastructure sector is struggling in terms of numbers, which is not giving comfort to the market in terms of growth visibility,"" said Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President at Sharekhan.

Sensex closed 120 points, or 0.33 per cent, lower at 36,034.11, while Nifty lost 38 points, or 0.35 per cent, to close at 10,793.65.

16,2019-02-14,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Mutual funds were seen churning their portfolios in information technology, consumption and private banking sectors during the month gone by, even as they were busy buying into a couple of metals and m ining names ahead of the Interim Budget 2019.

The domestic institutional investors offloaded shares of Wipro and HCL Technologies but accumulated those of Infosys. In the banking space, they dumped shares of private lenders IndusInd Bank and YES Bank to accumulate shares of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. They also showed preference for consumer stocks such as ITC, HUL and Asian Paints over discretionary plays such as Maruti Suzuki. Farm play M&M, too, was on the radar of these funds.

In addition, fund managers showed preference for oil marketing major IOC over BPCL. Besides, they also dumped several NBFCs and telecom stocks, data suggested.

January was the third straight month when inflows into equity funds slowed down. In fact, inflows shrank 60 per cent to Rs 6,158 crore in January over the same month last year. Lack of returns in last one month and cautiousness ahead of the general elections were seen as major reasons for the slowdown in inflows.

“Churning was evident across sectors. Akin to the trend of last few months, select private banks were in demand followed by IT and consumption names. Fund houses also reduced exposure to select auto and cement names,” Edelweiss Securities said, adding that the market has entered a wait and watch period ahead of the all-important general elections.


Select private banks saw MF buyingData suggests ICICI Bank was the biggest buy, with funds buying 4.41 crore shares of the private lender during the month. On a net basis, their exposure to the counter increased by Rs 1,606 crore during the month. HDFC Bank and Axis Bank saw mutual funds buy additional shares worth Rs 1,402 crore and Rs 1,127 crore, respectively.

In his Budget speech, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal adhered to the path of fiscal prudence by projecting a marginal 10 basis points slippage in FY19 fiscal deficit to 3.4 per cent of GDP, compared with the market expectations of 3.5 per cent. The government had initially targeted a fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent for FY19.

Post last week’s money policy review, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said if one were to go to the second decimal point, fiscal deficit would be 3.37 per cent for FY19 and 3.35 per cent for FY20, which is broadly in alignment with the path of fiscal consolidation. 

This less-than-expected slippage and the recent drop in inflation persuaded RBI to cut policy rate by 25 basis points last week. Among stocks seeing brisk buying among mutual funds, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank were the top two preferred picks of CLSA.

“The recent earnings from ICICI Bank and Axis Bank give us more confidence that the NPL cycle has indeed peaked out for these two,” CLSA said in a note. IndusInd Bank and YES Bank saw selling by mutual funds.


Agencies

Tractor maker saw buying, car makers losersThe Interim Budget 2019 was special as it was the last Budget for the ruling NPA ahead of May general elections. It was expected to appease farmers and the middle class, and it did.

Ahead of the main event, MFs were seen buying shares of tractor maker M&M to the tune of Rs 171 crore. But they sold shares of Maruti Suzuki worth Rs 218 crore in January. CLSA has cut its weightages on both stocks. 

Maruti Suzuki, like other car makers, is seeing a slowdown in auto sales growth. The largest carmaker saw its December quarter profit drop 17.21 per cent to Rs 1,489 crore.


NBFC, telecom on sell radar; metals saw buyingBajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance were a few NBFCs that saw selling by MFs during the month.

Ambit Capital in a recent note said credit growth for NBFCs would decelerate to 12 per cent in FY18-21E from 18 per cent CAGR in FY14-18, with borrowing cost rising by 35-40 basis points. It, however, noted that auto and consumer financiers are better placed than housing finance companies (HFCs) and wholesale lenders.

Metals & mining stocks Hindalco, Coal India and JSW Steel saw buying interest, but selling was seen in telecom stocks Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India. 


Funds dump Wipro, HCL for InfosysMFs bought 11.65 crore shares of Infosys in January, increasing their exposure to the IT major by Rs 1,238 crore. CLSA has increased its weight for the stock in its model portfolio. Domestic funds’ exposure to Wipro fell by Rs 383 crore, and in HCL Tech by Rs 220 crore."

Infosys, Asian Paints, Reliance Communications, Coal India and HDFC Bank were among other major Sensex losers, each coming off by up to 2 per cent. 

YES Bank, on the other hand, was on cloud nine, notching up significant gains to become the best performing Sensex stock. The scrip soared 31 per cent after the lender received ""no observation on divergence"" in the bank’s asset classification and provisioning in the RBI’s Risk Assessment Report for FY2018. 


Minnows flex their muscles
Midcap and smallcap indices, however, outperformed benchmark Sensex and settled in the green. BSE Midcap shut shop up 0.52 per cent while BSE Smallcap settled 0.17 per cent higher.


Sectoral watch
BSE Oil & Gas was the worst hit in the sectoral space, losing 2.11 per cent, as most of the OMC stocks like IOC, BPCL and ONGC declined. Telecom, Energy, IT and technology were other indices that took a hit today. 

Meanwhile, BSE Industrials was the top index gainer, with CG Power as the lead gainer, followed by BSE Bankex. 


Stock-specific action
DHFL shares staged a smart rebound in intraday session following a 6 per cent plunge to close 15.69 per cent higher on the BSE. The stock declined in early trade after the company said its Chief Executive Harshil Mehta has resigned.

Now, turning to factors, let's see what moved the market today.


Sharp jump in crude prices
Oil prices rose by around 1 per cent, with Brent crude futures hitting a 2019-high, buoyed by hopes that the Sino-US tariff dispute could end soon, and as China's trade figures including crude imports beat forecasts, according to a Reuters report. International Brent crude oil futures were at $64.35 per barrel, up 74 cents, or 1.1 per cent.


Rupee in a sticky spot
The domestic currency depreciated 36 paise to 71.16 against the dollar on Thursday on increased demand for the greenback from importers and banks amid rising global crude prices. A strong dollar in overseas markets and a lower opening of the domestic equity market weighed on the rupee, a currency dealer said. The decline in the domestic currency dampened investor mood. 


Expert-take
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

""Market extended losses despite positive global market as investors continued to give more focus on domestic cues while assessing global developments. Moderation in WPI to 2.76 per cent in January provides an insight about the slowdown in the economy and earnings growth. Mid and small cap rebounded after many days of correction. However, investors are yet to find stability in the market in expectation of election outcome."""
18,2019-02-16,Asian Paints,"The domestic equity market fell steadily everyday during the week gone by in spite of positive global cues. Despite good numbers from Sun Pharma (PAT up by 75 per cent), United Breweries (profit jumped two-fold to Rs 109 crore), MMTC (348 per cent growth in PAT), the market succumbed to profit booking on political uncertainty and higher valuation in frontline stocks like Asian Paints, Reliance, Nestle, HUL - all met with selling pressure which kept the bourses lower.

RBI’s sudden change of stance on Yes Bank has raised many eyebrows but the clean chit given to the bank has been widely cheered by the market participants. However, investors should wait for a correction before entering Yes Bank as one-off events cannot change the underlying trend of the stock.

Moreover, surprisingly, the volatility on D-Street was extremely low, which indicates that the bears are losing their grip and the bulls are gaining strength. Market-wide open interest is on the lower side as major participants are out of the market awaiting clear direction.

Additionally, crude oil is rising since the last few weeks, but such a bounce will eventually resolve into lower prices again, which will later help the bulls to take the indices higher.


Event of the Week

IBC is indeed helping banks to recover their dues from corporate sharks. One more example being Jet Airways, wherein banks in all likelihood will take control of the company, but if they do, then such an action can lead to faster recovery of NPAs and most importantly it will act as a deterrent for other doubtful accounts, which will bring in a lot of prudence in the credit market.


Technical Outlook

After witnessing heavy selling, the Nifty50 recovered by the close of the week, taking support at the lower trend line. A 50 per cent retracement will take Nifty50 back to 10,870 level, after which a declining trend is expected to resume. Too much pessimism has created a short-term emotional bottom for the time being but when the level of 10,600 is broken, Nifty50 will fall violently. In the meantime, traders can go short on rise and take aggressive short positions only when Nifty50 decisively falls below 10,600.





Expectations for the Week

Since the earnings season is nearing its dull end, the market will most likely remain rangebound with a lower bias. However, some bounces are expected after the current week’s fall, but they will only prove to be a dead cat bounce and, therefore, should be ignored. The political climate is expected to further alleviate the pitch for the parties given the terrorist attack in J&K. Whatever be the responses, the market will be impacted negatively. Investors are advised to remain on the side lines till a decisive direction is visible while traders can avoid trading.

Nifty50 ended the week 2 per cent lower at 10,724."

Shares of United Spirits have fallen 18.6 per cent in the last six months and during that period, Sensex has fallen 7.6 per cent. The stock ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 513.25 on Tuesday. 

United Spirits is Morgan Stanley's top discretionary stock pick. 

""At 28 times F21e (estimates), risk-reward on the stock looks favourable. Even as quarterly earnings delivery may be volatile, we see potential for 27 per cent FY19-FY21 earnings CAGR,"" the firm said in a separate note. 

The firm had added Asian Paints to its focus list in September 2017. 

Other consumer stocks in Morgan Stanley's focus list include Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and Dabur India. 

The brokerage said consumer discretionary is among its largest overweights at 500 basis points and it is neutral on consumer staples. 

Government spending for farmers and middle income families could boost consumption, said Morgan Stanley. However, it is neutral on consumer staples due to high valuations. 

On the technology space, Morgan Stanley said business momentum has been strong but stocks have re-rated and recent outperformance has probably priced in the depreciation in the rupee."

Board meetings"
23,2019-02-21,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The market is telling you what’s on the investor’s mind: While low PE stocks continue to bleed, so-called growth stocks have been among the top gainers in an otherwise depressed market.

Looks like investors are in no mood to chase value at the moment. And given the pre-election uncertainty, the trend is unlikely to change for now. 

The disconnect between price and value in ’growth’ and ‘value’ stocks is such that many of the growth stocks are trading at expensive valuations, even on FY2021 earnings estimates, while many value stocks are ruling at inexpensive valuations, even on FY2019 basis, said Kotak Securities. 

Out of the 49 BSE 200 stocks that have gained between 10 per cent and 60 per cent in last 12 months, half had PE multiples in excess of 40, data compiled from AceEquity suggests.

Shares of HUL and Nestle India have gained 30 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively. The two FMCG stocks have managed to sustain high price multiples in last 12 months, even as the benchmark BSE200 has declined 2 per cent in the same period. 

Shares of United Breweries are up 28 per cent; Jubilant Foodworks has gained 34 per cent and Bajaj Finance 56 per cent while Pidilite Industries, Asian Paints and Dabur India have risen up to 25 per cent in last one year.

And look at the low PE stocks: oil firms ONGC, BPCL and HPCL, power firms NTPC, REC, Power Grid, Torrent Power, NBFC stocks Dewan Housing and Reliance Capital, metals & mining companies Vedanta, Coal India and NMDC are down up to 77 per cent during this period.


What disappointed
Calendar 2019 has an even worse record: none of the 40 stocks that quoted single-digit PE as of December 31, 2018 are in the green. 

Analysts say poor returns by these stocks are either reflecting the poor growth prospects and, in many cases, concerns over corporate governance.

“Stocks quoting low PEs at this point mostly belong to heavily-indebted firms or companies with unstable earnings. As such, the pressure on stock prices are further dragging their valuations. Low PE in no way suggests a stock is cheap and that it is a better company to bet on for the future,” said Sameer Kalra of Equity Research Analyst and Founder, Target Investing.

Among the top 10 BSE200 losers so far are three ADAG group stocks Reliance Power (down 63 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (down 62 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 35 per cent). These stocks have been hammered after two lenders sold shares pledged with them by the promoters.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have dropped xx per cent. Company’s CEO Harshil Mehta resigned earlier this month. A news portal recently alleged that the NBFC was involved in a financial scam as big as Rs 31,000 crore. The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

“Certain so-called value companies have found new ways to disappoint investors on corporate governance, thereby making the valuation argument largely redundant for such stocks,” Kotak Securities said.

Graphite electrode makers Graphite India, HEG are seeing tough days as electrode prices have softened due to weak global steel prices, increased Chinese imports into India and select trade restriction placed by the US.

Adani Power and IDBI Bank have been posting losses. Nalco has seen 58 per cent plunge in Q3 earnings, while Vedanta has been in news on concerns over corporate governance.

In contrast, among the top BSE200 stocks this year are from IT sector, where firms do offer earnings guidance at the end of each quarter. Two are private lenders, and one is consumer-oriented firm (Titan Company, which too offers guidance on its jewellery business).


Smart money chases growth
Smart money will always chase growth even at the higher premium, Kalra said. “For good retail and institutional investors, growth has always been a key criteria as cleaner growth is much more sustainable. Growth is what makes them give premium valuations to stocks. Consumer stocks are a case in point. They always trade at a higher premium as they are high cash flow businesses and there is high earnings visibility. It’s easy to estimate growth simply by looking at volumes,” he said. 

Kotak Securities said: ""The market seems to have taken a permanent view on the future of most companies, thereby effectively segregating companies into long-term winners; which are companies with superior business models, trustworthy managements and good corporate governance practices where no price or valuation may be too high to own the stocks, and long-term losers; which are companies with inferior business models and poor governance practices where no price or valuation may be too low to avoid the stocks.""


Election & demand for qualityElection dates are likely to be announced over the next three weeks. In a study of past three general elections, Elara Capital found that volatility usually rises sharply ahead of Lok Sabha elections and cool off only after the election outcome. In a study of the 2004 -2018 period, the brokerage found that quality stocks tend to outperform in an uncertain market.

The brokerage says by high quality, it refers to companies with RoCE of greater than 15 in each of last five years, net debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1, positive free cash flow (FCF) yield for at least four out of last five years and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) either stable or increasing. Within the BSE200 universe, there are 34 companies that fit the bill.

The brokerage has recommended 15 of them, which include Castrol India, Cyient, Eicher Motors, Gillette India, GSK Consumer, Infosys, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Oracle, Sun TV Network and Tata Elxsi.

Here is the complete list

24,2019-02-21,Asian Paints,"The real picture is in the broader market which in the next year can even double, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP
  
  
  markets and corporate affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now. LIC Housing, L&T Finance and Havells, Bharti & Bharat Forge are the five marquee names that can outperform in 2019, says Bhasin. Edited excerpts:


What is your strategy when it comes to the banking pack at the moment?
There is extreme pessimism and despondency at a time when globally markets are looking the best they have looked in a year and Indian markets are down a little bit on geopolitics. I am extremely positive on the market and I could name four bank stocks -- ICICI Bank, IDFC Bank First, SBI and Federal Bank. In these four names there is a lot of steam on the upside. PSU banks have clearly outperformed on back of recapitalisation. Bond yields are lower and the pessimism is overdone. Assets are going to improve and net interest incomes are going to rise. 


Given the volatility we have seen recently, would you still stick to some of the safer larger plays?
I have been in the market for 30 years and I have not seen this type of pessimism on midcaps. We are missing the woods for the trees. Look at the positives of NCLT, IBC. We are seeing errant promoters who are coming back to bid for their assets -- whether it is Ruias or Jaypee or Anil Ambani. It is telling us that with backs to the wall, banks are going to be in an extremely sweet spot.

Midcaps are going to double in the next one year if not triple. There is a lot of valuation comfort. There is dismal ownership and macros are changing for the better. So, I would be more bullish on the midcaps with a six-month view. 

In the medium ,term there are places to hide but we want to make money on an alpha. We think that there is a lot of room on the upside on a lot of midcaps. In select largecaps, ACC, Asian Paints, Reliance,UltraTech are the marquee names where you could be making money in the short run. The real picture is in the broader market which in the next year can even double. 


Consumption that seems to have been another theme that has been talked about a lot recently. Are there particular plays that you are focusing on?
I will give you four ideas. One would be Bharti Tele on the back of th fact that this election will be seeing the maximum amount of social media we have ever seen historically. Second would be Bharat Forge.


One sector where midcaps have more presence in one year’s timeframe but probably would revive in two years timeframe? Stocks that would substantially reward investors?
It is difficult to give specific ideas but the broader market is extremely positive. Look at insurance, a stock like ICCI Pru is giving enough comfort. Look at metals. I would say select largecaps are extremely attractive even at this price. Tata Steel, JSW, Hindalco are just to name a few. 

In constructionm whether it is Nagarjuna Construction or an NBCC or a Sadbhav Engineering, a lot of ideas are there and in auto, there are Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motor.

We just heard the management of Ashok Leyland talking of 25% growth next year. They are realigned to the BS-VI norms; there are a large number of defence orders on the truck side; there are 200 airports where buses will be supplied and in all biggest gainer will be Ashok Leyland. 

There are enough ideas, but one has to be a brave heart and and build a portfolio when the screen is red. If you do, you may be laughing your way to the bank by this Diwali and definitely by March 2020. 


Why do you like Bharti?
This election is going to see the maximum amount of data usage. Social media is at the highest ever in our historic battle and pricing power is coming back. It will be a two-way battle between Jio and Bharti. Bharti is going to definitely see a lot of revenue on both sides. They are in the process of selling some of their assets. They are in the process of realising the monetisation of their Africa business. The sum of parts, if you can ignore the rhetoric, is Bharti look good for at least 20% upside. 

The other stock which I mentioned was Bharat Forge, also I would like to mention that in this NBFC fiasco, LIC Housing is looking extremely good after the last two quarterly results and it becomes a very good proxy where the management and the pedigree of the promoter will stand out in this carnage which has taken place. 

LIC Housing, L&T Finance and Havells in the consumer electricals would be five marquee names which I think can outperform for 2019. 


What should one stay away from? 
It is a good point but that has been the best place to hide even though expensive have become more expensive and that would definitely be some of the largecap consumer names -- the Levers, the Nestles, the Asian Paints. However we have had a buy on them much lower and we still think they should be part of your portfolio but we do not want to hide. We want to be brave enough and buy the broader market; metals, autos where there is extreme pessimism which I think on the consumption side can lead from the front. 

We also think in the auto space Eicher Motors will stand out given that Siddarth Lal is now enlarging his encompass in India and beyond. Closer to Rs 20,000 is again a very good opportunity to get into Eicher Motors. There are a whole lot of stocks and sectors which can outperform. You have to be just a little brave hearted because that is where you are going to make a lot of money in the next one year."
25,2019-02-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Following the crowd usually takes you nowhere in the stock market. True!

But what do you make of the stocks that figure in portfolios of one after another mutual fund scheme? At the end of January, there were 78 stocks that were part of the portfolios of at least 100 mutual fund schemes, including ETFs, data from Ace Mutual Fund showed.

Don’t forget domestic institutional investors have become one of the key market drivers in recent years, having managed to cushion severe corrections every time there has been a big selloff by the overseas portfolio investors. 

Foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in Indian market, having offloaded shares worth over Rs 34,000 crore since January 2018. DIIs poured in some Rs 1,15,000 crore in the same period.

Not surprisingly, the list of 78 stocks includes the usual suspects. HDFC Bank is part of at least 535 mutual fund schemes; ICICI Bank 528 schemes, State Bank of India 465 schemes and Axis Bank 450 schemes.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

26,2019-02-27,Asian Paints,"Analysts said ‘buy on dips’ and retail investors went on accumulating many of the beaten-down stocks throughout Calendar 2018.

While a handful of stocks did deliver good returns to investors, but a majority of them actually tanked further over the past two months. 

December quarter shareholding data shows individual investors gradually increased stake in as many as 97 stocks in the BSE500 index in the first nine months of financial year 2019. Only 10 of them have logged gains, some up to 92 per cent in this period.

Among the most favoured stocks, individual investors held over 46 per cent stake in Nocil as of December 31, 2018, up from 44.37 per cent at the end of March 2018. The stock fell 9 per cent in 2018 and 24 per cent in 2019 so far. Brokerage Way2Wealth has a 'Buy' rating on Nocil with a price target of Rs 195.

The South Indian Bank and Suzlon Energy are two other players where investors increased stake from below 40 per cent at the end of March 2018 to above 40 per cent by December. The stock declined up to 50 per cent.

It’s the same story with PC Jeweller and Manpasand Beverages, which tanked over 75 per cent in 2018, and 14 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, so far in 2019. Individual investors raised their stakes on the two counters during April-December 2018. 

Anil Ambani’s Reliance Power also drew individual investors’ interest through the year and their holding rose to 12.74 per cent at the end of December quarter 2018 from 12.49 per cent at the end of March 2018. The stock declined 43 per cent in 2018 and 60 per cent so far this year.

However, Reliance Nippon – another retail investors’ favourite of 2018 – has delivered some 25 per cent this year after having slipped over 45 per cent between January and December 2018.







Beaten-down Tata Motors saw retail buying on every dip in 2018 and individual investors’ stake increased to 10.81 per cent by the end of December from 7.38 per cent at the end of March, 2018. The stock tanked 60 per cent in 2018, but has since gained over 1 per cent in 2019 so far. 

The auto firm recently reported its biggest-ever quarterly net loss of Rs 26,960.8 crore for December quarter. Brokerage Sharekhan is cautious on the stock due to subdued earnings and weak management commentary. It has advised investors not to bottom-fish on the counter.

Market participants should adopt a stock-specific approach while going for a buy-on-dips strategy, says Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.

“Given that the midcaps have been beaten black and blue, but they always draw retail investors’ attention. I think at this point time you have to not just balance midcaps but also keep an eye on the forthcoming events and play safe,” says Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher told ETNow.

“If you are getting Maruti or M&M 35-40 per cent lower from their highs, consider them because you are getting good stocks at reasonable valuations,” he said. 

Investors increased their holdings in Maruti Suzuki to 4.21 per cent in December 2018 from 3.47 per cent in March. The stock tanked 23 per cent in 2018 and another 7 per cent in 2019 till February 22.

With 31 per cent holding, individual investors also remained bullish on VA Tech Wabag. But shares of Chennai-based Indian multinational company slipped 39 per cent in 2018 and 16 per cent in 2019. Cholamandalam Securities has a price target of Rs 308 on the stock.

However, Merck, Jubilant FoodWorks, L&T Technology Services, MphasiS, Britannia, VIP Industries and SRF worked for investors during this period, with the shares rallying between 9 per cent and 92 per cent since April 2018.

Yes Bank, Dewan Housing Finance, Asian Paints were also on the list of 38 stocks where individual investors increased their holding in the past two quarters.

Analysts say investors should not rush to buy but keep some cash ready. It is one of those phases where you neither bat aggressively on the front foot nor go on the back foot. It is important to preserve your resources, says Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking told ETNow.

“There are a number of events lined up and the volatility they create will provide lot of opportunities over next three to four months to build a portfolio for next three to four years,” he said."
27,2019-02-28,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices opened on a strong note on Thursday, as market took courage from data showing strong foreign inflows despite mounting India-Pakistan tensions. Buying was also seen amid heightened activity in the derivatives segment ahead of February F&O expiry. 

At 9.25 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 158.20 points, or 0.44 per cent, higher at 36,063.63. Nifty50 was tradng 32.40 points, or 0.30 per cent, higher at 10,839.05. The index hit 10,850 earlier in trade.

“We have seen lots of stock specific outperformance in last few sessions, suggesting strength in the broader market. While we would recommend continuing with a stock-specific action, one needs to avoid heavy positions in such difficult times,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

Coal India jumped 1.36 per cent to Rs 224.35. Bharti Airtel, ONGC, Sun Pharma and Power Grid advanced 1.33 per cent, 1.02 per cent, 0.77 per cent and 0.74 per cent, respectively. Asian Paints added 0.72 per cent to Rs 1412.65. 

The index losers incuded Bajaj Auto, Axis bank, Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro which fell up to 0.53 per cent. 

The market-wide rollovers stood at 65 per cent till Wednesday, which were lower than an average rollover of 69 per cent seen in the comparable period of last three series. Nifty futures rollover stood at 48 per cent, which were lower than 52 per cent rollovers seen in the last three series.

Edelweiss Securities said that arbitrageurs may redeem units of the recently concluded ETF offering, so as to unwind the arbitrage positions and hence the ETF components are likely to be under pressure on Thursday. “With F&O market expiry, MSCI Index rebalancing and some action by the Bharat 22 ETF arbitrageurs all lined up together, we expect Thursday’s session to be a charged up one laced with both volatility and volumes,” said Edelweiss Securities. 

MSCI recently announced rejig which will be implemented after Thursday’s close."

1,2019-03-01,Asian Paints,"There is no obvious link any more between the Indian economy and the Indian stock market and that really puts 
  
  
  the onus on folks like us to stock pick intelligently for our clients, said Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

can start with the block deal as to what is the future for insurance companies. We can talk about geopolitical tensions or we can talk about a multi-bagger idea from your side.
Let us get the geopolitical tension addressed. Obviously, what is happening in the border is far more serious than my or most other people’s portfolios. We are a $3-trillion economy now. Even if matters were to escalate, the financial hit to the Indian economy is very tractable. It is the world’s sixth largest economy now and even in case of a conflict in scale of Kargil, the financial hit can be dealt with but obviously the human cost is on a different level. That is why the market is relatively sanguine about the serious matters taking place up north and let us hope the market stays that way and the matters decelerate. 

The Korea-America matter has been brewing for several years now. The global financial market has learnt to live with it and China-America tensions, if anything, seem to be settling down. So the geopolitics is not something we should have foremost in our minds. It is very interest to talk about but I am not so sure how relevant it is to your and my portfolios. 


But you also mentioned that there is a disconnect between the opportunities and the earnings expansions. Could you explain that?
It has been a good ten years now. The nominal GDP growth in India has been around 12-13% over the last decade or so. In only one out of the last 10 years, has the Nifty earnings growth been commensurate with India’s GDP growth. Overall Nifty earnings growth has been miserable for five-six years. My reckoning is this is not going to go away easily. It is not a question of the Nifty suddenly recovering one year.

What is increasingly happening as we become more affluent is that a bigger part of our consumption pie is coming from imported goods that is at the B2C level, at the B2B level, increasing spend on capital goods is imported robots, automation, mechanisation lines. So, the link of the Indian stock market as a play on the Indian economy unfortunately is getting broken. Our economic growth no longer seems to feed into stock market performance which means that stock picking, building an intelligently constructed portfolio in India is becoming ever more important. There is no obvious link any more between the Indian economy and the Indian stock market and that really puts the onus on folks like us to stock pick intelligently for our clients.


Telecom turns out to be that contra bet. Jio has really set the cat amongst the pigeons. But now it seems that Bharti is upping its game. An Africa listing is in the pipeline. There is news about a sizable fund raising. Does it seem like at least some power is coming back to the incumbents too?
Generating high earnings growth for sectors in India which have heavy regulatory construct , has always been a challenge. It is not just telecom. It also includes power, infrastructure, real estate. Wherever a sector is surrounded by regulation, the regulators basically suck the profits out. In telecom, initially it used to done through auctions. Now, it is done through rule changes. So I am not optimistic about that sector. 

If you ask me, the best chance the Indian market has of finding sectors which consistently give earnings growth better than GDP growth are sectors where there is low regulatory intervention and capital intensity is light. So, light industrials, traditional FMCG consumption type plays, IT, pharma. 

My reckoning is over the next one to two years, consumption-oriented light industrials, export-oriented IT-pharma type plays will have a decent run. Capital intensity is light in these sectors. The currency is weak. The currency is likely to weaken further over the next 12 months and those sectors give us the best chance of generating EPS growth ahead of GDP growth of say 11-12%. 

The only other area is private sector banks as the NBFCs and housing finance companies lose market share, given what is happening in the wholesale market. As NBFC and housing finance companies lose market share, the top four or five private sector banks should be able to pull away from the rest of the BFSI pack.


The closer we get to elections, everybody will have a view on it. But from the market standpoint, this is just conversation narrative and nothing more, nothing less. When election verdicts have been on expected lines, markets have moved. When election verdicts have not been on expected lines, markets have come down and then moved. Eventually what matters is earnings.
The Indian stock markets’ track record on elections is not great. It is probably as bad as the opinion pollster track record on elections. In 2004, when UPA won, the stock market went circuit down and then it had the best bull run ever in the next five years. 

In 2009, while the UPA won again, the stock market thought that it was a good result and then we had a miserable run for the next five years. So the Indian market’s ability to read political outcomes even after the election is done is fairly patchy and hence my reading is best to ignore it from a portfolio perspective. 

It is a big human interest story. Looking at powerful people jockeying for great power is always fascinating. But I am not so sure it will make me wiser and wealthier if I obsess about who will win the election. Part of the reason is there is no great ideological difference when it comes to economic policy. It is not as if politicians are sitting up late either reading Karl Marx or Adam Smith, losing sleep on matters of economic theory and economic philosophy. Their job is somewhat different in the Indian context. We leave them to do their jobs. We do ours which is to buy well run companies which generate good cash flows consistently.


When it comes to pharma space as a whole, do you believe that there are select opportunities here? There are expensive valuations as well. What exactly is driving your conviction here?
Let us us be clear. Sectors like IT and pharma do not have companies in those sectors which are akin to an Asian Paints or an HDFC Bank. An HDFC Bank and Asian Paints have core competitive advantages. It is in none of the IT or pharma sector companies. Those two sectors are far more commoditised. They are competing in a global market, with low differentiation in their products and that is why a currency tailwind is immensely helpful.

I reckon the rupee will go towards 75 over the next 12 months. The rupee sliding to that extent gives sectors like IT and pharma which are inherently commoditised sectors. It gives them a real kicker. We have seen the IT companies benefit from that, not just in terms of earnings but also in stock prices. You can see in pharma’s Q3 results the currency benefits coming through. The US numbers are turning around and whilst the FDA issues will continue, it is also clear that the leading pharma companies are getting a better grip on how to deal with the FDA issues. 

A combination of currency pulling back with further currency depreciation ahead of us, decent Q3 numbers from the pharma companies and in a way the worst of the FDA issues being behind us, my reckoning is there is a good pharma recovery ahead of us over next 12 months. I said the same about IT 18 months ago and I am sticking to my IT call. I would like to add pharma to that list of currency beneficiaries as we continue to exist in a phase where the rupee is heading downwards.


Do you stay with more of the same? Do you continue to buy the top four, five Nifty names which have performed in the recent past, or do you think the time has come to tactically move yourself and start nibbling into the small and midcap names or even some of the largecaps which have been beaten down?
The way I think about portfolio construction is I have a core in portfolio say 10 to 11 stocks which I call structural compounders. These are well-run companies with core competitive advantages, clean accounting and good corporate governance -- the Asian Paints, HDFC Bank type plays. I sit with them for very long periods of time and I will admit that I personally own these stocks. 

Then there are another eight, nine stocks where I take a tactical view. For example, my tactical view is that the housing finance companies and NBFCs will cede market share rapidly to the private sector banks. So I will add a couple of other private sector banks to my portfolio. They might not be of the quality of HDFC Bank. but they will be able to benefit from the shift in market share. 

Similarly, I am not saying IT and pharma are structural bets for me but given the extent of the rupee weakness, IT and pharma companies will tactically perform for me over the next one to two years and therefore I will have a couple of stocks from each of those sectors in my portfolio. As I try to blend the two, perhaps a little more than majority of the portfolio is in structural plays and something like 40-45% of my portfolio on tactical plays. Obviously all of these companies have to have clean accounts. If the accounts are believable, then I am whistling in the wind. But leaving that aside, on the tactical play front, there are opportunities in private sector banks, opportunities in IT and pharma, small ticket consumption which do not require borrowing money and these are in good shape in our country. We are seeing that for the last three sets of results.

Consumption will continue roaring ahead. The recent budget that the FM announced is very pro consumer. So there is plenty to play for. It is not just largecaps, there are some midcap plays, one or two smallcap plays as well, but the primary focus has to be underlying quality in the financial statements, strength in the franchise and consistently good ROCs, without which you really find it very difficult to make money in India.


Howard Marks in a Google talk said if you bought the classic blue chip stocks in 1960s which is GE, Kodak, 3M -- the 1960 classics -- you did not make money because those were fully priced. My only fear with classic compounders is that their businesses will continue to grow but in today’s market are they pricing in next three, four, five years of growth. Is that the risk for some of the A quality great moat franchises like Asian Paints or an HDFC Bank?
One fundamental difference between American investing and Indian investing is exactly this subject and that is the reason I write books in India. In America, you will find it possible to find a company. In America, you will not find companies which have return on capital massively above their cost of capital for decades on an end. You would not find companies like Asian Paints, Britannia, ITC, HDFC Bank, Marico in America. American firms that we are all familiar with say, Walmart, JP Morgan have return on capital pretty close to their cost of capital because America is a far more competitive economy. 

Ours is the only large economy in the world where a) companies continue to dominate sectors for decades on an end and b) they have return on capital well above the cost of capital. So I am sure Howard Marks is right in the American context but that message does not apply to India because unfortunately or fortunately, whichever way you look at it, an Asian Paints or a Britannia is able to maintain return on capital, way above the cost of capital for decades on an end.

Asian Paints is 1600x since their IPO in 1983 and 1600x in a pretty smooth line. It is not that Asian Paints had a good run and then suddenly stagnated. I reckon that continues. I am not saying that this is true for lots of Indian companies. I would say barely 1% of Indian companies fall in the category of Asian Paints on 99% of Indian companies Howard Marks is absolutely right. But there are 1% Indian companies, the structural compounders, the classic compounders, which are able to continue dominating their sectors for decades on an end, in a way which is not possible in the United States.

As a result, these companies give you 10x in 10 years and 100x in 20 years, 1000x in 30 years. It is a shame to not have those companies in your portfolio. It is like an ATM machine you stand in front of it and collect the Rs 2,000 notes."
2,2019-03-01,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty reversed the losing run of three sessions on Friday, spurred by healthy gains in bank, financial, IT and auto stocks, as investors cheered de-escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan.

Speculators raised their bets across sectors on the first day of March futures and options contracts. A rally in emerging markets also influenced mood. 

Chinese stocks jumped after MSCI raised their weight in its global benchmarks. 

Concerns over weak macroeconomic data eased as investors saw a silver lining in subdued GDP and infrastructure output numbers. They hoped that the signs of slowdown in the economy may push RBI to cut interest rate at its next meet. 

The Sensex jumped 196 points, or 0.55 per cent, to close the day at 36,063.81. IndusInd bank stole the show, advancing 2.94 per cent, followed by Yes Bank and Vedanta. 

The decliners included Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, Axis Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech, sliding up to 3.43 per cent. 

Midcaps and smallcaps stayed ahead of the Sensex, with solid gains, rising up to 2.13 per cent.

NSE's Nifty50 settled higher 71 points, or 0.66 per cent, at 10,863.50.

For the week, Sensex inched up by 192 points or 0.54 per cent, while the Nifty added 72 points or 0.67 per cent.

Let's take a look at highlights of Friday's session.


Rs 1.41 lakh crore added to investor kitty
Friday's rally in the market made BSE investors richer by Rs 1.41 lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of listed firms on the BSE jumped to Rs 1,41,82,750.99 crore from Rs 1,40,41,530.33 crore on Thursday.


Spurt in open interest
Reliance Power, with a change of 82.35 per cent, emerged at the top among the stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on the NSE. It was followed by Arvind (71.83 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (48.36 per cent), Just Dial (44.64 per cent), Oriental Bank of Commerce (38.76 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (35.14 per cent).


Over 200 stocks hit upper circuits
As many as 202 BSE stocks, including SML Isuzu, Religare Enterprises, Shreyans Industries, Star Paper Mills, Forbes & Company and Indiabulls Integrated Services, hit their upper circuits. On the flip side, Weizmann, Atlas Jewellery India, Optiemus Infracom and Darshan Orna were among the 162 stocks that hit their lower circuits. 


115 stocks signal upside
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 115 counters on the BSE, indicating that they may climb in coming sessions. Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Engineers India, ITI, Dabur India, Lupin, Repco Home Finance, Mindtree, Dr Reddy's Labs, JSW Energy and Karur Vysya Bank. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Asian Hotels (West) and Orient Beverages were among the 22 stocks that showed bearish crossovers. 


New CEO takes charge, YES Bank jumps 3%
Shares of YES Bank closed 2.68 per cent higher at Rs 237.40 after Ravneet Gill took charge as Managing Director and CEO of the bank. His tenure as approved by RBI is 3 years from the date of his joining, i.e. March 1, 2019 to February 28, 2022. 


Sugar stocks turn sweeter
Most sugar stocks jumped higher, a day after India's Cabinet approved a plan to spend up to Rs 1,054 crore to pay interest on loans to the sugar industry for a year, in a bid to help sugar mills clear their dues to farmers. Dharani Sugars & Chemicals (up 9.99 per cent), Sakthi Sugars (up 6.06 per cent), Triveni Engineering & Industries (up 5.18 per cent), Indian Sucrose (up 4.69 per cent) and Thiru Arooran Sugars (up 4.97 per cent) were among top gainers in the sugar space. 


Airtel falls on EPS worry
Markets reacted negatively to the fund-raising plan of Bharti Airtel as the shares of the company fell 3.43 per cent to close at Rs 307.05. Analysts say the raised funds will help the company pare its debt, but is not enough for its capex and opex plans. Also, the deep discount given for the right issue will hit the company's investors view for further fund-raising and increase worries on EPS estimates.


SBI Life Insurance gains 5%
Shares of SBI Life Insurance Company settled at Rs 612.25, up 5.47 per cent, after CA Emerald Investments, an affiliated entity of a Carlyle Group fund, bought 9 per cent stake in the firm. Separately, BNP Paribas Cardif SA cut its stake in the insurer by 9.23 per cent to 12.77 per cent, the company said. 


Jet Airways jumps 5%
Shares of Jet Airways closed 5.32 per cent higher at Rs 234.65 on reports that founder Naresh Goyal had agreed to step down as chairman. Reuters said Goyal also agreed to reduce his 51 per cent stake in the airline but would continue to be part of the company in some capacity even after stepping down as chairman.


Auto sales
SML Isuzu sold 1,282 vehicles in February 2019 against 965 vehicles in the same month a year ago. The stock closed 20 per cent up at Rs 682.55. 

Domestic sales of Mahindra & Mahindra stood at 52,915 vehicles, compared with 48,473 units during February 2018. Shares closed the day 0.43 per cent up at Rs 649.35.

Maruti Suzuki India saw a marginal decline in total sales at 1,48,682 units. The company had sold 1,49,824 units in February last year. The scrip closed 1.48 per cent up at Rs 6,933.20. 

Ashok Leyland saw an increase of 1 per cent in its domestic sales at 17,352 units. Shares of the company closed 0.23 per cent up at Rs 86.55.

Total trucks and buses sales of Eicher Motors came in at 6,268 units against 6,796 units a year ago. The scrip settled 0.19 per cent up at Rs 19,938.25. 

Escorts reported a 12 per cent increase in tractor sales at 7,240 units against 6,462 units in February 2018. Its shares closed 2.35 per cent up at Rs 674.30. 

Bajaj Auto reported a 10 per cent increase in total sales at 3,93,089 units against 3,57,883 units in the same month last year. The stock fell 1.16 per cent to close at Rs 2,862.90."
4,2019-03-05,Asian Paints,"Private banks and cement companies are where money would flow in said, Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder, 
Complete Circle Consultants, in an interview with ET Now. Also, one can be selective in consumption and tactical in OMCs, says Chadha. Edited excerpts: 


What is it that the market is pricing in? It seems this is a pre-election cheer which is coming in a tad too early?
It is a little early to call it pre-election cheers but what has happened is that while the entire market continues to focus on the geopolitical risk, a lot of other risks which the market was concerned about have abated a little bit. 

2018 was a year when we had some central banks hiking rates like in US and some of the emerging markets like India and Indonesia. There were some central bankers who were more accommodative. Probably this year you will see all central bankers being more accommodative. US is already indicating a pause in balance sheet contraction. India has already had a rate cut. China has now guided for lower end of the GDP at 6%. You could see both monetary and fiscal stimulus there. 

You will probably have a synchronised central bank accommodative stance this year which is positive for EMs. Also the threat of a full-blown trade war seems to have abated a little bit. Also India has really underperformed the EM basket. The emerging market index is up 11-12%. China is almost 18-20% up and we had underperformed. So. it could be a bit of catching up as well.


Which are those names which you would like to be part of your portfolio? Any particular segment within housing finance companies where you are more optimistic?
In the housing finance space, we have to differentiate the balance sheets. It looks to be a homogenous space, but it is not. A lot of the names have been under pressure -- the likes of Edelweiss or Repco or even Motilal because of their Aspire incurring losses. 

In case of L&T Finance, 60-65% of the book is mortgaged. The balance is developer loans and LAP. Also, NHP does not regulate HFCs as strongly as RBI does for some of the others in terms of banks. I also expect more regulation to come in once this crisis is fully taken care of. 

Within the HFC space, one safe bet is HDFC Limited. They have about six million homes which they have financed. They have a right combination of consumer and institutional book. Even if you see the institutional book, they are more focussed. The growth is coming from the lease rental discounting and construction finance and not much from the corporate loans to developers. We are a little selective here. I would consider something like a Can Fin in HFCs, where 80% of the book are linked to the salaried class, which again are mostly government employees. 

We have to watch out on the liability side. It should be more granular and on the lending side, the exposure to developer loans and the LAP should be a little lower. On consumer finance, the obvious position which I have been maintaining for long is Bajaj Finance. 


You seem to be betting on NCC. What kind of potential do you see over here? What is the long-term target price and do you believe now is a good time to enter?
We are positive on three fronts. They have a order book of more than Rs 34,000 crore, even in last quarter, they had a good EBIT with 12% margin. Most of these orders are government PSU backed. It is one of the largest construction companies right now. 

The only concern is the working capital days which is about the highest in the industry. Their receivable days are about 200 vis-à-vis about 120 for the industry. The safer bet could be L&T in the largecap space which is not necessarily construction, but the entire engineering construction -- the ECC space. In Q4, they have guided for almost Rs 40,000-50,000 crore of order book and in the first nine months, they were at about Rs 1.2 lakh crore.

If they have a Rs 40,000-50,000-crore order book, they will be on course to hit about 10% to 12% growth in orders and the good part is that there is improvement across the metrics. It is not only in terms of the diversification of orders. There are orders from hydrocarbons and refineries because the oil prices have been a little better. There are airports, water supply and they have this time re-categorised the orders into broadly four categories -- which is significant, large, major and mega. I am not really talking about the small orders which are Rs 1,000 crore. There is improvement in working capital cycle as well. So, in this space, we are fairly positive on largecap L&T and midcap NCC.


Tata Motors clocked it is best single day gain in about three years’ time. Do you think Tata Son’s business rejig to cut costs, the fact that they have assured that JLR turnaround is round the corner and the kind of rebound that we have seen in the Feb auto sales would that give you conviction to be a medium or long-term buyer in Tata Motors?
It is interestingly placed. If you see its sales breakup, the passenger cars actually grew 2% in Feb where the CV and the overall business was down. In case of JLR also, the US sales were up about 29%. If you add Germany, Italy and US and put together as a cluster minus China, it grew about 16%. 

There is lot of action in terms of ramping up their I-PACE model. There are couple of more SUV models on the Range Rover platform. So it will be an interesting space to watch out and I think Tata Motors has been attractive sub-200 for a long, long time. 

I think what has happened is that every quarter you had some disappointment or the other. I would like to watch out for Brexit and the China factor because that is where the high margin because US is mostly low margin sales. China is where they have the higher margin as well as volumes sales coming up. So, maybe with news of China cutting 3% VAT on manufacturing, there could be a slight improvement in their China sales.

In domestic business, the response to Harrier and some of the new SUVs which they are coming is quite good in terms of their dealer checks we have done. So it is an interesting one. If you want to buy it right now, maybe 20% now and then wait for a quarter and then maybe gradually accumulate.


Would you buy into Eicher sub Rs 20,000? The stock has recovered much from there and seeing a big move today?
A lot of pain was in the price when the stock was at around Rs 19,000 and sub 19,000. The numbers of February were also a little disappointing as it was approximately 64,000 units versus 70,000 which this fleet was expecting. If you look at it, the strike in one of their plants meant a loss of 3,000 units. So, it is a larger trend which is playing out here. I will not be a buyer right now on Eicher. I will try to wait and watch because I like to see two trends here, one is their new models which are at the 650 cc which is the Interceptor and the Terminator.

Also often not discussed is the commercial vehicle segment and they have some good technology in the medium weight commercial vehicles. We probably will have to see whether the CV cycle is on the downturn or it is a temporary phase. But it is good to add on dips. You can wait and watch for now on some of these auto names, but as I said lot of pain is in the price.


How are you playing the consumption theme? Do you believe that within the consumption space, you would tend to be very selective?
I would be. Every election in India is like a mini QE (quantitative easing). You see the cash in circulation goes up. It has already gone above the pre-DeMo level and a lot of the parallel side of the economy comes into the mainstream with the kind of spending we see.

We are already seeing government transferring about Rs 28,000 crore to the farmers which is part of the basic income support. There will be more loan waivers and as you get closer to election, there will be probably a lot of spending by the political parties. So. that makes me positive. 

There are two-three spaces I like here. The FMCG packs stands out, I like Nestle and HUL in the staples. Nestle is likely to launch about 13 t0 15 new products, you could have a topline growth of 15% after a long, long time and followed by a margin expansion or may be 80 to 100 bps. So, that looks attractive. 

HUL has come off a little bit in the last previous trading sessions. The food and the beverage segment after the acquisition would give them the distribution reach to add on to those gains so positive there. 

I also like some niche consumption plays which are like the pressure cooker and the kitchenware makers like a TTK prestige the market itself will probably grow 3 to 4x as rural areas are only 20-30% penetrated. 

I also like some of the while we have spoke about Info Edge right and Zomato probably the unlisted space has an advantage on the food aggregator side but I like Jubilant for the fact that there has been a good price correction. They are cutting down on their Dunkin Donuts outlets which did not pan out well. They have already cut down from 70 to about 35. The same store growth is about 20-21% and they are now venturing into the Chinese Kitchen which will probably give them some variety to take on to these food aggregator so those are some of the ideas in the space.


How would you approach not just OMCs but also some of the other names like ONGC and some of the gas names like MGL, IGL?
There are two parts to the portfolio. One is buy to hold which is your HDFC and Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints of the world and one is buy to sell. A lot of these OMCs, some of the PSU names you spoke about possibly fall there. One has to be a little tactical in OMCs. HPCL for example at sub-200 was a good buy. It was almost book value. 

Also we have to look at the marketing infrastructure. Some of these are virtually oligopolies. There are chances of obvious government regulating through tinkering with excise duties and subsidies. HPCL, in particular, is one of the largest lube based refineries in India. If I were to be a little tactical here, I will probably pick up HPCL. 

You are right about the city gas distributors. MGL looks very, very good. We are already seeing three-wheeler sales turning positive for most of the auto makers even in February. So domestic connections, increasing three wheelers moving to the CNG and slightly lesser regulation in the gas space compared to petrol and diesel, gives them an edge. 

But again you have to be more tactical here. Some of the other PSU names where you can be a little tactical is NTPC. It is trading at about 11 times. It has a good dividend yield. The coal production is up by almost 7% after a long time. The dispatches are up about 3%. It is a virtual monopoly play. This is almost like 7-8% dividend yield on it. So maybe that part of the portfolio could be looked at, but as I said tactically.


In the next leg of the rally, where do you think the contribution is going to come in from sectorally?
If you see the overall report which has come last year on the entire banking sector, the private corporate banks are getting the bulk of the flows. If you look at for example current accounts, the share of PSU bank has even fallen from 58% last year to 54%. In deposits, they are losing market share and by deposits I mean saving, current and term deposits. 

Once you lose current account share, it basically means that cash management is being handed over to the private banks. The corporate loan fund are going to the private banks which affects the PSU banks’ trade, their fx income and it has a cascading impact on their overall fee and interest income. 

So they will continue to gain market share and bankex typically grows one and a half times GDP. If private banks can gain market share, probably they will grow at 15% to 18% as a category. Also, the credit cost is likely to come off by 100 bps for private banks largely led by ICICI and Axis. Now on a large base, a 1% reduction in credit cost would translate to Rs 5,000-7,000 crore of bottom line movement. That is one space which is looking very good. 

Some of the construction names we have discussed in the capital goods space looks good. Cement valuations look very, very attractive. There have been a price hike of Rs 50 to Rs 60 on an average in south, about Rs 30-40 in other parts of the country. Good picks here could be Shree Cement which is largely north based and ACC as well because the stock has been a little under pressure due to having older splant and some of the clinker capacities are not really coming through. So, these are the broad sectors, which liquidity would chase."

9,2019-03-11,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Hopes of the incumbent BJP coming back to power made the stock bulls go all guns blazing as key benchmark indices surged over 1 per cent on Monday. 

The Narendra Modi-led alliance will sweep a majority of parliamentary seats up for grabs in the general elections starting April 11, the CVoter opinion poll showed. 

India will go to polls from April 11, spread over 7 phases, and the results will be out on May 23, the Election Commission announced on Sunday evening. 

Besides, strong foreign inflows and an appreciating rupee ticked all the right boxes for the equity market. 

The BSE benchmark Sensex rallied 383 points, or 1.04 per cent, to 37,054 while the NSE Nifty ended at 11,171 points, up 136 points, or 1.23 per cent. In the 30-share BSE pack, five ended in the red and 25 rose.

In the Sensex box, Airtel led with a gain of over 8 per cent. Power Grid, Coal India, Reliance Industries, Tata Steel and Asian Paints were among others that logged solid gains. 

Barring IT, buying kept all sectors buzzing. BSE Telecom soared over 5 per cent mainly on account of index heavyweight Airtel. BSE Energy, Oil & Gas, Metals and Consumer Durables were among other top sectoral gainers, rising up to 3 per cent. 

Here's a quick glance at factors for today's market rally.



Pre-election rally
According to market experts, investors are factoring in a win for the government in power in the upcoming elections, which set off a rally in domestic markets. Ashish P Sommaiyaa of Motilal Oswal said the market is already in a pre-election rally. 

""Different people have their different opinions, but I do not think the market as an aggregate is going to leave all of this for suspense on May 23. The market will have its own process of discounting which we are already seeing because there are trends which are available and everybody is aware of what they are reading or what they are picking up,"" Sommaiyaa said.



Foreign inflows keep growing
Overseas investors have pumped in a net Rs 2,741 crore into the capital markets in the first five trading sessions of March, mainly due to positive sentiment. As per analysts, the change is triggered by domestic as well as global factors and the trend is likely to continue for some time, according to PTI. 



Rupee flexes its muscles
The rupee rose as much as 21 paise to 69.94 against the dollar on Monday after selling in American currency by banks and exporters. The domestic unit logged gains of 78 paise last week. The appreciation in the rupee is mainly on account of strong FII buying. 



Dovish Fed comments
US Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday reiterated that the Fed would continue with its 'wait-and-see' approach on rate hikes and will make sure not to shock financial markets as it stabilises its bond portfolio. Powell said it does not see problems in the US economy that warrant an immediate change in its policy.



Global markets go up
Asian shares inched up on Monday as Chinese markets rebounded on hopes of more policy support for the slowing economy, but surprisingly weak US employment data raised doubts about the strength of the global economy and limited gains. European shares were seen rising, with spread-betters expecting Britain's FTSE to rise 0.7 per cent, France's CAC 0.6 per cent and Germany's DAX 0.5 per cent, Reuters reported. 


Expert view
The recent surge is largely reflecting buoyancy on the local front despite signs of slowdown in global economy. The breakout in the benchmark index, after four-month long consolidation phase, has further boosted sentiment. Amid all, we feel stock selection is the key, as participation is limited mainly to the quality counters. Nifty has potential of testing 11,300-11,400 zone in near future- Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking"
10,2019-03-12,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A recent opinion poll that predicted NDA retaining power in the upcoming elections has put the bulls in-charge on the Street.

NSE barometer Nifty has broken above its three-month long consolidation range and is eyeing 78.6 per cent retracement of the September-October 2018 decline near 11,400 level. 

As such, 20 stocks look poised for a rally, according to momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The gauge has signalled an upward crossover -- a sign of bullish undertone -- on these counters, hinting at a possible upside. 

Signs on the ground lend credence to the emerging trend. Many of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late. 

The list includes Nifty constituents Bharti Airtel, Titan Company and other blue chips such as paints makers Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac, pharma firms Biocon and GSK Pharmaceuticals, Dabur India and Adani Transmission. 

Aditya Birla Fashion, Avenue Supermarts, Prestige Estates, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Future Lifestyle and Thyrocare Technologies are other prominent names that figure in the list. 



MACD -- the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages -- is used for indicating trend reversals in traded securities or indices. 

 A nine-day exponential moving average called the signal line is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. When MACD goes above the signal line, it throws up a bullish sign, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, three stocks Dhampur Sugar, Swan Energy and Atul have observed a downward crossover, signaling bearish sentiment on these counters.



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio. Traders should use other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend, say analysts.

Analysts said the ongoing rally has more legs.

“It’s better to stay on the positive side and expect this rally to extend towards 11,300-11,400 in days to come. The previous hurdle of 11,050-11,000 range is likely to play a sheet anchor role for the index. Traders should identify potential candidates, who are poised for blown up moves. Do watch out for auto and auto ancillary space, along with a few midcaps in the private banking space,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

The index has moved above the immediate resistance of previous swing high of 11,118 levels (February 7) and closed higher. This is positive indication for the Nifty, said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities.

“The short-term trend of the Nifty is positive. One may expect further upside for the short term. Next upside is to be watched at 11,250-70 in the next few sessions,” Shetti said.


Understanding MACD 
  A close look at the stock chart of Titan Company reveals that every time the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock tended to show an upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 2 per cent higher at Rs 1,090.55 on the NSE."
11,2019-03-12,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Risk appetite of investors went up by a few notches on Tuesday who appear to be super bullish in the run-up to the general elections in April-May. 

FPIs' renewed buying, strong overseas cues, rupee's strength against the dollar, and improved prospects of a stable Narendra Modi-led government after the elections made sure the bulls stuck to the script.

The Sensex surged 530 points during the day, but settled at 37,536, up 482 points, or 1.30 per cent. NSE's Nifty closed at 11,301, with a gain of 133 points, or 1.19 per cent.

Midcaps and smallcaps played ball as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed 0.65 per cent and 1.07 per cent up, respectively.

We run you through the market highlights of Tuesday. 


Investors richer by Rs 1.23 lakh crore
Tuesday's rally created Rs 1.23 lakh crore for BSE investors as the total market capitalisation of BSE firms jumped to Rs 1,48,17,502.49 crore, from Rs 1,46,93,581.01 crore on Monday. In the last two straight sessions, investors have earned Rs 3.49 lakh crore.


Nifty Bank hits record
The Nifty Bank index closed at a record high of 28,443.70, jumping 477 points or 1.71 per cent. Out of 12 components of the index, five logged gains and 7 declined. ICICI Bank (3.42 per cent), IndusInd Bank (3.24 per cent), HDFC Bank (1.86 per cent), Axis Bank (1.10 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (1 per cent) settled with gains. However, RBL Bank (down 1.46 per cent), Federal Bank (down 1.26 per cent), Punjab National Bank (down 0.87 per cent), Bank of Baroda (down 0.86 per cent), IDFC First Bank (down 0.60 per cent), YES Bank (down 0.51 per cent) and State Bank of India (down 0.02 per cent) were top decliners. 


254 stocks hit upper circuits
As many as 254 stocks, including Kwality, Bhartiya International, Asian Star, IG Petrochemicals, Mangalam Drugs & Organics and ESS DEE Aluminium, hit their upper circuits on the BSE today. Punj Lloyd, Soma Textiles & Industries, Kaushalya Infrastructure, Cyber Media and Nu Tek India were among the 170 stocks that hit their lower circuits. 


HDFC Life OFS a big draw
The two-day offer for sale (OFS) by HDFC Life Insurance Company saw a strong response from non-retail investors on Tuesday as the issue was subscribed 1,83 times on Day 1. The issue received institutional bids for 16.4 crore shares against the non-retail quota of 8.95 crore. 


Airtel jumps 5%
Bharti Airtel shares jumped 5.12 per cent to close at Rs 350.80 after Bharti Infratel said Airtel was to sell some of its stake in the company. Bharti Airtel will pare its stake in the telecom tower company by more than half to 18.3 per cent. Shares of Bharti Infratel slipped 0.72 per cent to close at Rs 317.05.


ICICI Bank gains traction
Shares of ICICI Bank closed 3.27 per cent up at Rs 388.20, clocking healthy gains for the second consecutive session. Several brokerages appear confident about the prospects of the bank. Reliance Securities has a 'Buy' call on the stock with a target of Rs 470. JM Financial has a buy call too with a target price of Rs 430. 


Aurobindo Pharma in a sweet spot
Shares of Aurobindo Pharma closed 3.19 per cent higher at Rs 772.65 on reports that the pharma major had received Establishment Inspection report (EIR) for Unit-4 facility in which the USFDA has closed issued Form 483. The USFDA had inspected the Unit-4 facility in December and had issued Form 483. 


Fresh tranche of CPSE ETF coming? 
The government is considering a fresh tranche of CPSE ETF to raise Rs 4,000-5,000 crore this month, according to a report by ETNow citing sources. However, there is no final call on the fresh tranche. Last month, as much as Rs 10,000 crore came in from Bharat-22 ETF and, another Rs 5,379 crore from the sale of Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) stake in Axis Bank. 


55 stocks signal rise
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 55 counters on the BSE, indicating that these counters may witness a rise in coming sessions. Among them were Bharti Airtel, GTPL Hathway, Titan Company, Biocon, Dabur India, Asian Paints and Future Lifestyle. On the other hand, 21 stocks, including Power Finance Corporation, Dhampur Sugar, Atul and Medinova Diagnostic Services, showed bearish crossovers.


IT pack lone sectoral loser
The IT index closed 0.22 per cent lower at 14,989.88, emerging as the lone sectoral loser on the BSE. Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Mindtree and Larsen & Toubro Infotech were the top drag on the index, in that order."
12,2019-03-14,Asian Paints,"HDFC Mutual Fund’s chief investment officer Prashant Jain has become the first Indian fund manager to complete 25 years managing a single fund. He achieved this in 2019 with HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund which has generated an alpha of 9.54 per cent over the Sensex since 1994, Morningstar Direct data show.

HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund (the erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund), launched in February 1994, is the largest equity-oriented fund in India with assets of Rs 37,395 crore as of February 2019. The fund, now categorised as dynamic asset allocation (equity can be 0 per cent to 100 per cent), in its earlier avatar as HDFC Prudence Fund (a balanced fund). Data from Morningstar Direct show that when compared to other global funds managed by a single fund manager for 25 years and above, Jain’s fund has generated an alpha of 9.54 per cent over the Sensex, second only to legendary Peter Lynch who managed Fidelity Magellan till 1977, generating an alpha of 10.92 per cent.


Anthony Bolton managed Fidelity Special Situations from December 17, 1979 to December 31, 2007 and generated an alpha of 9.2 per cent. HDFC Balanced has returned an annualised 18.48 per cent since inception.

Financial planners point out that one of the main reason for Jain’s success is his ability to identify market cycles ahead of time and ride through cycles. For example, he made the most of the IT-driven rally between 1995 and 2000 by buying Infosys that multiplied 113 times. Between December 2000 and December 2017, Jain was quick to spot the capex/banking and commodity stock rally identifying stocks like BHEL which rose 35x, L&T 33x, Reliance 19x and Tata Steel 16x and SBI 14x. In the next cycle between December 2007 and December 2017, where FMCG and pharma stocks rallied he bought HUL which rose 8x, ITC 5x, Lupin 8x and HDFC Bank 6x.

Currently, Jain is betting on corporate banks, utilities and capex with stocks like Infosys, ICICI Bank, SBI, L&T and NTPC being the top holdings in his portfolio. Jain has had his shares of misses as well. He missed multi-baggers like Kotak Bank, IndusInd Bank, Eicher Motors and Asian Paints. Then there are a number of stocks where he exited early. Though he was quick to spot Shree Cement and made 10 fold returns, he sold off early at Rs 700. Similarly, he sold out Page Industries early on at Rs 7,000.

“Jain has a sharp ability to spot cycles ahead of time. He adopts a long-term approach to stock picking, sticks to his investment mandate and is not worried about underperformance in the short term,” says Himanshu Srivastava, senior research analyst at Morningstar India.

While Jain’s strategy has worked in the long term, it has also tested investor patience in the short term. “The transition years, where he books profits and identifies stocks to ride the next cycle have been the most difficult for Jain, as returns lag those of peers in the short term. However, if you consider block of 3 or 5 years the returns are good,” says Deepak Chhabria, CEO, Axiom Financial Services."
13,2019-03-16,Asian Paints,"BY- Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay

For a large number of urban Indians, there is no escaping Prime Minister Narendra Modi the first thing in the morning. While rushing to work, going through morning chores or even still half-asleep, the resonating voice of Kailash Kher and a motley crew of children backing him intrudes into homes, reminding people of their ‘larger responsibility’ and the man pushing it.

Prasoon Joshi’s lyrics set to the tune of Vishal Khurana blares across colonies as municipal garbage collection vans inch through lanes symbolising the PM’s omnipresence. The ‘Swachh Bharat’ song acts as an implicit anthem-jingle to Modi, bearing the same impact as the old Jenson & Nicholson tagline: Whenever you see colour, think of us.

Playing since October 2014 when the Swachh Bharat mission was launched, the song is an early example of the current administration’s ceaseless campaigning prowess. Heading into elections, the benefits of being in ‘permanent campaign mode’ is obvious.

Yet, there is also a flip side. Marketing success stories require more than a great line. Returning to the Jenson &Nicholson tagline, there were customers who read it, saw the colours and bought Asian Paints. Fortunately for Modi, there is no other resilient ‘brand’ lurking. But there is no knowing what surprise may spring up, or when GoI starts becoming its own nemesis.

This possibility exists and BJP should barricade itself from a possible backlash of marketing overkill. This recurring high-octave pitch runs the risk of irritating people by being constantly in the face. Every incumbent is confronted with the challenge of its claims not matching people’s expectations. There is little manoeuvrability now, since BJP’s campaign is already committed to a certain path.


Your Job is Not My Job

If BJP’s principal slogan, ‘Modi hai to mumkin hai’ (With Modi, everything is possible), and its outreach programme targeting 220 million beneficiaries have an upside, they have a downside as well. On the one hand, they reinforce claims of providing, what party president Amit Shah described recently, a ‘mazboot’ (strong) leader capable of providing a stable, strong, secure, resurgent and caring India.

On the other hand, by stressing the benefits of egalitarian programmes, BJP is opening GoI’s actions to scrutiny and assessment — that Modi’s government may have failed to accomplish what it had set out to do: generate jobs, settle farm distress, boost non-agricultural rural income.…

‘Whataboutery’ has been a standard BJP tactic since 2014. It has been successful in quashing Opposition and critics in TV debates (sic). But using the same tactic with voters runs a risk. Shah was asked about two biggest concerns facing India: jobs and rural stress. Instead, he rattled off the significant rise in bank accounts, cooking gas, toilets, houses, electricity, health insurance, roads, railways and loans.

His argument was that if these people were having all these, they must be having jobs too. Shah challenged critics for a ‘debate at any chowk’ for him to prove that ‘no other government has done more to generate jobs’.

The electorate, of course, will be guided solely by their opinion about whether these initiatives have provided them jobs. And voters don’t debate with leaders. They will vote.

Because events such as Pulwama and Balakot stare us in the face, it seems that there is a consensus that the rationale for voting in the 2019 elections will be neatly divided into two phases: pre- and post-February 14, 2019. But with such evidence yet to come by, this, at best, remains a supposition. Also, historical benchmarks for (perceptions of) military successes translating into electoral victories is hardly watertight. Victory in Kargil in 1999 did not boost the ruling BJP’s tally (182 seats) in the Lok Sabha elections later that year beyond what it had earlier secured in the 1998 elections (182 seats). But Indira Gandhi’s Congress rode on the triumph of the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war and swept state assembly polls in March 1972.

Globally, the shock defeat of the Conservatives in Britain under Winston Churchill after World War 2 remains a lasting paradox of electoral politics. Additionally, recent military terrorist groups backed by Pakistan can’t be compared to any previous accomplishments in conventional wars. With China once again blocking the UN Security Council’s inclusion of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar in the ‘global terrorist’ list, Modi-Shah’s claim of bringing ‘glory and pride to the nation on the world stage’ will be taken with a pinch of salt.


2019 is Here and Now

BJP’s prospects considerably depend on the Opposition parties’ failure so far to ‘defeat’ Modi with their actions. Congress remains fixated — as party president Rahul Gandhi declared at his sister Priyanka Vadra’s induction into the polls — on 2022, when assembly polls are due in Uttar Pradesh. While Virat Kohli could have afforded to declare the ODI series against Australia as ‘experiment-time’ before the World Cup, Gandhi has no such luxury. This is the ‘World Cup’. Unless Opposition parties forge better alliances, they may well heed Omar Abdullah advice, ‘Forget 2019. Plan for 2024’. For both Modi’s BJP and the Opposition, this is an election to lose."
14,2019-03-18,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty registered a gap-up start to Monday's session on hopes that the US Fed will sound dovish in its policy meet next week.

A fall in India's trade deficit print to a 17-month low in February, on a sharp decline in import of oil, gold and electronics, was seen as a major positive by investors. 

Besides, rupee's continuous rise against the US dollar, sustained FPI inflow, easing crude oil prices and positive global cues boosted the risk appetite of investors. 

The rupee opened 18 paise higher at 68.92 against the US dollar and global crude oil prices eased on concerns over fall in global demand.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 4,323.49 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday, data available with NSE suggested. 

Sensex jumped about 300 points, while Nifty topped 11,510 in early deals. 

Around 9:25 am, the BSE benchmark Sensex was 261 points, or 0.69 per cent, up at 38,285. The NSE Nifty was 77 points, or 0.68 per cent, up at 11,504 at that time. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.61 per cent and 0.51 per cent up, respectively. 

Shares of Power Grid, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints and HDFC Bank were among the top gainers in the Sensex index.

Maruti, however, declined nearly 3 per cent to trade as the top loser in the Sensex kitty. Vedanta, NTPC, Sun Pharma and Hindustan Unilever were also in the red.

Among the sectoral indices on BSE, only healthcare and auto were trading with nominal losses, due to losses in shares of Lupin, Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, Dr Reddy's Labs, Cipla, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Motherson Sumi Systems."
15,2019-03-19,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: Star India is set to rake in over Rs 2,100 crore in advertising revenues from 12th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a sharp 20% jump over the previous season, when it had netted Rs 1,750 crore across TV and digital platforms.

“It’s been a really strong year and the response from the advertisers has overshot our earlier projections. This is testimony to the value IPL delivered last year and the plans we have this season,” said a highly placed source, adding that over 80% inventory has already been sold. IPL 2019 will kick off on March 23.

“I think Star has done fabulously well this season. Till last week, Rs 2,100 crore had been logged. The strategy to go language intensive has really helped. Also, a March IPL means residual budgets of last year are coming in handy and new fiscal budgets kicking in April,” said Dr. Sandeep Goyal, chairman, Mogae Media.

Some of the big advertisers who have come on board across TV and Hotstar this season include Coca-Cola, PhonePe, Vivo, Oppo, Swiggy, Maruti Suzuki, Dream 11, MRF, MakeMyTrip, Voltas, Asian Paints, Samsung LED, Future Group, Byju’s, Vimal Pan Masala, Mondelez, Mobile Premier League and Polycab.

Advertisers which have taken only digital sponsorship on Hotstar, include Amazon Pay, Flipkart, Madhura Garments and Nestle Maggi. Shashi Sinha, CEO at IPG Mediabrands, said the overall ad spends on IPL this season is “far better” than the previous season.



In an earlier interaction, Gautam Thakar, CEO, Star Sports, had told ET that IPL is by far India’s biggest property across genres and the company is excited to take it to the next level.

“We are better equipped this year with what can be done to make it the biggest IPL ever,” he had said.

IPL has been the only property that has delivered viewership growth year-on-year, over the last 11 years.

Star India had aired the league across six languages and 12 channels last year. This year, the network will show IPL across 22 channels. The Sunday matches will be aired on Star Gold (Hindi), Vijay Super (Tamil), Maa Movies (Telugu), Star Suvarna (Kannada), Jalsha Movies (Bengali), Star Pravah (Marathi) and Asianet Plus (Malayalam). Regional sports channels in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, and Bengali (to be launched ahead of IPL) will carry matches on all days.

Star had incurred a loss of over Rs 1,200 crore from the 11th edition of the annual cricket extravaganza as per ET estimates. Star India had done bundled deals — selling both TV and digital together — for Rs 10 lakh per 10 seconds ad spot. While it met with resistance, the company managed to recover about Rs 1,750 crore, a 30% jump over previous year."
16,2019-03-20,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: While BSE Sensex is barely 600 points (or 1.6 per cent) away from its all-time high of 38,989 hit last August, only five index stocks –ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank and Infosys – are reflecting this bullishness.

Analysts said while one may expect the index to hit fresh highs going forward, a majority index stocks are unlikely to hit their record high levels.

Data showed half of index stocks need to rise at least 18 per cent from current levels to hit their respective record highs. As many as 10 index stocks need to rally anywhere between 50 per cent and 200 per cent to hit their previous peak levels.

“The performance of the Sensex pack has been a concentrated one. Some stocks have played catchup of late. But if we remain at these levels or somewhat higher levels, some stocks will perform. But don’t expect record high levels for majority of the index stocks,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.

The combined market value of the five index stocks hitting all-time high levels (in 2019 so far) has climbed 6.19 per cent since August 2018, even as the rest 25 saw a 7 per cent erosion in their combined market value.

What does it mean? It means only a few stocks have driven up the indices in recent weeks. It was the case with the rally that the index saw from November till the start of February.


Risk-reward turning favourable
While some analysts say the risk-reward us turning favourable, others don’t feel the same way. Goldman Sachs has upgraded its view on Indian equities to ‘overweight’ from ‘market weight’ and set a one-year target for Nifty at 12,500 – a potential gain of over 8 per cent. The foreign brokerage is betting on cyclicals over defensives and exporters. These sectors have the highest weight in the Nifty pack.

Morgan Stanley said the Indian equity market could start pricing in a stronger election outcome in the coming weeks, which may help Nifty break its four-month range on the upside.

Kotak Institutional Equities doubts the rally.

“Indian market’s catch-up trade with other emerging markets after a period of under-performance in the first six weeks of CY2019 may be largely over, with weaker reward-risk balance for many largecap and midcap stocks after a 10-30 per cent rise in many stocks over the past 3-4 weeks,” the brokerage said in a note.

It said heavyweight stocks like Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and HUL are trading above their fair values. It says Asian Paints and Bajaj Finance, which are near record high levels, are now at prices above their fair values.

Data suggests HDFC, Asian Paints, L&T, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HCL Technologies are among the stocks that are up to 10 per cent away from making fresh record highs. They hit their all-time high levels between February and September last year.


Can banks anchor rally?
AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital said Bank Nifty has hit an all-time high level ahead of the NSE barometer. “Fundamentally, the banking space looks exciting, especially the private ones which have been key beneficiaries of the NCLT resolutions. In case of IT, another heavyweight sector in the index, no downside is likely in the light of a rising rupee, but upside too is limited,” he said. 

Prabhakar says the ongoing rally has legs. “You don’t need all stocks to push the index to records levels,” said he.

A few new leaders may also emerge in the market.

“A few stocks from the corporate banking and industrial segments could emerge as new leaders, but others like those from auto and metals sectors continue to present a weak outlook and may remain a drag on the index,” said Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan. 


A lease of life for battered stocks
Since its February 19 low point, when Sensex hit sub-35,300 level, a few underperforming stocks have started rising again. NTPC has rallied 18 per cent to cut its losses since August 2018 to 5 per cent. The stock still needs to rally 84 per cent to reclaim its high point hit in January 2008.

YES Bank is up 15 per cent from February low, but is off 33 per cent from its August 2018 high. This stock needs to rally 65 per cent to reclaim Rs 404 level it had hit on August 20,2018.

Vedanta, Coal India, Sun Pharma and ONGC are among the stocks that have gained 10-15 per cent from their February lows, but still need to gain 80-180 per cent to reach previous high points.


Non-performing stocks
As many as 20 of the 30 index stocks have been trading in the red since August 2018 high, show data. Auto stocks Tata Motors, M&M, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp are down 31 per cent, 29 per cent, 24 per cent and 15 per cent from the point Sensex hit its high point last August. They are down 30-70 per cent from their respective record high levels. Prabhakar says the auto segment may not perform well for some time due to production cuts.

Metals & mining stocks Vedanta and Coal India are down 23 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. ITC and HUL have also failed to contribute to the recovery and are down 7 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. YES Bank has been the worst index performer. 

“Pharma, which performed pretty well between 2000 to 2017, is not participating in this rally. While IT, FMCG, private banks and NBFC have been doing well, metals and cements too have been laggards,” Prabhakar said."
17,2019-03-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The bull rally for the Sensex stalled on Friday as the benchmark stumbled for the first time in nine days. 

Losses in bank stocks and index heavyweight RIL poured cold water on gains in L&T, NTPC and Infosys. 

Most analysts see the end to the eight-day rally as nothing more than a breather as foreign inflows continue to stream in on the back of hopes of the ruling BJP winning a second term after the general elections. 

Market reversed all its early gains, landing in negative territory at the close.

Fitch Ratings cut India's economic growth forecast for 2019-20 to 6.8 per cent from its previous estimate of 7 per cent, on weaker than expected momentum in the economy. This development did not sit well with market participants. Soon, selling followed. 

Slowdown fears gripped global markets too amid disappointing data from Germany and a dovish turn by the US Federal Reserve. 

The 30-share Sensex declined 222 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 38,165, with 10 components in the green and 20 in the red. 

NSE's Nifty settled below the 11,500-mark at 11,457, down 64 points, or 0.56 per cent. The 50-share bloc saw 19 stocks march up and 31 retreat. 


Here is a round-up of what happened in the market today.

Tata Steel with a fall of 2.47 per cent bore the brunt in the Sensex team. RIL (down 2.44 per cent), Maruti (down 1.84 per cent), SBI (down 1.80 per cent) and Kotak Bank (down 1.22 per cent) had a hard landing too.

By contrast, NTPC, L&T, Asian Paints, Tata Steel and Infosys emerged as top gainers, rising up to 3.67 per cent. 

Midcaps and smallcaps declined in line with the benchmark Sensex. The BSE Midcap index closed 0.59 per cent lower while Smallcap dropped 0.44 per cent. 

Of the 19 sectoral indices on the BSE, only five gained, namely basic materials, utilities, capital goods, power and realty. 

Energy stocks took the worst hammering as the Energy index slipped 2.01 per cent. Oil & energy, telecom and auto too met with the same fate, slipping over 1 per cent each.

In the NSE sectoral space, barring realty, all indices ran out of luck. 


Factors at play


Fitch cuts India's GDP growth forecast 
Fitch Ratings cutting India's economic growth forecast spoiled mood. ""While we have cut our growth forecasts for the next fiscal year (2019-20) on weaker-than-expected momentum, we still see Indian GDP growth to hold up reasonably well, at 6.8 per cent, followed by 7.1 per cent in FY21,"" Fitch said in its Global Economic Outlook. 

This sparked selling in Indian stocks which could not take anything exiting from Asian shares.


Economic warhorse out of breath
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index measuring activity in German services and manufacturing, which together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 51.5, its lowest reading since June 2013.

This development added to global slowdown worries, which were earlier set off by the Fed's assessment of the US economy. 

European stocks wiped out early gains, with German shares tumbling 0.6 per cent to hit their lowest in two weeks. Equities in Paris and London FTSE tumbled 0.8 per cent. Europe's auto sector led the falls, dropping one per cent, Reuters reported. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe slipped 0.2 per cent, pulling away from the 5-1/2 months high hit earlier in the week. 


Rupee feels the pinch
The domestic currency roiled the outlook as it wiped off gains against the greenback. After gaining as much as 30 paise against the dollar, the rupee slipped some 17 paise to hit intraday low of 69.10. 


Expert-take

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

Domestic market ended on a weak note as investors turned to profit booking, given the sharp rally in last two weeks and weak global cues. The US Fed has indicted that there will be no rate hike this year and ended its ongoing QE tightening programme due to concerns over economic growth. Uncertainties over Brexit deal and delay in trade deal between US and China continued to impact global markets. Global bond yields were in decline as global central banks were tweaking their monetary policy to support growth. This is likely to benefit emerging markets like India in the medium term."
18,2019-03-22,Asian Paints,"Domestic equity benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty slipped over half a per cent in Friday’s trade after Fitch Ratings cut India's GDP growth projection for next financial year to 6.8 per cent from 7 per cent earlier on weaker-than-expected growth momentum. 

Snapping its eight-day winning streak, the 30-share Sensex settled 222 points down at 38,164, while the 50-pack Nifty shut shop 64.15 points down at 11,456.

Let’s check out the movers and shakers of Friday’s trade. 


147 stocks look bearishAs many as 147 stocks, including Power Finance, Coal India, NMDC, Allahabad Bank, TCS and ICICI Prudential Life, showed bearish crossovers on momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, on BSE. On the other hand, eight stocks, including Reliance Naval, MEP Infra, Ducon Infratechnologies, ICICI Lombard and Karda Constructions witnessed bullish crossovers. 


280 stocks hit lower circuitsUnitech, Binani Industries, Dion Global and Ruchi Soya were among 280 stocks that hit lower circuits on BSE, while Frontline Securities, Reliance Communications, Polychem, Ugar Sugar Works and Jai Balaji were among 153 stocks that hit upper circuits.


Nifty Bank kisses 30,000Before closing 0.84 points down at 29,582, Bank Nifty hit the 30,000-mark for the first time ever. Banking majors SBI, PNB, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank all slipped and settled 1.94 per cent, 2.67 per cent, 0.37 per cent and 1.04 per cent lower at Rs 297.90, Rs 91.05, Rs 391.45 and Rs 2,275.10, respectively.

Power, realty, CG indices only winnersExcept for BSE Power (up 0.85 per cent), Realty (up 0.70 per cent) and Capital Goods (up 0.60 per cent) indices, all other sectoral indices ended in the red on BSE. The BSE Energy index plunged the most at 2.01 per cent, followed by Telecom (down 1.42 per cent) and Auto (down 1.42 per cent) indices and Bankex (down 0.75 per cent).


Kansai Nerolac slipsShares of Kansai Nerolac plunged as much as 4.67 per cent after global financial firm CLSA downgraded the stock to ‘sell’, citing demand headwinds as the auto sector is reeling under pressure. The scrip, however, gave up the gains and closed 2.48 per cent down at Rs 449.10.


Who moved my SensexNPTC, L&T, Asian Paints, Tata Steel, Infosys, ONGC, Coal India, Axis Bank and YES Bank capped the downside of BSE Sensex, while Tata Motors, Reliance Industries, Maruti Suzuki, State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank proved the biggest drag.

It was followed by Suzlon (number of shares traded: 9.46 crore), Punjab National Bank (6.96 crore) and NTPC (5.37 crore). On the other hand, HDFC Bank (Rs 1,736 crore) finished as most active stock in terms of value, followed by Reliance Industries (Rs 1,558 crore) and Maruti Suzuki (Rs 1,132 crore).


SpiceJet flies highShares of low-cost carrier SpiceJet climbed over 7 per cent after data showed its passenger traffic rose 5.62 per cent in February on a month-on-month basis. Passenger load factor for SpiceJet jumped to 94 per cent in February from 90.9 per cent in January, while InterGlobe Aviation-owned IndiGo’s load factor grew 88.40 per cent against 86.40 per cent in January."
19,2019-03-22,Asian Paints,"I would not be surprised if the market again starts moving up after a day or two’s correction, said Sudip Bandyopadhyay,
  
  
  Group Chairman, Inditrade Capital, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Markets have seemed to taper off in the last couple of sessions. Is it profit booking or is there any other factor that you are tracking?
The market has been moving up pretty fast for the last 10-15 trading days and some amount of profit booking, correction, whatever you call it was becoming overdue. I would not get too worried about the correction which we had seen today. There should have been some correction even earlier but having said that, I will like to mention here that the mood continues to be positive. 

The bias for the market is definitely positive. FIIs are putting in a lot of money to work in Indian markets and I would not be surprised if the market again starts moving up after a day or two’s correction. We have to be really prepared for the upward movement in the near future. There was a little bit of correction here and there is par for the course.


Speaking of ADAG, do you believe that at least one of the road blocks is out of the way after R-Comm paying off Ericsson? Is there potential to play this space or it would absolutely not merit an investment?
I will definitely stay away both from the ADAG basket as well as the telecom sector in particular. There are too many moving parts in both and it is better from the investor’s point of view to stay away from these counters at this stage. 

The uncertainties are still very much there. It is not that things have settled in either the telecom space where RComm was playing as well as the entire ADAG debt related issues. There are still so many issues which needs to be resolved. For a trader, it makes sense to buy and sell taking the temporary opportunities but from investment point of view, it is absolutely a no-no. 

If at all somebody is really keen to invest, the only company in the ADAG pack where they can look at putting money to work is the asset management piece. That is a good business and obviously there will be transaction soon and value unlocking may happen.


What would be your strategy on the OMC basket going ahead?
Absolutely stay away. Yesterday crude shot up in the international market. We were closed for Holi but it was close to $70 per barrel and we are again getting into a territory which is quite treacherous as far as the Indian markets are concerned. We have an election coming very soon. During this phase, it is absolutely impossible for the government to let the OMCs pass on the crude price hike to the consumers. 

If there is a flare up in the crude prices, the OMCs will end up bearing the burden and so this is not the time to play in OMCs. One should wait and watch. Fundamentally, these companies look good. They have a decent quality of management and out of the entire PSU pack, probably, they are the best managed bunch of businesses. But having said that, this is definitely not the time to buy into the crude. 


Within the banking space, it has managed to breach record highs but within the banking space it is the PSU banks they are showing some lustre after showing significant underperformance for the last couple of years. What do you think is changing over there?
The excitement over the last few days is pretty much driven by government action -- whether it is the decision to recapitalise Bank of Baroda by Rs 5,000 crore which came out today or the launch of the fund of which the PSU banks were a part. 

Some of these actions created some excitement in the PSU stocks and PSU banks in particular but the fundamental issues have not yet been resolved and that is what we believe. 

The IBC process and the Bankruptcy Code have started yielding some result and some of the bad assets are getting close to resolution and that is definitely a positive development. But having said that, there is still a long, long way to go before we can say that the PSU banks are out of the woods, have been fully recapitalised and are in a position to grab back market share.

I do not think I will go and start buying PSU banks in a hurry. I do not think I will recommend that to my investors. While somebody is really keen on PSU banks, I would probably recommend them to go and buy SBI. SBI of course, is a slightly different bank. They have a whole lot of things which the other banks lack including top class management. Other than SBI, I will like to stay away from the PSU banking pack at this stage. If somebody is keen on banking, there are more small and midcap private sector corporate facing banks which can be looked at at this stage. 


While we have got some amount of capacity build up and consolidation, we have just seen the metal stocks getting hammered for quite a while. Would you still look at any select metal names at this point as value buys?
We are bullish on steel and there are lots of logical reasons for that. The demand and supply is predominantly driven by global factors and China plays a significant role. What we have seen over the last few months is that China has started restocking, building up the inventory and that has led to steel prices going up globally. In India also, we are seeing a reflection of that. 

Remember the Government of India has done something fantastic for the industry. They have ensured that the dumping of steel does not happen and the way they have structured the kind of duties and the protection, that it goes on till 2022. So domestic steel industry is protected from the adverse impact of dumping. Global prices are going up and domestic demand is also going up. So under these circumstances, the steel units which have got captive iron supply, captive coal mines are the ones who are going to emerge as winners and under these circumstances, companies with good quality management which are in the right industry, can be looked at.

I can recommend Tata Steel. We can recommend JSW and even Steel Authority, SAIL, can be looked at at current levels. One has to keep monitoring the market situation closely but as things stand today at current levels, these stocks can be entered into by an aggressive investor. 


Let us talk about some of these names that are affected because of the auto industry. It is a huge industry and a lot of other industries depend on ir. A CLSA report talks about how Kansai Nerolac is one victim because it does have a large proportion of its revenues coming in from the auto OEM space. Do you see any ancillary impact on account of the slowdown in the auto sale numbers on any other sectors?
A slowdown in auto is a cause of significant concern. There are a whole lot of ancillary industries which depend on it. The Mohterson Sumis and Boschs of the world, tyre companies, paint companies are all dependent on auto and it is a huge cycle. A whole lot of companies will get impacted. But as I mentioned, automobiles numbers slowdown is a temporary phenomenon. We will probably not get good numbers till the monsoons are over. 

Our view is that post monsoon, the numbers will start improving once again and we are reasonably confident that economy will start showing good performance. Once the numbers started improving, you would see a very sharp upward movement in the auto ancillaries. 

On the paint side specifically, we like companies like Akzo Nobel and Asian Paints. Some of these corrections in prices are a great opportunity to acquire these stocks. These are true blue chips, they have been performing outstandingly well for a very long time. Some of them have started having global linkages as far as supplies are concerned. 

One last factor which I would like to highlight that all these different ancillaries depend on other things as well. Paints also depends on crude oil prices and the impact of crude oil price going up or coming down reflects in their P&L with a lag of about a quarter. If you look at tyre industry, the rubber prices does play a role. If you look at the battery companies like Exide or Amara Raja, there are other components like lead prices which we need to be cognizant of. But overall we are by and large, bullish on the ancillary space. 


What is your view on auto ancillary names? What is the sense that you are getting when it comes to some of the tyre stocks, the likes of Motherson Sumi, etc?
Let us look at Motherson Sumi. There is definitely a slowdown as far as the offtake is concerned on the automobile sector in India. Motherson Sumi is a global company. They have global operations but definitely the sentiment in India and the poor offtake in India does impact Motherson Sumi. 

On the other hand, in the global market, the dynamics is mixed. Some of the companies where there are OEM, there are issues as far as volumes are concerned and that also is leading to some amount of concern as far as Motherson Sumi is concerned. But having said that, the correction in Motherson Sumi is pretty sharp. Around Rs 140-145 levels which I think it is reaching today or maybe soon, I will be recommending a buy because it is a fundamentally good company. They have global diversified business. In spite of the forthcoming shift from gasoline based vehicles to electric vehicles, the auto component suppliers like Motherson Sumi will not be significantly impacted. They will focus their production towards supplying to these newer generation of cars.

Look at the case of Bosch. I think it is a fantastic company. It is available at a very reasonable price even compared to some of its competitors. So buying Bosch at current subdued levels would be a good idea. 

If you look at the entire sector, the automobile numbers are coming significantly lower than expectations. It has been a shock. Nobody expected the numbers to suffer to the extent it is suffering and that is getting reflected in the share price of auto ancillary companies also. But most of these companies are suppliers to global companies as well. They can pivot their production processes and production lines very quickly and they are much more of a nibble than automobile manufacturers. I will be more bullish on the auto ancillaries today than Indian auto companies.


There are areas where you see some opportunity, but are there any sectors that you would avoid at this juncture?
Telecom definitely is an avoid. The way Jio has been expanding aggressively and acquiring customers and the way the pricing war effectively still continues, I will be extremely wary of any exposure in the telecom space. 

Bharti Airtel or an Idea-Voda are definitely avoidable at this stage. I would also probably not get into the very highly valued consumer names. It is not because they are not going to expand but the fact that the multiples look really stretched. So I would rather get into some of the interesting names in the sectors we spoke about where the valuation looks reasonable at this stage."
20,2019-03-25,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Fear of US recession came back to haunt financial markets on Monday after a historical trend of inverted yield curve resurfaced last Friday.

This coupled with repeated weak macroeconomic data has strengthened the fear that all is not well with the global economy and India, being among the most prominent emerging markets, cannot shrug off the heat. 

A 380-point fall in the Sensex came on the back of a wave of selloff across sectors. 

Besides global cues, rupee weakness has also contributed to the fall in stocks. Analysts said investors should adopt a prudent, stock-specific approach in such a market.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks. 


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking
Heidelbergcement India | Buy | Target price: Rs 192 | Stop loss: Rs 167
This stock recently witnessed a sharp upsurge from Rs 145 level to Rs 184 and which was shadowed by profit booking that pushed prices back towards Rs 170 level with low volumes. At this juncture, the stock is showing much resilience after forming a Japanese candlestick pattern, which resembles a bullish engulfing pattern. Volume analysis indicated low volume during the down move, whereas high volume during the upmove suggests accumulation on the counter. In addition, momentum oscillator RSI seems to have formed a base around the 65 mark on the daily chart and has seen a fresh bullish crossover with its smoothened moving average. 


Infosys | Buy | Target price: Rs 804 | Stop loss: Rs 707
During the recent market rally, this stock and its peers lacked participation. Some technical indicators are hinting at an end to its slumber phase and a period of outperformance in the near term. On the daily chart, the stock has confirmed a ‘Falling Channel’ bullish breakout, supported by a bullish breakaway gap. The recent bounce from lower levels was accompanied by increasing volume, indicating a bottom out and signs of optimism. The momentum oscillator has crossed above the positive zone at 50, supporting the buy call. 


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager- technical analysis, YES Securities

Teamlease Services | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,200-3,350 | Stop loss: Rs 2,800
On the weekly chart, this stock is on the verge of a breakout from the channel pattern, indicating bullishness. Further, on the daily chart, it is on the verge of a breakout from a ‘W’ pattern neckline placed at Rs 3,010. A sustained trade above this neckline can extend the upward move to Rs 3,200-3,350 levels. The RSI has also turned upward after taking support at the lower end of the bull zone i.e. 40-level. It has formed a positive trend reversal on the daily chart, suggesting bullishness on the counter.


Asian Paints | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,520-1,570 | Stop loss: Rs 1,420
On the weekly chart, Asian Paints is on the verge of a breakout of an ascending triangle pattern neckline. Moreover, it has turned up after taking support at the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement. The RSI has turned upward after forming a positive divergence, affirming bullishness.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher

Castrol India | Buy | Target price: Rs 180 | Stop loss: Rs 154
This stock has formed a higher bottom pattern on the daily chart, taking support at the significant 200-DMA and has also moved past the 50-DMA to signify strength. It has improved the bias for further upward movement in the coming days. The RSI has also indicated a trend reversal to give a buy signal. “With good volume participation, we recommend a buy rating on this stock for an upside target of Rs 180, keeping a stop loss of Rs 154,” Parekh said.


Astral Poly Technik | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,300 | Stop loss: Rs 1,080
This stock has been in an upward trending mode and with a slight correction witnessed in recent times, the chart looks attractive for further upward momentum in the coming days. The indicators are all favourable and with the RSI showing a trend reversal, the bias is maintained positive. 


Kkunal Parar, Senior Technical Research Analyst, Choice Broking 

CanFin Homes | Buy | Target price: Rs 347-355 | Stop loss: Rs 308
On the daily chart, this stock has been trading above its upper band of slightly higher top higher bottom formation with above-average volume, which indicates a robust upside movement in the counter. On the weekly chart, the stock has started to trade above its 50-week moving average placed at Rs 309.40, which shows a positive trend in the counter.


SRF | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,610-2,665 | Stop loss: Rs 2,350
On the weekly chart, this stock has seen a breakout of its downward falling trend line, which indicates a robust upside movement in the counter. On the hourly chart, the stock has been trading with strong support of 21- and 50-hourly moving average, which suggests an uptrend for the time being. Moreover, the stock has been trading in an upward rising channel formation since last many days which is a continuation formation and suggests a further upside movement.


Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

Infosys | Buy | Target price: Rs 798 | Stop loss: Rs 729
The stock has breached a declining trend line resistance on the daily chart along with higher volumes that are above average as compared to the last few days. RSI on the daily scale is seen above 50, showing positive divergence. ""We expect Infosys to gain momentum in coming days with the stock moving to higher levels of Rs 770 and Rs 798, with a stop loss of Rs 729,"" said Nadeem.


Jubilant Foodworks | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,495 | Stop loss: Rs 1,385
A bullish engulfing pattern was seen on the chart after two days of consolidation. A bullish trend is in place while the stock has sustained its support line which is a point of inflection for price action. ""We expect Jubilant to keep a sustained move in the short-term, heading upwards to the level of Rs 1,495, with a stop loss of Rs 1,385,"" said Nadeem.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in 

SRF | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,662 | Stop loss: Rs 2,390
Since this counter has registered a new lifetime high by getting past Rs 2,446, it is pointing towards the beginning of a fresh upswing. Another positive factor to observe is that this breakout is coming on the back of a minor consolidation of around 10 sessions. 


City Union Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 219 | Stop loss: Rs 189
This counter appears to be heading to a new lifetime high, as it appears to have registered a breakout with a close above its interim top at Rs 198, registered in January 2019. However initially, it may face some hiccups around its lifetime high at Rs 207, registered in August 2018. But, once it manages a close above that hurdle, its next target can be towards Rs 219.

23,2019-03-26,Asian Paints,"PSU banks and also ICICI Bank were marked underperformers and missed the entire massive bull market 
  between 2013 and 2018, said Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 


Would you agree that perhaps all the concerns with regards to the inverted yield curve in the US and all those recessionary concerns were perhaps a little overdone? 
That’s possible but I am no expert on global macroeconomics. So, US or Europe probably could get into recession. One does not really know about Germany or Japan and I am not going to make a comment on that. We will stick to our markets.

It is almost 15 months since a large number of stocks have corrected very meaningfully in the period starting January 2018. If we look at the earnings growth, in a large number of those companies which have corrected sharply, the earnings growth story continues. Even where the news flow is not very positive or is absolutely negative, say autos for example, you see some of your biggest stocks are not really correcting. Stocks like Maruti or Bajaj Auto or Hero have corrected but they have stopped falling. That itself signals an inherent strength in the markets that over a short, medium as well as long-term, India’s earnings growth story continues. We do not really have much to be worried about. That is probably the message the market seems to be giving us and we are probably focussed on that.


Most of the banks are seeing a strong upmove. What is looking good to you within the banking pack?
PSU banks. These banks have been marked underperformers during the entire rally between 2013 and 2018, the entire massive bull market that we had. It seemed a very strange bull market without the participation of any of the PSU banks, most of which were in fact trending lower, especially the tier-2, tier-3 banks. 

Specifically speaking, a SBI or a Bank of Baroda look very interesting. SBI at whereabouts of Rs 300, is fairly attractive valuation wise. At a multiyear low in terms of valuation multiples on price to book, including management commentary is the meaningful recoveries of bad loans done in the last three, four years. 

A lot of those recoveries probably will result in write-backs which will probably drive earnings growth over the next few quarters. That argument applies for most PSU banks but obviously the biggest will be the best beneficiaries. For me, an SBI or a Bank of Baroda remain preferred picks. An upfront disclaimer, we have interest in Bank of Baroda as well as positions in them on behalf of our clients including personal positions. 

Having said that, since you mentioned corporate banks, even an ICICI Bank looks fairly interesting because ICICI Bank along with most PSU banks, was an underperformer for almost five years. 

Now with balance-sheet improvements, earnings growth kicking in, internal restructuring in terms of a new management in place, ICICI Bank should be one of the leaders of the next leg of rally in the banking space. 


Let us talk about the FMCG space, There are concerns over margins and pricing. Is that a pocket you choose to stay away from right now?
In terms of subdued performance, FMCG is one but you cannot paint all FMCG companies with the same brush. It is going to be pretty stock selective. Within the FMCG basket, Titan continues to deliver quarter after quarter and still the management guides at close to 25% earnings growth and the stock hits all-time high amidst volatility in the other segments of the consumer space. 

One really cannot generalise there. But specifically speaking, over the last five years, in the consumer space, FMCG has been the sector leader in the entire bull market. So, some kind of breather is fine. For a year or so, if they do not perform or they stay range bound.

I think nobody really should complain about. Valuations too have quite rich. Whether you take an HUL trading at some 70 times earnings and the management guides at a slowdown in volumes and earnings, some kind of correction over there is probably not totally unwarranted. It should happen. But selectively, in the consumer space things do look quite good especially the paint companies like Asian Paints and Berger Paints. I just mentioned Titan or even stocks in the building material space, especially say Havells or Kajaria which are all quasi consumer plays.


What do you think is happening in the entire power, power allied space -- be it PFC, REC or for that matter NTPC? All of them are moving in a synchronised fashion?
Fundamentally speaking,, one is at slightly at a difficulty in trying to find positive news flow as yet but generally, the market always discounts future events in advance. What I can sense in an REC or PFC is that they had fallen to ridiculous levels and finally the companies have not gone bust. 

No matter how much people would be crying hoarse about that but the fact is they do have assets on the ground and loans which they have given out are giving them earnings. In case of REC, just a few weeks ago it was trading at dividend yield of close to 10% and then it seemed like a no brainer. The company also declared an interim dividend of Rs 11 which was paid out a few weeks ago. 

It was sheer deep value that some of these stocks had gotten into -- REC, PFC and NTPC as well. What you are seeing is some sort of a correction given the huge underperformance that they had over the last eight, nine years."

29,2019-03-27,Asian Paints,"Smart money always gets in earlier and the local guy acts after the news, said Basant 
   
   
   Maheshwari, Co-founder & Partner, Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Bank Nifty is at a record high. Nifty is inching towards a life high. Would you call it a pre-election run-up or the beginning of a fresh run?
From a broad perspective, I will call it a post-election rally that is happening pre-election. Smart money is getting in. Once the election results are out and if this government comes back, the retailers would get in at whatever be the Nifty level at that point and whatever has been now would normally be sold to the retailers. This is an old story. Smart money always gets in earlier and the local guy acts after the news. We have always learnt this ever since we came into the market that buy at rumour and sell on news. That is what is happening right now.


We saw a similar factor at play in 2004 when smart money bought ahead of the elections but then the election verdict was not favourable.
The markets did come down at that time but if you remember there was this CPI(M) leader who suddenly said bhaar mein jai share bazaar (to hell with the share market) and that spooked the market at that time. For some people, share bazaar is life and death. I do not think any such situation would happen. But even if it does, it was just a knee-jerk reaction. What happened in 2004 was once the markets fell, they recovered in no time and CY2004 still gave a positive return. People say there is a huge risk of buying when there is no clarity. But I think there is a huge risk of buying when there is clarity. 

Six months back – there was the IL&FS issue and all the NBFCs were written off. Of course, 90% of them would never ever come back to the same price but the best one is ready to take out its all-time high. You have to buy looking at the fundamentals but we learnt an interesting lesson last year that fundamentals is not everything. There has to be something else which dictates why you buy and sell shares. It is a mix and match of everything but personally for our clients, for ourselves, we are more than fully invested and aggressively positioned.


All those naysayers on banks missed out in buying the Axis even Yes Bank. Do you think there is still money to be made in banks? Would the rally spread outside ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank to some degree and Axis? Would it spread to PSBs or is it going to be a very restrictive rally?
If you have a one-year view, we do not own it. It is not a recommendation. Axis and ICICI will outperform HDFC Bank but if you have a five-year view and you want to go back to sleep and don’t want to wake up each night thinking what is going to happen to the Nasdaq, to the Dow, to the SGX Nifty, HDFC Bank still remains a no-brainer. Again, it is not our recommendation.

Why I talk about one-year and five-year view is because ICICI and Axis are playing a valuation catch-up. It is not a growth catch-up. With the new management coming in, for Rs 2-3-4 lakh-crore asset book, how much money can one siphon off? That has already been taken care of by the market. I am talking about ICICI right now. Axis has the best of brains coming from an insurance company. He is going to try and change the bank but then this is not a five-year bet in my view. We do not own it and so I can talk about it. It is a one-year view, a six-month or maybe a nine-month view. But that is for people who want to buy and sell. Do buy and sell but if you want to still go back to sleep peacefully, HDFC Bank is there for you. 

Remember HDFC Bank did a QIP at Rs 2,200 last year and those QIP guys are still to see the price and HDFC is not another company in India which will do a QIP and never come back. They also noted that in three years they have to do another offering. So those guys have to make money and the management will ensure that the guys who bought it at Rs 2,200 last year would make money because they have to do this repetitively to make up the gap between the ROE and growth. So, HDFC Bank is also fine. All these big private banks are fine but if you want to be cute and start playing the PSU banks, that would be a very dangerous thing to do.


What has kept you away from Axis and ICICI Bank?
We were already holding the companies which we own and they were doing very well. In some cases, you do not want to sell a company just because you want to buy something else. If you have fresh cash, you go and buy it but normally you do not want to do all that tinkering unnecessarily. Also, we do not take very small positions, we normally take 10%, 15% of our portfolios. So, maybe we missed it, but we do not want to tinker around because the ones which we have, have also done quite well from the lows.


If I have to capture a 15-20% growth for next three years, which is that expensive consumer dominated stock I should go for? Or should I rather buy a cyclical/corporate bank or a beaten down NBFC where I will still get 15-18% growth at half the valuation?

About five years back, I had umpteen number of people calling and saying Corporation Bank lelo, iska dividend yield dekh lo, Dena Bank lelo iska dividend yield dekh lo (Buy Corporation Bank, Dena Bank. Look at their dividend yield). Suddenly we realised what a mess we are in. The point is consistency is the single most important factor in stock analysis and we have understood that. Sometimes you have to pay a lot of money, sometimes you pay little money to understand that. If you are sure about it, 15-18% is not good enough for a 40 PE, it has to be above or around 25%. If you are sure of 25% growth for the next 10 years or like seven years at least, not five, not three, I would pay 40-50 trailing to buy a 25% growing company for the next five, seven years. 

But if the growth is in the 15-18% range, you go and buy an Asian Paints or anything else. It is a little difficult to actually put your finger on the pie but then what decides that PE is not just growth, it is the sustainability of that growth, the ability of the company to handle its situation and still deliver the growth like out of the NBFC space where 60-80% of the companies were almost wiped off their feet last October. But still there was one company which delivered stellar results. So, why not buy more of that because once the competition weakens the market share shifting process becomes a lot more easier. 

All opinions do not make money and we have understood that we might have 200 different opinions but then you have to go and act on that. Right now, everybody has an opinion but nobody wants to act on that opinion. They are just waiting for something to happen and that something would be 11,700 taken out around the election time. That is where the new gush of money is going to come in. 

That is where everybody would find something good to talk about and something good to buy in this market, till that gets taken out, we will have our own fear about whether to buy or not to buy.


How did you insulate yourself in this entire NBFC/HFC slowdown? You have owned HFC stocks in the past. Is this an opportunity to shift your portfolio to better quality NBFCs or HFCs or are you thinking twice about where the sector is headed?
We do not own any HFC right now. We got fed up and dumped it sometime back and we bought a great consumer company which should grow 25% for the next five, seven, eight years. We just own one NBFC and it is not a recommendation again, everybody knows it. It is Bajaj Finance and we are more than fully invested into that as on the allocation perspective and they should do fine. That is about it. 

We make mistakes in life and my mistake was balance sheet is not enough so it is like unless the kanya daan happens, the baratis would not get the food to eat. The kanya daan did not happen with HFC and we got no food to eat. After two years, with stock doubling, we almost sold when it fell 30-40% from the top but that is how life is. We learn something new in life and then you move on. 


What would you buy if you had extra cash right now? Would it be cyclicals?
I do not think we should be buying cyclicals because nothing changes. It is the same country, same politicians, same politics, same policies and sometimes I get fearful of the way this country is going to polls. It seems the politicians have formed a group to auction the entire country! Somebody says I will give you Rs 6,000, somebody says I will give you Rs 1,500. People forget it is our money. The country cannot be auctioned for politics and then the Election Commission will charge somebody who distributes Rs 500 and one liquor bottle saying this is bribing. 

Somebody should file a PIL in the Supreme Court saying that this kind of pre-election dole-out should be completely banned from this country because if this happens, you will not have Bangladeshis and Burmese people coming to India. You will have Indians going into Burma and Bangladesh. I am very fearful of what politics is going to turn right now. So you better be in the best consumer and financial services names. Make 2% less, but at least protect the Rs 100 that you had brought to the market.


 A lot of companies are deleveraging and some amount of consolidation is on. What would be the outcome going forward?
First you goof up and then you go and deleverage. Look what happened to Jet. First they goofed up and then nobody wanted 200 pilots and 5,000 airhostesses going around airports protesting just before an election and so Jet was actually asked to extend its life. A company like Jet is not a recommendation. It has just been put on a ventilator. When your operating profit is less than the interest cost that you have to pay, the best you can do is survive. Even if you can survive. where is the cash flow to repay the debt? 

A lot of telecom companies are under this situation right now. Unless the big daddy of them all actually increases prices, it is like stopping the oxygen flow from your peer group. In the telecom sector, a couple of companies are standing on the brink. This deleveraging is not happening just because suddenly they have decided to let us reward the minority. It is happening out of compulsion and deleveraging happening out of compulsion is never a great thing for shareholders. Deleveraging when it happens on a discretionary basis is great because normally the valuation of a company goes up multi-fold when it starts repaying debt out of cash flow. But if you repay debt by selling off your assets, it is something different.


Would you say the same about DLF also? After the Rs 3,000-crore QIP, they are almost debt free now?
Not DLF. No recommendation again. But they do not have this problem of getting into bankruptcy. It is a different story. I am talking about the telecom companies, the airline companies where one doesn’t know how far this deleveraging is going to take them. The deleveraging only guarantees an extension of the old life. Investor should be very mindful of what they are doing right now because as Rs 200 stocks go to Rs 250, you think something has changed. I have got nothing against these companies -- neither short nor long. 


Which are some stocks which you do not own but you would like to own? If there is a crash, where will you be a buyer?
We do not own it and it is not a recommendation but Axis and ICICI are good. Please do not buy just because I am saying it. Do your own research. May be in the consumer space, something which we do not own and something which you have liked for a while -- Britannia looks okay. Companies like these are okay but again not a recommendation for the viewers. 


Those who are sitting on cash, if they find value they should put money to work even though election it could have short-term implications of 5%, 10%, 15% in midcap stocks. That should not stop you from investing.
Absolutely. It is much much easier to buy a stock and see it go down 30% than to buy a stock 10% above the price at which you first saw it. If you missed a certain stock, what are you going to do? You are going to buy the B or the C or the D names of that sector and that is what investors should not be doing. 

If you are okay buying something at 10% above after elections, then you should wait. But if you missed stock A, and then bought B or C or D, that is where the problem starts. It is okay to buy when the stock fell 10%. Finally, it is a stock market and not a fixed deposit which is going to hit an all-time high every second. You just buy it. If it falls, it falls. That’s about it."
25,2019-03-27,Asian Paints,"The pre-poll rally that added $220 billion of the market capitalisation to Indian equity market in the past one month has catapulted the valuation of the benchmark Nifty50 to a record level. The Nifty’s trailing price-earnings (P/E) multiple touched 25.9 in March 2019, the highest since year 2000, according to Bloomberg data. India has also become the second country, after the US, among major markets to surpass the P/E level prevailing before the financial crisis in 2009.

The Nifty’s current valuation is at 45 per cent premium to the 15-year average. In contrast, the MSCI EM index — a gauge for developing nations, and the MSCI World index — a measure of developed countries index performance, trade 10 per cent and 11 per cent below their respective 15-year averages. In addition, India is now the most expensive market among the top 20 global markets by the market capitalisation.

Nifty’s P/E multiple is two standard deviations away from the mean, a rare phenomenon given that it occurred 44 out of 4,663 trading days in the past 19 years.



Of the 50 Nifty stocks, 19 that include Bharti Airtel, Titan, Asian Paints, and Hindustan Unilever have higher P/Es than the index. These together contribute 48 per cent to the Nifty’s weight. Bharti Airtel with a P/E of 337 is the most expensive stock in the Nifty.

One of the reasons for an expanded P/E multiple is a drop in the denominator, the earnings per share (EPS). In the 12 months to December 2018, the index EPS dropped by 3 per cent year-on-year to ?444.8. This was the first drop in 10 quarters, according to Bloomberg. The Nifty’s current price-book (P/B) value of three is similar to the long-term average. It had peaked six times in December 2007."
31,2019-03-28,Asian Paints,"There is a risk that the PE multiples could come off but as long as the earnings engine sustains. you will make 
  
  
  healthy money, said Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


We do not talk about real estate stocks but a lot of real estate stocks have not done well. DLF is 20% up, Kolte Patil is at record high, Oberoi is not looking bad. For someone who has patience for three years, does it make sense to buy the top two-three real estate names?
I am not sure about residential real estate but I agree that commercial real estate in India is a very viable asset class. Clearly, there is still big shortage of high quality office space in the big cities. There is a good reason to believe that well-run commercial real estate play can generate yields of say 8-9-10%. Commercial real estate is an asset class whose time has not yet come in India and it is worth looking out for that. 

I am not so sure on residential real estate. I have been saying this for four-five years and I still think that there still is not any affordability in residential real estate. You have got a handful of developers who do a good job of residential real estate. It does not mean that the asset class itself is still viable.


How much more can this rally in banks push forward? For those who have missed the bus, is it too late to jump in? Are there still banks out there which can be bought and where you can still make 15 to 30 odd per cent return in next three to four months?
There is further scope for rallying in frontline private sector banks because the NBFC sector will give up more share to the private sector banks in next 12 months. We have seen some of it in the last six-seven months as the cost of wholesale money has risen and thus cost of money for the NBFCs and HFCs have gone to the point where them losing market share to private sector banks is inevitable. 

That cycle has not yet fully played out. On the other side of elections, we will get another bout of problems in the short-term money market, in the wholesale money market and that will probably be the next trigger for another bout of market share shift from NBFCs to the private sector banks.


So-called disguised correction in consumer durables and consumer staples has already started. Autos have already taken it on the chin. They are admitting that business is slowing down. What does that mean for earnings, consumption and the economy?
At one level, I do not think it is any bad thing. In India, we are fairly accustomed to seeing auto demand cycles where demand is strong with mid teens, high teens growth for three-four years and then a slowdown which lasts for two-three years. We are probably half way through that slowdown both in cars and trucks. 

At one level, there is nothing surprising here. It is healthy to have an auto cycle where you grow strongly for three-four years and then slowdown for a couple of years. Where the demand situation is still pretty healthy is small-ticket consumption. So, whether it is FMCG, apparel, restaurants QSR, the small-ticket consumption picture is fairly healthy and the recent budget that we went through should be a major stimulus to consumption over the next 12 months. The tax cuts, PM Kisan Maha Pension Yojana, all the loan waivers that we heard about over the last 12 months, should provide consumption stimulus. 

Due to the fact that the GST’s ambit has been pulled back so aggressively, there is enough to sustain small-ticket consumption in our country. Obviously sooner or later, we need a jobs revival. You cannot indefinitely consume even small ticket stuff without a job creation cycle. But at least for the next 12 months, there is reasonable visibility that small-ticket consumption will hold up even as auto continues to start in sputter.


As US-China talks resume, what is your take on metals?
I am not an expert on the subject and as you alluded to in your question, the number of imponderables in that picture are multiple. Exactly how deep is the China slowdown, if it a slowdown or a revival by itself is a mystery for most of us sitting outside China. 

But what does look relatively clear is that across the western world -- be it in America or Europe, an economic slowdown is coming through. Both the US Fed in December and the European Central Bank and the Bank of England recently are all signalling a slowdown in economic growth. A slowdown in economic growth in the world’s big economic blocks cannot be good news for metal prices.

 While the China piece is a black box and a bit of a mystery to me. the data that is coming from North America and from Europe does suggest a slowdown which should lead to tampering in metal prices. Indian metals and mining stocks show a 70% correlation with the prices on LME. The implications are self evident.


What do you make of the overall March rally? Another 300 points and we will be sitting at an all-time high. It has been a little too smooth and should one tread with caution right now?
The global risk-on rally started around 22ndDecember when Fed chairman Powell signalled that he was abandoning his tightening monetary policy stance. Between 22nd December and end of February, equity markets across the world rallied by around 10%. We did not participate in that, we started catching up with that rally over the last three, four weeks or so and in that regard we have fallen behind global equity markets by a distance.

For the last year, year and a half, there is very little reason to say that the Indian index as a whole has got lots of upside in it. Our earnings growth has been sclerotic, 7.5% is the 10-year CAGR on Nifty earnings. Last six, seven years we have seen hardly more than 6-7% earnings growth. To have that sort of situation as a backdrop and have an index trading at PE multiples we saw in early 2008, does send alarm bells ringing in my head with regards to the index as a whole. 

Where there are opportunities, it is relatively clear in our country that the consumption engine is the only engine that can fire a) because there is a middle class which is rising in the world and wants to spend more and b) because there is a government in place which wants to pump consumption up. 

So, the consumption engine is going to help us deal with this elongated bout of no capex growth and in that context specific bouts of stocks whether it is retail banks or consumption plays works. It is also relatively clear that the currency is overvalued. 68-69 to the rupee does not make sense. Export growth has once again slowed down and if you assume that the fair value of the currency is around 75, that would suggest that there is a fair tailwind coming for exporters.

IT and pharma should do well as the export-oriented sectors get a currency fillip in the next 12 months. So there are pockets in the Indian economy where you can make money -- consumption, private sector banks, exporters. But there is very little reason for me to say that the index as a whole is undervalued and should be running up any moment now on the back of either global macro or election news.


You had spoken about some classic compounders in the past and identified a name like Abbott India. What else is sticking out to you that you would like to share?
Let us take it sector by sector. In FMCG, the structural compounders; the consistent compounders with long strong track records are well known. We have discussed companies like Asian Paints, Marico before. One often hears commentaries around these names or around HDFC Bank that the price to book multiple is very rich and there should be a correction. The challenge that one has with these stocks is the underlying compounding in the business consistently. 

Asian Paints cash flow per share has compounded at 21-22% over one year, three year, five year, 10 years, 20 years. The underlying compounding in this business is so strong that the PE multiple almost gets irrelevant over time periods of over three years. Anybody who tries to say I will sell Asian Paints or an HDFC Bank because it looks expensive on conventional price matrix runs into the challenge of compounding in the business. In consumption, we have half a dozen companies which keep compounding at a healthy rate. 

In banking, HDFC Bank is the obvious compounder but there is reason to believe that there are other companies who will join that list and the recent bout of change in Indian banking, change at the top of ICICI and Axis Bank is very encouraging. Maybe one needs to do a lot of work to see if there are other compounders we can dig out there which can have as bright a future as HDFC Bank. 

Pharma is a beaten down sector that has been thrashed badly in the last three years but the fundamentals in terms of ROCs are very strong; cash generation is strong and the last three-four months of channel check that we are doing suggest that an export-driven pharma recovery should be round the corner and this is a sector where at the top of my head, I can think of four of five names where the ROCs are north of 25%.

There are strong moats around those businesses and so pharma is another sector where we are looking forward to discovery. You named Abbott, but I think there is probably one or two more there which could make it into that compounders’ list.

It is not as if you have to go and buy the Nifty tomorrow morning to make money. At least a dozen companies have consistently compounded your wealth year in and year out for the last 5-15 years and it is a shame to ignore them to pick some company with a low PE multiple which you potentially believe will rally tomorrow morning or buy the Nifty. 

There is very little reason to buy the index as a whole because the index as a whole is not that promising. It contains a lot of weak companies which have struggled to grow in the past. You are much better off focussing on companies like Asian Paints or HDFC Bank.


The PE multiple of Asian Paints is 65 and the Abbot stock is trading at a PE multiple of 40. What are the chances that if you buy an Asian Paints and something like an Abbott for next three years you may not actually get even market beating returns?
One way is to think about PE multiples and it is quite important to develop a mental framework which allows you to rationalise PE multiples. Typically, if you look at most stocks in our country, most of these names that we are discussing over a 10-year period either the PE multiples have halved or doubled. 

If the PE multiple doubles over 10 years, it gives you a 7% compounding just on the PE multiples. If it halves, it is minus 7%. If you have an underlying EPS growth engine which chugs along 25%, even if the PE multiples halves in the next 10 years, you get 25 minus 7 -- around 18%. Most of these companies have dividend yields of around 2-3%. So assuming that 25% earnings growth sustains which is the underlying premise of looking at companies like Asian Paints or the Abbott’s, PE multiple comes off by 50%. With 7-18% dividend yield, you are making 20% total shareholder returns with the high degree of visibility with lower volatility consistently across time. That is as good an outcome as you can get in large and midcap investing in one of the world’s largest stock markets.

That is why I called my book Coffee Can Investing the low risk route to stupendous wealth. This is your best bet in India, consistently chugging out good returns year after year over very long periods of time. I completely agree with you though that there is a risk that the PE multiples could come off but as long as the earnings engine sustains. you will make healthy money."

Data source: industry estimate"
32,2019-03-29,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: In the past five bull markets on Dalal Street, the champions have always emerged from sectors such as banking, industrials and metals.

Will this time be different?

On an average, a bull market in India has lasted 32 months in last 20 years against 15 months for bear markets.

The last bull run lasted 31 months from February 2016 to August 2018. It was followed by a period of short-term vulnerability till October before the indices started moving higher. 

Global brokerage HSBC in a research note said most macro parameters suggest the elements are in place for the next bull run in the Indian market.

Analysts are painting a rosy picture for banking and industrial sectors, but have been cautious on healthcare. They are also advising selective buying in real estate and consumer plays.

Data compiled from corporate database AceEquity shows Nifty Bank jumped 101 per cent in the last bull run. Nifty Realty soared 111 per cent and BSE capital goods index 69 per cent, but Nifty pharma fell 7 per cent. The Nifty50 was up 67 per cent in the same period.




Banks at the core of any bull run, infra follows
There have been concerns over the health of the global economy, which has prompted central banks globally to re-assess their policy stances. The US Fed earlier this month signalled no rate cut this year. India has become the first country among key emerging markets to see a policy rate cut. Going by consensus, another 25 bp rate cut is highly likely in RBI's April 2-4 policy review. Nifty Bank has already been hitting new record highs.

Aasif Hirani, Director at Tradebulls Securities, said banking and financials have been at the core of any bull market in India followed by infrastructure, which usually starts participating at the high momentum stage.

Data showed Bank Nifty has jumped 12 per cent year to date against a 6.56 per cent rise in Nifty50.

“With most of fresh liquidity finding its way to largecap private banking names, expect the banking index to continue its outperformance. Nifty Infra has gained 10 per cent this month. With the leader still going strong and the laggards gearing up, it seems the ongoing bull market still has a lot of steam left. Banking and financials along with infrastructure could continue to outperform in the ongoing bull run,” Hirani said.


Bull run under way
HSBC said all major macro indicators, including inflation outlook, GDP growth rate, bond yields, crude oil price, valuations and earnings are painting a positive picture. Except for the uncertainty surrounding election outcome, it feels the next bull market would already be under way.

“The unending trade talks between the US and China and ever-continuing Brexit process are adding uncertainty. Global central banks have changed their stance from hawkish to dovish and despite a fresh output cut by OPEC at 1.20 million barrels a day, Brent crude is still down 23 per cent from its 2018 high,” said VK Sharma, Head - PCG & Capital Market Strategy, HDFC Securities.

On the political front, opinion polls suggest a decisive victory for the incumbent BJP in the general elections that kick off on April 11. This has triggered a buying frenzy among FIIs. The rupee is appreciating, which has lent support to the market. 

Sharma expects banks and NBFCs to do well as he feels the sector would post higher profits compared with other Nifty constituents. He feels real estate and housing finance companies and the evergreen FMCG stocks should do well going forward.

In the infrastructure sector, CLSA is recommending early-cycle plays L&T, Sadbhav, NCC and IRB, and also urban infrastructure play JKIL, following a 16-43 per cent correction (excluding L&T) over the past year.

HSBC likes private banks, consumer discretionary and real estate, and suggests selective exposure to metals, consumer staples and energy stocks. Among banks, it likes Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank while among consumer discretionaries, it prefers Asian Paints, Kajaria Ceramics and Jubilant Foodworks.

In real estate, the brokerage finds a structural opportunity in Godrej Properties thanks to its sound balance sheet, and sees Prestige Estates as a laggard despite accelerating sales momentum. 

The brokerage said regulatory headwinds, delayed product launches and price erosion in generic drugs are leading to underperformance of the healthcare sector."

Where are We? Market finished the final trading day of the financial year on a positive note to close at 11,623.9 with a gain of 0.47 per cent for the day and 1.46 per cent on a weekly basis. For FY19, Nifty has seen gains of 14.93 per cent. Broader market indices — BSE Midcap and Smallcap — gained 2.67 per cent and 1.86 per cent, respectively, for the week outperforming the benchmark indices. The market breadth on NSE was positive with 5 stocks advancing for every 4 declines.


What is in Store? Nifty has formed long body bullish candlestick on weekly and monthly charts. Strong momentum suggests the market is going ahead towards its all-time high of 11,760. Immediate support of 11,550 is needed for the last week’s rally to continue towards new highs. Crossing and sustaining above 11,760 on tradable basis. Next level for Nifty is seen at 11,830 and 11,900. On the downside, last week’s low of 11,311 becomes critical for the market. A decline below would break the sequence of higher highs and higher lows. In Nifty options, maximum open interest for puts is at 11,500 strike, followed by 11,000. For calls, it is seen at strike price of 12,000 and 11,600. Put writing was seen in 11,500 and 11,600 along with call writing in 12,000 and 11,700.


What could Investors Do? India VIX surged 5.6 per cent for the week to close at 17.2. In last three weeks, volatility has seen a rise from 15 levels. VIX needs to settle at the current level or decrease for the rally to continue, otherwise further increase may stall the rally. Stock specific, Bajaj Finserv, Petronet LNG, Asian Paints, IDBI Bank and NBCC have witnessed consolidation and showing breakouts."
1,2019-04-01,Asian Paints,"It took a good seven months for the flagship Sensex to hit a new all-time peak of 39,017 on Monday. But that has a jarring note. 

An aerial view of Dalal Street shows more patches of red than green despite this smart rally. 

The index earlier hit a high of 38,989.70 on August 29. 

The upside is mainly being driven by buying in select private banks, including Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, which jumped 11-19 per cent since August last. 

There were other bright spots, too. Bajaj Auto (up 8.50 per cent), Asian Paints (up 7.18 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 5.30 per cent), HCL Technologies (up 5.28 per cent) and Infosys (up 5.26 per cent) showed their mettle. 

Similarly, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI, Larsen & Toubro, Power Grid, Bajaj Finance and HDFC advanced up to 4 per cent during the same period.

“The rise in equity markets currently looks like a catch-up rally just before the 2019 general elections, especially in the case of private banks which are making new highs. NBFC stocks which took a beating post the IL&FS crisis have bounced back. However, concerns still remain, especially with regard to smaller NBFCs. On the global economic front, concerns stay with regard to rising oil prices and slowdown in the global economy which may impact investor sentiment,” said Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

The sore point is the rest 16 stocks, including Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki in the Sensex pack, dived up to a staggering 34 per cent.

Analysts believe that higher chances of repo rate cut by RBI this week, unabated inflows by foreign investors and hopes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi retaining power lifted sentiment.

However, oil remains the joker in the pack. Wild movement in the rupee, US-China trade woes, tensions between India and Pakistan, corporate governance issues and the stubborn liquidity crisis at a leading NBFC roiled the outlook.

The broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices are still down by over 7 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, since August-end levels. 

Take this. Close to 66 per cent of stocks in the midcap space are flashing red. 

Among top movers and shakers, DHFL, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Power, Reliance Capital and Varroc Engineering tanked over 45 per cent in the past seven months while Muthoot Finance, Adani Power, Divi’s Laboratories and The Indian Hotels Company went up 20-50 per cent. 

After the recent run-up in select largecaps, experts are turning positive on the midcap space. 

“Two-three months ago, we were talking about 60 per cent allocation in largecaps and 40 per cent in midcaps. Today, I am close to 55-45 per cent in terms of how the allocation should be. So, midcaps have gone up, from say about 30-35 per cent to 45 per cent,” said Sunil Subramaniam, MD and CEO, Sundaram Mutual, in a recent chat with ETNow. 

Brokerage firm Elara Capital expects returns from midcaps to exceed 15 per cent in 2019 as against a fall of 15.3 per cent in the previous year.

Smallcaps are no better. Companies like Ashapura Intimates, Punj Lloyd, Infibeam Avenues, Rolta India, LEEL Electricals and Reliance Communications lost up to 97 per cent in the smallcap space. Nearly 700 BSE smallcaps are still below their August 2018 levels. 

Sugar stocks added a dose of sweetness though, featuring on the list of top gainers. Dhampur Sugar Mills, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Balrampur Chini Mills rallied up to 160 per cent. 

Sectoral data suggested that the recent buying was not broad-based. Barring BSE Bankex (up 7 per cent) and Oil & Gas index (up 1 per cent), rest of the sectoral indices faltered. Auto, Metal, Telecom, Healthcare and FMCG declined 6-24 per cent during the past seven months.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) poured in Rs 51,200 crore during February and March taken together. Interestingly, they offloaded shares worth Rs 33,108 crore during August 2018 and January 2019."

11,2019-04-04,Asian Paints,"This stock quotes at Rs 6 on BSE, pays Rs 15 dividend every year, but does not trade. There are buyers ready to pay 15,000 times its current price, but no sellers. A headache not just for investors, but also for stock exchanges! 

Elcid Investments is a microcap company, but it is one of the promoter entities of bluechip firm Asian Paints, an index stock that traded at Rs 1,522 on Thursday. The company has two subsidiaries: Murahar Investments & Trading Company and Suptaswar Investments & Trading company. Both these subsidiaries are registered with the RBI as NBFCs.

Elcid Investments owns over 2.83 crore shares of Asian Paints, roughly 2.95 per cent stake. At prevailing market price of the Asian Paints stock, that holding is worth over Rs 4,200 crore. But Elcid Investments has a paid-up capital of just Rs 0.20 crore and a market capitalisation just over Rs 0.12 crore.

There has been no trade on the counter in last eight months.

The stock was last traded on August 9, 2018, when it hit the 5 per cent upper circuit at Rs 5.89. It has been traded only 18 times since 2011. But it has been giving dividends at Rs 15 per share every year.

Investors on Dalal Street are willing to invest in the stock, but no one is keen on selling it due the huge disparity between real and actual market price.

“No investor will be willing to sell a stock worth Rs 80,000 for just Rs 6. There is a possibility of a once-in-a-bluemoon trade only when mistaken selling happens,” says Ashish Chugh, Director, Hidden Gems Advisory.


Actual worth of stock
Arun Mukherjee, Co-Founder of Sebi-registered firm SA Investment Advisers, pegs the value of the stock at over Rs 1 lakh per share.

“If someone sells, only then can someone else buy it. That is how a transaction takes place. In the case of Elcid, it is worth over Rs 1 lakh. No one will sell it for just Rs 6 or so. Thus, there is no transaction and no volume on the counter,” Mukherjee said.


Quest for value discovery
Various stakeholder groups have approached Bombay High Court to intervene in the matter and issue directives to markets regulator Sebi and BSE. Many shareholders have been advocating a ‘call auction’ to discover fair price in Elcid Investments.

Promoters of Elcid Investments announced an offer-for-sale (OFS) in 2013 for a price of Rs 5,000 and the investors who purchased those shares are stuck at Rs 5.89. In 2013, the promoters announced a delisting offer to public shareholders at Rs 11.455 per share, but the offer was rejected.

Chugh says the laws should be made in line in the interest of minority shareholders. Regulators and exchanges should treat their interest as prime. Many gullible investors may fall for an offer made by the promoters and tender their shares at very less price than their actual value.


What shall investors do?
But neither BSE nor Sebi has taken the investors’ appeals seriously. “The real value of the stock shall be over Rs 80,000, if the exchange allows price discovery. However, there is no such law, it is at the discretion of the exchange,” Chugh said.

He said the exchanges should be pro-active in addressing investor concerns. “They should safeguard the interest of small and retail investors,” he said.

The Delhi-based value investor said a huge gap between traded value and the actual value of the stock is very clear. Exchanges must allow price discovery in such extraordinary cases.

Often, exchanges suspend such stocks for non-compliance of listing guidelines. It is the easiest way out for them. “But if such stocks are suspended from trading, thousands of retail and small investors will suffer as it will make the scrip illiquid. However, there are no such repercussions on the promoters.”

Mukherjee, known for spotting little-known multibaggers, said there are buyers in the market for such shares. “There would be a lot of brokers who are willing to buy the stock at a price around Rs 1 lakh. If anyone is inclined to sell this stock, they can approach these brokers,"" he said.

In India, there is no law, particularly relating to holding companies. “Nothing can be done, until and unless Asian Paints and promoters of Elcid decide to do something in this matter,” Mukherjee said."

6,2019-04-04,Asian Paints,"Stock indices ended weak on Wednesday, breaking a four-day winning run on, as a below-normal monsoon forecast dragged the Sensex and Nifty down from their record highs hit earlier during the day.

“There is a fatigue in the market at this juncture,” said Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, managing director, Valentis Advisors, a fund management firm. “The up-move we have seen in the last couple of months is a catch-up rally with the rest of the emerging markets.”



The Sensex and Nifty have gained over 8 per cent in March driven by foreign portfolio inflows worth Rs 33,000 crore. So far in 2019, they have pumped almost Rs 57,000 crore in domestic stocks. Analysts say early trends in portfolio inflows suggest a slowdown.

Jaipuria added that the market is no longer cheap. The Nifty is currently trading at an estimated price-to-earnings ratio of 18.1 times, said Deutsche Bank. This continues to be higher than the historical average of about 17 times.

17,2019-04-05,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: After a pro-poor Congress manifesto for the ensuing general election, Dalal Street is bracing for an equally doleout-heavy, if not heavier, election manifesto from the BJP. The saffron party is scheduled to unveil its poll pledges next week.

Smart stock investors are taking cues from rising rural focus and greater inclinations among political parties to woo the poor to draw out an investment theme around it. That is cue for the FMCG sector, the most likely immediate beneficiary of higher rural income, which is otherwise staring at bleak days ahead in view of a poor monsoon forecast, weak volume growth and lofty valuations. 

There is a clear tilt towards giving income support to the poor via direct benefit transfers, says IIFL Institutional Equities. “With a spate of farm loan waivers, the PM Kisan Yojana and now the Congress’ proposed NYAY scheme, FMCG consumption is bound to increase. The stimulus may lead to demand-pull inflation in agricultural products, which may become another booster dose for farmer income,” the brokerage said. 

With NYAY or Nyuntam Aay Yojna, the Congress is promising Rs 72,000 per year basic income to 5 crore families. It has also promised universal farm loan waiver and an increase in social sector spending.

A promise to waive farm loans worked well for the Congress party in the 2018 state elections in the Hindi heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 

“As the game of populist one-upmanship heats up, we expect the BJP to release a pro-poor, pro-farmer manifesto over the next one week,” Nomura India said. 

In the February Union Budget, Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal announced Rs 6,000 per year support to farmers, who own up to 2 hectares (5 acres) of land, under a direct income support scheme, called PM Kisan. Part of that money has started flowing into the hinterland already, though analysts say it may not have any material impact on consumer demand immediately.

The BSE FMCG index is down 2 per cent so far this year compared with an 8 per cent rise in Sensex. But a demand revival appears to be on the cards.

“Pockets of rural distress have hogged limelight over the past few months and seem to have finally bitten the most defensive pack – consumer staples. But we have reasons to believe this slowness would be shortlived. We would watch out for intensity of direct government transfers (DBTs), El Nino impact on monsoon, liquidity situation and any increase in competitive intensity in populism at political level,” Edelweiss said.

NSSO data shows the average consumption of low-income families, the bottom 20 per cent, is about half the all-India average.

With the promised income support (NYAY), poor families are expected to start spending in line with the next 23 per cent population.

“The spending of this 23 per cent is 35-40 per cent higher than the lowest 20 per cent. This could result in a 4 per cent increase in FMCG demand (including spirits and cigarettes), as a direct consequence of the NYAY scheme, assuming this is an incremental expenditure by the government and would be implemented immediately,” IIFL said.

The bottom 20 per cent population’s consumption of FMCG goods such as biscuits, detergents, soaps and haircare accounts for only 10-11 per cent of the total. Categories such as cigarettes and kitchen appliances are more discretionary in nature and, therefore, the bottom 20 per cent population accounts for a lower percentage of sales in these categories.

“When consumers move from the bottom 20 per cent to the next 23 per cent of consumption, their expenditure on FMCG categories such as hair care, detergents, soaps and biscuits would move up by 34-40 per cent. For discretionary categories such as kitchenware, cigarettes and IMFL, it would go up by 207-247 per cent, albeit on a very small base,” IIFL said.

A research by market research firm Nielsen showed retail sales of packaged FMCG goods grew at 11 per cent in 2018.

SBI Economic Wing says PM-KISAN is not enough to propel rural demand. “The scheme, which has been introduced to address farmer distress, is expected to have less impact on both consumption and food prices,” it said in a note.

Monsoon remains a cloud over project FMCG demand revival. Private weather forecaster Skymet says there is only a 30 per cent chance of normal rains, which delivers about 70 per cent of the country’s annual rainfall on which 60 per cent of Indian farmers depend. The probability of a below-normal monsoon, it said, is a high 55 per cent.

“Due to the possibility of an imminent drought, we would not be in a hurry to upgrade our estimates for FMCG stocks,” IIFL said. 

Top FMCG companies such as Britannia, HUL and Marico did not have a great quarter in January-March. Brokerage Edelweiss Securities has projected Britannia’s volume growth at 7 per cent, HUL’s 6 per cent and Marico’s at 6.5 per cent.

The brokerage estimates Bajaj Corp, Colgate and Dabur to post volume growth in the 4–5 per cent range. GCPL is seen reporting no growth at all. ITC’s cigarette volumes are seen growing at 5 per cent YoY, but on a negative base of 2 per cent. Volume growth for paint companies such as Asian Paints, Berger and Pidilite is seen at 9–10 per cent YoY."
12,2019-04-05,Asian Paints,"Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, is of the view that market has been historically poor in 
  
  
  reading election results. He also believes there is very poor evidence that with different governments, there are changes in policy and reforms. In an interview with ET Markets, Mukherjea said Nifty and the Sensex are not performing the function of being the “glittering jewels,” the best the country has to offer in investment options, and the stock market itself faces challenges because the best growth opportunities are being taken up by the giant PE funds, which accentuates the issue. Edited excerpts:


With elections around the corner, how do you feel the market could react in different scenarios -- a) NDA gets a clean majority or a close majority and forms the government or b)the current opposition forms the government with a majority or a close majority or c) it is a hung parliament?
The whole notion of trying to guess how markets will read elections is a little bit more interesting than trying to figure out whether India will win the World Cup or not in England. Market is obviously pretty poor at reading election results. I mean even after the election results have come, the Indian market has not been able to figure out what to do with the results. 

Back in 2004, when NDA lost, the market went down circuit and then we had the biggest bull run in the Indian history in the next five years. In 2009, when UPA won, the market celebrated and then we had five years of no returns. So the Indian market’s ability to understand what the political outcome means for the economy and for the market is pretty poor. 

If we look back at India’s history over the last 40-50 years, there is very little evidence that politics have any meaningful impact on the economy or on the stock market. For the last five decades, our GDP growth has been better than the decade before, Obviously, it will be hard fact to convince ourselves or others that over the last five decades, India has had some enlightened version of economic leadership which has resulted in five decades of trending up. 

Second, if you look at our country, there is very little proof or evidence that government X changes the policy of government X minus one. Since 1991, there has been a great deal of continuity in economic policy of various governments. Whatever policy the previous government promulgated, the next government have taken it through. There are obviously ideological differences between our political parties but those ideological differences are not with regards to economic policy. 

Third, if you look at the pressing problems facing the country such as job creation, it is not evident that any political party or indeed a apolitical party has any great success in making our country more competitive in the global economy. How do we create jobs? That hopefully answers from the government policy and indeed no political party can claim to have clear answers on these pressing issues. For a variety of reasons, the less focus you give to elections, the better off you are as you are. If you want to play a game, you might want to concentrate on second guessing the result of the cricket world cup rather than the coming elections.


You have recently said that Nifty does not clearly reflect the state of the economy, which indices or what do you think would be a better play on the state of the economy?

It is not just the question of the Nifty. Two things have happened in parallel over the last decade; the first is that readers have become more prosperous and increasingly large percentage of our spending is being devoted to items which are not part of the listed world at all. So this phone on which I am talking to you and your phone as well, the PC or the laptop on which you are going to write the story up, the websites on which your readers will read the story, the servers or the cloud on which the story will be hosted -- increasingly your and my life is about products with have nothing to do with the Indian market and that itself makes the market a pretty poor play on economic growth.

The second challenge is that private equity has emerged in India as a far more aggressive, far more reliable provider of growth equity than the Indian stock market and therefore the provision of growth capital to our economy now primarily comes from private equity than from the stock market.

So, in both regards, we have a challenge facing our country. The challenge is accentuated by the composition of the Nifty or the Sensex reflects old fashioned smokestack economy whereas the growth in our country -- whether in consumer or in financial services --is anything but smokestack industry. Both Nifty and the Sensex are loaded up in sectors like power, infrastructure, metals, mining, oil and gas, engineering, construction for reasons which are not quite easy for me to understand because the economy itself or our GDP itself is not heavily biased towards these heavy industrial sectors.

Yet for some reason, the Nifty and the Sensex gives disproportionate representation. There are challenges with the composition of the Nifty and the Sensex but leaving that aside, there are broader structural issues which are increasingly making the stock market a poor play on India’s economic story.


For investors, which are the proxy plays that they can use for the unlisted space?
People like us at Marcellus say just look at the last 10 years. Let us look for companies which are consistently growing revenues in double digits, consistently generating return on capital above the cost of capital and therefore we call these consistent compounders. Therefore, these companies are a reliable trade on India’s strong economic growth just by doing evidence based investing. Just by doing evidence based investing, we are saying look here is the data, here are a dozen odd companies which are consistently growing faster than the Indian economy whilst generating free cash flow, reinvesting the free cash flow back into the Indian economy and generating faster growth for years ahead. 

If you want to participate in India’s economic prosperity and its economic growth, invest in the consistent compounders. We are not waiting for some capex cycle to start day after tomorrow morning at 9 am, nor are we waiting for the election results to trigger a capex cycle. We are not making any funds in the dark that companies who have not generated return on capital for a single year in the last 10 years, they will suddenly miraculously generate return on capital in the next two, three years. That sort of speculative investing is unfortunately encouraged by the composition of our frontline indices which is one of the reasons that the frontline indices are no longer doing justice to the Indian economy.

Think of the Nifty and the Sensex as the shop window of the Indian stock market. If I go to a shop -- whether it is a online shop or a physical shop -- the shop window is supposed to entice us to enter the shop by showcasing the best about the shop. If it is a clothing shop, the best dresses, the best clothes will be on the shop window, if it is a bakery, the tastiest and most attractive looking cakes will be in the shop window. The Nifty and the Sensex are not performing that function anymore for the Indian stock market. They no longer contain the glittering jewels, the best that our country has to offer and they are doing a disservice to the stock market. 

The stock market itself has challenges because the best growth opportunities are being taken up by the giant PE funds which have large aggressive PEs in Mumbai and Bangalore now and more generally because our growth is increasingly coming from unlisted parts of the market, It is a multilayered issue but people who run the stock market could start deviating matters by revisiting the composition of the Nifty and the Sensex.


There's a lot of optimism in the market right now. We have had people raising their targets on Nifty. What are your thoughts on this optimism and is it here to stay?

In our investment style, we have never really bothered about optimism or pessimism. Our investment style is always focussed on buying high quality compounders and staying invested for years. We typically buy when client money comes in and we build the portfolio for that but never really understood why people get so swayed by short-term factors. That being said, if one were to understand why people are suddenly optimistic around the world on markets in India, first the Fed in December and now ECB in March have basically said that the economy is slowing down and therefore we are going to keep monetary policy relaxed and not hike interest rates. That has made investors more optimistic about the prospects of equity going forward.

Similarly, in our country, the rates have been cut twice. Around the world, the desire of central banks to stimulate growth in a slowing economic climate has made investors more optimistic in the near term. But we need to be mindful that these waves of optimism or pessimism really are little bit more than entertainment for stock market participants. Fundamentally, high quality companies keep compoundin. In a year like 2017 when the market rose 30% or a year like 2018 when the market fell and thereby the market was flat. Great compounders keep compounding and also ran in years of 2017 where they run up and years like 2018 when they crumpled. Since our focus in our investing is on the great compounders, we never lost that much sleep on the short-term noise. 


You have been pro consumption theme for a while. What are your thoughts there?The filters that we use are needed to assess where to put our money, where to put our clients’ money. Filters have dragged up for us companies which are growing consistently, generating good return on capital. It so happens that these companies are primarily from the B2C domain or from financial services. These are the companies which have consistently over the last decade participated or more than adequately participated in India’s economic growth. It is not that we start our day at 8 in the morning with the view to be pro consumer. It is just that sort of evidence based investing that we do -- the quantitatively oriented investment I do, finds itself aligned to the consumption theme in our country.


What are your thoughts in the auto space currently given the fact that it is going through its own headwinds.
If you look at the data, the auto sector is doing what the data historically suggested it should do, which is that auto sector goes through cycles. It goes through four-five years of good sales growth, volume growth and then it goes to two to three years where volume growth becomes weak. We are in the midst of the first year of what could be the first year of three years where volume growth is weak. To that extent, people like us look for consistency in historical compounding. The auto sector has not been able to provide that because of this off-on nature of volume growth. The volume growth is switched on for four-five years, switches off two-three years. As a result, the auto sector has not been able to deliver consistent compounding that people like us look for.


What are your thoughts on the paint sector?
The paint companies, not just an Asian Paints, even the next two players Berger and AkzoNobel have had very long track record of return on capital being above the cost of capital for several decades now. That is the first criteria if you look at paint, Asian Paints has 50% market share, Berger Paint around 20% market share, Nerolac and Akzo each with around 5% to 10% market share. Each of the top four players has return on capital above cost of capital for extended periods of time, multiple decades we are talking about. Within that --the two leading players Asian and Berger have had double digit volume growth pretty consistently for the last decade or so. In case of Asian Paints, you have more like the last 30 years. Berger’s case last 20 years. These characteristics obviously lend themselves very nicely to our philosophy of consistent compounding. Asian Paint stocks are up 1600x or 1700x since that IPO in 1983. So you are getting 10x in 10 years, 100x in 20 years, 1000x in 30 years quite comfortably with Asian or Berger. 

The auto sector does not give you this sort of compounding. So what happens in the years like 2017 is the auto sector looks far more attractive than the paint sector and those who get swayed by short-term data and noise, get sucked into the auto sector right at the top of cycle in 2017 and then obviously the sector comes down in 2018 to what is historically done, it does again in 2018 where after three-four years of strong volume growth, the volumes drop. We are going through that and obviously auto sector investors are struggling with their 2017 investments in this sector.


What are your thoughts on the recent L&T-MindTree saga?
It is relatively clear to all concerned that consolidation in Indian IT is long overdue and logically the consolidation will have to come in the mid-tier companies . The big four are too big for others to consume but the mid-tier companies are possible. It is high time they consolidated because if they do not consolidate, they tend to have very one-dimensional growth stories. Either they have a specific skill set or they have this one sector or one geography that they focus on. They tend to be volatile if that specific skill set or that geography is not working at that point in time. It is high time that we saw consolidation in Indian mid-tier IT, midcap-small cap IT and this could be the starting run for that wave of consolidation."

16,2019-04-05,Asian Paints,"The sprint maybe over but the marathon is here till the end of the year and 13,500 on the Nifty and midcap outperformance 
  
  
  is very much on the cards, said Sanjiv Bhasin,Executive VP, Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

What are you telling your clients to do now, take chips off the table or ride the momentum?
We have had the fastest sprint I have seen in the last one and a half years and 10,500 is 11,700! But the new highs are seeing only pessimism. I think we have at least another 500 points on the upside, 12,000 to 12,200 and aside from that, the little bit of momentum that we have lost on the midcaps should again see a resurgence. By the end of April, I am sure 12,000 will be tested. We are asking our clients to stay put because the sprint maybe over but the marathon is here till the end of the year where 13,500 on the Nifty and midcap outperformance is very much on the cards.


Highlight some of the fresh names which you would recommend buying?
Some of our recent picks or one-year picks have been outperformers. We were one of the few who were sticking our neck out at Rs 75 on PFC and Rs 100 on REC. They have given a stellar 50% return. GMR at Rs 15 was one our dark horses. That has been a huge outperformer and so is the case with IDFC First. We are staying put with those. 

We think some of the autos are giving you a very good entry point. We are extremely bullish on Ashok Leyland. Eicher Motors, TVS Motor and Maruti was closer to that 6,700. All these are excellent plays. Metals have had a dream run in the last month but that is just the starting point. JSW, Hindalco would be included there and our regular top picks, Reliance, ITC, ACC, Axis Bank and Asian Paints continue to be the top heavyweights which we are overweight on. 


We are tracking Titan this morning. There was a huge bump up on SRF yesterday on account of the plant closure being revoked. What is your take on these stocks?
Three things: Titan has been a huge outperformer. It is telling you that the consumption part, particularly discretionary, is seeing huge amount of uptick and that will now flow into autos as we get into elections. Already you have seen SUV sales touch all-time highs in the shape of Toyota and Mahindra. 

Titan continues to be one of the darlings of the market and even though the stock is expensive, the management guidance is extremely positive. 

On aviation, one is more heavyweight on IndiGo. But at Rs 15, we thought that the best play on the aviation sector on airport side is GMR. Now, it is in the process of demerging the power and real estate from the airport business which is turning out to be huge cash multiplier. I continue to be overweight on GMR. I think you could get a target of 30 maybe in the next one year. The airport business itself will suffice. 


What is your view on SRF?
SRF, Atul and Aarti have been our top picks in the speciality chemicals and we think SRF is giving a brilliant opportunity as an one-off buying opportunity. We still think that China is under pressure because of the environment reasons and SRF margins have been maintained at the highs and even Rs 2,700 could be on the cards in the next three to four months.


What is your take on IT?
They are fully priced. All earnings are priced in and I do not see that much of growth. Globally there has been a hiccup and the best of IT may be played out. They have been over owned by both foreign and the domestic side and given the rupee’s strength, I would expect some sort of selling. If you wanted to play the rupee weakness, we would rather play it through the pharma route. 

A disclosure, HCL Tech and MindTree are two contrarian plays where we have initiated buys -- Rs 925 on HCL Tech which has been a handsome outperformer and Rs 825 on MindTree. We continue to own both those and recommend those to be bought on declines."

21,2019-04-09,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: For months, India remained significantly costlier than its emerging market peers, reflecting the theoretical upside limit to local stocks. With the Federal Reserve turning dovish, money began flowing into emerging market equities that posted their best quarterly gains in the past two years in the March quarter.

Indian equities expanded more slowly. The valuation premium of the Nifty 50, compared with the MSCI EM index, dropped to 47 per cent from the 15-year high of 70 per cent in September 2018, according to Bloomberg data compiled by ETIG. The long-term average valuation premium to the MSCI EM index stood at 33 per cent. The relative valuation of the Nifty 50 eased after it underperformed the MSCI EM index by 5 per cent since the beginning of the year.

However, on an absolute level, the valuation of Indian equities continues to remain elevated. The Nifty, trading at 18.7 times its projected twelve-month earnings, is the most expensive among the top 20 by market capitalisation. The Nifty is trading at a 17.7 per cent premium to its longterm average. There are 15 companies in the Nifty 50 trading at premiums to the benchmark. The prominent companies with superior valuation are Titan, Asian Paints, Britannia, HUL, and Bajaj Finance.



On price-to-book value terms, the Nifty is trading at 2.66 times against the ten-year average of 2.40. On EV/EBITDA basis, it is trading at 10.37 times, a 7.3 per cent premium to the long-term average. Market cap to GDP ratio —a measure often used by long-term investors —stood at 83 per cent compared with a 10-year average of 79 per cent. The market cap to GDP ratio peaked at 146 per cent in the previous bull phase of 2007."

Nifty remained rangebound for most part of Tuesday’s session but witnessed momentum in the last hour of trade and rose towards 11,680 level. It formed a Bullish Candle along with an Inside Bar or Harami pa ttern on the daily scale, which indicated that every selloff is being bought into while the upside barriers are also visible in the market.

The index has been consolidating between 11,550 and 11,750 levels for last eight sessions and requires a decisive range breakout to commence the next leg of rally. Now it has to continue to hold its immediate support in the 11,550 – 11,580 range to retest the lifetime high of 11,761 and then move towards 11,888 levels, while on the downside support is intact at 11,550 level.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 levels. Call unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices while there was Put writing at 11,600 followed by 11,300. The option band signified an immediate trading range in between 11,550 and 11,800 levels.

India VIX moved by a sharp 0.65 per cent to 20.28 level. A sudden spike in VIX indicated limited upside with volatile swing in the market.

29,2019-04-09,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Private bank stocks and blue chip Reliance Industries lifted key benchmark indices by over half a per cent on Tuesday, helping recoup the previous session's losses. 

The market for the most part meandered through gains and losses, but a recovery in European shares along with rupee's rise against the dollar gave investors some confidence. 

Driven by banking and auto shares, the BSE benchmark Sensex rose 239 points, or 0.62 per cent to 38,939 while its NSE counterpart Nifty ended at 11,672, up 67 points or 0.58 per cent. 

The advance-decline ratio, however, leaned more towards the sellers side, indicating underlying bearishness in market.


How did the market look like today?

Of the Sensex scrips, 25 settled on the higher side while five slipped. YES Bank with gains of 4.08 per cent topped the chart. Tata Motors, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, Coal India and HCL Tech trailed, rising up to 3 per cent. 

Meanwhile, Asian Paints lost big by 3.54 per cent after CLSA downgraded the stock to 'Sell' from 'Outperform' while reducing the target price to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,565. The brokerage has cut the EPS estimate by 2-5 per cent led by revenue cuts. 

Sectorally, barring telecom and consumer durables, all other indices ended in the green. Realty, auto and bankex were the best performing sectors, rising over a per cent each. 

The day was not as rosy for midcap and smallcap indices. Though BSE Midcap managed to end on a positive note, up 0.15 per cent, the Smallcap index declined by 0.10 per cent. 


What made the stocks come alive? 


Rupee rebounds
The rupee surged by as much as 39 paise against the dollar on Tuesday even as oil prices topped a 5-month high. The domestic currency hit intra-day high of 69.28 against the greenback. It looked to snap its four-day losing streak. 


European shares march ahead
Bank stocks helped European shares shrug off early weakness on Tuesday, but gains were kept in check by a drop in shares of Airbus and its suppliers after the US ratcheted up a trade dispute with the European Union over aircraft subsidies. A rise in bank shares following two days of losses helped the pan-region STOXX 600 index up 0.4 per cent in thin trade. Most European bourses posted small gains.

The positive sentiment in global peers rubbed off on Indian equities, too.


Expert Take

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

Market gained after a range-bound movement on expectations of a turnaround in earnings growth led by Q4 FY19 results starting this week while positive global peers aided the market. Banks outperformed as outlook improved led by reduction in stressed assets, repo rate and pick-up in credit growth.

25,2019-04-09,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Asian Paints declined nearly 3 per cent in morning trade on Tuesday, extending the losses to the third consecutive session.

Global brokerage CLSA has downgraded to the stock to a 'Sell' from 'Outperform' while reducing the target price to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,565. The brokerage has cut the EPS estimate by 2-5 per cent led by revenue cuts. 

Meanwhile, the company reported that a fire broke out in Andhra Pradesh manufacturing facility on Monday. 

The fire has been brought under control and the company is in the process of assessing the extent of the damage. The manufacturing operations of the plant have been affected. 

Shares of the company closed 3.54 per cent down at Rs 1,443.50 on BSE ."
32,2019-04-10,Asian Paints,"ET Intelligence Group: Over the past five years, cement marketing has changed. Cement sales teams across the industry have often humbled top consumer companies in the race to hire the best talent, and the word ‘brand’ has become central to pricing and product strategies in an industry that makes the world’s most-used manufactured commodity.

UltraTech, the biggest in business, is the face of this industry makeover.

Like consumer staples that harness numerous power brands to justify valuations covering earnings five decades into the future, UltraTech is beginning to command premiums analysts typically assign to FMCG companies. In the past two years, the valuation gap between UltraTech and companies constituting the Nifty Consumption Index has halved.

At present, UltraTech’s is the fifth most expensive stock in the Nifty after consumer companies Titan, Britannia, Asian Paints and Hindustan Unilever. Typically, the Street ascribes superior PE multiples to consumer companies because of their high Return on Equity (RoE) and volume visibility.



Overseas, cement is treated as a part of the building material space and trades at PEs similar to those in commodities industries. The current PE multiple ascribed to Ultra-Tech seems to suggest the Indian market perceives cement as a branded product.

UltraTech is trading at 50 times trailing and 38 times one-year forward earnings. That translates into a premium of 111 per cent to the Nifty’s valuation. By comparison, Zurich-based LafargeHolcim, which owns ACC and Ambuja Cements, is trading at 14.1 times, while the Swiss benchmark index is quoting at 16.8 times.

UltraTech leads its global rivals in growth estimates, underscoring its pricing power in a cement market that is the world’s second-biggest after China. Ultra-Tech’s projected earnings growth for FY20 is 31.9 per cent, compared with a range of 5-27 per cent for its overseas peers. The PEG ratio — a measure of price-earnings per unit of growth — at UltraTech is 1.27, while for top global companies it is 1.8.

This optimism reflects the return of pricing power in India’s cement sector after a gap of at least three years. There is consensus among sector experts and analysts that in the coming months, manufacturers would be able to sustain price increases unlike in the past few years. Sustained investments in infrastructure and lowcost housing projects should help maintain stable demand.

Analysts expect the industry’s operating profit to rise 17 per cent in the March 2019 quarter, the fastest pace of growth in about three years. In the December 2018 quarter, the industry’s operating profit margin was at a 16-year low. Double-digit volume growth in FY19 and higher pricing power prompted CLSA to upgrade UltraTech, with a price target of Rs 5,025."
33,2019-04-10,Asian Paints,"Foreign brokerage CLSA has downgraded India's largest paint maker Asian Paints to ‘sell’ from 'outperform' and slashed target price to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,565 given near term concerns on demand and high expectations from the stock.

The downgrade led to the stock ending down 3.5 per cent at Rs 1,443.50 on Tuesday. The stock closed in the negative for the third consecutive session.

CLSA said the recent trend in several sectors including the automobile and the staples sector raises concern on broader consumption, which is worrying for the paint industry, including the market leader Asian Paints.

These concerns are coming at a time when crude oil prices have risen 33 per cent from their January lows, and titanium dioxide – a key input in paints, is also seeing a rise, said CLSA.

“Slowdown concerns are emerging as several sectors have been showing weak trends: a) Indian auto demand has weakened in the past six months with declines recently; b) HUL (Hindustan Unilever) and Dabur highlighting growth moderation in staples; c) India’s electronics import declining YoY (year-on-year); d) airline traffic growth slowing down,” said CLSA.

The brokerage pointed out that macro data points are also worrying as India’s Gross Domestic Product growth in the October-December period of 2018 decelerated to a near-16 quarter low of 6.6 per cent – a concern for the paint industry given the discretionary nature of spending involved.

For Asian Paints, new capacity will also impact margins going ahead till the new plants ramp-up, said the foreign brokerage.

The paint manufacturer reported a 14.1 per cent increase in consolidated net profit for the December quarter from a year ago at Rs 647.15 crore. The company had reported a profit of Rs 567.21 crore in the same period last year. Revenue from operations stood at Rs 5,293.99 crore in the third quarter, against Rs 4,267.49 crore in the same period last year.

Although CLSA downgraded the stock, majority of analysts tracking the stock hold a bullish view, with 26 out of 36 analysts having a ‘buy’ rating. Eight analysts have a ‘hold’ rating while two have a ‘sell’ rating. The consensus target price is Rs 1,535.29.

The stock trades at 67 times on a trailing basis, which is far higher than last three-years average price-to-earnings ratio of 61.2 times."
34,2019-04-10,Asian Paints,"Dalal Street watchers have been wrestling with a major dilemma for a few years now: the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, a traditional value gauge, has defied all logic to stay elevated and yet the market has delivered solid returns in phases.
When Indian stocks were surging till the middle last week, any talk of market valuations reaching uncomfortable level would meet with a cold gaze.

Sensex has come down some 117 points over the past five sessions amid concerns over a spike in crude oil prices, weaker global growth, uncertainty surrounding the domestic elections and worries ahead of the March quarter earnings seasons.

On Wednesday, the valuation multiple of BSE Sensex hovered at its highest level in 11 years after the recent rally lifted its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to 28 times by March end. Last time the 30-pack quoted around this mark in January 2008, the market was witnessing a raging bull run.

Strong inflows from overseas portfolio managers fuelled a solid dash in Indian stocks for two months, helping the BSE benchmark to advance nearly 7 per cent and hit its all-time high of 39,270 on April 3. Its last all-time high was 36,256, hit on January 31 this year.

Analysts are not ready to slow down investment looking at the high PE multiple. Their refrain: this ratio should not be looked at in isolation.

“Just looking at PE multiple can be misleading. Valuations have to be seen on many fronts. The ratio is looking optically higher due to decades of subdued earnings. Once the problem of deleveraging of corporate balance sheets gets over, capacity utilisation of the private sector rises to 85-88 per cent levels, issues related to asset quality and liquidity problems resolved, then earnings will play catchup. At present, earnings yields of equities are still looking attractive compared with other fixed income,” said Amar Ambani, President, Head of Research at Mumbai-based YES Securities.

Foreign portfolio investors infused more than Rs 51,000 crore in Indian equities through February and March, after having sold shares worth Rs 4,262 crore in January.

Some say the PE itself may have undergone a transformation. “The E (earning) in the PE is at a trough. Once it recovers, primarily on strength from corporate bank earnings, the adjusted PE will be much lower,” says Prabhakar Kudva, Co-Founder and Director of Samvitti Capital.

Compositions of Indian equity benchmarks have changed drastically in recent times. Today they have many high-quality companies that generally trade at high PEs given their strong return ratios and sustainable growth prospects. “We are not worried about high valuations in the market,” said Kudva.

As of March 29, private sector lenders Axis Bank and ICICI Bank were trading at price-to-earnings ratios of 203 times and 75.30 times, respectively, while some other index stocks like Asian Paints, HUL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finance and Tata Motors traded at PE values ranging from 35 to 67 times.

At the same time, Coal India, ONGC, Tata Steel and Vedanta traded PEs of 9.6 times, 7 times, 6.9 times and 6.2 times, respectively.

The Sensex PE has remained elevated for quite some time now, defying traditional stock market equations. It was at 20 times in February 2015 when worries over China debt, the US business cycle, Brexit, Italy’s debt crisis, India’s demonetisation and ballooning bad loans of PSU lenders were haunting investors.

The PE has persistently stayed elevated ever since and yet managed to deliver over 31 per cent returns till date.

Some analysts say the price-to-book value may be reflecting a better picture. This barometer ruled at over 3 times on April 9, far below the 6-times mark where the market traded at the peak of the bull market in 2008. 

Edelweiss Securities says Indian equities are poised for some dramatic growth as economic indicators have hit historical troughs and are likely to inch up from here on.

“This improvement can be the likely basis for an already expansionary fiscal and an expectedly dovish monetary policy. Thus, India seems ready for Reflating the bull,” the brokerage said.

“Higher nominal growth is likely to result in better revenue growth. In confluence with basing out of banking profitability, we expect the earnings recession to limp out and give way to better earnings growth,” the brokerage said in a report.

Nifty faced many downgrades in FY19 as its EPS growth slowed to just 9 per cent year-on-year in the first nine months. Infrastructure and capital goods along with IT were the only sectors that sprang earnings surprises, leading to upgrades. 

Auto stocks faced repeated downgrades as a muted demand environment troubled the sector all through 2018-19. “According to consensus, India Inc would witness earnings growth at 16 per cent CAGR in next three years, significantly breaking out of the current trend. With credit conditions improving and nominal GDP reviving, we should see upgrades going ahead,” Edelweiss said."
35,2019-04-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Around 24 stocks fell to touch their 52-week lows on NSE in Wednesday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows were C & C Constructions, Diligent Media Corporation, Ind-Swift Lab, JVL Agro and Khaitan Electricals.

Mercator Limited, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, Reliance Communications, Radha Madhav Corporation and Vardhman Polytex also featured among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows on NSE.

Domestic benchmark index NSE Nifty was trading 15.60 points down at 11,656.35 while the BSE Sensex was trading 57.55 points down at 38,881.67. 

In the Nifty 50 index, Tata Motors, Cipla, Wipro, Hind. Unilever and Dr. Reddy's Lab were among the top gainers on the NSE. 

However, TCS, Asian Paints, Hindalco Inds., HDFC Bank and Titan Company were among the top losers."
36,2019-04-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A sharp selloff gripped domestic markets in the afternoon session on Wednesday just a day before India goes to polls. 

Much of the damage came from HDFC duo and IT giants Infosys and TCS. 

A cut in global as well as India growth outlook by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and crude's rise to $71 per barrel made investors on Dalal Street nervous. 

The US opening a new trade war front with Europe, the turmoil surrounding Lok Sabha elections starting from April 11 and the upcoming Q4 earnings added to the worries.

BSE Sensex declined 354 points, or 0.91 per cent, to 38,585 while NSE Nifty broke below the 11,600 mark to settle at 11,584, down 88 points, or 0.75 per cent. 

The advance-decline ratio leaned in favour of the sellers. 


Market Bulletin
A good 22 stocks closed in the red while eight bucked the trend. Bharti Airtel slipped 3.28 per cent to top the losers' chart. Asian Paints, TCS, HDFC Bank and HDFC had a hard landing, too. 

Shares of HDFC Bank dropped 2.07 per cent after an ET report that KKR planned to sell 1.14 crore shares of the private lender through a block deal.

Tata Motors, however, jumped 4.68 per cent to top the main board. 

The selloff in midcaps and smallcaps was not as intense as the one in the benchmark. BSE Midcap index declined 0.33 per cent while BSE Smallcap shed just 0.02 per cent. 

Sectorally, telecom was the biggest loser, down 2.09 per cent. Technology, metals, IT, finance and bankex came off nearly 1 per cent each.


Let's track the factors.


Bank, IT in selloff mode
FII favourite HDFC twins and IT giants Infosys and TCS were the major drag. These four stocks were responsible for almost 200-point fall, which is more than half of the total decline of the Sensex. BSE Bankex, IT and Teck fell almost 1 per cent each. 


Election jitters
The recent rally in stocks has been limited to Reliance Industries and a few private bank and IT scrips. Analysts expect the market to consolidate from now till the elections are over. ""The markets are likely to pause between now and the completion of elections and largely be sideways,"" Chakri Lokapriya told ETNOW. Over the past few days, the advance-decline ratio has been leaning towards the sellers.


Global, domestic growth clouds
Caution was the word on D-Street after IMF lowered its global economic outlook. On Tuesday, the IMF reduced its global economic growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 3.3 per cent, citing the US-China trade war and a potential disorderly British exit from the European Union as key risks, according to a Reuters report. 

According to IMF estimates, India’s economy is expected to accelerate to 7.3 per cent growth this fiscal and 7.5 per cent in FY21. All the estimates are 0.2 percentage points less than its previous assessment in January.

In light of these developments, the investors rushed to take profit. 


Threat of trade war 
US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of EU products in a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies, opening a new front in his global trade war. 


The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United St… https://t.co/psI0Zborsf&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1554809679000
The possibility of another trade war did not sit well with markets across the globe as world stocks slipped. US and Asian stocks fell, and the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, dropped below the six-month low reached earlier in the week. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4 per cent and Japan's Nikkei lost 0.7 per cent.


Oil prices spurt
Crude oil prices rose towards five-month highs hit the previous day as Opec production cuts and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela continued to tighten supply, although economic worries deepened. International benchmark Brent futures were at $70.92 per barrel at 0900 GMT, up 31 cents, or 0.44 per cent, from their last close. Rising crude puts pressure on the domestic currency as it adds to the import bill.



Expert Take
Sahaj Agrawal, Kotak Securities
Nifty has been consolidating in a narrow range of 11,550-11,700 for the past few trading sessions. In the short term, breach of 11,550 is expected to limit the upsides for the April series and push the index towards 11,300-11,350 levels. We advise accumulating on meaningful corrections for the larger trend, which remains extremely strong. Metals and auto are staging a bounceback. Any sustenance will indicate strength and support for the broader market rally. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Market slid ahead of the start of the first phase of polling and renewed concern on global economic growth after IMF downgraded the growth forecast to 3.3 per cent for 2019. Rupee remains strong and FIIs inflows were steady which will cap the downside. Election led consolidation may be short-lived and the key trigger will be the earnings growth which is expected to revive from fourth quarter onwards."
37,2019-04-11,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: Mumbai stocks fell on Wednesday as investors hit the pause button ahead of the first phase of India’s mammoth sevenstage elections with polling in 91 seats on Thursday. The International Monetary Fund’s decision to cut outlook for global and Indian growth also weighed on Street’s sentiment. Experts said stocks could struggle to hold onto gains after a sharp pre-vote rally in the past few weeks.

The Sensex slipped 353.8 points, or 0.9 per cent, to close at 38,585.3 and the Nifty ended down 87.6 points, or 0.75 per cent, at 11,584.3. Decliners outnumbered the advances on the Nifty with 29 of the 50 constituents ending in the red. Stock indices in Asia were mixed as concerns emerged over the global growth outlook.

The Sensex has gained 9.3 per cent from the calendar year 2019 low of 35,287.1 on February 19, while the Nifty has climbed 9.4 per cent on the back of opinion polls indicating the BJP-led coalition returning to power on May 23.



The national polls will be held between Thursday and May 19.

Index heavyweight HDFC Bank was one of the biggest laggards. The stock fell 2 per cent after a block deal where private equity giant KKR sold a portion of its stake. Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, Tata Consultancy Services and Housing Development Finance Corporation also fell 2 per cent to 3 per cent. Tata Motors was the top gainer on the Sensex climbing 4.7 per cent. Hindustan Unilever, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Auto and Coal India all rose 0.5-0.8 per cent.



“Fatigue is setting in. Market has more or less factored in the possibility of the NDA returning to power,” said Piyush Garg, Chief Investment Officer at ICICI Securities. Garg added that it could be difficult for the index to rally from current levels. Yogesh Mehta, vice president-retail research at Motilal Oswal Securities, believes that lack of participation from retail investors is making high net-worth investors cautious.

“Mid-caps are not participating and large-cap valuations look stretched for the near term,” said Mehta.

The volatility index, India VIX, also known as the fear gauge, is also pointing towards caution as it is firmly trading above 20 level. India VIX ended up 4 per cent at 21.09 level and analysts expect it to touch 22-23 in the near term.

Oil prices hovering above $70 per barrel is also a near-term headwind for domestic equities, experts said.

Kotak Institutional Equities believes stocks are “getting a bit hot for comfort”.

""The Indian market has largely ignored the recent (1) economic growth deceleration, (2) rebound in crude prices and (3) deterioration in India’s fiscal position,” the brokerage said. “Valuations are largely unattractive for most parts of the market and we note potential downside risks to earnings in the event of a further slowdown in the economy,” it added."

40,2019-04-12,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Frontline indices Sensex and Nifty opened with tepid gains on Friday ahead of release of fourth-quarter corporate earnings of heavyweights TCS and Infosys. 

The market remained cautious, mirroring Thursday's trade, as investors await the corporate earnings and key macroeconomic numbers - IIP data for February and retail inflation prints for March - scheduled for today, to get a direction. 

Lacklustre Asian peers kept the mood sombre while rupee's fall against the US dollar further weighed on sentiment. 

The domestic currency fell up to 30 paise against the dollar in early trade. 

Asian shares were flat and US Treasury yields pulled back on Friday as investor caution prevailed ahead of the release of first-quarter corporate earnings, although stronger US economic data helped offset some concerns about global growth, Reuters reported.

Gains in shares of Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS, Asian Paints and Axis Bank kept the market in the green.

43,2019-04-13,Asian Paints,"It's a question of three Es -- economy, earnings and elections, not necessarily in the same order.

The heat is showing on Indian stocks as the market posted first weekly fall in eight. This followed the IMF lowering India’s growth estimate for 2018-19 and the next two years as well. 

Though corporate earnings for the March quarter kicked off on a strong note on Friday, thanks to TCS and Infosys, investors are wondering what lies ahead.

General elections, which got under way on Thursday and run till May 19, is adding to this level of uncertainties though a win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi is largely being priced in.

Despite all these unknowns, some buying over the last two days of the week kept the downside in the market to a minimum. 

The BSE Sensex slipped 95 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 38,767 on April 12, from 38,862 on April 5. Likewise, the NSE Nifty came off 23 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 11,643 during the same period.

The next week will be a truncated one as the market is shut on Wednesday and Friday for Mahavir Jayanti and Good Friday, respectively. 

Among key data points, WPI inflation for March is slated for Monday. On the global front, Chinese GDP and industrial production data due on Wednesday, along with Opec Meeting, will inject a sense of caution.

Below is a list of top stocks and sectors that made news through the whole week.


Stocks that rallied up to 30%
As many as nine stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Rain Industries (up 30.85 per cent), PC Jeweller (28.68 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (22.92 per cent), Shankara Building Products (16.66 per cent) and Jai Corp (15.20 per cent). 


Pain for 3 scrips Just three stocks such as Century Plyboards (down 11.53 per cent), PNB Housing Finance (down 11.86 per cent) and Reliance Communications (down 22 per cent) on the BSE500 plunged in double digits. 


IPO update
The initial public offering (IPO) of wires and cables manufacturer Polycab India, which was open for subscription from April 5-9, got subscribed over 51.96 times during the week. The Rs 1,345-crore IPO received bids for over 91 crore shares against the total issue size of more than 1.76 crore. 


Lacklustre debut
Shares of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited made a flat market debut on Thursday, listing at its issue price of Rs 19 on BSE and NSE both. The scrip settled 3.94 per cent up at Rs 19.80 on the NSE.


Q4 off to good start
IT majors TCS and Infosys beat Street expectations on Friday with some solid March quarterly numbers. The results came in after market closing. 

While TCS earnings grew 17.7 per cent in January-March from a year earlier, Infosys posted a 10.5 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,078 crore. TCS stock settled 0.26 per cent down at Rs 2,013.75 ahead of earnings whereas Infosys gained 0.63 per cent to Rs 747.85. 

“With robust TCV (total contract value) signings and improving business visibility, we believe that Infosys would gradually catch up in revenue growth with TCS in FY2020E and in turn would narrow the valuation gap with TCS, going forward. Thus, we maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs 840,” said brokerage firm Sharekhan.


Stocks @fresh all-time high
As many as 13 stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs. The list includes stocks such as ICICI Lombard Life Insurance, Gillette India, Bajaj Finserv, PVR, SKF India, Pidilite, Honeywell Automation, Info Edge (India) and Infosys.

Top Nifty gainers/losers
Wipro: With a rally of 8.13 per cent during the week, Wipro was the top gainer in the Nifty pack. Tata Motors (up 5.26 per cent), Bajaj Auto (up 5.12 per cent), Cipla (up 4.28 per cent) and ITC (up 3.80 per cent) brought up the rest of the list. 

Wipro is scheduled to announce its results on April 16. It's set to announce its largest buyback of Rs 12,000 crore ($1.7 billion) on the same day following Sebi's nod to the proposal. 

On the other hand, Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 8 per cent), Asian Paints (down 5.01 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 4.12 per cent) lost the game in the 50-share Nifty pack.

Asian Paints scrip fell after a fire at its paint manufacturing facility in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The manufacturing operations have been affected since. 


DHFL skids
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) came down by over 3 per cent to Rs 167.10 on Friday after rating agency Brickwork Ratings India downgraded its secured NCDs and subordinated debt instruments. An ETNow report suggested that US-based large private equity (PE) player Lone Star Funds is eyeing a stake in the company. 


But SpicJet takes off
Shares of SpiceJet rallied over 10 per cent after the airline announced induction of new aircraft into its fleet. According to a BSE filing, the company will induct 16 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft on dry lease in the next 10 days after regulatory approvals. 


Takeover buzz lifts Ruchi Soya

48,2019-04-17,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: India’s equity benchmarks closed at a record on Tuesday, with the Nifty crossing 11,800 following the forecast of a near-normal monsoon by the weather department and a strong start to the earnings season.

The Sensex rose 0.95 per cent to 39,275.64 points at the close after hitting an all-time high of 39,364.34 while the Nifty climbed 0.8 per cent to close at 11,787.15. The 50-stock index set a new intraday high of 11,810.95. The Bank Nifty index also hit a lifetime high of 30,590.95 points before ending up 1.4 per cent at 30,531.35. There was an element of nervousness, though — the India VIX volatility gauge ended up 2.3 per cent at 21.87 after crossing 22 intraday for the first time since October 31 last year.

IndusInd Bank gained the most on the Sensex, ending 4 per cent up. ICICI Bank, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Larsen & Toubro, Maruti Suzuki India, Asian Paints and Bajaj Auto gained 1.3-3.6 per cent. Infosys lagged for the second consecutive day after guiding for lower profits in FY20 and ended down 0.4 per cent.



“The monsoon is expected to be near normal, foreign investors continue to put in money, markets are looking technically strong and the election outcome is expected to be stable,” said Shiv Diwan, co-head, institutional equities, Edelweiss. “Given these factors, the Nifty may come closer to 12,000 in the April series.”



Nifty forms golden cross

The June-September rainy season is crucial to India’s farm output and the country’s broader economic wellbeing, particularly with growth under pressure.

The Nifty has formed a so-called golden cross on the technical charts, which suggests continuation of market strength, analysts said. A golden cross is formed when a stock or an index’s 50-day, short-term moving average goes past its 200-day moving average.

The Nifty has gained 9.2 per cent and Sensex has risen 9.5 per cent since the beginning of March, primarily due to strong overseas investment flows into emerging markets and opinion polls suggesting that the BJP-led coalition will return to power after votes in the ongoing national poll are counted on May 23. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Indian shares worth a net Rs 1,038.6 crore on Tuesday while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought local shares worth Rs 37.2 crore, according to provisional data. However, the FPI figure is much less than what it was in March. FPIs have pumped Rs 5,800 crore into Indian equities so far in April, including provisional data for Tuesday. That compares with Rs 42,600 crore in March. DIIs have been net sellers to the tune of Rs 936 crore in Indian markets so far this month.

Some market experts said a BJP win is more or less priced in but others believe there is more upside left. The BJP-led government’s response to the Pulwama terror attacks has helped the party’s prospects of retaining power, said market participants.

“The market undertone and liquidity have been strong. Some of the expectation around election outcome has been priced in but it cannot be said if it is fully priced in,” said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer, equity, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co."
49,2019-04-17,Asian Paints,"We have already explained that technical analysts use price actions to arrive at the direction of a stock (ie whether the counter is in uptrend, downtrend or sideways trend). However, these price actions are not complete without volumes and therefore, volumes are also usually plotted in these charts, usually below the price chart.


What is volume?

Traded volume is defined as the number of shares or contracts traded in a counter during a given time period. Hence, the volume chart is plotted depending on the time period selected. For example, hourly chart will carry the total volume traded in an hour, daily chart will reflect the volume during the day, weekly chart will show the entire week’s volume, etc.


Volume vs value

Traded value is calculated by multiplying volume with share price. Since most traders use shortterm charts, using volume or value won’t make much difference. However, value gives clearer picture if you are using long-term charts. If you look at the Asian Paints chart, you will realise that the traded value has multiplied over the years, though the traded volume remained almost flat. Another advantage of value is that it automatically takes care of events such as a split or bonus in the counter. For example, assume that the price of a stock fell from Rs 100 to Rs 50 after 1:1 bonus. Since the price has halved, people may buy double number of shares and therefore, an increase of volume from 1 lakh shared a day to 2 lakh a day should be treated as normal. Traded value will remain same in the above example (ie ?1 cr). However, this will ‘show as a jump’ in volume charts.




Use in fundamental analysis

Volume is important for all market participants. This is because it is very easy to manipulate a counter with very little traded volume (popularly known as an illiquid counter). Long-term investors, especially institutional investors like mutual funds, usually avoid stocks that don’t have sufficient traded volume.


Use in technical analysis

Since technical analysis tools are designed to measure the mass psychology of participants, it can work only if the stock has a large number of investors. That means before trading in any stock, investors need to make sure that the trading volume is sufficiently high.


Use average volume

Unlike stock prices, volume can move up and down drastically within a short time period. While the traded volume in a counter is only a few thousand shares on a particular day, the volume can be in lakh on some other day. By using the average, say 10 day average, investors can get a fair idea about the liquidity of the counter. Please note that the 10 day average is relatively stable in both volume and value charts."
47,2019-04-17,Asian Paints,"The domestic equity market as well as forex and commodity exchanges are shut on Wednesday on account of Mahavir Jayanti. 

Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty scaled fresh life-time close highs on Tuesday, as sentiment remained upbeat for the fourth session in a row on “near-normal” monsoon forecast and optimism over firm corporate earnings.

Asian share markets got off to a guarded start on Wednesday as investors waited anxiously for a raft of Chinese data that might show policy stimulus is finally gaining traction in the world's second-largest economy. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a fraction lower, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.2 per cent.

On the other hand, PowerGrid, Infosys, Tata Motors and Coal India closed up to 0.63 per cent lower.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, “The market rallied to a new high supported by optimism over quarterly earnings and positive global market. A better monsoon outlook from IMD provided relief to investors, who are keen on earnings outcome to accumulate quality stocks despite election led volatility.”

Meanwhile, the rupee lost another 18 paise to close at 69.60 against the US dollar on Tuesday, marking third straight session of decline owing to sustained demand for the greenback from importers and rising global crude oil prices.

Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking said, “We remain cautiously optimistic on the Indian markets and expect consolidation in the near term given the recent rally. Further, earnings outcome of Nifty heavyweights (Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank) this week may provide further direction to the markets.”

On the global front, China GDP data, US-China trade talks as well as corporate earnings will provide cues to the investors. In addition, INR vs USD and oil price movement are the other key factors."

53,2019-04-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian stocks started the F&O expiry week on a bearish note on Monday, as jitters over a possible spike in crude oil prices on US plan to end all sanction waivers on Iran oil imports dampened mood Dalal Street in morning trade. 

Crude oil prices rallied nearly 3 per cent on Monday to levels not seen since November 2018. Citing a source familiar with the matter, Reuters confirmed a report that Washington was set to announce that all imports of Iranian oil must end or be subject to sanctions. Brent crude futures rose to $73.77 a barrel near the November 2018 high.

Surging crude oil prices also hurt the rupee, which slipped as much as 52 paise to 69.87 against the greenback. 

HDFC Bank traded 0.29 per cent higher at Rs 2,296 after the private lender reported a 22.63 per cent year-on-year jump in March quarter profit at Rs 5,885 crore, which was better than a Rs 5,805 crore estimate that analysts had projected.

Reliance Industries slipped 2 per cent to Rs 1,355 even after the company delivered better-than-expected earnings for March quarter post market hours on Thursday. Indian markets were closed on Good Friday. Analysts said the quarterly profit spike was already baked in the stock price. A continuous drop in average monthly billings of RIL’s telecom arm Reliance Jio for the past five quarters proved to be one worry, though analysts said it may finally put pressure on the company to raise tariffs.

A spike in India VIX, the Volatility Index that measures traders’ perception of market risks, to its highest in 15 months, also turned traders and investors cautious ahead of the national election results.

India VIX opened 7 per cent higher this morning.

Record high levels of the benchmark equity indices have also made market participants nervous. BSE barometer Sensex traded 209 points, or 0.53 per cent, down at 38,932, while NSE’s Nifty was down 67 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 11,686. 

""We expect Nifty to sustain above last week’s low of 11,648, and eventually head towards the 12,100 level in the coming weeks. Stock-specific activity would take centrestage as March quarter earnings season accelerates and the general elections enter a crucial stage,"" said ICICIDirect.

On NSE, 14 Nifty stocks advanced, 34 declined while 2 started the day unchanged.

In the Sensex pack, eight stocks traded mildly higher while 22 were in the red. TCS was the biggest gainer, rising 0.91 per cent, after the company deployed an integrated solution for India Post to modernise a network of more than 1.5 lakh post offices in the country. 

Others on the leader board included PowerGrid, Infosys, HCL Tech, HDFC Bank and ONGC.

IndusInd Bank led the laggards, shedding 2.23 per cent. Other losers included Reliance Industries, YES Bank, Asian Paints and Axis Bank.

TCS and Infosys were the biggest contributors to index gain. But heavyweights such as RIL, HDFC and others top bank stocks pulled the market down.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices followed Sensex into the negative territory, losing 0.85 per cent and 0.70 per cent, respectively. 

All the sectoral indices were in the red. The biggest loser was BSE Oil & Gas index, which shed 2.02 per cent on the back of soaring oil prices. BPCL, IOC and RIL proved key drags.

Meanwhile, a Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) report showed business sentiments continued to decline for the country's financial and macro-economic conditions in the second quarter of the year compared with the same period a year before."
54,2019-04-23,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: The sharp rise of crude oil prices following comments by US President Donald Trump on Iran sanctions sparked a sell-off in shares of domestic oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Monday.

Shares of Hindustan Petroleum fell 6 per cent, Indian Oil Corp declined 4.1 per cent and Bharat Petroleum 3.3 per cent, respectively. Investors worry that higher crude prices may not lead to an increase in retail fuel prices because of the general elections.

“The margins of OMCs are under serious pressure due to the global crude oil prices,” said Yogesh Patil, oil and gas sector analyst at Reliance Securities. “Prices have shot up from $64-65 a barrel in February to $74 now. However, due to the ongoing election, this price increase has not been passed on to the consumers impacting the margins of OMCs.”

Shares of Gail, Petronet LNG and Mahanagar Gas fell over 1.5 per cent each. Analysts expect the volatility in the sector to remain and are advising clients to stay away from most of these stocks.

The downturn in the OMC stocks was on account of comments made by the US President that there won’t be any further waiver to countries like China, Greece, India and Japan from buying Iranian oil.

Iran is currently facing both US and international sanctions on account of several global issues. The US had provided a six month waiver to select few countries which enabled them to buy Iranian Oil despite the sanctions. The waiver will end in May and Trump has now said the US is not keen on extending this waiver.

Responding to the announcement, global crude oil prices surged 2 per cent to nearly $74 a barrel. Oil prices have already surged 37 per cent in 2019 so far, data showed. The non-extension of waiver is only a part of the problem as the OMCs are dealing with bigger issues, say analysts.

“The shortfall in oil exports from Iran can be compensated by higher production by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries but the process will take time,” said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research, IIFL Securities. “There are still several structural issues when it comes to Indian oil stocks such as lacklustre earnings, which will continue to weigh on the investor sentiment.”

Analysts said investors should pick the companies which do not depend on the oil business alone such as Reliance Industries. Also, Petronet and Gail which are not primarily into oil marketing could be safer bets.

Sectors sensitive to oil prices like paints could see a correction, said analysts. Asian Paints could be an exception in the space since it has ability to sustain margins without having to increase the prices of its products significantly, they said."

57,2019-04-26,Asian Paints,"I cannot see more than three credible NBFCs surviving this brutal shake out over the next two years, said Saurabh 
   
   
   Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

It is a dull market. Valuations are not that great but one always hopes tomorrow will be better. How does one make money in this kind of a market?
I partially agree with you about the dull market point and I will partly disagree as well. It is a dull market in the sense that like in the last six, seven years, we are set for another year of weak earnings growth. Even if you factor in a rebound in the private sector banks’ numbers, I do not think we will be seeing Nifty earnings growth going too far above the 11-12% mark. Clearly valuations are stretched in that regard and have been stretched for the last couple of years. 

Where I do not think it is a dull market and I do not see the uncertainty being as big as others are making it out to be is we are in a classical Indian setup of high government spending, rising cost of money, consumption is in decent shape, as is small ticket consumption; private sector banks are all set to have a good couple of years as NBFCs and PSU banks struggle and the currency is set to weaken thus favouring exporters. So IT, pharma, private sector banks, FMCG sectors that investors have known and loved for a long time, are set for a good couple of years and in that regard, I am not so sure the outlook is as uncertain as some are making it out to be.


If the evidence is backing the fact that election is more like a short term/sentiment market event, why is there so much of uncertainty? 
It is a natural human sentiment. We are caught between greed on the one hand, the greed that if I could get in early before the result and if I could guess the result, the natural tendency is to believe I could make potentially a lot of money in the next couple of months and the fear obviously is I know that earnings have not been the best for the last six, seven years; I know the earnings outlook even now. Even with an NDA victory, I know PE multiples are stretched and so hey, could the market correct sharply? 

It is a natural human tendency and this sort of investing is as best seen as a hobby. If you want to professionally invest or make good money with your savings, it is best to buy the classical compounders in our country which really are not swayed by elections. 

Kids will have baby milk powder ever after 23rd May, regardless of who wins the elections and in that regard, just to take an example, it is difficult to see why say a Nestle’s earnings should be swayed by the identity of the winner on 23rd May? Similarly, houses will be painted after the elections regardless of who wins and Asian Paints’ earnings therefore should hold up regardless. 

But the human mind does not like boring things. It wants excitement which comes from these sorts of big ticket events and people try to gamble around it. It is natural to want to do so but it does not make you a great deal of money if you want to gamble. It is a good hobby to have but that is not professional investing.


Chris Wood of CLSA is saying that the pain has been further exacerbated in the NBFC space by the blow up in the NBFC issues since the IL&FS crisis. He continues to see a slowdown in consumer credit caused by cut in funding to NBFCs. Do you think smaller NBFCs with a strong parentage would continue to do so in the near future as well?
Two years ago, I started sounding the alarm bell on various TV channels about the state of the NBFC sector and the associated problems with debt mutual fund sector which is very much the banker to the NBFCs and the HFCs. Clearly a lot of these businesses have unviable business models. You cannot be borrowing money in the short-term money market and be lending them for 20 year home loans, it makes no sense. 

I think we are half-way through the blow up. My reckoning is the rest of the blow up in the sector will happen in the six, seven months following the elections. As we read every day in the newspapers, debt mutual funds are having a serious problem with their exposure to the sector and to other promoter funding vehicles.

Those problems will exacerbate over the next six months and we are only half way through what will be a brutal shake out in the HFC and the NBFC sector. There will be a few champions who will be left standing but I think of the top of my head I cannot see more than three credible NBFCs surviving this brutal shake out over the next two years.


IT Well Placed Over Next 12 Months and TCS is Best PlayHow have you assessed the earnings so far and do you have any preferences within the IT pack?
A couple of things to remember, Indian IT obviously is a reasonably commoditised sector and our IT firms are not offering some cutting- edge science and technology. Therefore cost-efficiency and currency is central for them. A weakening rupee is super helpful for Indian IT. Over the next 12 months, the rupee looks destined to head to 75-76 against the dollar. 

That sort of a backdrop is a natural and a super powerful tailwind for Indian IT regardless of what is happening in America or Europe. Secondly, on the basis of what I read on tech commentary, the digital blueprint for the western world is pretty well laid out. It is relatively clear that the Accentures and the IBMs who ruled the roost are now once again back in the mode of giving plenty of work to the Indian IT services firms.

Indian IT services are back in the groove or executing low-cost projects on a well worn template. Finally, low-cost scale gorillas the world over are well placed to benefit from the global supply chains and to my mind TCS as the dominant scale gorilla in Indian IT and indeed TCS is a scale gorilla in global IT. It is a natural beneficiary of that climate. 

So currency, the maturing of the new digital blueprint and scale are the three things to look at and to my mind, TCS is the best play on that. One disclaimer, it is something that we have recommended to our clients over the last couple of months and therefore in some regard, I am already talking my own book. I believe Indian IT generally is well placed over the next 12 months and TCS is the best play. 


Time and again I keep on hearing this argument that Indian IT companies are going the commodity way. They are the ones who do not have a cutting edge and are not in product. But tlook at TCS. This is a business which is giving you free cash flow, the return ratios are strong, cash is coming back to the shareholders and margins are between 25% and 28%. How many businesses in the world can grow at 8%, 9%, 10% at that run rate and give you dividend and cash back or buyback every two years?
Absolutely, I agree with you. The financial strength of these franchises are unbelievable. if I hug back to my book Coffee Can Investing the two things I look for is return on capital employed consistently above 15% and revenue growth consistently above 10%. TCS’s ROCs are in the vicinity of 30% and at the moment they seem to be well set for dollar revenue growth of 10% which should be rupee revenue growth of at least 12-13%. This has all the hallmarks of what is already a legendary franchise and the ability to be a Coffee Can Franchise potentially over the next decade or so.


 In cement, ACC results showed a fair amount of cost pressure and the margins were bog down. But UltraTech Cement saw blowout earnings. Could some of the other companies like India Cement replicate the same kind of performance?
It is entirely possible that we get quarter to quarter numbers which favour certain players. You are right UltraTech’s numbers do look very impressive but the longer term pictures are worth looking at because to make really good money, you need to settle down on 10 large bets on high quality firms and ride with them. 

If I look at the cement sector, I struggle to find too many companies where I can consistently see ROCs north of 15% and consistent revenue growth in excess of 10%. Take UltraTech itself, ROC struggled to get into double digits forget exceeding 15%. Yes,they have had a good quarter may be and they will have several more, but I do not see the makings of a really lucrative stock in the franchise. It could have a good one or two-year run, but it is now one of those stocks where I can put it away and consistently expect 25% compounding. That is the big thing to look out for. Look for stocks which can consistently give you 20-25% compounding on the basis of really superior underlying fundamentals which can grind out superior performance year after year. Asian Paints or HDFC Bank are classic examples of that.


Any more additions to your compounder list? I remember few names from there. You had Abbott, Asian Paints, HDFC... any new additions?
A company which we have not discussed on your programme is Pidilite. It is a classic Coffee Can Compounder with market share of 70% odd in adhesives, ROC’s north of 25% and whilst growth has not been the greatest over the last couple of years, I think Pidilite’s just does not dominate adhesives, but now the waterproofing business as well which bodes well for the future. It is a well-run firm and part of our portfolio.


Most of us do not invest with a 10-15 years view. We have a 2-3 year view. On a two-to-three year view, would Pidilite, Asian Paints or perhaps a P&G make money?
I am not so sure about P&G. I do not know much about the name but on the other two names that you mentioned, if you get a chance to read Coffee Can Investing you will see that even over a three-year period, even if you do rolling three-year returns on these sorts of companies, you tend to get very good returns provided you are willing to give it three years.

Not only will you get good returns from franchises like HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, the Pidilite’s of the world, the volatility of your returns is as low as a Government of India bond. I have consistently tried to explain to people about this form of investing. You are getting returns well ahead of the Nifty 6%, 7% , 8% ahead of the Nifty for half the volatility of the Nifty. 

For a Government bond volatility, you get 20-21% returns pretty consistently even for a period as short as three years. That is all really one can ask for in equities. If you are getting returns well ahead of the Nifty, ahead of the benchmark, half the volatility of the benchmark is as close to a free lunch as people like me can get to in the Indian stock market."

Losses in IndusInd Bank, RIL, Maruti and SBI added to Sensex's decline.

Asian shares too remained subdued, despite another record high close for the S&P 500, as investors await a US Federal Reserve policy decision for clues of whether it will continue to take a “patient” approach to interest rate policy, Reuters reported. 

D-Street would keep an eye on stocks such as TVS Motor, Exide Industries, Can Fin Homes, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Ambuja Cements, Godrej Properties, Gruh Finance, Indian Hotels, Monsanto India, Raymond and Zensar Technologies which are among a few companies reporting their March quarter earnings today.

0,2019-05-01,Asian Paints,"India’s demographic pyramid has traditionally meant that consumer staples would remain evergreen in any investment basket. That script now seems to be changing, and changing rather quickly. Business models that have largely been commoditised no longer offer the margin of safety they once did.

The cement sector is one such example, wherein leadership in crucial micro-markets in a highly regional industry structure holds the key to differential valuations – and investment returns. So, investors should look at companies with distinctive moats, strong cashflows, and predictable profits.

HINDUSTAN UNILEVER
Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) diverse portfolio, covering categories such as homecare, personal care and foods, offers the company a distinct edge among consumer companies. The company is known for brands such as Lifebuoy, Dove, Lux, Knorr, and Wheel.

Two factors work in HUL’s favour. One, its product portfolio is aspirational in nature. Two, these brands are sold at a premium to products from the unorganised segment. In the past 10 years, the company has increased prices of its products at a CAGR of 12%, which has ensured superior volume growth than peers.


ITC
ITC has a dominant market share in India’s cigarette market. It is known for its brands Wills Navy Cut, Gold Flake Kings and Gold Flake Premium lights. It commands 75% total cigarette volumes in India. This dominant position works in ITC’s favour as it provides comfort of earnings’ growth. It serves as a huge entry barrier for other consumer staples companies to replicate. Analysts believe that the company's cigarette volumes are expected to stabilise and increase in the coming quarters.


ASIAN PAINTS
Asian Paints has more than 50% market share in the decorative pain segment. Its large distribution network, which is almost two times that of its nearest competitor, wide product offerings which cover most price points, robust franchise and strong demand work in favour of Asian Paints.

COLGATE-PALMOLIVE
Colgate-Palmolive India is the leader in India’s toothpaste industry. It has close to 53% volume share in the toothpaste category and 45% market share in the toothbrush category. The company has better free cash flow generation compared to its peers in consumer staples, thanks to its strong brand, prompt efforts at innovating products and a deep distribution network.

PIDILITE INDUSTRIES
Pidilite Industries has a monopolistic position in India’s adhesive (known for its brand Fevicol) and industrial chemicals.

Post the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the company has shown better resilience than its peers in terms of sustained volume growth.

Besides, the management's attention to expansion without resorting to high debt --- seen in its recent acquisitions --- shows that it believes in steady and sustained earnings growth.


PROCTER & GAMBLE HEALTH & HYGIENE
Procter & Gamble Health & Hygiene (P&GHH) is the largest player in the sanitary pads segment which is still an underpenetrated market and is growing rapidly.

Through its brand ‘Whisper’ the company controls over 50% market share. P&G HH is also present in health space through brands like Vicks.

In the listed space, the company has no peer which itself gives it an edge over other companies in consumer staples space."
1,2019-05-02,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: JSW Paints will rely on captive consumption from JSW Steel colour coated business to generate initial demand for the newly created venture that aims to earn Rs 2,000 crore worth revenue in the next three years.

Launched on Thursday, the Sajjan Jindal-led JSW group’s JSW Paints entered the highly competitive paints industry in India with an initial investment of Rs 600 crore. The company has built two facilities- a 25,000 kilo litres coil coating facility at Vasind in Maharashtra for industrial demand and another 100,000 kl water-based decorative paints facility in Vijayanagar in Karnataka.

The latter will ramp up capacity to 200,000 kl in the next 18 months over which time the company's investment will also increase to Rs 1,000 crore, Parth Jindal, MD of JSW Paints, told reporters at the launch. 

Initial industrial demand is secured from group company JSW Steel's growing demand for coil coating paints as it is nearly tripling its colour coated steel capacity to 2 MT over a year and a half. The company alone will need 40,000 kl of paint in a year, amounting to revenue contribution of about Rs 1,000 crore to the new paints venture.

""We would be catering to JSW Steel's requirements as well as that of other steel players like Uttam Galva, Essar Steel etc… We believe that with continued growth in the colour coated (steel) segment and with JSW Steel being the market leader there, JSW Paints has a right to win in that area,"" Jindal said. Industrial segment will contribute 25% of the business' revenue with the major contribution coming from the decorative segment.

In the 50-pack index, 38 stocks advanced, while 12 declined.

Among Sensex stocks, 24 traded in the green zone and six in the red. Bharti Airtel was the biggest gainer, rising 1.40 per cent amid an appellate tribunal’s decision to stay the telecom department’s demand for dues of over Rs 9,000 crore from Bharti Airtel as a precondition for approving its acquisition of Tata Teleservices’ consumer mobility division. 

Yes Bank, ONGC, Asian Paints and Power Grid were among other gainers.

3,2019-05-06,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices took a beating on Monday as hopes of a US-China trade deal were dashed by US President Donald Trump’s fresh threat to China on likely tariff hikes. The comments, at this crucial stage, is all set delay progress, as China is unlikely to send its delegates to Washington scheduled for later this week. This along will a host of other domestic concerns are a key drag on domestic indices today. 

The BSE Sensex dropped 362.92 points, or 0.93 per cent, to hit a low of 38,600.34. Nifty50 ended below sub-11,600 level.

Here are key factors which led to a sharp plunge in domestic benchmarks on Monday: 


Trump comments sinks Asia, China down 5% Domestic investors can take heart from the fact that domestic indices were among least hurt indices among Asian peers, which dropped up to 5 per cent in Monday’s trade on fears that extended US-China trade talks could derail recovery in the world economy, especially for export-oriented economies of Asia.

China’s Shanghai Composite slumped over 5.4 per cent, followed by Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 3.84 per cent, Singapore’s STI 3.52 per cent, Taiwan’s TWSE 1.83 per cent and Korea’s Kospi 0.9 per cent. 

Trump on Sunday announced that he would hike US tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. Reports suggests China was considering canceling this week’s trade talks in Washington. 


For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 B… https://t.co/oXh0NKws5m&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1557072526000

5th phase of elections Adding to the nervousness was the kick start of the fifth phase of the general elections. Voting on Monday began on 51 Lok Sabha constituencies from 7 different states. In this phase, nearly nine crore voters will decide the fate of 674 candidates, including political bigwigs Rajnath Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Smriti Irani. After four phases of elections, the voting percentage is 67 per cent, comparable to 67.6 per cent in 2014. 


Concerns over Q4 earningsThere have been concerns over mixed set of numbers by largecap majors. After five consecutive quarters of double-digit volume growth, FMCG behemoth Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Friday reported just 7 per cent volume growth for March quarter. Bharti Airtel, which is scheduled to announce its quarterly numbers today, is projected to report losses to the tune of Rs 1,200-1,300 crore on a 3-5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in sales. A total of 216 companies will report March quarter earnings in this trading week, BSE data suggests. 


Foreign flows may take a hitUS-China trade tensions is likely to take a toll on foreign flows into India and other emerging markets, which have been pretty strong so far. Foreign inflows to India stood at Rs 72,394 in the last three months. That said, inflows in April at Rs 21,193 crore were down 37 per cent from March’s record flows of Rs 33,980 crore. In May so far, FPIs have pulled out Rs 367.30 crore worth of equities. 


Nifty nears lower end of a key range Nifty has been stuck in the 11,550-11,850 range for last 22 sessions. Dips were being bought into, but follow-up buying was missing at higher levels, analysts said. But Monday's sharp fall means the index has been trading near its lower end of the range, a break below which could bring further downside. By 9.45 am, the index has already breached its support of 11,666. 


Market Update:
In the sensex pack of stocks, 28 were in the red while only two were in the green at around 9.30 am. Power Grid was the biggest gainer rising 0.89 per cent, followed by Asian Paints which rose 0.70 per cent.

Meanwhile shares of Tata Motors shed the most, falling over 4 per cent, on reports that that auto major may phase out small diesel cars from its portfolio as demand is expected to slow down due to upcoming BS-VI emission norms that would make such vehicles expensive, according to a senior company official. 

Other losers were Tata Steel, YES Bank, Vedanta, HDFC and IndusInd Bank.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap too slipped into the red zone, shedding 0.47 per cent and 0.36 per cent, each.

On the BSE sectoral front, all sectors declined with the BSE Metal falling the maximum, down, 2.15 per cent led by Tata Steel."

5,2019-05-07,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market fell for a fifth straight session on Tuesday as BSE Sensex after gyrating 600 points ended nearly a per cent lower on heavy selling in Tata Motors, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries.

Market sentiment remained subdued amid fall in global shares after the US President Donald Trump's latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods upset financial markets and fueled worries that trade talks may get derailed.

European shares struggled to stay afloat as trade concerns weigh.


How the market performedBears dominated the show as only seven Sensex stocks ended in the green while 21 fell.

HUL was the top performer, up 1.37 per cent. Other gainers included L&T, Power Grid, Infosys, ONGC and Bajaj Auto.

Tata Motors was the biggest loser, down 4.60 per cent. Other losers were ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, vedanta and Asian Paints.

In Nifty50 pack, 15 stocks advanced, 34 declined while one remain unchanged.

Both the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap ended lower, down 0.98 per cent and 0.85 per cent, respectively.

Infosys was the biggest contributor, however, the mood was spoiled by heavyweights such as Reliance, ICICI Bank and ITC.

On the sectoral front, barring IT, Consumer Durable and Capital Goods, all other sectoral indices declined. The BSE telecom was the biggest loser, down 2.44 per cent led by Bharti Airtel.


Factors that weighed on market:

Weak European marketsEuropean shares were little changed early on Tuesday with London markets leading losses as investors returned from a long weekend to digest a slew of earnings and watch for developments around US-China trade talks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index flitted between gains and losses and was last up 0.1 percent by 0735 GMT.


Concerns over GSTTrading sentiment also got hampered with S&P Global Ratings’ latest report stating that Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in India is not likely to reduce the deficit of state governments significantly, amid large and growing expenditure mandates for the social sector as well as capital spending.


Uninspiring earningsThe market mood was further dragged because of lacklustre March quarter earnings, which reflect towards a slowdown in Indian economy and a delay in the much-awaited revival in earnings. These developments developments that are likely to promote investor unease


Sharp selloffThe negative breath was triggered owing to a sharp selloff in the index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, ITC and Tata Motors.


Trade tensionsEscalating trade tensions and uncertainty over election outcome remain an overhang on the markets continuing the past bearish mood.


Expert Take
Indian markets have been on a shaky ground for the past couple of days driven by ambiguity associated with the US-China trade negotiations and less-than-inspiring ongoing corporate earnings season. Further, the ongoing election season is another major variable that markets are watching closely. In the current scenario it’s critical that market participants keep resources handy to take advantage of opportunities once stability revives- Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Centrum Broking"
8,2019-05-08,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Asian Paints is likely to post double-digit topline as well as bottomline growth for the quarter ended March 2019 on Thursday. 

Edelweiss Securities projected that the company may report 23.30 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 611.50 crore in Q4FY19 on 17.50 per cent and 11.20 per cent YoY jump in EBITDA and revenues. 

The brokerage house added that on the cost of goods sold front, prices of Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) and other monomers have declined from the peak. This coupled with the price hike and stabilising rupee should aid sequential gross margin expansion. Cost rationalisation will further boost margin at the EBITDA level on YoY as well as QoQ basis. A higher tax rate (37 per cent) in the base quarter should see PAT grow ahead of EBITDA YoY.

Emkay Global Financial Services sees PAT and net sales growth of 16 per cent and 15 per cent YoY. It also estimated 14 per cent YoY jump in EBITDA with 12 per cent volume growth. 

“Strong domestic decorative paints demand to drive 12 per cent volume growth. Our estimates of realisation growth of 3.5 per cent factoring in the recent price hikes. Margins to improve sequentially but will be lower YoY due to input inflation and higher overheads on account of the commissioning of new plants,” Emkay said in a report. 

It sees 27 basis points and 124 basis points dip in EBITDA margin at 18.50 per cent for the quarter ended March 2019."

Puri had joined the board of Pidilite as an independent director in 2008 and was appointed as managing director in April 2015.

10,2019-05-08,Asian Paints,"Stocks on Dalal Street continued to bleed on Wednesday, as Sensex and Nifty fell for a sixth straight session on fears of intensifying trade war, foreign fund inflows and a poor set of earnings numbers by Indian companies.

Sensex dived 488 points or 1.27 per cent to 37,789, while NSE Nifty ended at 11,359, down 138 points or 1.20 per cent. 

""Market continued to slide as escalation in trade war and anxiety over global growth dampened risk sentiment. Selling was broadbased while the outflow of foreign funds may impact liquidity. The ongoing Q4 results are not surprising the investors whereas the expectation continued to be positive. Stability in oil prices and drop in bond yield are some positive triggers for the market, which will provide edge over other emerging markets,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.


Here are five key factors that hit stocks on Wednesday:


China-US trade war worriesReuters on Wednesday quoted sources as suggesting that the diplomatic cable from Beijing arrived in Washington late on Friday night had systematic edits to a nearly 150-page draft trade agreement.

That development blew up months of negotiations between the world’s two largest economies. 

As a result, most of the Asian markets were trading in the red. US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese imports. Hang Seng, Nikkei and Shanghai were down up to 1.50 per cent.

Chinese exports also unexpectedly declined in April, though imports surprised with their first increase in five months, painting a mixed picture of the economy.


Slowdown in foreign inflowsForeign portfolio investors have offloaded shares worth Rs 150 crore during the first four trading sessions of May. They had poured around Rs 9,000 crore last month.


Concerns over Q4 earningsThe market mood was further hit by lacklustre March quarter earnings, which reflect towards a slowdown in Indian economy and a delay in the much-awaited revival in earnings. 


Caution ahead of election outcomeMarket participants were also seen sitting on the sidelines and limiting their exposure ahead of general election outcome on May 23.

“What is coming out of the so called non-poll polls is that NDA may not be able to get majority and that is why markets seems to have quietened down in the last couple of days, after the last round of UP elections. Earlier, FIIs were convinced that there was going to be a stable government. We are now looking at maybe horse trading going on for two, three, four weeks,” said Pashupati Advani of pashupatiadvani@globalforay.


Consumption story losing the plotAccording to ET Intelligence Group, consumption is sputtering across a range of products including cars, two-wheelers, air travel and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), with volumes dropping to multi-quarter lows.

The decline in demand stems from an income growth slump in urban and rural areas that’s forced people to curb spending, falling money supply in the economy and rising uncertainty over how customers will respond to regulatory action, experts said.


Market at a glanceLosses in private bank stocks and index heavyweight Reliance Industries also hit stock benchmarks hard.

As many as 27 out of 30 Sensex stocks declined with Bajaj Finance and RIL leading the pack of losers. Both of these stocks lost over 3 per cent. Asian Paints, HCL Tech and TCS, however, ended with meagre gains.

In the 50-pack Nifty, 10 stocks advanced and 40 declined. 

Market minnows, midcap and smallcap declined in line with benchmark Sensex. BSE Midcap shed 0.96 per cent and BSE Smallcap 1.21 per cent.

In the sectoral space, BSE Energy led by losses in RIL, was the worst performing index, ending lower by 2.51 per cent.

It was followed by BSE Realty that shed 2.13 per cent. All indices ended in a pool of red with IT falling taking the least hit."
15,2019-05-09,Asian Paints,"HDFC Asset Management, the country’s largest mutual fund house by assets, lightened its largecap holdings and bought additional shares of select midcap and smallcap companies in April, when the benchmark equity indices advanced 1 per cent. 

The money manager more than doubled its holding in select aviation, NBFC, cement and consumer durables plays in April, even as it sold stake in industry leaders Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints and ICICI Bank. 

The fund house added more shares in as many as 61 companies, while reduced its holdings in as many as 84. NSE’s Nifty index rose nearly 8 per cent during the January-April period, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap100 shed up to 2 per cent each.

Brokerage Elara Capital says midcaps continue their underperformance against largecaps. “Relative valuations are plunging towards -1 standard deviation levels, making midcaps very attractive. A negative SD shows the price to equity ratio has slipped to the lower end of average valuations.

Stocks where the top fund manager raised its holding in April included in InterGlobe Aviation, where its holding has gone up to a whooping 1,94,200 shares as of April 30 from 15,600 on March 31. Likewise, it increased stake in Indiabulls Housing Finance (from 99,238 shares to 3,72,605), ACC (from 8,000 to 27,200) and Bajaj Electricals (from 8,65,300 to 24,60,000).

According to Stewart & Mackertich, improved pricing power, lower ATF coupled with rupee appreciation should aid an improvement in profitability of domestic airlines. With the global ban on Boeing 737 Max 8 planes coming into force from March, capacity is not likely to rise at the expected pace, thus demand should outpace supply in the near future. This means the prospects for yields would be encouraging, the brokerage said. 

“We expect IndiGo to outperform, as it has a deep domestic network with over 43 per cent market share, availability of slots, lowest cost structure and a healthy cash balance to fuel the airline,” the brokerage said.

ACC has been demonstrating sustained ability to improve sales volume since Q1CY17, which had remained stagnant through CY11-CY16. While its CY18 volume growth stood at 8.7 per cent YoY, capacity utilisation came in 85 per cent, Ashika Stock Broking said in a report. 

“We expect ACC to deliver improved RoE backed by better pricing and lower operating expenditure,” the brokerage said.

HDFC AMC also developed fancy for select power plays. Data shows the fund house bought over 1 crore additional shares in NTPC and BHEL during the month. It held 35.75 crore shares of NTPC and 2.04 crore shares of BHEL as of April 30, 2019.

Antique Stock Broking prefers utilities firm like NTPC over equipment makers like BHEL. “In the short run, for a year or two, demand in power equipment and projects is unlikely to grow. Policy makers are consolidating and streamlining the existing 68GW of projects under construction. Plus, in the near term, the focus is on making good of the 175GW renewable target. This is visible in subdued order pipeline for BHEL, a state-owned power-equipment manufacturer. However, with commissioning pace of thermal plants are inching up,” it said

Tiles firm Kajaria Ceramics, telecom major Bharti Airtel as well as private sector bank Karur Vysya Bank also drew interest of HDFC AMC, which added 13,000 shares of Kajaria, 43.65 lakh shares of Karur and 16.77 lakh shares of Airtel during the month.

Coal India, Bank of Baroda, Apollo Tyres, GAIL India, Sadbhav Engineering, Bharat Electronics, Tata Steel, Bharat Dynamics, Jagran Prakashan, Chambal Fertiliser, Power Finance Corporation, Firstsource Solution, REC, Redington, REC, Kalpataru Power, KEC International, Axis Bank, Indian Hotel, BPCL, Gabriel India, SBI, Cipla, ITC, ICICI Prudential, Zee Entertainment and HDFC were among other stocks where the fund house raised its stake during the month.

On the other hand, it offloaded more than 13 lakh shares in Infosys, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries. It also sold over 50,000 shares in Maruti Suzuki, Adani Enterprises, HPCL, Britannia, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Allahabad Bank, Wipro and NBCC, among others.

Brokerage firm YES Securities recently gave a ‘sell’ rating to Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 5,850. “Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) reported a weak performance in Q4FY19 with Ebidta coming in 8 per cent below expectations,” said YES Securities.

In the Nifty50 pack, shares of companies like Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, Wipro and HCL Technologies surged over 20 per cent in the first four months of 2019, while Hero Moto, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki declined over 10 per cent.

Average asset under management (AUM) of HDFC AMC stood at Rs 3.43 lakh crore as of March 31, 2019. It was followed by ICICI Prudential AMC (Rs 3.21 lakh crore) and SBI Fund Management (Rs 2.84 lakh crore) in terms of AUM."

Board meetings (Full list)
 

Analyst calls
• IIFL has maintained reduce rating on Kansai Nerolac Paints with a target price of ₹410. Continued strength in decorative and powder coatings segments is likely to offset weakness in auto coatings and support FY20 growth, the brokerage said. 

• Anand Rathi has upgraded DFM Foods to buy and revised target price higher to ₹361. DFM’s growth momentum will persist, bolstered by its three focus areas: innovative marketing, distribution expansion and introducing products, said Anand Rathi.. The brokerage said it is optimistic on the company with the new products gaining traction and boosting overall growth and profitability. 

• CLSA has maintained sell rating on Vedanta and revised target price to ₹135 from ₹170. The 14-34% rally in zinc and oil prices is benefiting Vedanta as these form 80% of its EBITDA, said CLSA. On the flip side, the slow volume ramp-up in zinc and oil as well as increased costs in Hindustan Zinc are concerns, it added. CLSA believes that concerns of related party transactions and the future use of cash will overshadow earnings outlook. 

• CIMB Securities has maintained add rating on Escorts with a target price of ₹938. The brokerage believes Escorts will continue to outperform in terms of tractor volumes and market share gain. After the recent stock price correction of 17% in April, the stock is looking attractive at 9 times FY21 price-to-earnings considering compounded growth of 14% in earnings per share over FY20-FY21. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Jyothy Laboratories and revised fair value to ₹200 from ₹210. Jyothy Lab's fourth quarter earnings print was weak on all fronts with subdued topline growth and sharp margin decline, off a high base, it said. The company's growth guidance appears ambitious in the backdrop of the current business momentum and demand slowdown suggested by larger players, it added.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
20,2019-05-09,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity barometer Sensex suffered losses for the seventh consecutive session on Thursday as worsening US-China trade relations continued to haunt major markets around the world. 

In the absence of any positive trigger, the domestic market failed to break the multi-day losing spell, as it saw strong selling in energy, telecom, metal, oil & gas and power sectors. 

Participants said other than the gloomy global cues, the ongoing elections have added to cautiousness. March quarter earnings have been mixed so far and they have failed to boost market sentiment.

Sensex closed 230 points, or 0.61 per cent, down at 37,558 while Nifty finished at 11,301, down 58 points or 0.51 per cent. In last seven days, both Sensex and Nifty have come off nearly 4 per cent. 


Let's take a look at highlights of Thursday's session:

RIL loses Rs 28,000 cr in m-capShares of Reliance Industries (RIL) declined 3.41 per cent to settle at Rs 1,255.15 after global brokerage Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from ‘overweight’ to ‘equal-weight’ with a price target of Rs 1,349. The stock has come off nearly 11 per cent after falling for four consecutive sessions, which eroded its market capitalisation by Rs 96,288 crore. On Thursday alone, the company lost Rs 28,081 crore in m-cap. 


Investors poorer & poorerIn last seven sessions, investors have lost over Rs 6.16 lakh crore, as the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 1,46,92,788.80 crore from Rs 1,53,08,828.49 crore on Friday, April 26. On Thursday, equity investors lost Rs 55,000 crore.


229 stocks hit 52-week lows As many as 229 stocks, including Cyient, Amara Raja Batteries, Apollo Tyres, Biocon, Bosch, Cadila Healthcare, Graphite India and Jubilant Life Sciences, hit 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, GKP Printing & Packaging, Gaurav Mercantiles, Halder Venture and Stephanotis Finance were among 19 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


YES Bank surprisesSnapping the losing streak of three consecutive sessions, shares of YES Bank surged 5.94 per cent to close at Rs 170.30 despite reports of rating downgrades. Days after Icra downgraded YES Bank, India Ratings has also scaled down the bank's long-term rating to 'IND AA-' with a negative outlook. Analysts said short-covering at cheaper price might have given the stock a boost. 


Asian Paints down 2%Shares of Asian Paints finished 2.29 per cent lower at Rs 1,355 after the company reported a 1.6 per cent year-on-year fall in consolidated profit after minority interest at Rs 473.11 crore, falling short of Rs 595 crore that analysts had projected in an ETNOW poll. 


Zee shares surge 7%Shares of Zee Entertainment jumped 7.31 per cent to Rs 357.65, a day after it denied rumours of concerns over the audit of its financial statements. Besides, the stock gained after the company told stock exchanges that the stake sale process, undertaken by Essel Group, is at an advanced stage. 


52 stocks show bearish signalMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 52 counters on BSE. Among the stocks were HDFC Bank, HDFC Life Insurance, InterGlobe Aviation, Oil India, Tech Mahindra and GRUH Finance. On the other hand, Hexaware Technologies, Cyient, Albert David, Atul and Dynacons Systems were among 36 stocks that showed bullish crossovers.


56 stocks in oversold zoneMomentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 56 stocks in the oversold zone on BSE. Among them were Eveready Industries, Escorts, Dabur India, Phillips Carbon, Cox & Kings, DB Realty and Britannia Industries. On the other hand, Esaar (India), Halder Venture, Source Natural Foods and Aavas Financiers were among 19 stocks that entered the overbought zone.


Asian Paints, NIIT Tech below 200 DMAsSundaram Finance, Minda Industries, Phoenix Mills, Asian Paints, NIIT Technologies, SKF India and JSW Energy featured among the stocks that traded below their 200 DMAs. On the other hand, Sanghvi Movers, Mawana Sugars, Welspun Corp, Indiabulls Real Estate and Adhunik Metaliks were among the stocks that witnessed positive breakouts and traded above their 200-DMAs."
14,2019-05-09,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian indices opened lower on Thursday, tracking somber mood in other Asian peers, as escalating trade melee between two of the world's biggest economies coupled with uncertainty surrounding election outcome dampened mood back home. 

President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of breaking the deal and warned that it would face stiff tariffs if no agreement is reached. The two sides sent out conflicting signals as they prepared to meet in Washington, with President Trump expressing optimism about the prospect of a deal and Beijing warning that it would retaliate if the US follows through on a threat to hike tariffs.

Asian shares hit six-week lows in early trade. Japan’s Nikkei average shed 0.9 percent to its five-week low, while South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.8 percent and the Australian benchmark added 0.3 percent 

Keeping in line with the negative mood, rupee depreciated 14 paise against the greenback extending amid heightened US-China trade tensions.

The markets would keep an eye on stocks such as Voltas, HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, GMDC, GSPL, HCC, IoB, McDowell Holdings which will report their March quarter results on Thursday. 

At around 9:30 am, Sensex was trading 202 points or 0.53 per cent lower at 37,586. Its NSE counterpart Nifty lost 57.85 points, 0.51 per cent to trade at 11,301.



""The breach of last five week’s consolidation (11,550) signifies elongated profit booking as participants turned cautious ahead of General Election 2019 outcome amid escalating trade war tension, in turn suggesting a prolonged corrective bias towards 11250–11200 range in coming weeks. Therefore, we expect the bias to remain negative as long as lower high-low is maintained,"" said ICICIDirect.

In the Nifty pack of stocks, 16 advanced, while 34 declined. 

In the 30-pack Sensex, Hero MotoCorp was the biggest gainer, rising over 1 per cent. Infosys, Bajaj Auto, L&T, Maruti and SBI too joined Hero on the gainer list.

On the other hand, Reliance Industries, with a fall of over 2 per cent, topped the loserboard. Other losers were -- NTPC, YES Bank, Power Grid, HCL Tech and M&M.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap too slipped, shedding 0.57 per cent and 0.36 per cent, respectively.

On the BSE sectoral front, all sectors sulked with BSE Energy coming forth as the worst performer, down, 2.10 per cent."
19,2019-05-09,Asian Paints,"In case of a continuous slowdown and worsening of the liquidity challenges, the market may again come down irrespective of what happens at the hustings, said Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


It has been a colourless Q4 for Asian Paints even when it comes to key operating metrics and the overall volume growth. The management has spoken about double digit growth but the Street is not excited. How are you looking at this in tandem with the slowdown in consumption? 
One needs to understand whether putty sales was significantly higher in the overall mix and as a result of that, the revenue was at a lower margin. Having said that, clearly whether you look at earlier Kansai results also, the slowdown which we are experiencing even in the FMCG or consumption sectors overall, seems to be taking a toll on a big company like Asian Paints. 

The decorative sales growth at around 15% suggests that there is a significant amount of impact in terms of growth that we are witnessing. Also one must keep in mind that the raw material prices had earlier gone up and then had come down. So most analysts were pinning hopes on a slight improvement. But there were cases of lower sales and as a result, the margins were also tepid because the company could have been carrying high-cost inventory. One needs to look at those factors in detail before making a final call. 

But definitely, on the face of it, the numbers do look quite disappointing. 


What about Reliance? Has the stock already run up or are you seeing a larger shift in momentum?
Clearly, there is some amount of shift that one is seeing in the overall momentum in the market over the last couple of days. The reason for that is the NBFC and liquidity pressure. Today we had another corporate, which is not from the NBFC sector, talking about some debt-raising being postponed. 

The amount of leverage that people have in the system needs to reduce because people are feeling that because of election results otherwise we do not want to take any chance. So, from a risk-on kind of a thought process, people are clearly moving to a risk-off mindset and looking at how the consumption story is playing out. People right now have difficulty in finding places where they can park their money. 

I would say select IT could be one of the places. Tech Mahindra is one stock that we can look at. 

With regard to Reliance, my view is that clearly the overall long-term story looks quite good to us. We believe there could be some issue in terms of growth relative to what it was in the past. For example, look at the Bharti numbers. Earlier the kind of difference there was in terms of growth between Bharti and Reliance Jio, that seems to have subsided a bit. 

From that perspective, the expectation on the Jio side will be slightly tepid going forward. But overall, because of re-gasification and other initiatives, especially on the retail side, the stock from a long-term perspective should continue to be in the portfolio and investors should not worry with the fall that they have seen in the price over the last couple of days. 


In the overall consumption pack, higher valuations number is not that great, outlook is not that great. Do you think a de-rating can come in or is it getting factored in as well?

I do not think it is largely factored in till now. When these kind of changes happen, it is not for a one-two-month period. You need a couple of factors to add up for this to change. One of the key things is that you need people to have more disposable income and for that you need to have more government programmes which lead to better spending of people; more jobs and also easing of liquidity for the NBFC sector. A lot of companies, which were getting into consumer finance space, are holding back in terms of their growth plans. 

These factors clearly have impact in addition to the competition for the overall sector. Overall, my sense is there is still time left before one can say that we have reached the bottom in these companies. Clearly there is a case for time correction in most of these stocks, because multiples will continue to be quite high relative to the kind of earnings these companies are showing.


How would you look at some of the other names that are declaring numbers? When we talk about NBFCs that are coming in, asset quality seems to be decent for a lot of them. But growth is slowing down. How will the market price that in? 
Within NBFCs, one needs to look at some of the traditional NBFCs like Sundaram or maybe a Bajaj Finance. They will be doing pretty well. I do not see much of an issue there. 

The problem is for NBFCs which had higher amount of commercial papers. When they are getting into longer-duration kind of funding, it is taking them time, considering whatever news flow we are seeing. Today, we already have one additional NBFC talking about some issues in terms of payments. 

Until and unless we have more stability in terms of liquidity for the entire NBFC sector, going forward there will be continued pressure on the NBFC sector and investors should not look at averaging at this particular point of time. It is better to wait, look for some government signal or overall improvement in the liquidity and then look at buying these stocks, maybe at a 10-15% lower price from the current levels.


How insulated do you feel we are from jittery global markets? What would you advise in terms of positions right now?
In terms of positions, we have been telling our clients to be slightly light in terms of positions. A lot of leveraged positions that clients used to have, thinking that the market is doing very well, are not there right now. 

People have become a bit circumspect over the last couple of days in terms of the outlook going forward. Tthis risk-off, risk-on trade has the genesis in what is happening internationally. People are nervous about what happens between US and China but whenever there is an extreme movement, there will always be a swing back in terms of the pendulum. 

Right now, whatever you have invested in is fine; keep some 25% of allocation with yourself. Obviously there is a clear expectation that if we have a stable government, then there is likely to be a pop in the market which a lot of people are looking for. But in case we see a continuous slowdown and worsening of the liquidity challenges, the market may again come down irrespective of what happens at the hustings. 

The uncertainty levels seems to have gone up over the last couple of days and for that reason we are telling investors not to be too aggressive. Carrying on with SIPs and doing things in terms of slowly averaging, would be the right strategy to tell to investors at this particular juncture."
18,2019-05-09,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints on Thursday reported a 1.6 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in consolidated profit after minority interest at Rs 473.11 crore for March quarter. The paints firm had posted Rs 480.99 crore net in the corresponding quarter last year.

Analysts in an ET NOW poll had projected a profit of Rs 595 crore.

Consolidated total income increased 12 per cent to Rs 5,075 crore from Rs 4,531.52 crore in the year-ago period.

Segmentwise revenue: Revenue from paint and home improvement segments jumped to Rs 4,899.09 crore and Rs 119.12 crore, respectively, over Rs 4,394.66 crore and Rs 97.64 crore, respectively, in the same quarter last year.

As a result, total revenue from operations excluding excise duty on sale jumped 11.71 per cent to Rs 5018.21 crore.

The company said its decorative business segment registered double-digit volume growth.

The Industrial Coatings JV (AP-PPG) witnessed good growth in the dealer channel for both, powder and protective coatings.

“The Automotive coatings JV (PPG-AP) growth was impacted as a result of the slowdown in the Auto OEM segment. High raw material prices and marketing spends in the fourth quarter affected the margins,” the company said. 


From the desk of MD and CEO: “Challenging business conditions affected operations in some of the key markets in our international business portfolio, especially Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The Kitchen (Sleek) and bath business in the home improvement portfolio grew well and we continue to work on scaling up these operations further,” said KBS Anand.


Dividend: The board recommended a final dividend of Rs 7.65 per equity share for the financial year ended March 31. The dividend, if approved by the shareholders will be paid on or after June 28.


Total expenses: Rise in total expenditure also put some pressure on bottomline numbers. The figure jumped 15.66 per cent to Rs 4,340.64 crore in Q4FY19 over Rs 3,752.94 crore in Q4FY18.


Ebitda: Consolidated Ebitda of Asian Paints declined 2 per cent to Rs 823 crore in March quarter. Margins stood at 16.40 per cent as against 18.70 per cent."
17,2019-05-09,Asian Paints,"Falling for a seventh straight session, domestic equity indices hit two-month lows on Thursday bogged down by trade war jitters, election uncertainty and a mixed bag of earnings numbers. Heavy selling in index heavyweight Reliance Industries added to the pain.

BSE Sensex ended 230.22 points or 0.61 per cent lower at 37,558.91. NSE shed 57.65 points, 0.51 per cent and closed at 11,301.80

Bearish global cues had a domino effect on Indian stock market. US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods beginning Friday, while Beijing said it would retaliate if tariffs rise. Asian stocks tanked, dragging Europe lower.


How the market performedOn the 30-pack Sensex, 13 stocks ended in the green, while 17 stocks traded in the red.

YES Bank was the top performer up 6.44 per cent. Other gainers included Bajaj Finance, TCS, Hero MotoCorp, and HUL.

Reliance Industries was the biggest loser down 3.50 per cent after global brokerage Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. After two years of outperformance, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from ‘overweight’ to ‘equal-weight’ with a price target of Rs 1,349.

Other losers from the Sensex pack included, Asian Paints, Coal India, NTPC, Kotak Bank and Bharti Airtel.

In Nifty50 pack, 23 stocks advanced, while 27 fell.

Broader market suffered too, as BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 0.19 per cent and 0.38 per cent, respectively.

On the sectoral front, FMCG, IT, Consumer Durables, Realty, and Teck were the only gainers. BSE energy was the biggest loser, down 2.63 per cent led by Reliance.


Factors at play

Weak global cuesAsian markets again fell as US-China trade tiff continued to affect investor sentiment. Major Asian markets including Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Nikkei declined up to 2.40 per cent. The Nikkei share average dropped 0.93 percent to 21,402.13, its lowest finish since March 29.

European shares tumbled too amid week cues. The pan-European STOXX 600 index had dropped 0.7 per cent by 0720 GMT, touching a fresh four-week low. China stocks closed at a 11-week low as trade tensions rise. The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 1.9 percent, to 3,599.70, while the Shanghai Composite Index declined 1.5 percent to 2,850.95, Reuters reported.


Heavy selloff in RILOil-to-telecom major Reliance Industries wiped off more than 125 points in Sensex after global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley downgraded the behemoth. The scrip ended 3.41 per cent down at Rs 1,255.15. Selling in HDFC twins, ITC, Larsen & Toubro, NTPC, Asian Paints and Bharti Airtel too weighed market sentiment.


Election uncertaintyInvestors also remained cautious ahead of election outcome on May 23. Market participants were also seen sitting on the sidelines and limiting their exposure ahead of the general election outcome on May 23.


RupeeThe local currency declined around 23 paise to below the 70 mark to 69.9425 against the US dollar in the afternoon trade amid heavy sell-off in the domestic equity market and foreign fund outflows.


Expert Take
Domestic market is in a consolidation mode as the pre-election rally is fading. Investors have turned cautious as domestic valuations are not so comforting given weak results leading to downgrade in earnings. This negative trend may get extended given slowdown in institutional flows and premium valuation. On global front, escalation in trade tensions between US-China ahead of the upcoming meeting further accentuated the consolidation- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"

24,2019-05-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian domestic indices soon took a turn for the worse, after opening mildly higher in morning trade on Friday, after US hiked tariffs on Chinese goods. 

Other Asian markets traded mixed after the tariff hike. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3 per cent, led by gains in Chinese shares. China markets were on midday break when the higher tariffs took effect. The Shanghai composite rose as much as 3.1 per cent early on Friday before paring much of that gain, leaving it up 1.5 per cent.

The BSE benchmark Sensex was down 28 poinst or 0.07 per cent at 37,531 whereas its NSE counterpart Nifty was trading at 11,294, down 7 poinst or 0.061 per cent.

""The index needs to hold key support of 11,200-11,250 and enter a base formation to see a pause in the ongoing correction. The recent consolidation breakdown area 11,550 would now act as stiff resistance, as per change of polarity concept earlier support would now act as resistance,"" said ICICI Direct in a note.

Reliance Industries was the biggest Sensex gainer, up around nearly 2 per cent, after Mukesh Ambani-led company acquired iconic British toy-maker Hamleys for around Rs 620 crore in an all-cash deal. 

Other gainers included -- ICICI Bank, Vedanta, Tata Motors, SBI and Tata Steel.

On the other hand, HCL Tech fell the most, down 4 per cent, following its March quarter numbers. The IT services major posted a 14.3 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 2,550 crore for the March 2019 quarter and set an ""aspirational"" annual revenue target of more than USD 10-billion (about Rs 70,258 crore) in FY2019-20. 

Asian Paints, Kotak bank, Coal India, HUL and Power Grid joined HCL Tech on the loserboard.

On the BSE sectoral front, realty was the biggest gainer. Meanwhile, FMCG, telecom, consumer durables, oil & gas were among the sectoral losers.


BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap traded marginally higher, up 0.02 per cent and 0.14 per cent respectively.

The markets would keep an eye on stocks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Eicher Motors, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, PVR, Oberoi Realty, Syndicate Bank, Vakrangee and Venky’s which will report their March quarter results on Friday."
25,2019-05-10,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Asian Paints declined over 3 per cent in morning trade on Friday after the company missed Street's estimates in its March quarter numbers.

The company on Thursday posted a 1.6 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in consolidated profit after minority interest at Rs 473.11 crore for March quarter. Analysts in an ET NOW poll had projected a profit of Rs 595 crore. 

""Asian Paints' numbers were significantly lower than our and consensus estimates in terms of both- volume and pricing growth,"" said Reliance Securities.

The brokerage highlighted while the company delivered double-digit volume growth for the quarter, higher contribution low-end products led to slower revenue growth. 

Rising cost structure because of the commissioning of new plants and higher marketing spends resulted in significantly lower Ebidta margins, the brokerage added.

The brokerage has downgraded the stock to hold, reducing the target price to Rs 1,305.

Motilal Oswal Securities has also downgraded the stock to sell, with a target price of Rs 1,150.

""We cut our FY20, FY21 earnings per share (EPS) forecast sharply by 16.5 per cent and 15.3 per cent, respectively to factor in the slowdown amid a higher fixed cost environment,"" the brokerage said.

Weakening operating performance and the deteriorating mix over the past few quarters, severely affecting the gross margin, has also triggered a cut in EPS forecast, the brokerage added.

The brokerage highlighted that the uncertain operating environment will hit the prospects of earnings recovery for the company.

""Given the current uncertain operating environment, the prospects of a sharp earnings recovery and a RoCE improvement now appear bleak. P/E multiples of 57.3 times FY20E and 47.1 times FY21E EPS appear stretched,"" MOSL added.

Shares of Asian Paints closed 1.10 per cent down at Rs 1,340.95 on BSE."

27,2019-05-10,Asian Paints,"Reliance Securities has given a hold recommendation on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,305.

Shares of Asian Paints traded at Rs 1,336.9 around 12:10 pm on Friday, 10 May, 2019. The brokerage thinks the stock can hit the target price in one-year horizon.


March quarter highlights:



""Asian Paints' Q4FY19 numbers were significantly lower than our and consensus estimates in terms of both, volume and pricing growth,"" the brokerage said.
Consolidated revenues grew by 11.9 per cent year-on-year (YoY) and Standalone revenues grew by 12.2 per cent YoY. The decorative paints business registered double digit volume growth of nearly 10 per cent for the quarter.
Even as the company has taken price hikes of 6 per cent during FY19, the price growth for the quarter was just 2 per cent. This is attributable to higher contribution of bottom of pyramid products like Putty, Distemper and emulsion paints.
The growth in industrial coatings category was strong during the quarter but international business growth remained sluggish due challenges in Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Consolidated Ebidta for the quarter declined by 2 per cent YoY to Rs 820 crore. Consolidated margins at 16.4 per cent declined by 230bps YoY. The quarter’s margins are lowest in the last 13 quarters.
PAT declined by 5 per cent YoY as depreciation expenses increased significantly on commissioning of new plants and sluggish Ebidta.
Gross margins declined by 160bps YoY but improved by 60bps QoQ. The management indicated that the raw material pricing environment remains uncertain but have not initiated any price hike in Q4FY19. 


Rationale for the hold recommendation:

Considering the slower revenue growth and impact of rising cost structure, our earnings estimates see material downward revision of 10 per cent each for FY20 and FY21, Reliance Securities said in a report. 

""Considering the pressure on margins, we cut our target multiple to 42 times, translating into our revised target price of Rs 1,305 implying a significant cut from earlier target price of Rs 1,550. Considering the limited downside, we recommend hold rating,"" the brokerage said."
28,2019-05-11,Asian Paints,"Brokerages have slashed target price on Asian Paints after the company’s profit missed Street estimates in the March quarter. The paint maker on Thursday reported a 1.6 per cent fall in consolidated profit after minority interest at Rs 473.1 crore, while consolidated revenue from operations rose 11.7 per cent to Rs 5,018.21crore. Shares of the company ended down 1.1 per cent at Rs 1,340.95 on Friday.

“There is uncertainty over growth and progress of monsoon and easing of the credit cycle need to monitored,” said CLSA, cutting EPS estimates by 1-3 per cent and lowering target price by 8.2 per cent to Rs 1,285.



Citi said Asian Paints’ earnings disappointed in the light of high expectations built after the strong third quarter. Citi has trimmed earnings estimates by 7-10 per cent and maintained a neutral stance due to the earnings miss and uncertain business environment. Jefferies has maintained a buy rating but reduced target price to Rs 1,575 from Rs 1,620.



Motilal Oswal has downgraded the stock to sell with a target price of Rs 1,150, and cut EPS forecast for FY20 and FY21 by 16.5 per cent and 15.3 per cent, respectively.

“...even after the sharp earnings cut, the FY21 Ebitda margin forecast of 18.2 per cent is at the higher end of the long-term average, which too could be at risk if crude prices increase further,” said Motilal Oswal."
29,2019-05-14,Asian Paints,"This time elections are turning out to be very noisy with allegations & counter allegations flowing freely which have not been seen in a long time, Raamdeo Agrawal, MD & Co-Founder, Motilal Oswal, who has been a spectator to the markets & to the election process in India for about 30 years, tells ETNOW in a candid chat. Edited excerpts: 


There is a lot of uncertainty over the election outcome. What is the market thinking?A good thing is that this time there is a lot of data flow about election though opinion polls. Though one does not know which one is more authentic, but depending on estimates by psephologists on the numbers, the market is getting a lot of data and based on that, the market is believing is that there is not going to be a disruption, that the current government is going to come with a slightly reduced majority -- about 245-250 this time. But ultimately prediction is prediction and there will be mistakes. It could be even 300, it could be even a little lower than 245, but at least the market is not saying that there will be any major disruption in the current dispensation in Delhi.





After Balakot, there was a sense in the market that there are chances of a complete swipe by the current government. But over the last couple of weeks, the way voting has progressed has coincided with Nifty coming down from almost 12000 to 11300. Is it good that the market is going into this event with tempered expectations?

One month is a lot of time with such a noisy election with claim and counter claim and various other issues. The kind of feeling which was there at the time of Balakot incident a month-month and a half back, that impact has got muted but, somewhere, a lot of opposition leaders kind of lost the way. So there is no alternative. Now the BJP or Mr Modi looks to be a a there is no alternative (TINA) kind of situation. So, to that extent, the certainty of coming back has increased in the minds of the people but as the time passes, other factors start coming and uncertainty starts building up. 

Somebody says that NDA tally might be 180-190. Suddenly it brings down the confidence and then globally also a lot is happening. The stock market is a reflection of everything, it is not only about the election. I would say, the other things have a bigger role in the sense of how the dollar is behaving, how the US-China Trade War is on, how the oil is behaving etc. 

If you see, the FII flow as an indicator of what foreigners are thinking about India right now. I think they have become muted and the decline is because the aggression with which they bought in March and early April, has tapered down.


Even the China-US situation has completely changed in the last one week or so as was absolutely not envisaged earlier. Is this a surprise for the market? They are at daggers drawn because they almost kissed and made up a couple of weeks back?
They seem to have a love-and-hate kind of a situation where every time they find a new reason for postponing a deal by another one month-two months. But the US has gone ahead and raised the tariff by 25%. If by chance it becomes permanent, then it will have a huge repercussion on global trade and global competitiveness of China. A lot of things which China exports right now, the scale and the price at which they can sell is not possible by anybody else but with 25% duty, a lot of other countries particularly India will be very fast to sieze the opportunity. But it has to become permanent. If it is only for a month or two, you cannot take a business decision based on that.


There are sections where the market is already talking about how India may actually turn out to be a gainer because a lot of manufacturing capacity from China can shift to India?
It is too early to say that. I would not count on that too much. That is one aspect. Second, is the how the FIIs react. In March, they came out with Rs 32,000 crore of buying which is unprecedented and that took the market to different levels. The cooling off of the domestic investors from October-November have continued. The March flow is the lowest. Domestics are still very cautious and foreigners are also now sitting on the fence. They are not selling. It all depends on May 23 outcome.


Half the Nifty earnings is almost getting over. What are your reading in the numbers so far? Auto companies are talking about a slowdown which is visible clearly. But even an Asian Paints with 12% volume growth, Kajaria at 11-12% volume growth and HUL with a sombre commentary giving 7% volume growth are there. What is the reality in your view?
It is very confusing right now as to how much is the actual slowdown and how much is impacted because of the slowdown in entire credit flow. There is a disruption in the smooth credit flow in the system. There is an aversion to lend and lot of winding down of the NBFCs are happening because they want to become safe. This is a very confusing environment.


If NDA gets anything upwards of 220-230, how do you think the market will react? If the tally is closer to 190-200, how would the markets react?
It is a huge event risk. A lot of local clients I speak to, have taken money out or they are sitting on the fence. It is not about the number. It is about the stability. Even with 225 or even 220, if you are able to provide a stable transition without much noise or breakdown, it is okay. Nobody wants to come with a ruling party who has to make it up from 220 to 272 and midnight oil is being burnt to figure it out. If that kind of situation does not come, where there is a comfortable transition from one regime to the next, the market will be fine and welcome it.


If there is a question mark on that, then probably we should be....
Yes, the market does not like uncertainty. See right now, there is uncertainty. We might say anything about 245, but market wants certainty and the event to be out. That event is not out and so event will be out only on 23rd. If the market corrects further from here, that will be very good. Market expectation will be much more muted.


How do you rate the five years gone by of this government and where do you see the next focus area?
One of the things which is coming out very clearly is job creation. There was a lot of correction of old practices in terms of how real estate industry was taken care of, how the indirect taxes were unorganised. There was demonetisation. A lot of these big changes have been made. Whenever you make big changes, it has its own cost. You cannot do big surgery without pain. So the pain we have gone through, hopefully the next phase will be for growth.


Let us see how much cost they have to bear?
Yes everybody is pro-poor but the pro-poorness has to come from the taxes and taxes can be collected only when the economy grows. I think the growth in the economy and will bring all kinds of things like good job creation, feel-good factor, corporate profits and hence the stock markets. A lot of good things will happen. The focus is on growth rather than beating the significant players in the economy."
30,2019-05-14,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic benchmark indices snapped nine-day losing streak on Tuesday as comments from Washington and Beijing helped soothe investor worries about a deepening trade row.

US President Donald Trump on Monday said he was optimistic about resolving the trade dispute, while a Chinese diplomat also sounded confident about a possible deal, Reuters reported. 

European shares and US stocks futures too moved higher lending a vote of confidence to Indian equities. 

BSE Sensex jumped 227 points or 0.61 per cent to 37,319 with 17 of 30 constituents in the green. NSE Nifty rose gained 74 points or 0.66 per cent to settle at 11,222.

The advance-decline ratio stood at 1:1 on the BSE.

Recovery was also visible in the rupee, which was thrashed in Monday's session. The rupee rose as much as 25 paise to hit intraday high of 70.28 against the greenback. 


Market at a glance:
Monday’s worst-performing stock Sun Pharma was today's top Sensex gainer. The scrip rose 5.87 per cent to end the day at Rs 420.15 apiece. Bharti Airtel, Vedanta, SBI, IndusInd Bank and RIL were among other index gainers. 

However, shares of TCS, down 1.72 per cent, were the worst hit in the Sensex kitty of stocks. HCL Tech, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Auto, Infosys and Asian Paints too joined the loser brigade.

The minnows too showed some strength. The BSE Midcap rose 0.62 per cent while BSE Smallcap 0.30 per cent. 

In the sectoral space, baring IT and Teck, all other indices shut shop in the green. BSE Telecom was the best index performer followed by Energy and Capital Goods. 


Factors:
Hopes of a trade dealGlobal markets including India rose in anticipation of ease in trade tensions between the US and China. US President Donald Trump said he was optimistic about resolving the trade dispute. European shares bounced on Tuesday after hitting two-month lows and US Futures were trading over half a per cent higher.


Recovery in the rupeeThe domestic currency recovered some 25 paise against the US dollar to hit an intraday high of 70.28 against the US dollar. The rupee on Monday had fallen sharply by 59 paise to close at nearly 2.5 -month of 70.51 against the US currency.


Expert Take
The market got some respite after many days of consolidation due to expectation of ease in trade tensions between the US and China, as Donald Trump sounded optimistic about the upcoming meeting. Short covering was seen in beatendown indices such as banks and pharma while IT continue to underperform due to strength in the rupee. Investors are not very aggressive in the market as every rally will be used as an opportunity to book profit and remain watchful on quarter earnings & election verdict.- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"
31,2019-05-16,Asian Paints,"After a 10-year blast up of consumption and a 10-year fall in savings, it makes sense if for 2-4 years, the savings rate recovers back to where we were 9-10 years ago, which is around 25%, said Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


Are we reaching a level where one should be looking for bargains rather than focussing too much on the election permutation and combination? 
I have always felt elections are relatively irrelevant to Indian equities at two levels. First, as I have said several times, I do not think any political party in our country really has the answers to the big policy questions, the big economic issues of our era; such questions as to how do we improve the health of this financial system, how do we create jobs, how do we create social security safety net etc. In the absence of politicians having answers to the questions which really matter, I am not so sure it makes a difference either way who comes to power on 23rd, 24th May. So that is a fundamental reason. 

Secondly, the challenge with the Indian market as I have been saying for the last couple of years has been that it has been overvalued -- 26 times trailing earnings or 29 times trailing earnings. The market is still overvalued and until that overvaluation corrects, I am not so sure overall market level buying will make a great deal of sense even now, regardless of who wins on 23rd May. 



These two points make the elections a non-event for investors. Where I am getting interest is say a situation like ITC. It is a classic coffee can company -- 10% revenue growth, 15% ROC. It meets those criteria comfortably over long periods of time. It is a monopoly for all intents and purposes in cigarettes; it has got a chairman and an MD who knows the company inside out but the stock has not done that much in three, four years. That is the kind of situation which always appeals to me, a high quality dominant franchise, but it does not seem to me that the market has really priced to a level where it becomes unattractive. 

I am looking for bargains in companies where the franchise is superb but the market does not seem to appreciate it. I am not looking for bargains for the market as a whole in totality, which still looks too expensive to me.


You talk very positively about names like Asian Paints, Nestle. They are high quality franchises but it is interesting given the slowdown narrative that has been predominant over the last few weeks. When you are talking about long-term plays, would you still consider buying into some of these names at these levels?
If you are trying to make money in the Indian stock market what is really important is not to lose yourself in the noise and lose the signal. Nestle and Asian Paints have given the signal that they have given over the last 20 years, that in specific segments of the Indian economy, they have an absolutely dominant position. So Nestle’s case in baby milk powder from which comes the majority of their profits. They have almost 90% market share. 

In Asian Paint’s case, for the last 50 years, this company has had more than 50% market share in paints. On metrics like working capital cycle, ability to generate cash, ability to translate profits into cash, ability to drive high ROCE over long periods of time, Asian Paints is unrivalled. 

I suppose my team and I have developed such an appreciation for the strength of these franchises that we do not lose too much sleep over short-term developments. But if other investors out there can do the same, what you are able to buy is really world class franchises. World over, in the last 30-50 years, you will find very few companies which have performed like Asian Paints. It is up something like 1700 times since the IPO in 1983 and over the last 40 years, the underlying fundamentals have been quite unbelievable. 

If you take a longer view, and I am not saying take a decade-long view, even if we take a five-year view, franchises like ITC, Nestle, Asian Paints make you lots of money. If on the other hand, you choose to lose yourself on what will happen on 23rd May well you might be able to entertain yourself on the results day but it is not a particularly lucrative way to invest in a country like ours, which is giving you these incredible franchises which make tons of money.


Everyone says the slowdown is very short term in nature, that the consumer slowdown and the auto slowdown will pickup. What will it take for the demand to come back and historically what are the factors which have contributed to a comeback?
Two things; one, the slowdown is very selective. Look at Titan’s results. There is nothing called a slowdown in Titan’s results, if you speak to manufacturers of high-end apparel, it is not apparent that there is a massive slowdown in luxury consumption. Yes, there is one in auto and there is one in consumer durables, but that is for understandable reasons. Those sectors were funded through NBFC credit and we all know what is happening in the NBFC sector. 

The other thing which is worth doing is just zoom back up and look at what has happened in the last 10 years. Ten years ago, India’s household savings rate was around 25%. Over the 10 years, it has dropped to something like 17%. That is great news for consumption, but that is not very good news from a savings perspective! 

Banks are struggling to get deposits and the problems the NBFC sector is facing is in attracting money. We do need resumption and a recovery in savings in our country to infuse low cost capital into the financial system, into the banking system and therefore, after a 10-year blast up of consumption and a 10-year fall in savings it does make sense for two, three, four years the savings rate does recover somewhere back to where we were nine, 10 years ago which is around 25%. 

From both perspectives, it is worth not overplaying the consumption slowdown. It is not across the board and looking at the big picture over the last 10 years, where we have had a steady decline over a decade in the household savings rate, it is worthwhile pushing that savings rate up because it helps a large sector in our country; the financial services sector. I am not that fussy about this consumption slowdown. It has been overplayed by people who want to create an excuse for why they have bought the wrong sorts of companies. 


Besides ITC, which you said is a perfect Coffee Can Investment portfolio stock idea, where else are you digging out the opportunities?
So, if we go back to the great Rob Kirby’s investment philosophy that he laid out in 1984, we should look for companies which over a decadal period, can give you steady performance year after year. The frontline Indian private sector banks, especially HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank (both are in our client’s portfolios). HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank fit that description very nicely. They have demonstrated over the last 10 years an ability to stay clear of these epic NPA disasters that seem to befall other banks -- both public and private. 

Going into what looks to be a fairly significant financial crisis, they have been going with ample fire power -- both in terms of tier one and a strong CASA franchise. 

Kotak Bank size is now over above 50% which is quite unbelievable in the Indian context. If you want to go beyond consumer and say you are losing sleep about the consumer slowdown, then look at the financial services sector where a combination of sclerotic PSU banks and troubled NBFCs sector is basically going to concentrate the entire lending activity into the hands of four perhaps five private sector banks. The top two are HDFC Bank and Kotak.

It is a very interesting situation in private sector banks. It is very rare to be able to sit in a market and see the entire concentration of economic activity in one sector getting focussed on three or four companies. We are seeing that in private sector banking in India today.


Does it make sense to buy a Bajaj Finance even though it is 6-8 times price to book?
I reckon NBFCs will emerge from this ongoing crisis. The NBFCs will stand tall and I would put a Bajaj Finance in that list. There are three specific things in works for this company which I think are quite rare anywhere in the world. First, you have not just the large corporate backing, but a cash generative cooperate group. There are others in India which have large corporate groups’ backing them, but very few of those corporate groups have an outstanding cash machine in the form of Bajaj Auto and the broader group. 

The second is, Bajaj Finance has worked very hard to reduce the duration of its asset. Then the entire portfolio is not housing finance or real estate developer finance. The portfolio stand is made much lower by auto finance and consumer durable finance. 

Thirdly, intriguingly, in 2017 and the early part of 2018, when every other borrower was reducing the tenure of their liability and looking for shorter and shorter dated money. Bajaj Finance from what I can see the annual report did not do that, they dragged up the tenure of their liability. So, if you have a longer-dated liability, shorter-dated assets, you are crunching the asset liability mismatch down. You got a big cash generating corporate group behind you and over and above that you have got a competent management. It is a good combination and as I said repeatedly, I have never lost that much sleep about short-term valuations for franchises of this quality. It is a part of several of our client’s portfolios.


But choose between an HDFC Bank or a Bajaj Finance. There are sometimes compulsions. You cannot buy both and if somebody has a compulsion for a three-year time frame, which one will make more money?
It is a very tough question I would rather not answer the question. My point is if you got two flares coming up which are going to make lots of money, why worry about choosing? I would have both in my portfolio.


You see growth impacting auto and auto ancillaries in particular, the shift to EVs and also the entire ride sharing phenomenon. What kind of impact do you see there?
I will caveat all of this by saying we are not experts in EV. We are not experts in this whole shift to electric. We read the same newspapers and articles on the internet that you guys do. But what it looks to us is that a combination of policy pressure, policy pressure from governments around the world and the fact that growing scale is making electric batteries and electrical vehicles cheaper. It does mean that our auto industry will also transition to a place probably 10 years hence. Perhaps 30% of cars on our roads will be EV. 

So the old-fashioned ICE cars now going to die away very soon. But it does look that there is a transition underway. Obviously that begs the question as to which Indian auto EM will be able to deal with it. So the auto situation is quite interesting. I do not think the near-term cyclical downturn will last indefinitely. Sooner or later. we will come out of the near-term cyclical downturn. 

But there is the longer-term question as well. How do the giant auto OEMs, which are ICE driven, companies like Maruti, M&M reposition themselves? These are well managed companies. They will find a way out of this cycle, out of the ICE and into the EV world. But I think free cash flow will get squeezed. As these companies take out more money to invest in the EV platforms first an R&D, then in manufacturing I think return on capital employed and free cash flow will come down which in turn has a bearing on what sort of long term valuations the auto OEMs can command. So I would be careful about jumping into buying autos saying that the sector is bottomed out. I think the scale of investment is necessary by the auto OEMs to transition to EV will be quite substantive. The impact to long-term valuations could therefore be quite meaningful.


Let’s touch upon money markets as well. We all know what the market wants. What are you anticipating or what are you pricing in?
I do not think the central bank has that much choice. Look at the scale of challenges facing us in the financial system and the RBI has to keep the system flushed with liquidity. It has done as good a job as it possibly could be expected to do in the last seven-eight months. 

Second, I think we need another 25 bps rate cut. We are in a pretty tricky situation both in terms of bringing down the short term cost of money and in terms of system liquidity infusion. RBI should do as much as it can to take us through what will be a pretty tricky summer for the CP and the NCD market."
32,2019-05-16,Asian Paints,"Beside corporate banks, we have not seen any meaningful improvement in the earnings trajectory so far, said Gautam Duggad, Head - Research, Motilal Oswal Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Any earnings that has positively surprised your own estimates?
Not yet. So far, the earnings season has been in line but the problem is about the future earnings revision which is still showing more downgrades than upgrades. Out of the companies which have reported numbers so far, the upgrades to downgrade ratio is pretty poor. We have seen 35-36 companies where earnings have been downgraded by more than 3%, only 20 companies have earnings upgraded. So clearly, the future direction of earnings is still showing downgrades. 

More importantly, while earning season has been in line, the commentaries have been quite sombre. Whether it is auto or consumer, we are seeing very distinct weakness in commentaries of consumption-oriented companies which is a new development because till about last quarter, we have not heard such weaknesses in the demand commentaries of consumer companies. Those are the two highlights of this earning season so far. 

Obviously, Nifty has shown around 3-4% kind of an earnings growth of corporate banks because the corporate banks numbers have been pretty good on operational front even as they missed their estimates but because the base is so low, if you include corporate banks, the numbers look very different. Beside corporate banks, we have not seen any meaningful improvement in the earnings trajectory so far.


 I also wanted to pick on some of the individual earnings and taking a leaf from the entire consumption basket that you were mentioning, what do you do with names like a Jubilant? Look at their same store sales growth, clearly indicating that all the growth that is coming in the revenues incurred are only from the newer stores, because the SSG growth has come in at single digits?
Yes, you have to remember that the base is very high for Jubilant for this quarter. They had 26% growth on same store growth in the base quarter. Therefore, the expectations were also realigned. People were expecting 8% same store growth, they have delivered 6% which I would reckon is fine in this kind of an environment when other consumer companies like Godrej, Pidilite, Dabur or Jyoti for that matter have delivered very poor volume growth. 

Secondly, on Jubilant itself, there has been a significant derating in the last one year. The stock is now trading at around Rs 42-43 on its own. It is not a cheap stock, but clearly where it used to trade two years back at 60-65 times, have come down to 40 times and going forward, the earnings expectations also not very inflated. 

We are expecting around 17% earnings CAGR stock trades at 43-44 FY20 and 37% on FY21. We need to remain very cognisant of the fact that the same store growth trajectory can moderate from here as well but it has not deteriorated to the extent that other companies have. In the next two quarters, obviously they will again have the high same store growth base to contain. Therefore, you will see earnings normalising there. But the stock has seen an ample amount of derating, we still have neutral there. 

Other discretionary stories also show the earnings have not been great. In fact, we have downgraded Asian Paints to sell. Yesterday, we have downgraded Pidilite to neutral and these stocks have had a tremendous run in the last three-four years. There can be a decent amount of time correction and the stocks typically do not fall 20-30% on price, but they do undergo a decent time correction. The time is right for time correction in some of the stocks.


You are fairly positive on IT. We have not seen any momentum in some of those IT names. Why is IT looking good to you?
In IT, our preference is towards top-tier companies. There are two-three factors which we find interesting about IT. It serves as a defensive in the portfolio when you know other defensives are crumbling. You have seen what has happened to pharma over the last three-four years and even now, earnings are getting revised downwards. So, that goes out of the defensive basket. 

Consumer is a defensive. The valuations are not defensive right now. Most of them are trading at 30% to 40% premium to their own three year, five year averages. In that context, IT with a growth of 10%-12% does provide some defensible element in the portfolio and if election outcomes are adverse versus what the market is expecting, clearly there can be some impact on the currency. From that perspective, IT can serve as a good defensive component in the portfolio. Our preference is towards Infosys and Tech Mahindra within the tier one pack. 

We still do not like many names in tier two barring one or two because tier two had seen a very strong run up till about June 18 and since they have been consolidating. Within IT, we clearly have a bias towards tier one and it is more a call on a defensives and valuations. Clearly they are returning cash to the shareholders. That does provide cushion to ROE and valuations.


What do you do with pharma because with news with respect to the legal tussle for these companies, it is going to pose as a big challenge if at all they are found guilty of hiking prices of these generics, even if they are not they are going to have to shell out a lot in terms of legal expenses. What does this news mean for the companies?
Yes, I agree it creates an additional overhang and uncertainty around this whole legal process and this can drag for a long time. Obviously company-specific impact will have to be evaluated but the fact remains that this sector has been up with one or the other problems -- be it on compliance with FDA, pricing erosion in the US markets and now this additional problem about earnings revision, that has been singularly downward for almost all the top tier names in the last three years now. 

If I can just highlight one data point, five years back the earnings pool of for pharma universe was at around Rs 17,000-odd-crore and even now it is at around Rs 18,500-19,000 crore. There has hardly been any earnings growth in this sector. Clearly ROEs have contracted for most of these names but the point is this is a sector where there is no universal trend and each stock has its own concerns as well as opportunity, you have to be very stock specific. 

While top down, the sector does not look too good even now after so much of correction because earnings revisions is not yet showing a rest."

Brands signing celebrities as an ambassador is age-old and has proved to be effective ammunition in marketing. In the current era of disruption and the advent of new channels and diversified consumer behaviour, the marketing strategy needs to factor people’s time and attention. There is an inherent belief that endorsements provide a higher degree of recall. The genesis of this belief stems from the star stuck Indian diaspora, whether they are film stars, cricketers, You-tubers, social media stars, serial actors, political figures, wealthy businessmen etc.

Some of the iconic brands of the world like Nike, Adidas have signed on celebrities, but that doesn’t limit the usage to big brands alone. In today’s digital age, the different dimensions of celebrities as ambassadors, spokesperson, motivators, equity carriers, influencers and literally the face of the brand have made it easier to incorporate them as part of marketing strategy irrespective of the size of the business. Ironically, the inclusion of celebrities is perceived to be hugely expensive and not advisable for every business. Wrong?

Today, brands must consider celebrities as their own brand ambassadors who recommend their brand freely without any monetary implication. These are passionate fans and they derive immense satisfaction by engaging with the brand and getting acknowledged by the brand. The task simply is to convert a regular user into a brand ambassador. Which means if the user is loyal and they love the brand then, effort should be on to elevate them to become an influencer for the brand. If the audience believes that a person promoting a brand is not paid for it, then they are more likely to believe them. This kind of word-of- mouth marketing works wonders. The current environment is best suited to use celebrities in different ways and brands can leverage them to maximise their bang for the buck. Let’s understand which is the most effective endorsement strategy in today’s scenario.

Social media has become the game changer and has provided the impetus to the concept of influencer marketing. Based on research, 80% of the customers believe all information provided by social media influencers on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram & Twitter. 60% of the consumers make their purchase decisions after considering the information provided by top influencers in the country. Their respective pages have drawn millions of followers and brands are lining up to recruit them to strengthen their online presence. According to Reardon “Influencer marketing is the new word-of-mouth, but scalable—and cost-effective,”. “SMBs don’t have the resources to market one-at-a-time, so influencer marketing makes a lot of sense—communicate to a large group who share a common interest through a mutual thought leader, and you’ll see a much higher conversion rate.”

Here are some examples of brands collaborating with influencers. Nykaa tied up with comedian Rohan Joshi to promote beauty products and it worked well as it was disruptive enough to attract attention. Craftsvilla used 20 women influencers to create content and it had overwhelming engagement. Prajakta Koliwa, the You-Tuber, tied up with Yatra.com to create content about travel.

A great marketing plan would factor celebrities during new product launch, new brand positioning, repositioning, sustenance and resurrection. The mode of dissemination of communication involving the celebrity can take place through many channels and often it’s the right mix of channels that can provide maximum impact and recall. For instance, the new mobile phone brands as part of their new product launch, have roped in Bollywood and
cricket stars and the ads appear in TV and digital channels. Similarly, Ranbir Kapoor is used by Asian Paints to enhance brand appeal. Sometime ago Godrej had used Aamir Khan to revive their brand. But these are big brands and they can afford the big stars. Small businesses or startups can look at the second and third rung actors and sports personalities. When we look at the middle-class population the soap actors are hugely popular and there lies a great opportunity to sign them at a fraction of the cost and manage a decent level of recall.

Since mega influencers are expensive, macro and micro influencers who have less than 10,000 followers with high engagement levels can be considered as they reflect trust, credibility, authenticity and value for money.

Going forward brand ambassadors will expand from mainstream celebrities to influencers and in India where youth is in the driver’s seat, influencer marketing can serve the purpose very well. With new channels coming up, the engagement levels are undergoing change to keep pace with the audience. The craft lies in creating different kinds of disruption involving the influencers to arrest eyeballs. The brands who are witty enough to have a crack at it are definitely going to have a strong brand perception. In today’s fragmented world, brands can opine for using different celebrities across different channels or using a single celebrity across channels. Both the approaches could be right depending on the resources and objectives.

34,2019-05-18,Asian Paints,"It is very unusual that while the GDP growth is 7%, the entire automotive sector is down. This does not connect. Either, the automotive demand has to correct very quickly or GDP itself might get muted, said Raamdeo Agrawal, MD & Co-Founder, Motilal Oswal, in an interview with ET NOW. Edited excerpts:


The final outcome of the election will be known on May 23, This has been one of the noisiest elections in the past 30 years...
Very prolonged and very noisy.


You have actually seen various cycles of the market as well as various election seasons. In your view, how are the markets positioned going into this event?
A good thing is that this time there is a lot of data flow about election. Though one does not which of the opinion polls is more authentic but betting market and other estimates from psephologists give us some inkling about what could be the numbers. So, the market is getting a lot of data and based on that, I believe that there is not going to be any disruption. The current government is going to come back with a slightly reduced majority, about 245-250 instead of 282. But ultimately prediction is prediction. There will be mistakes. It could be even 300, it could be a little lower than 245. But at least the market is not saying that there will be any major disruption in the current dispensation in Delhi.


After Balakot, there was a sense in the market that there would be chances of a complete swipe by the current government. But in the last couple of weeks, the way voting has progressed and markets have coincided with the Nifty coming down from almost 12,000 to 11,300. Do you think it is good that the market is going into this event with tempered expectations?
One month is a lot of time with such a noisy election with claim and counter claim and various other issues. The kind of feeling which was there at the time of Balakot incident a month-month and a half back, that impact has got muted but, somewhere, a lot of opposition leaders kind of lost the way. So there is no alternative. Now the BJP or Mr Modi looks to be a there is no alternative (TINA) kind of situation. So, to that extent, the certainty of coming back has increased in the minds of the people but as the time passes, other factors start coming and uncertainty starts building up. 

Somebody says that NDA tally might be 180-190. Suddenly it brings down the confidence and then globally also a lot is happening. The stock market is a reflection of everything, it is not only about the election. I would say, the other things have a bigger role in the sense of how the dollar is behaving, how the US-China Trade War is on, how the oil is behaving etc. 

If you see, the FII flow as an indicator of what foreigners are thinking about India right now. I think they have become muted and the decline is because the aggression with which they bought in March and early April, has tapered down.


Even the China-US situation has completely changed in the last one week or so as was absolutely not envisaged earlier. Is this a surprise for the market? They are at daggers drawn because they almost kissed and made up a couple of weeks back?
They seem to have a love-and-hate kind of a situation where every time they find a new reason for postponing a deal by another one month-two months. But the US has gone ahead and raised the tariff by 25%. If by chance it becomes permanent, then it will have a huge repercussion on global trade and global competitiveness of China. A lot of things which China exports right now, the scale and the price at which they can sell is not possible by anybody else but with 25% duty, a lot of other countries, particularly India, will be very fast to seize the opportunity. But it has to become permanent. If it is only for a month or two, you cannot take a business decision based on that.


There are sections where the market is already talking about how India may actually turn out to be a gainer because a lot of manufacturing capacity from China can shift to India?
It is too early to say that. I would not count on that too much. That is one aspect. Second, is how the FIIs react. In March, they came out with Rs 32,000 crore of buying which is unprecedented and that took the market to different levels. The cooling off of the domestic investors from October-November have continued. The March flow is the lowest. Domestics are still very cautious and foreigners are also now sitting on the fence. They are not selling. It all depends on May 23 outcome.


Half the Nifty earnings is almost getting over. What are your reading in the numbers so far? Auto companies are talking about a slowdown which is visible clearly. But even an Asian Paints with 12% volume growth, Kajaria at 11-12% volume growth and HUL with a sombre commentary giving 7% volume growth are there. What is the reality in your view?
It is very confusing right now as to how much is the actual slowdown and how much is impacted because of the slowdown in entire credit flow. There is a disruption in the smooth credit flow in the system. There is an aversion to lend and lot of winding down of the NBFCs are happening because they want to become safe. This is a very confusing environment.

On top of it, this election is so noisy. The confidence levels in a lot of businesses, particularly for the months of March-April is quite low. I had gone to a hotel for a party. He was saying April-May was a complete washout. Till March, it was booming and he is guiding me that next month will be a bumper. You are passing through a very low phase of businesses. I would not like to extrapolate whatever is happening right now too much into the future. A lot of things will change.


But at the same time, let’s not disregard the fact that the last couple of years, people got estimates awfully wrong because they started the financial year with strong numbers. What is your own number?
Next year, the earnings growth for Nifty could be more than 20% and one of the sources of earnings growth is going to be the corporate bankers like SBI. So there is confidence and if you read the commentary of the quarterly results, there is a high probability that those numbers will come. If not in the first half, in the second half of this year we must see very determined recovery in corporate profits.


How are you analysing the consumer space? The premium which they had enjoyed for a long time is being mildly stripped off by the market. Is this a mild correction happening and would people reposition themselves there?
In the last 30 years, all these consumer companies have kept on becoming more and more expensive decade after decade. When I started my career in 1989-90, I wanted to buy Asian Paint at 15-16 PE multiple. It was more like 20-21 PE. I thought it was expensive. When I was determined to pay 25, it was at 30 and now it is 50-60! This has happened because of the longevity of these franchises and nobody has been able to damage the franchise quality in a major fashion. That has been the major factor in people staying on to the stocks. They are not willing to sell these stocks and hence it is becoming expensive. 

When you buy at significantly three to four times of the growth rate, say growth is at 15-16%. Till about 30-35 PE, it is fine but the moment you start crossing 60, you are actually speculating. This time at the Berkshire Hathaway AGM, one of the things that was discussed was Heinz Kraft. It was accepted that the business is fantastic because on a tangible assets of around a billion, they make about a billion. The issue is the price we have paid for it.


It is the humility of some of the great investors that they also agree that sometimes they go wrong…
Yes, he was very clear that they overpaid and that is why it is bringing all kinds of….


Let us talk about another area where the market has seen price damage. You have held on to those stocks for long -- the Eichers, Marutis of the world. When the commentary comes in or the numbers trickle in, have you seen this kind of lean patch earlier as well?
Yes we have seen the lean patches but not with so much of money as to exaggerate the situation in the sense that if you are holding a very small quantity in your personal portfolio, you are not that worried, the thing passes. 

I do not bother about my personal portfolio that intensely on a day-to-day basis but when peoples’ money are involved, then you are being reported by analysts, fund managers and by sales guys. Everybody keeps bringing out why you are not performing. That brings in a lot of sensitivity. It is very unusual right now that while your GDP growth is 7%, the entire automotive sector is down. So this does not connect. Either, the automotive demand has to correct very quickly back or GDP itself might get muted.


As a practitioner of market money management and also a citizen watching the economy for such a long time, what is your take on the debate on data quality?
This is a broad aggregate. We do not bother about that much. I take all the data that comes from companies very seriously because that is real, because they have to face it after three months. If Eicher, Maruti or anybody else says next quarter we are going to get this number, they have to face up to it. The slowdown is real in the sense that instead of Rs 1,70,000 crore, you sell Rs 1,40,000. Somebody tells me that my economy is booming but I am not going to believe it. If the company, which has 55--60% market share, are not able to sell cars, that is the reality for me. 


What do you make of Mr Vinod Dasari shifting from Ashok Leyland to Eicher?
Very iconic shift and I think he is a very big performer. I am sure it will be a terrific addition for Eicher.


Some believe that this is the time to position towards defensives and pharma. Stocks like say Divi's or DRL are at life-time highs. What is your view?
Pharma, particularly the export pharma dependent on exports to US or Europe, is not a very generic kind of industry. Every company has its own challenges and its own opportunities depending on what kind of ANDAs or you have filed, which markets you are in and where you are in the cycle. It all depends on the individual business strategy. 

Some companies which suffered earlier, like Divi's, had their own problems a year before and from there they came back and now they are doing very well. Dr Reddy’s had its own set of problems and now they are doing very well. It all depends on individual companies. It is not generic like cement. If one cement company is doing well, almost all the companies are doing well. You have to be very careful in investing in pharma and it is slightly technical also.


How about NBFCs? How are you analysing this space?
One of the things, I keep telling guys is that you can buy a bad cement company, a bad steel company but never buy a bad lender. You are giving Rs 100 and you get that the cover for you is very small. You want to have credit cost of 1% or less than 1%, whereas if one borrower blows up, that can take the entire NBFC down. One has to be very careful in any lender -- be it NBFC or even a private sector bank, public sector banks or whatever. You cannot compromise on the quality of lender.


2018 was a destructive year for midcaps and smallcaps after a good four years. In January again we saw midcaps, small-caps coming back. But that rally fizzled out and it was the largecap which led the market. What is your take on the valuations of that pocket versus largecaps?
These things keep happening. One of the things was that the period between 2014 and 2017 was the main period in which mid and smallcaps flourished.


The Modi rally as they were calling it at that time…
It was a domestic rally. The reason could be anything but the domestic flow was unprecedented. You got Rs 2.5 lakh crores in 2017-18. All the PMS guys were buying small and midcaps and they were buying the same company every day. So they were pushing their own products higher and companies were finding it difficult to catch up with the valuation. 

They were doing well but if you push the company price by 4-5 times in a very short while, what do you do? Nobody complained about the rise. Now it has corrected and that is the complaint. Current levels of valuations are not bad, but it is much lower than what it was 12 months back. Compare what has happened 12 months back with four years back, before the rally started and you will be very happy.


You have just come back from a trip of four cities in the US and have interacted with a host of clients globally. How are they looking at the way Indian economy and political leadership is panning out?
We go and meet all the people who are interested in India. We are not meeting hundreds of them. We are not figuring out how many are interested. We are going to 20-25 guys, all of them who have money here or who are likely to increase their allocation and things like that. 

Second, I found lots of interest in India. Of course, everybody is waiting for the election to get over but I think on the whole. they were positively inclined. 


Historically whenever Mr Modi goes on foreign visit...
It has nothing to do with that. It is just that India is too inevitable. It is too big a country and it is rising too fast in the sense that now we are in the top six-seven countries in terms of market cap and in next 10 years we are definitely likely to be in top three or four. So everybody now has a India strategy. They want some India allocation, some percentage of their funds to be in India and lot of people are under-allocated. 

One of the things is that they have not seen this level of valuation. They love individual stocks but when it comes to valuation, they also give up. The real challenge is broad-basing of the growth so that wherever growth reappears, the fund can be channelled.


If NDA gets anything upwards of 220-230, how do you think the market will react? If the tally is closer to 190-200, how would the markets react?
It is a huge event risk. A lot of local clients I speak to, have taken money out or they are sitting on the fence. It is not about the number. It is about the stability. Even with 225 or even 220, if you are able to provide a stable transition without much noise or breakdown, it is okay. Nobody wants to come with a ruling party who has to make it up from 220 to 272 and midnight oil is being burnt to figure it out. If that kind of situation does not come, where there is a comfortable transition from one regime to the next, the market will be fine and welcome it.


If there is a question mark on that, then probably we should be....
Yes, the market does not like uncertainty. See right now, there is uncertainty. We might say anything about 245, but market wants certainty and the event to be out. That event is not out and so event will be out only on 23rd. If the market corrects further from here, that will be very good. Market expectation will be much more muted.


How do you rate the five years gone by of this government and where do you see the next focus area?
One of the things which is coming out very clearly is job creation. There was a lot of correction of old practices in terms of how real estate industry was taken care of, how the indirect taxes were unorganised. There was demonetisation. A lot of these big changes have been made. Whenever you make big changes, it has its own cost. You cannot do big surgery without pain. So the pain we have gone through, hopefully the next phase will be for growth.


Let us see how much cost they have to bear?
Yes everybody is pro-poor but the pro-poorness has to come from the taxes and taxes can be collected only when the economy grows. I think the growth in the economy and will bring all kinds of things like good job creation, feel-good factor, corporate profits and hence the stock markets. A lot of good things will happen. The focus is on growth rather than beating the significant players in the economy."
35,2019-05-18,Asian Paints,"Last month, startup India saw a crossover that it was delighted with. Rajan Anandan, managing director of Google India, quit to join Sequoia Capital and lead its early stage investment program Surge. Anandan is among India’s most prolific angel investors with over 59 investments. He got a star’s welcome. 

“Rajan is a true angel,” says Amarpreet Kalkat, co-founder, Frrole, an AI-powered social intelligence startup that offers services to businesses. In an ecosystem where business-to-consumer has been the flavour of the season and deep tech-based startups a rarity, Frrole has had its share of rough times. So, when in 2017 Kalkat was desperately trying to raise a bridge round, Anandan came to his rescue. 

“I met him at an event in Jaipur. He took 10 minutes to understand the need and write a cheque. Once he was in, obviously, everyone followed,” says Kalkat. That Rajan’s move represents a leg up for the ecosystem is a view that echoes far and wide in the startup world. 

“Indian VCs often have investment banker pedigree with little entrepreneurial experience. Rajan Anandan joining, with his vast experience, knowledge and networks, will give it a big boost,” says Saurabh Srivastava, chairman, Indian Angel Network. 

Anandan’s move is ultimately just one executive movement in a large industry. But the timing as well as his role in championing India’s internet economy and its entrepreneurs makes it emblematic of larger shifts underway in the ecosystem that funds India’s startups. There are a number of other developments that are signaling subtle but important shifts underway in this space. 


Others “We are seeing both maturing and deepening of the investor landscape, which will have significant implications,” says Alok Goyal, partner, Stellaris Venture.


Spring Follows 
Winter The first wave of venture capital (VC) investors arrived in India in the early 2000s with global giants such as Sequoia and Norwest Partners. Homegrown companies such as SAIF Partners and Helion Advisors joined the fray, too. Often led by investment bankers with deal-making in their DNA, VCs in India behaved herd-like and topdown demonstrating low risk appetite. It was a good start. 

“Remember, Silicon Valley is over a century old. It’s the cycles of experiences that bring maturity. By that yardstick, Indian VCs have done a fantastic job in such a short time,” says Murali Talasila, partner and innovation leader at consultancy PwC. 



Others
In terms of fund availability, the harsh winter that set in late 2015 appears to have thawed well, with VCs retooling for the next phase of growth. Successful tech entrepreneurs such as Sachin Bansal (of Flipkart), Kunal Shah (of Freecharge) and Girish Mathrubootham (of Freshworks) turning investors has provided both heft and depth to the funding scene. 

The behemoth of the investing world, Softbank, decided to quit being a ‘tourist investor’, opening its India office early this year. Temasek-backed Vertex, a global venture fund, has decided to drive India investment decisions through a local office rather than out of Singapore. Quitters are returning. 



Mohanjit Jolly, the erstwhile head of DFJ India, shut shop and relocated to the Silicon Valley in 2016. He is back. Last November, he set up Iron Pillar, a growth-stage venture fund. Amid tough times, many funds shut down, imploded or saw partners exiting. Wiser, many of those partners have resurfaced, launching new funds like A91 Partners, with a more focused investment strategy. Slowly, among a sea of generalists, more and more specialist funds with knowledge and expertise — for instance the agri-tech focused Omnivore Partners—are mushrooming. 

Global incubators and accelerators in India are seeing frenzied growth. While Y Combinator is increasing its India intake, others such as Techstars and Entrepreneur First have rolled out their India programmes. “They will accelerate the maturity of the ecosystem,” says Ashish Goel, co-founder, Urban Ladder. Specialist ones such as the SaaS-based accelerator Uppekha are entering the fray betting on new business models—it gets no equity until the startup achieves a pre-decided revenue milestone. The source of capital in India, too, is diversifying. 


Others
A new breed of MNCs (Philips and Alibaba, for instance) are ploughing in funds. Multiple new funds from countries as diverse as Japan (Beenext), China (Shunwei), South Korea (Mirae) and Abu Dhabi (ADIA) are deploying their capital. Finally, domestic capital, too, is betting on startups. Indian corporations such as Reliance, Mahindra & Mahindra, Godrej and Hero Motorcorp are making investments in startups. 

“Indian VC ecosystem has been nascent. Most investors in their institutional capacities have never built startups,” says Jay Krishnan, ex-CEO, T-Hub. The playbook has mostly been about customer acquisition and market growth, not profitable business. Exits have been poor. The funding drought between 2016 and 2017 has taught some tough lessons. There are early signs of a reset and a rethink in the investor landscape.

New Government, New Hope The frothy boom days of 2014 may be a faint memory. But exactly five years back, this was another world. NDA government had just taken over the reins. ‘Achhe din’ held out new hopes. And India’s startup world was on an adrenaline high. Amid irrational exuberance and mostly copy-cat entrepreneurs, competitive funds-flush investors chased deals and flavours of the season, driving up valuations. Entrepreneurs big and small, including the likes of Ratan Tata, set up family offices and turned angel investors. 

NDA government’s Startup India campaign in 2015 helped along with momentum and some funds. The sobering reality hit home shortly afterwards. Many VC funds such as DFJ, Sherpalo and Canaan Ventures closed shop or exited India. Several startups such as TinyOwl and Stayzilla folded up. In 2016 alone, more than 1,000 startups reportedly shut down. 

Snapdeal is perhaps the best example of the good and the bad times. In 2015, it bought Kunal Shah’s Freecharge for over $400 million. In 2017, starved of funds, Snapdeal sold Freecharge for $60 million and later laid off many employees.

The startup India story had begun to sour. Poor exits, declining valuations, troubled investments and funding squeeze became a recurring theme. Japanese giant Softbank wrote down $550 million in its India investments Ola and Snapdeal. Here’s the macro picture: Since 2006, some $38 billion is estimated to have been invested in India’s startup ecosystem, of which $34 billion is foreign money. Even if one takes a 2X return, this would mean at least $76 billion that ought to return. The VC ecosystem has not even returned $38 billion. 

“So, there is obvious pain in the ecosystem,” says Sharad Sharma, co-founder, iSPIRT Foundation. 2019 is looking like a replay of sorts for both India and startups. A new government is set to form next week amid hope and optimism. Green shoots are visible in the startup world too. 

“Both investors and entrepreneurs have learnt lessons. India is maturing. The confidence in the ecosystem is returning,” adds Sanjay Nath, managing partner, Blume Ventures. 


A Higher Orbit The reset is at multiple levels. The first thing Krishnan notices is that the deal size is getting bigger ($1 million plus at seed stage) and entrepreneurs older (often more than 40 years), and therefore, more experienced. After chasing fancy targets like GMV (gross merchandise value) and market share, there is a greater appreciation of basic values such as favourable unit economics, strong management team and great consumer experience.

“VC funding is a marathon, not sprint. Investors realise it now. From growth at any cost, they are now focusing on business foundation, customer experience and efficiency,” says Sanjeev Aggarwal, who has co-founded Fundamentum, a technology fund, with Nandan Nilekani. 

Share of domestic capital is rising. Sudhir Sethi, founder of Chiratae Ventures, says when they raised their second fund, the contribution of domestic capital was just 20%. “Last October, India’s share crossed 50% in the fourth fund we raised. We learnt very early that rupee capital is stable and also brings a lot of knowledge and networks,” he says. 

Chiratae—with people like Ratan Tata, Infosys cofounder Kris Gopalakrishnan, Asian Paints’ Manish Choksi on his advisory board — aims to bring a lot more than just capital to startups. Partly linked to this is a slight recalibration of how entrepreneurs and their family offices are making investments. 

“In 2015, many Indian family offices and UHNIs (ultra high networth individuals) — from Ratan Tata to Mohandas Pai— got excited about investing directly in startups. Many of them are now routing their funds through institutional vehicles,” says Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence. 

Others are moving on to their next stage of evolution cycle as the gen-next takes over. Previous waves saw both Indian investors and startups inflicted by imitation syndrome with a venture factory strategy, a phenomenon that has played out in other markets like China as well. 

Now wiser, a grounds-up differentiated approach with a focus on deep-tech, innovation-led startups, is beginning to emerge. Not surprisingly, B-to-B startups are gaining both traction and funding. With them, hybrid funds straddling multiple markets – especially the US and India – are gaining currency. 

“We are seeing world-class Indian startups looking to build global business. I am excited about investing in them,” says USbased Sumant Mandal, managing director, March Capital. Investors have often misjudged the India market. 

In the 1990s, MNCs such as Nike and Levis got their business calculation wrong by overestimating their target segment and India’s middle class at 300 million. That mistake “basically got repeated by VCs chasing the internet middle class in the last decade,” says Sharma. 

As a result, VCs mostly funded undifferentiated B2C startups, often copycats from the West chasing urban online consumers, thus ignoring startups that solved real problems of Bharat. Not surprisingly, amid bruising competition and deep discounts, the path to growth, profitability and exits was not easy. 

In fact, many investors missed some of the biggest waves such as digital payments. Humbled, many are course correcting. The strategic shift to Bharat is now discernible. Sateesh Andra, managing director of Endiya Partners, says specialised niches like cyber security and semiconductors have begun to get attention. 

Thanks to Reliance Jio, India’s digital consumer base has been surging (pegged at over 500 million), thus gaining a critical mass and opening up new possibilities. “What we were dreaming about the internet economy now looks possible,” says Sunil Goyal, managing director, YourNest Venture. 


Softbank Effect Two opposing but important trends are playing out. On the one hand, we are seeing the emergence of full-stack investors such as global giant Sequoia, who are expanding to have funding continuum across a startup’s lifecycle from Pre-Series A to late stage. Simultaneously, there is a rise of niche, specialised investors who are focussed on specific sectors (Omnivore) or specific lifecycle stage. 

Fundamentum, focused on growth stage startups, says it offers patient capital with a time horizon up to 10 years. Partly, Sequoia’s Pre-Series A bet is a natural progression. Globally, Sequoia is a full-stack investor. After a decade of existence in India, it is now feeling bolder to enter earlystage investment. Also, among the world’s top five startup ecosystems, a bigger India play has become critical for most global investors. 

“Since Sequoia came slightly later in startup’s lifecycle, it missed a few good opportunities. Surge will help solve that problem,” says Mark Kahn, managing partner, Omnivore. But he also hopes that Surge will improve things for early-stage entrepreneurs. 

“Hopefully, deals will get fairer. Sometimes, especially the not-so-well connected entrepreneurs, have to give away too much for too little.” 

But there is another factor that is pushing Sequoias of the world to rethink their strategy, in India as well as globally. Talk about Softbank and their disruptive play with the $100 billion Vision Fund. “Think of it like this. Everybody is fighting, competing for the deals. Suddenly, somebody gets a nuclear weapon. How do you deal with that?” says a Bengaluru-based serial entrepreneur and investor, who has dealt with Softbank in a few deals. 

A mega $100-billion fund disturbs the ecosystem and skews the power structure is a unanimous view among investors. “Imagine, you have 10% stake in a startup and Softbank comes and takes 40%. Suddenly, your ability to exit 10% is now at Softbank’s mercy. Well… god save you if you are in competition. There is no way you can compete with its muscle power,” says another NCR-based entrepreneurturned-investor. 

Getting into early-stage investing is more complex and logistically difficult but it does help investors like Sequoia have a good deal flow and also gain entry at a lower valuation. At the beginning of another growth curve, India’s startup world is brimming with new hope. With funding drought fresh in investors’ memory, clear-headed rationale guide their investment strategy. But in this volatile world of startup financing, where boom-and-bust cycles are part of the game, irrational exuberance will return some day."

I cannot see a recovery for the next 6-9 months at least, says Maheshwari.Edited excerpts:

You have migrated from Kolkata to Mumbai. So, the financial capital attracts everyone?
 It is more the idea of meeting like-minded people.


Buffett stayed in Omaha and he said look I am very happy, I do not need to interact with Wall Street people; Franklin Templeton is in Chennai, they said look we want to stay away.I wish I was Warren Buffett and Templeton. I would have gone to Asansol.


No, but he said that we want to stay away from the noise because the noise affects our day-to-day market thinking. You should be away from the noise. You have come to the centre where all the noise is there.That is very commonly said but it is not about noise. It is also about information, about sharing news and views but in today’s world, Twitter, Facebook, you get to know everything. It was just let us go and try and see what happens.


What a timing! You have come. What a welcome, what a decisive mandate and what a reaction by the market! What next? Is this the trigger point for all those bleeding small and midcaps to come back to form?I have a different view on this. The broad market is still in pain because if you have 6-6.5% GDP growth, you cannot have 200 companies doing very well. Just imagine a situation where there are five people in a room and there are just three mangoes. The stronger ones will go and take on each and the two weak guys will be left without a mango. If you are five people and seven mangoes, then each one gets to have one of them. The moment we have 7.5-8% GDP growth, it is that point where the smallcaps, the midcaps, the tiny caps and the penny caps do well. Also, there is no problem in the Nifty, there is no problem in the top 30-40-50 companies that are delivering earnings. 

See what happened a couple of weeks back; Pidilite came with a horrible set of numbers.We all thought that the stock is going to go down but it did not, it just went up because just three months of earnings cannot define a company which is going to stay for the next 50 years. We are back in the 2009-2015 era where a handful of 20-30-40 companies would do well, liquidity would chase growth and if there is growth, people will say okay let me get a pie of it.


So, there would not be a broad-based recovery? Would it be very selective even within broader market?I cannot see a recovery for the next 6-9 months at least.


We were taking cognisance of what is going on within the infrastructure space and there is a lot that has been done, a lot of reform push. A lot is anticipated in terms of picking up the overall private capex. If they stick to their promises for doling out sizable amounts, what do you make of the progress in infra?Infra, selectively the Bharatmala, where Nitin Gadkari was handling things, he was really pushing things around. But the problem in infra in 2019 and 2004 is, in 2004 you had probably 25 infra companies in India, in 2019 you have 250 companies and infra is always an L1 thing. The guy who bids the cheapest, gets the order. While infrastructure could make money, buying those infra companies will require a little more intelligence than what it did earlier.


The sliver of the market is growing within financials, consumption and those stocks are available at levels where you would say you got to be crazy to be buying silver at the price of diamond, forget buying gold at the price of silver. This is like if you buy a Bajaj Finance 8 times a book, if you look at AU Finance again, at same kind of a level, how does one invest in this market?I give this example most of the time; if me and you are being chased by a lion, I do not have to run faster than the lion, I have to run faster than you. The point is if there are say 200 companies and just seven of them are growing at 30%, money will chase those seven. A disclaimer, we own Bajaj Finance in truck loads, maybe up to the throat. But the point is, if I get something else at three times book growing at similar rate with similar valuations, I would sell Bajaj Finance the next day and tell the broker to switch all the trade. But there is not anything available. Look at the kind of beating the other NBFCs are taking right now.


Exactly a year ago, RC Bhargava came on the channel and said “itna demand hai ke gaadi ka shortage hai” (There’s so much demand that there is a shortage of cars.) The same guy after one year tell us that we are cutting our production because there is just no demand. HFC guys said a year ago, they were certain of a 15-18% or 18-25% growth. That grown has become de-growth. When demand turns around, it turns around so dramatically and radically that you cannot ever figure out?The theory is if there is a company which has 50% of market share like Asian Paints, Maruti, no recommendations. Maybe Pidilite, maybe a Horlicks which Glaxo Consumer used to sell sometime. When you are yourself 50% of the market, how can you grow at 25% when the market is growing at 10%? So there is an alarm bell and there is something to get very impressed about that this company has 50% of market share because if you are 50% of the market share you would not go out of business, you will still make the business but you cannot grow fast. 

All those companies with 50% market share will reach the growth plateau sooner than later. Look at what happened to Page Industries. In the mid segment, it has 60% of the market share. But you cannot grow fast when you have 50-60% market share. Look at companies where you have 2-3% market share but the market is expanding at say 10% then you can grow at 25% because all you have to do is grow and grab market share from others with a 50% market share.


So what within consumption has the potential to grow at 25%?, Right now we are seeing almost a blanket decline barring in two or three odd names?It is very difficult because a company that grows at two, three, four does not grow at 20%. A company that grows at 5%, grows at 7%. A company that grows at 20%, can grow at 22%. In the consumption space, we own just two companies -- a grocery retailer and a jewellery retailer. No recommendations again, because we think that these are the only two companies that can grow faster. 

Apart from that, I can make a case for Bata may be but then there is the same problem. Bata itself is quite dominant in its space and we like to look at top line growth whereas markets look at bottom line growth because once you have top line growth, the bottom line growth can come in and you can inflate bottom line growth by cutting expenses, advertising, expansion and capacity, but you cannot create top line growth and ultimately over the long term, it is the top line growth that matters. 

Look at companies like Amazon and Apple and Google. May be they spend billions of dollars just to get market share, but that is a way to look at it. I cannot find too many opportunities in even consumer and financials.


Another headline this morning on the Economic Times is that hopes of big reforms will take D-Street bulls to new highs. There seems to be a consensus that with the new government in place, we are going to see a boost in overall sentiments. Only global factors could come as a hindrance. Where do you think we stand on the market front now?The government is likely to go for a big infra push. It had tried to do DeMon so that it could get a couple of lakh crore but that did not happen and it asked the RBI for dividend, but that did not happen. It is looking for a big amount of money which they can put in through the infrastructure space. People tell me that may be an inheritance tax could be coming. But that is not for the stock market to celebrate because this government has told us that it will not walk one line, it will be somewhere between socialism and capitalism. 

If it is only capitalism, then it gets voted out like India shine in 2004. If it is only socialism, then what is the difference between the Third Front and the NDA government? So, the stock markets should celebrate but the celebration should not go beyond the designated time.


We compared the five-year chart of NDA-1 with global markets and realised that in the last five years, S&P and Nifty have given almost neck and neck returns. 4-5% here or there is point to point but that is a way all we need to do. What is the data telling us?Over the last five years, the Nifty has done almost nothing. If you go into the broader market, there is more mud there but still you could find your company. When we meet Bajaj Finance, it has done phenomenally well. It is said it is a stock pickers’ market, you have to become a value buyer. All those things are good enough but ultimately over the last 25 years of Indian stock markets, money has only been made in companies that are growing at above normal rates -- be it Infosys, L&T, Unitech, Pantaloon, Bharti Airtel, Page Industries or Eicher Motors.

Give me one company which was growing at 10% and people made 25x on it. I cannot find even one."

45,2019-05-27,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity indices rallied for a second straight session on Monday amid optimism that Prime Minister Narendra Modi coming back to power will spur economic growth over the next five years. 

Strong support from institutional investors in form of high inflows also boosted equities. Crude oil prices traded stable, below the $69 level.

Bank stocks in addition to shares of Tata Steel, L&T and NTPC added to market gains.

BSE Sensex gained for a second day and closed 249 points or 0.63 per cent higher at 39,683. While its NSE counterpart Nifty ended at 11,925, up 81 points or 0.68 per cent.

In the 30-pack Sensex, 18 out of 12 stocks ended in the green. Tata Steel, with a rise of 5.46 per cent, was the best performing stock. YES Bank, NTPC, L&T, Axis Bank and SBI were other stocks that joined Tata Steel on the gainers list.

Meanwhile, IndusInd Bank, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, ONGC and Bharti Airtel suffered losses, declining up to 2 per cent.

In the broader market, Manpasand Beverages took a big hit. The scrip hit a lower circuit of 20 per cent after the company MD and CFO were arrested on allegations of GST fraud.

Factors that boosted stocks


Hopes of strong economic reformsThe return of Narendra Modi at the Centre buoyed hopes of strong reforms that would boost the economy and would mean well for the Indian markets too.

""Sentiment remained buoyant expecting the better outlook for the economy with the return of Modi government to power. Thereby the domestic equity market registered sharp gains in today's session and ended up by 0.6 per cent, despite weakness in Asian peers,"" Rajnath Yadav, Sr. Research Analyst, Choice Broking said.


Strong FII inflows
The news Modi government's return also buoyed sentiment among foreign investors leading to heavy buying from them in equities. The FIIs in the last five sessions have bought Rs 2,738 crore worth of stocks, which bodes well for the rupee as well.


Expert Take

It is very attractive to invest in midcaps and small caps in spite of runaway in prices during the last few trading sessions. The economy is expected to revamp from the second half of FY20 led by growth agenda. On average they are available at one year forward P/E of 15x compared to an average of 18x in the last 5-year with a peak of 25x. The undercurrent is expected to be buoyant with hope over the upcoming final budget- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"

48,2019-05-30,Asian Paints,"There are around 25 dominant franchises in the BSE500. Most of them have been created by 
‘Unusual Billionaires’ – promoters or CEOs who saw their sectors through a very different lens than everybody else and then proceeded to flip the competitive paradigm to create an enduring competitive advantage.

“…And they shared an interesting set of personal characteristics in addition to some of the specific business actions they took. So they were, as a group, humble and frugal by nature. And sort of patient and pragmatic, in terms of their mindset. They were not overly charismatic, and they were not active seekers of the limelight. They did not speak at Davos. So Buffett is far and away the best known. Many of the other CEOs are virtually unknown today.”

– William Thorndike, author of 
The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success (2012)

The book and the film raise interesting issues. Last week we released a short film explaining how yours truly ended up writing the The Unusual Billionaires. The film contained short interviews studded with nuggets of wisdom from two of the ‘Unusual Billionaires’, Harsh Mariwala (Chairman, Marico) and Kuldip Singh Dhingra (Chairmen, Marico).

Reflecting on his decision to let professional executives run Berger Paints from Kolkata while the Dhingra family maintained oversight from Delhi, Dhingra says in the film that “the only sustainable way [to build a great firm] is to make it some kind of institution so that there is continuity and the [promoter] family can reap the benefit… it is a price to pay for sustainability. It was not a choice to tell you the truth.”

In a similar vein, Mr Mariwala explains in the film why in 2014 he did that rare thing for an Indian promoter; stepped down as managing director and made way for a professional executive, Saugata Gupta, now MD & CEO of Marico.


Thinking differently (from the herd) is difficult
Until we stumbled upon William Thorndike’s The Outsiders in 2013, we used to think of outstanding franchises in terms of the standard business school paradigm of competitive advantages. Thorndike’s book, which lit the creative spark for The Unusual Billionaires, gave us another perspective with which to understand great franchises.

That perspective was the personality of the promoter.

If you dig a little deeper at the businesses which feature in both of my recent books – The Unusual Billionaires (2016) and Coffee Can Investing (2018) – you will see that most of them are dominant franchises almost verging on monopolies. In fact, these dominant franchises can be classified into two buckets:

- Franchises whose monopolies are predicated on rules & regulations which help them erect invisible barriers to entry. These are often the most powerful, the most lucrative monopolies.

- The remaining dominant franchises are created due to a promoter/CEO viewing the competitive paradigm very differently from everyone else in the sector and then proceeding to flip the competitive paradigm in his favour.

This aspect of the Unusual Billionaires continues to fascinate us. Let us illustrate with a couple of examples.

Until the 1960s, paint was sold just like a normal FMCG product i.e. from the factory the product would go to the wholesaler, then the distributor and finally to the dealer. In the late 1960s, Champaklal Choksey, the dominant founder-promoter of Asian Paints until his death in 1997, turned this paradigm on its head.

Choksey got rid of the wholesalers and the distributors of Asian Paints and started selling direct to the firm’s 50,000 dealers. The remarkable distribution network that Asian Paints built in the late 1960s means even today, paint is a unique sector in four different ways:

(1) Paint is the only sector in India where the product goes straight from the manufacturer to the dealer;

(2) Paint is the only sector where the dealer’s shop is replenished multiple times in the same day;

(3) Paint is the only sector where the manufacturer (Asian Paints) earns 97% of the retail price of the product [in all other products the channel accounts for 30-40% of the retail price];

(4) Asian Paints’ distribution logistics are still unmatched.

So, whilst HUL, India’s largest FMCG company, has 7,000 distributors to whom it delivers once a week, Asian Paints delivers to nearly 50,000 dealers four times a day!

Behind this remarkable network architected by Champaklal Choksey is 50 years of proprietary data on paint demand for each neighbourhood in India, for every hour of the day, for every day of the year. That allows Asian Paints to forecast your paint demand just like Amazon can second guess what you will buy when you visit their website next.

Asian Paints’ proprietary data, its forecasting ability and its distribution network give it a working capital cycle of 8 days. Nobody else in the paint sector comes remotely close to Asian Paints on this metric. As a result, Asian Paints RoCE (usually at around 30%) and free cash flows are head and shoulders above its rivals.

What Choksey did to paints, Aditya Puri did to private sector banking in India. When HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh hired him from Citi in Malaysia, Puri started life in HDFC Bank in 1994 much as Citibankers usually do – extend corporate loans and keep NPAs low. Then as banking IT systems evolved in the late 1990s and as a common core banking solution operating across the entire HDFC Bank network came within his grasp, Puri did the paradigm flip and started building HDFC Bank’s Current & Savings Accounts (CASA) machine. He realised that if HDFC Bank could hoover up corporates’ current accounts and affluent individuals’ savings accounts, then at modest cost (around 4%) the bank could access funds which were not just low cost but also stable.

Once this was achieved, HDFC Bank could focus on lending to the safest segments of the economy at 8-9 per cent and still clock a net interest margin significantly in excess of 3.5 per cent points.

As with Asian Paints, a good plan, an ingenuous strategic insight is one thing – relentless execution of that plan marks out both Asian Paints and HDFC Bank. For decades, both firms have stuck to a relatively simple script and built their market leading franchises.


How can we make it easier for ourselves to think differently?
Writer-physician Atul Gawande has written about the phenomenon of ‘positive deviants’ in the medical profession, that a small set of players who are mired in the same environmental conditions as everyone else but stubbornly refuse to allow themselves to be constrained by conventional wisdoms, and as a consequence are able to identify fresh and often counter-traditional ways to address seemingly intractable problems.

“In business, I believe that there will always be positive deviants; brands that are exceptional, not because they are able to run harder or faster than the rest, but because at some fundamental level they have made a commitment to not taking the status quo for granted.” – Youngme Moon in Different: Escaping the Competitive Herd (2010)

Why is it that a small minority of business leaders are able to see the world through a very different lens? Re-reading The Outsiders and The Unusual Billionaires points to three factors:

1. Most of us are social creatures who feel the need to belong to a larger group; thanks to millions of years spent in the jungle, we feel safer if we are part of a larger tribe. That instinct makes us hug consensus opinion and mainstream culture. The makes it harder for us see the world differently. Basically, thanks to evolutionary forces, our genetic wiring makes us see the world through the same lenses as everyone else. An ‘Unusual Billionaire’ ,is therefore, more likely than not, an Outsider, an independent, iconoclastic thinker.

2. Even if we have the vision to see things differently, it takes a few more dollops of courage to go forth and execute relentlessly on this differentiated vision. Not only is the fear of ridicule if we fail, there is also the small problem of not having anyone to turn to for advice when you run into a problem. After all, if you are the first person on the surface of the Moon, you can’t call up a 0800 number and report a faulty oxygen tank! An Unusual Billionaire, therefore, needs to view risks very differently from the rest of us.

3. Not only does an unusual billionaire have to have the courage to traverse the path less trodden and the patience to relentlessly execute, the Unusual Billionaire also has to demonstrate what William Thorndike calls “crocodile-like temperament that mixes patience with occasional bold action” i.e. stay still for as long as possible and then move rapidly & decisively.

Thorndike summarised the unique characteristics of the Outsiders/Unusual Billionaires nicely in the HBR interview which is referenced right at the beginning of this note. At the core of exceptional businesses are exceptional men & women. Meeting them and learning from them makes working in Marcellus the world’s most interesting job.

51,2019-05-31,Asian Paints,"The earlier edition covered the concept of supports and resistances, which are markers of the prevailing market sentiment. Depending on the market mood (optimistic or pessimistic), these supports move up or down, creating an uptrend or a downtrend, which is the concept for this edition


UPTREND: Let us first consider a period of bullish fervour, when an investor loses the opportunity to buy Stock A at Rs 100 and the price shoots up to Rs 130 (i.e. the first top). When the correction starts in that counter, the same investor is afraid that the price may not come down to Rs 100 again; so he starts buying it at a price above Rs 100. Due to the increased buying pressure before the previous bottom (i.e. Rs 100), the stock may bottom out at a higher level, say at Rs 110. Once the stock bottoms out at Rs 110, the number of investors who want to buy it during correction increases. Since they know that the stock is already in an uptrend, they may try to buy it at a price above Rs 110 the next time, and this may result in the formation of another higher bottom. This formation of ‘higher tops and higher bottoms’ is an uptrend.


ET Bureau

UPTREND LINE: An uptrend line is plotted connecting higher bottoms, as shown in the Asian Paints chart. While it is mathematically possible to connect two data points to create a line, it is better to have at least three to form a trend line. It’s the third point that actually confirms the trend. Since these trend lines are formed connecting higher bottoms, it will slope upwards. 


DOWNTREND: Now consider a situation where another investor loses the opportunity to sell Stock B at Rs 200 and it falls to Rs 160. In a bear market scenario, there will be bad news about the stock and, therefore, he would not want to hold on to it. This means he would be ready to sell the stock at the next available opportunity (i.e. the next rally in the stock), even if the realised price is lower than Rs 200. So the increased selling pressure at a price below Rs 200 will make sure that the rally in Stock B will turn around before touching the previous top of Rs 200 (i.e. it will form a lower top). If the bear grip continues to affect the counter, these lower tops can continue for some time. And just like higher tops and higher bottoms making an uptrend, ‘lower tops and lower bottoms’ create a downtrend.


ET Bureau
DOWNTREND LINE: In the same manner that connecting higher bottoms results in an uptrend line, a downtrend line can be plotted by connecting the lower tops. Since it is formed using lower tops, the downtrend line will slope downwards, as is seen from the HDFC Bank chart above."

56,2019-05-31,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market on Friday gave in to global growth concerns, with investors shrugging off falling crude prices and Narendra Modi announcing Cabinet portfolios. 

Nirmala Sitharaman much to D-Street's surprise was named as finance minister. Analysts were of the view that she is capable of steering the economy in the right direction.

Ajay Bodke, Chief Executive and Chief Portfolio Manager at Prabhudas Lilladher felt that Sitharaman was eminently qualified to steer the economy, which is facing multiple headwinds in form of slowing consumption impulses, moribund private capex cycle and anemic exports. 

Benchmark indices after flirting with all-time high levels in early trade ended on a weaker note. BSE flagship Sensex slipped 118 points or 0.30 per cent down to 39,714. The index swung odd 750 points. 

NSE barometer Nifty settled at 11,923, up 23 points or 0.19 per cent lower. 

On BSE, the advance-decline ratio stood at 2:3, meaning for every two stocks that rose, three declined.


Market at a glance
YES Bank, with a fall of 4.27 per cent, was the biggest loser in the 30-pack Sensex. ITC, M&M, Vedanta NTPC and Tata Motors were among other prominent losers. 

On the other hand, Asian Paints, TCS, HCL Tech, ONGC and IndusInd Bank were among the top index gainers, rising up to 2 per cent.

The decline in BSE Smallcap index of 0.65 per cent beat that of Sensex, but BSE Midcap outperformed the benchmark index by logging gains of 0.23 per cent.

BSE Power followed by Metals and FMCG were among the worst performing indices, dropping over 1 per cent, each. Although, IT, Teck and Oil & Gas logged significant gains.

On NSE, only Nifty IT shut shop in the black. 


Factors that weighed on stock market:


Global markets bleedGlobal stocks tumbled as investors feared President Donald Trump's shock threat of tariffs on Mexico risked tipping the US into recession while disappointing China data added to the woes. Markets moved aggressively to price in deeper rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, while US bond yields touched fresh lows and parts of the curve inverted further, seen as a warning signal for recession in the world's largest economy, Reuters reported.

Wall Street - on track for the first monthly decline of 2019 - looked also in line for sizeable falls, with e-Mini futures for the S&P 500 pointing to a 1 per cent lower open.


GDP numbersIndia will announce its March quarter GDP numbers later on Friday and it is possible that India may lose its spot as the fastest growing major economy to China in the January-March quarter as a chill in domestic and global consumer demand hit manufacturers and service providers. 

A Reuters survey of economists forecast growth slipped to 6.3 per cent annually in the three months ending in March, its slowest pace in six quarters.


Expert Take: 

The ambiguity of portfolio allocation is now removed, so this is good for the market. We will get to see new finance minister’s proposals and approach in the Budget due in about a month. The emergence of clarity is what was important, and now narrative in markets will be about the economic policies that will be adopted to revive and stimulate the slowing economy- Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Sr. VP and Head of Research (Wealth), Centrum Broking"

5,2019-06-03,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: In its current stage, the Indian market may be trading in the risky zone as the risk-reward equation has turned unfavourable, but Dalal Street has surely not run out of ideas. Some market veterans are seeking to make money by betting against the wind, popular as contra bets in market parlance.

Analysts said there are stocks and sectors that look risky today, but have ample scope for upsides, and if things go in favour of them in the foreseeable future, they can offer high returns.

The disclaimer, they say, is that one has to have the appetite for high risk.


Power
CLSA feels the bull market for India’s power sector has just started after a 10-year-long bear phase. Plant load factors (PLFs) for the sector bottomed out in FY17 as new capacity outpaced demand growth. Last financial year saw the revival of PLF, the first in a decade. CLSA sees PLF to rise structurally going ahead.

“As utilisation increases, efficiency increases for companies and they are provided extra incentives above the ROE of 15.5 per cent. Overall, the sector and profitability improve as utilisation goes up,” the brokerage said.

CLSA, which likes NTPC, said power distribution companies were previously making over $10 billion a year in losses post subsidies from the government. That is no longer the case. 

“The transformational change, UDAY, was moving $ 30 billion of debt off balance sheets of the distribution firms into state government hands and reducing interest rates on overall debt. Other changes to reduce losses and increase efficiency were also undertaken,” it said.


Real estate
Market shares of top 25 residential developers at a pan-India level have increased to 20 per cent from 12 per cent, indicating consolidation at a systemic level, as small-time developers are finding it very difficult to survive. 

While there has been a steady decline in supply, demand has been higher than supply for a couple of quarters – at a pan-India level and also in majority of micro-markets, PhillipCapital said in a note. As NBFC funding slows, PE players are seen stepping in and filling the gap. Over past three years. PE players have pumped in more than $ 23 billion into Indian real estate.

In the case of commercial realty, absorption is expected to continue on the back of large demand-supply gap, despite substantial new supply that is expected to hit the market, said Antique Stock Broking.

“IT/ITeS and BFSI companies will continue to be major occupiers of office space across markets. Office space demand from co-working and fintech segments is envisaged to continue and gain further momentum.” it said.


Automobile
Going by estimates, May passenger vehicle volumes might have fallen by a sharp 23 per cent, a those of two-wheelers and MHCVs by 8-9 per cent. But Axis Capital said it would still prefer to play the discretionary theme by being contra in auto stocks.

“We continue to believe H2FY19 marked the trough for volume and margin for the sector and we are at the fag-end of the earnings downgrade cycle. While the quantum of recovery in H1FY20 might not be substantial, anecdotally, stocks bottom out immediately after a trough. Of late, auto stocks are not reacting to poor numbers. We’d use this period to increase weightage on the sector,” it said. 

UBS said weakening of near-term purchase intentions and a decline in postponements indicate limited pent-up demand for cars in the near term, but the inventory remains under control. 

Going ahead, ease in liquidity situation for NBFCs will be eyed as 80-90 per cent of CV segment sales are financed. In the case of two-wheeler makers, it remains to be seen if the industry demand for a cut in GST rate to 18 per cent from 28 per cent is accepted. 

Meanwhile, a good monsoon-led higher crop outout and increased government focus on reviving the rural economy could boost two-wheeler volumes. Maruti and M&M have higher rural exposure, said Prabhudas Lilladher. Most analysts feel a rate cut is imminent in June policy meet of RBI, which if it materialises, should have a sentimental impact on potential car buyers.


PSU banks
India’s PSU banks are under- capitalisated. UBS estimates that they would need $30-35 billion to restart growth, with roughly half of it to just ensure capitalisation to meet regulatory needs.

But a few analysts are positive.

They believe the Bimal Jalan Committee on the Reserve Bank of India's capital framework is likely to estimate excess reserves at the central bank and recommend transfer of the same to the government. The excess fund is likely be used to capitalise state-run banks. Besides, they see high chances of a rate cut by RBI next week. Valuation-wise too, PSU stocks look attractive, they said. 

“The risk-reward opportunity in SBI is much better than HDFC Bank. Similarly, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank at the current levels look much better than Kotak Bank. Because if credit growth takes off, HDFC Bank will not be the only lender providing loans. PSU banks are also going to contribute to that. In fact, they are going to be a major contributor,” Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities, told ETNOW in an interview.

7,2019-06-03,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices settled at fresh all-time highs on Monday as investors shrugged off weakness in global peers, 5-year low domestic GDP print and unemployment at 45-year high.

Weak auto sales numbers too failed to stop benchmark indices from rallying. BSE's flagship index Sensex ended at 40,268, up 553 points or 1.39 per cent. The 30-pack Sensex scaled an intraday high of 40,309. 

Meanwhile NSE Nifty ended at a peak of 12,089, 166 points or 1.39 per cent higher. The index touch a high of 12,103 during the day. 


Rate cut hopes: The weak GDP print, poor auto sales and other high-frequency data raised hopes of a 25 basis points rate cut by the RBI’s monetary policy committee. Three-fourths of the 28 respondents in an ET poll, which included executives and economists from banks, mutual funds, rating agencies and NBFCs, suggested the same. 

“Liquidity woes in banking system are far from over. The silver lining in this is the expectation of government spending, which is likely to reduce the liquidity deficit in the system. Also, the currency in circulation which had shown sharp spikes due to elections, is also likely to gradually recede, impacting liquidity favourably. Given the global as also domestic scenario, the MPC may well choose to gratify the markets with a benchmark rate cut. What is more important for markets is the MPC guidance that the actual rate action,” said Lakshmi Iyer, Chief Investment Officer (Debt) & Head Products, Kotak Mahindra AMC.

Trump’s Iran move: Oil prices extended their recent slide on Monday after the Trump administration said it was ready to talk with Iran about its nuclear programme without any preconditions. Tracking the news, Brent crude futures tumbled 1.50 per cent to $61.06 a barrel. In India, crude oil contracts for June traded lower by Rs 86, or 2.28 per cent, at Rs 3,689 per barrel with a business volume of 21,363 lots on the MCX.

Technically, Brent oil may fall more to a range of $58.17-$59.78, as suggested by its wave pattern and a projection analysis, Reuters reported.


Rupee rebound, hopes of FPI flows: A sharp fall in crude oil prices lifted the rupee by 40 paise to 69.29. A strengthening rupee against the dollar boosts dollar returns for foreign investors. Hence, a sharp rise in exchange rate raises hopes of incremental foreign inflows. Data suggests FII into Indian equities eased to Rs 7,919 crore in May from Rs 21,193 crore in April and Rs 33,980 crore in March.


Government stimulus, Budget: With the economy in a mess, hopes are that the government would step up and announce a slew of measures to revive consumption. Signs are already visible.

The Modi government in its first Cabinet meeting last week had approved a proposal to extend the benefit of Rs 6,000 per year under the PM-KISAN scheme to 14.5 crore farmers in the country.

The Cabinet also approved Pradhan Mantri Kisan Pension Yojana under which small and marginal farmers will get a minimum fixed pension of Rs 3,000 per month on attaining the age of 60 years. 

Besides, the Cabinet approved a new scheme that assures a minimum monthly pension of Rs 3,000 to all shopkeepers, retail traders and self-employed persons after attaining the age of 60 years.

2,2019-06-03,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Despite weak global cues, domestic benchmark indices got off to a positive start on Monday as ease in crude oil prices globally further boosted hopes of a policy rate cut by the RBI in its policy review later this week. 

The upside in the market though remained capped as macro data including a 5-year low GDP and weak auto sales numbers suggested that the domestic economy might not be immune to the global slowdown.

Analysts said one must execute trades with caution. Based on their recommendations, below are 11 stocks that look poised to give solid returns in 2-3 weeks:


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in 

Bata India | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,397 | Stop loss: Rs 1,306 
The stock appears to be stabilising after the recent correction. It has closed in the black for three consecutive sessions now. The price action has been flat around Rs 1,320, hinting at accumulation around the level. If the scrip sustains above the recent low of Rs 1,307, the counter may ideally head towards its interim top placed around Rs 1,400.


HCL Technologies | Buy | Target price: 1,150 | Stop loss: Rs 1,049 
After the recent correction from the highs of Rs 1,187, this counter appears to be positioning itself for a resumption. The scrip has made a Rounding Bottom-like formation on the lower time-frame charts, with a stable move around Rs 1,050. ""Positional traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further at lower levels around Rs 1,060 on dips. The can look for an initial target of Rs 1,150 with stop loss placed below Rs 1,049,"" said Mohammad.


Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher

Godrej Consumer Products | Buy | Target price: Rs 735 | Stop loss: Rs 650
The stock formed a bullish candle pattern on the daily. It breached its 50-day moving average to give a breakout above Rs 680. It was proving as a key resistance level during the consolidation phase. The scrip has potential to rise further in the coming days. The RSI also has indicated a trend reversal and has signaled a buy. ""With good volume participation, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 735. One may keep a stop loss at Rs 650,"" said Parekh.


Havells India | Buy | Target price: Rs 810 | Stop loss: Rs 710
The stock has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily chart at around Rs 710. It formed a positive candle, signaling positive bias. The scrip looks attractive.

Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking

Kansai Nerolac Paints | Buy | Target price: Rs 504 | Stop loss: Rs 438
The recent sharp fall in crude oil prices has been a boon for paint stocks. The scrip too has been buzzing for some time now. Technically, the scrip looks poised for a further leg of strong up move. The stock has broken above its supply zone of long-term trend line, which acted as resistance for more than five times during the last one year. A breakout has been witnessed along with a rise in volumes and positive placement of oscillators. ""We recommend buying this stock at the prevailing levels for a target of Rs 504 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 438,"" said Bhosale.


Godrej Consumer Products | Buy | Target price: Rs 760 | Stop loss: Rs 648

In addition, prices have closed above 50 and 89 EMA (moving averages) which indicate that the short to the medium-term trend has turned positive.

1,2019-06-03,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Massive fall in crude oil prices sent domestic benchmark indices half a percent higher on Monday. Mounting trade tensions and a slowdown in Indian economy to a five-year low could not roil investor spirits.

The domestic currency too logged significant gains, appreciating as much as 23 paise to 69.73, amid a fall in crude prices and buying by foreign institutional investors.

Oil prices fell more than 1 per cent, extending losses of over 3 per cent from Friday, as trade wars fanned fears of a global economic slowdown. Brent crude futures were at $61.16, down 83 cents, or 1.3 per cent, below Friday's close.

India’s economy grew slower than expected to a 20-quarter low in the January-March period, dragging overall growth to a five-year low in FY19.

15,2019-06-04,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Sensex and Nifty took a breather on Tuesday after scaling record high levels in the previous session as investors took profits off the table ahead of a market holiday. When markets open on Thursday, market participants will keep an eye on the RBI policy decision.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the second bimonthly policy review of this financial year.

Stocks, bonds, currency and commodities markets will remain closed on Wednesday on account of Eid al-Fitr.

For the day, BSE barometer Sensex fell 184 points or 0.46 per cent to 40,084. Its NSE counterpart Nifty settled at 12,022, down 67 points or 0.55 per cent. 

Technology stocks came forth as the biggest drags.


Markets at a glance:
In the Sensex kitty of stocks, 13 ended in the green and 17 in the red. Hero MotoCorp, HCL Technologies, TCS, Asian Paints, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Auto were among the top drags.

YES Bank, NTPC, Vedanta, Axis Bank and Coal India were among the main leaders.

The minnows too succumbed to profit taking, but still fared better than benchmark Sensex. BSE Midcap ended 0.22 per cent lower and BSE Smallcap 0.19 per cent.

Sectorally, teck and IT were the worst hit, shedding over 1.50 per cent each. Only six of 19 sectors on BSE ended in the green. Capital Goods index was the top gainer, followed by telecom but the gains were less than 1 per cent.


Factors that weighed on the market:


Global tensions persistStock markets remained under pressure on Tuesday as worries about a clampdown on the world's internet and social media giants compounded mounting global trade and recession jitters. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended down 0.3 per cent. China's blue-chip CSI300 dropped 0.9 per cent and the Hang Seng lost 0.66 per cent in Hong Kong.


Tech stocks under pressureTech stocks were the worst performers all across the globe and India was no exception. 

Not only did IT and teck were the worst losers on BSE sectoral space, but top IT stocks like TCS and Infosys dragged the benchmark indices lower. Reports the US government was gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google misused their market power, sent tech stocks falling across the globe.


Expert Take:
Intensified trade tensions and prediction of further delay of the onset of monsoon pushed investors to book profit. However, expectation of further cut in interest rate by RBI, falling oil prices and higher spending will improve earnings outlook. The sentiment remain buoyant despite premium valuation since FIIs are pumping liquidity to India as a chosen long-term equity in the emerging market in this ongoing uncertainty in the global market.- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesTrade remained choppy and market closed at intraday low level with the loss of 0.5% as investors booked profits across the counters.

8,2019-06-04,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: India’s benchmark indices surged to record highs and the rupee gained as a March quarter slowdown boosted expectations that the Reserve Bank of India could cut interest rates and ease its policy stance this week. The Sensex closed above 40,000 and Nifty above 12,000 for the first time on Monday.

The benchmark bond yield slid to an 18-month low as a slowing economy and falling oil prices sparked speculation that the central bank will cut rates more than once. Data released on Friday showed that India's economy grew at 5.8 per cent in the January-March period, its slowest pace in five years. The rupee ended at 69.26 against the US dollar on Monday while the Indian currency closed at 69.70 on Friday. The Sensex jumped 553.42 points, or 1.4 per cent, to close at 40,267.62 after scaling an all-time intraday peak of 40,308.9 during the session. The Nifty too touched an all-time high of 12,103.05 points before ending 165.75 points, or 1.4 per cent up, at 12,088.55. India VIX, the volatility gauge, slipped 0.85 per cent to 15.93. Twowheeler makers Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto led market advances on rate cut hopes, gaining 6 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively. IndusInd Bank, Asian Paints and Hindustan Unilever were the other top gainers. “The GDP data shows growth has moderated from the consumption and investment side,” said Nitin Bhasin, head of research, institutional equities at Ambit Capital. “The government will try to push for a rate cut first before coming up with stimulus measures.”

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth Rs 3,068.9 crore on Monday.



Impact on rate sensitive stocks

Their domestic peers sold stocks worth Rs 462.7 crore.

All sector indices barring the media index ended in the green.

Rate sensitives were among the top gainers, with the Bank Nifty gaining 0.9 per cent and the Nifty Auto index surging 1.9 per cent.

The Indian stock market bucked the trend elsewhere in Asia, which ended mixed amid rising concerns over US-China trade tensions.

Bhasin said a rate cut may not have significant impact on rate-sensitive stocks.

“It is difficult to say if a 25 bps cut or a 50 bps cut will boost auto demand significantly. Rate sensitives are unlikely to see a massive impact in the near term from a rate cut,” he said. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

The second bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2019-20 will be announced on Thursday and the consensus is pointing toward a 25 bps cut in the repo rate, according to an ET poll.

“Because the GDP number was lower than expected, the hope is that it will decisively push the RBI for a rate cut,” said Mahindra Group chief economist Sachchidanand Shukla. “Earlier, the expectation was that the RBI may wait for the budget numbers and monsoon distribution trends before cutting rates.”

Shukla is expecting the RBI to cut the repo rate by 25 bps on Thursday.

Besides the rate cut hopes, the market sentiment has continued to remain buoyant after the landslide election verdict in favour of the Narendra Modi-led coalition on May 23 over reform hopes.

Kotak Institutional Equities said the government has limited scope for a fiscal stimulus given India’s grim fiscal position.

“We expect further stimulus for housing at best,” the brokerage said. Kotak Institutional Equities believes that the RBI may cut policy rates by 50 bps in the second half of the calendar year but its efficacy may be limited without improvement in liquidity.

The brokerage said the risk-reward balance in the market is quite unfavourable given the rich valuations for quality stocks, downside risk to earnings and somewhat weak macroeconomic situation.

Indian benchmarks have gained 12 per cent since March, which is when the market rally began after a sluggish performance in the first two months of the year.

The rally was triggered by heightened expectations of the BJP government returning to power after its response to the Pulwama terror attack.

Despite setbacks in the form of US-China trade tensions and higher crude oil prices, India is the top performer behind China in terms of performance this year within the Asian markets.

The Nifty has gained 12 per cent in dollar terms so far in 2019 while China's Shanghai Composite has gained 15.4 per cent, according to data compiled by ETIG Database."

16,2019-06-04,Asian Paints,"MUMBAI: In an industry where brand visibility has a large impact on sales, Pune-based Indigo Paints spent close to 10% of its revenue last fiscal on television commercials to make a mark for itself in the highly competitive Indian decorative paints industry. 

Established in 2000, Indigo Paints is a relatively new entrant to the decorative paints industry that is dominated by the like of Asian Paints, Berger and Nerolac. With little to distinguish one product from another, the industry has a high barrier for new entrants in terms of brand recognition.

To overcome that, the Pune-based paint maker is adopting aggressive advertising. It spent close to Rs 60 crore in FY19 on its television ad campaigns, according to Hemant Jalan, founder and managing director of Indigo Paints. The company’s revenue for the fiscal was Rs 595 crore.

“It has done wonders for us,” Jalan told ET, explaining how the better brand recognition has helped the company increase its customer touch-points. The company has roped in cricketer and ex-Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni as its brand ambassador.

Jalan said that his company’s compounded growth rate for the past 10 years has been in excess of 40%, and he doesn’t expect that to change for the coming four to five years as the company increases its geographic reach across the country and improves penetration in the states where it has only recently entered.

“The industry itself is growing at 10%-12% year-on-year and there is enough room for all manufacturers to grow,” he said.

The company is planning to go public in the latter half of FY21 to raise capital for expansion and give initial investor Sequoia Capital an opportunity to make an exit. Sequoia holds about 38% equity in Indigo Paints.

In the ongoing fiscal, the company has planned an expenditure of Rs 75 crore on advertisements while the projected revenue is at Rs 800 crore.

For perspective, the revenue for market leader Asian Paints in FY19 was Rs 16,400 crore, according to regulatory filings. And that of Nerolac was Rs 5,400 crore."
9,2019-06-04,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: As the Nifty50 rules at all-time high, market breadth remains tepid, raising questions over the sustainability of the recent bounce.

More and more midcap and smallcap stocks are signalling bearish trends than the ones sending out bullish signals, suggests MACD, or moving average convergence divergence.

The momentum indicator signalled a bearish crossover – a sign of bearish undertone – on 46 counters, hinting at possible downsides.

These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included many midcap and smallcap names, including Aurobindo Pharma, NCC, Reliance Infrastructure, UltraTech Cement, Repco Home Finance, Opto Circuits India, Sintex Plastics, SRF and Kwality. 

Mastek, Ujaas Energy, IPCA Labs, Parag Milk Foods, Man Industries, Simplex Infra, Minda Industries, Aarti Drugs and Gallant Ispat are a few other companies on the list.









The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 10 stocks are showing bullish trends on NSE. The list included Havells India, Ajanta Pharma, Orient Refectories, Hatsun Agro and recently listed Chalet Hotels. 



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, analysts maintain a positive stance, but believe weak market breadth could be a worry. Besides, some momentum oscillators suggest the stocks have become oversold.

“The current chart pattern signals the possibility of a breakout of a recent upward range movement. But the overall market breadth was not impressive on Monday, with midcaps and smallcaps rising only marginally. The next upside range to watch out for is at 12,150-12,180,” said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. 

Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking expects ‘gravity defying’ moves in coming days despite some of the momentum oscillators being in the overbought territories.

The RS Line, when compared against the broader markets, has changed its territory and has penetrated its 20-DMA. RSI too is seen breaking out of a formation. RSI is bullish as it has marked a fresh 14-period high. Any move below 620 will be negative for the stock.NextCochin Shipyard | Buy | Target: Rs 4201 Jun, 2019Some fresh signs of a possible up move appear on this stock. After a prolonged multi-month downtrend, the stock has attempted for form, and subsequently confirm a reversal. The daily MACD is in continuing buy mode. While the price is consolidating, the OBV – On Balance Volume has given a fresh high, which is a bullish sign. The price has ended above its 200-DMA. The stock has also ended above the upper Bollinger band, and this further increases the possibility of a breakout and prices moving higher. Any move below 365 will be negative for the stock.Next Asian Paints | Buy | Target: Rs 1,4751 Jun, 2019After a recent underperformance, the stock has taken support at a multi-month trend line support in the 1295-1310 zone. After pulling back from these levels and after some brief consolidation, the stock is likely to resume its up move. The daily MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high and also shows bullish divergence against the price. A new buy signal has emerged on the weekly Stochastic. The drastic fall in the Crude price recently is likely to aid the possible up move of this otherwise technically stable stock. Any move below 1275 will be negative for the stock.Next HCL Tech | Buy | Target: Rs 1,1401 Jun, 2019The stock saw some corrective moves over the past several weeks while the IT pack under-performed the broader markets. The stock has found support at the confluence area of the two trend lines in the 1050-1065 zone. The daily MACD has shown a positive crossover, and it is now bullish while trading above its signal line. The RSI is in neutral not showing any divergence against the price. On the weekly chart, the price remains in a firm uptrend and the OBV – On Balance Volume has marked a fresh high. A price target of 1140 can be expected. Any move below 1065 will be negative for the stock.Next
“Mind you, we may not see immediate declines in the market amid such strong trends. Hence, it’s better not to be sceptical about the recent upward move and keep participating in this rally by following a stock-centric approach,” he said.

24,2019-06-06,Asian Paints,"The BSE benchmark Sensex plunged 554 points Thursday, dragged down by losses in banking, energy and capital goods stocks even as the RBI cut the policy rate to shore up growth. Slashing benchmark lending rate for the third time this year, the central bank cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent and changed its monetary policy stance from 'neutral' to 'accommodative'. 

 The RBI, however, lowered the economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7 per cent due to slowdown in domestic activities and escalation in global trade war. 

 Following the announcement, the 30-share index cracked 553.82 points, or 1.38 per cent, to settle at 39,529.72. The bourse hit an intra-day low of 39,481.15 and a high of 40,159.26.

 Top losers in the Sensex pack included IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, SBI, L&T, Tata Steel, M&M, Bajaj Finance, Vedanta, Tata Motors and RIL, tumbling up to 6.97 per cent. 

 Bucking the negative market trend, Coal India, PowerGrid, NTPC, HUL, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints and Infosys gained up to 1.92 per cent. 

 ""The rate cut could not infuse positivity, and the decline steepened as focus shifted from policy rates to new emerging short-term tight liquidity situation due to issues like IL&FS, DHFL and its impending impact on other financial institutions if any,"" said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) - AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. 

 Lowered GDP forecast for current year and failure to get any cue from RBI on the liquidity front except general assurance of addressing the situation added to the selling pressure later in the day, he added. 

 The Indian rupee fell marginally to 69.28 against the US dollar. 

 Meanwhile, other Asian bourses ended on a mixed note, while Europe was trading in the green in opening deals.

25,2019-06-06,Asian Paints,"JM Financial has given a buy recommendation on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,475.

Shares of Asian Paints closed at Rs 1,427.80. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.

While the company's business did witness headwinds on input-costs during the year (crude price inflation, some mix-deterioration) plus increase in costs-base on account of the commissioning of two large greenfield facilities, it still managed to sustain its ROCE and ROE in FY19 at 21.3 per cent (post-tax) and 24.1 per cent against 21.6 per cent and 24.6 per cent in FY18, said the brokerage. 

Reported ROIC, though, is down to 27.5 per cent in FY19 against 30.1 per cent in FY18 but excluding gestating assets, the same reflects a 130bps YoY improvement to 37.2 per cent in FY19.

""Asian Paints has traditionally been extremely efficient in managing its SG&A spends, in our view – overheads had grown at sub-3 per cent CAGR on per-unit-of-paints basis over FY05-12, and fell over FY15-18,"" said the brokerage. 

The period of FY12-15, however,see sharp SG&A growth post the commissioning of the Khandala plant that upped the then existing capacity base by c.50 per cent. 

Though FY19 did see similar magnitude of increase in installed capacities (up from 1.1mn KL p.a. to 1.7mn KL post Mysuru, Vizag), the growth in SG&A per unit of paints sold was still well-controlled at just about 2 per cent YoY; excluding A&P spends (which grew 20 per cent in FY19), overheads growth was even more muted at 0.8 per cent on a per-unit basis.

""We continue to see Asian Paints as a compelling LT investment theme that quite justifies the premium that it commands,"" said the brokerage."

19,2019-06-06,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets started on a cautious note on Thursday, with benchmark index Nifty slipping below the 12,000-mark ahead of RBI monetary policy outcome. The sentiment soured on the back of weak global cues.

Bank and financial stocks were the major index drags.

Global markets were weak as Asian shares got off to a hesitant start on Thursday as investors feared a looming US trade war with Mexico would further depress global growth. Japan's Nikkei dithered either side of flat, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 eased 0.1 per cent. 

The rupee too opened on a weak note. It depreciated by 13 paise to 69.38 against the US dollar.

Oil prices were at over 4-month low on rising US supply and demand fears and failed to lift Street mood.

At around 9:30 am, the 30-pack Sensex traded 28 points or 0.07 per cent down at 40,055. NSE Nifty lost 25 points or 0.21 per cent to 11,997.

In the sectoral space, barring consumer durables and power all sectors were in the red. BSE Utilities was the biggest loser, down 1.26 per cent.

Meanwhile, analysts said RBI is all set to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points. “The MPC in its last meeting has stated that the price stability has been achieved and has shifted focus to growth. With inflation continuing to provide room and output gap opening up further, there is a compelling case for rate cut,” Edelweiss said in a note."

BOARD MEETINGS
 

ANALYST CALLS• Anand Rathi has retained its buy recommendation on Heidelberg Cement with a higher target of ₹263.

28,2019-06-12,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities opened in the negative territory on Wednesday, in the light of weak Asian cues due to lingering trade war between the US and China.

Asian share markets were subdued as the US President Donald Trump reaffirmed his stricter views on trade talks with China.

Trump on Tuesday defended the use of tariffs as part of his trade strategy while China vowed a tough response if the United States insists on escalating trade tensions amid ongoing negotiations, Reuters reported.

Moreover, Trump has again criticised India's high import tariff on the iconic Harley Davidson motorcycles as unacceptable. 

Market participants now await April industrial growth prints and May retail inflation numbers, slated for release later today, to get directional cues.

Shares of Yes Bank tumbled over 5 per cent in early trade after UBS slashed the target price to Rs 90 (Rs 170 earlier) while maintaining a ‘Sell’ rating.

UBS also downgraded IndusInd Bank to ‘Sell’ from ‘Neutral’ with a target price of Rs 1400 (from Rs 1700 earlier.) The scrip was hovering at Rs 1,511 at around 9.23 am (IST).

Stewart & Mackertich said, ""On the hourly chart; rising RSI continues facing resistance around downward trend line, which implies the benchmark index moving higher above 12,000 is unlikely at this juncture. ADX is still laggard.""

Retail inflation spiked to a seven-month high of 3.05 per cent in May, though still within RBI’s comfort level, providing room for further interest rate cut to boost industrial output which expanded by 3.4 per cent in first month of the current fiscal.

According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) data, the jump in the retail inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) was mainly due to rise in prices of kitchen items like vegetables, meat and fish.

Asian markets were trading lower as the Hong Kong market fell for second consecutive session following a day of massive street protests, while oil prices flirted with five-month lows due to higher US crude inventories and a bleak demand outlook.

34,2019-06-14,Asian Paints,"High flown theories of finance & investing don’t work in India. What works in the Indian stock market is risk minimisation. We minimise risks associated with accounting fraud, with topline and bottomline volatility and with liquidity. In other words, we invest in clean monopolies selling essential products.


Sophisticated investment literature can be damaging for your wealth
There are many delusional theories in finance. One of these is the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH), which contends that since stock prices efficiently discount all the information available in the market, it is impossible to beat the market.

Another is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which claims that returns from a stock will be directly proportional to the systematic risk (or beta) represented by the stock.

Whilst Warren Buffett’s rubbishing of the EMH is well-known, thanks to the pseudo-science peddled by business schools, CAPM is still taught in classrooms across the world, including in India, a country where CAPM is even less applicable than it is in America.


Agencies
CAPM says returns are proportional to risk, it follows therefore that the only way you can generate higher returns in the market is by taking more risk. Basis this elegant theory, wealth managers lead their clients down the garden path towards high-risk products while selling the delusion that higher risk will lead to higher returns.


Crushing risk is the key to generating higher returnsOur decade of working and investing in India has led us to conclude that you need to minimise four types of risks if you want to generate steady and healthy investment returns in the Indian stock market:


1. Accounting risk: Whilst we all now know how prominent public and private sector banks in India fudged their NPA figures for years on end until RBI’s asset quality review forced them to come clean, the same problem exists with several housing finance companies (who don’t come under RBI’s purview).

The accounts of a leading cement manufacturer don’t stack up. Neither does the annual report of high flying retailer make sense. Ditto with a prominent petchem company and a prominent pharma company. In fact, the majority of the companies in the BSE500 have annual reports, which don’t pass scrutiny. Using 10 forensic accounting ratios and a financial model that contains time series data on 1,300 of India’s largest listed companies, we seek to identify that 20 per cent of the Indian stock market whose books are actually believable.


2. Topline risk: At $2000, India’s per capita income is still very low (less than half of Sri Lanka and a quarter of the level of Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Malaysia). As a result, beyond the basic essentials of life – FMCG products, pharma products, basic apparel – most other products are luxury items for most Indians. As a result, even for small cars or entry-level two-wheelers, demand in India fluctuates wildly. For instance, Maruti Suzuki typically experiences 5-6 years of strong demand growth (growth well above 15 per cent per annum) followed by 3-4 years of famine (growth well below 5 per cent per annum).

Whilst its cross-cycle average growth tends to be around 12 per cent, the stock price volatility reflects the swings in Maruti’s topline growth. In contrast, a company selling essential products like Asian Paints or Marico tends to see steady

revenue growth – between 10-20 per cent per annum – pretty much every year. Investing in companies selling essential products in India therefore reduces risk.


3. Bottomline risk: As the cost of capital is still pretty high for India, it is rare to find Indian companies which spend heavily on genuine R&D. Understandably, therefore, the Indian economy is characterised by rapid imitation – one company spots a niche (say, gold loan finance) and within a decade it has a 100 imitators. This rapid new entry squeezes profitability of the first mover and thus creates risk for its shareholders. In order to reduce such risk we look for sectors where over extended periods of time, one or two companies cumulatively account for 80 per cent of the sector’s profit pie. Such monopolies have lower volatility in their profit margin.


4. Liquidity risk: India is the least liquid of the world’s top ten stock markets, largely because promoters own more than half of the shares outstanding in the Indian market. As a result of this, beyond the top 30 or so stocks in India, liquidity – measured by average daily traded volume (ADV) – drops rapidly. By the time you are in the lower reaches of the BSE100, ADV is well below $5m per day. Such low liquidity creates stock price gyrations as investors go through their cycles of election-induced euphoria followed by accounting fraud-induced panic. Tilting the portfolio towards liquid stocks reduces this risk.


Investment implicationsOver the past decade another corollary of CAPM – smart beta - has become fashionable. Smart beta practitioners (no pun intended) believe there are various types of systematic risk embedded in stock prices, for example, size (i.e. smallcaps should outperform largecaps), value (i.e. cheaper stocks should outperform more expensive stocks), momentum (i.e. stocks which are doing well should continue doing well), etc.

Basically, what smart beta practitioners say is that investors who take any of the four risks outlined in the preceding section should be rewarded by the market for taking that extra risk. That line of thinking does not work in India.

In my book 
Coffee Can Investing: the Low Risk Route to Stupendous Wealth (2018), I have shown that identifying stocks with low accounting risk, low topline risk and low bottomline risk using a simple quantitative filter (revenue growth should be in double digits and ROCE should be above 15% every year for ten consecutive years) consistently generates returns in the vicinity of 20 per cent per annum with share price volatility half that of Nifty. Even without adjusting for risk (volatility), you are far better off investing in this portfolio rather than in Nifty. In fact, you are far better off investing in this portfolio – akin to our consistent compounder portfolio (CCP) – relative to almost every other asset class in India (including real estate, private equity and government bonds) – see chart above.

You do NOT have to take extra risk in India (or load up on beta) to get healthy returns.

Why does this simple filter-based approach to creating a CCP work so consistently? Because the CCP basically seeks to minimise the four risks outlined in the preceding section. If a company is able to grow revenues in double digits every year for 10 consecutive years, it is almost certainly selling an essential product, which will be in demand in both economic booms and busts. Secondly, if a company is able to generate RoCE above 15 per cent every year for 10 consecutive years, it is highly likely to be a dominant/moated franchise. (The vast majority of Nifty companies have not generated an RoCE of 15 per cent even once in the past 10 years.)

Less than 15 companies make it through the two filters described above. And because we are seeking to minimise risk rather than chase returns, the occasional period of underperformance does not cause us to lose sleep. We are happy crushing risk rather than chasing the ephemeral fantasies of high returns.

35,2019-06-17,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Led by losses in financials and index heavyweight RIL, domestic benchmark indices started Monday's session on a weak note. Macro headwinds, in the form of elevated crude oil prices, persisted and escalating stress around India-US trade relations remained an overhang.

The domestic currency slid over 5 paise in early trade to 69.85 against the US dollar on account of some buying in American currency by banks and importers and amid rising crude prices.

Global markets traded mildly higher. Investors remained cautious ahead of a closely-watched Federal Reserve meeting.

At around 9:30 am, the 30-pack Sensex traded 131 points or 0.33 per cent lower at 39,321. Nifty moved below the 11,800 mark and was at 11,781, down 42 points or 0.35 per cent at around the same time.

In the 50-pack index, 14 stocks advanced, 36 declined while one remained unchanged.

In the Sensex pack, only seven stocks gained while 23 dropped.

Vedanta shed the most, down 2.21 per cent, amid reports that it lost about $200 million in profits ever since its copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu was shut more than a year back after police fired on protesters and killed 13 people. 

Other losers were -- Tata Steel, Reliance, Coal India, Tata Motors and IndusInd Bank.

Bharti Airtel was the biggest gainer, up 0.28 per cent. ONGC. Asian Paints, Power grid, HDFC Bank and L&T were among other gainers.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap followed benchmark Sensex and were down 0.47 per cent and 0.32 per cent respectively.

Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 238.64 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 376.47 crore, data suggests."
39,2019-06-18,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The BSE benchmark Sensex rebounded in Tuesday's session following gains in financials and IT stocks. The 30-pack index snapped four-day losing streak to end 86 points or 0.22 per cent higher at 39,046. 

Meanwhile, its NSE counterpart Nifty ended the session tad below the 11,700 mark. The flagship index shut shop at 11,692, up 19 points or 0.17 per cent. 

The market remained volatile as investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of the US Federal Reserve's meeting that begins later today. Softening crude oil prices and rising rupee turned out to be positive triggers, but concerns regarding economic growth remained an overhang.

The advance-decline ratio stood at 3:5, indicating underlying bearishness in the market. 


Market at a glance:
In the Sensex pack, Vedanta followed by Coal India, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, HCL Tech and Bajaj Finance followed the gainer pack, rising between 2.47 per cent and 1.43 per cent. 

YES Bank, on the other hand, was the worst performing stock. The scrip ended 5.94 per cent lower. Maruti, Asian Paints, Sun Pharma and HDFC were among other losers.

In the sectoral space, oil & gas, IT and teck were the leaders whereas healthcare and auto were the worst laggards.

The BSE Midcap index rose marginally by 0.08 per cent while the BSE Smallcap index ended 0.42 per cent lower. 

Shares of Jet Airways nosedived 40.74 per cent to end at Rs 40.45 after lenders to the airline decided to take it to bankruptcy courts. 


Factors

Fed meetThe Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged in its policy meeting, even as President Donald Trump pressed fresh demands for a rate cut. However, there are hopes that the FOMC would adopt a more dovish stance.


Oil softensOil prices fell for a second day on signs that global economic growth is being hit by the US-China trade war, though losses were capped by Middle East tensions after last week's tanker attacks. Brent crude futures were trading 42 cents down at $60.52 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 26 cents to $51.67.


Rupee gainsThe rupee snapped its three-day losing streak after the domestic currency recovered close to 20 paise against the greenback amid selling in American currency by banks and exporters and softening crude prices.


Expert Take
Market ended positive supported by easing in oil prices due to concern over global growth, trade wars and uncertainties in upcoming Opec meeting. There was a hope that the weakening domestic market will be supported by fiscal and monetary measures. This hope is being tested today given continuous weak economic and monsoon data.

36,2019-06-18,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets moved higher on Tuesday, after falling over a percent in the previous session, amid hopes that the US central bank would adopt a more dovish stance and may slash borrowing costs. However, the gains remained capped amid economic worries back home.

There has been increasing talk that the Fed will cut borrowing costs for the first time in more than a decade, though the expectation is for a move later on. The shift to a more dovish tone from the bank has been a key support for global markets in the face of the trade uncertainty.

Fitch cut India's growth forecast for the current fiscal for a second time in a row to 6.6 per cent as manufacturing and agriculture sectors showed signs of slowing down over the past year which kept investors cautious.

Globally, major Asian markets were trading with tepid gains with all eyes on FOMC meet outcome. The Fed begins a two-day meeting later today which will conclude on Wednesday.

The rupee on Tuesday, after falling for the three-straight session, opened 8 paise higher at 69.83 against the US dollar on account of some selling in American currency by banks and exporters. 

“Expectation is that the central bank could remain dovish and any hints towards rate cut by the Fed could put the greenback under pressure. Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 69.40 and 70.05-70.20,” brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. 



At around 9:30 am, the 30-pack Sensex traded 143.80 points or 0.37 per cent higher at 39,104.

Nifty surged 39.65 points or 0.34 per cent to 11,712 with 14 constituents in the black and 36 in the red. One stock remained unchanged.

Among Sensex stocks, IndusInd Bank was the biggest gainer, up 1.77 per cent. Vedanta, Power Grid, Kotak Bank, Infosys and HCL Tech were among other gainers, rising upto one percent.

Yes Bank dropped the most, down 1.55 per cent. Other losers were -- HUL, SBIN, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel and ONGC.

On the sectoral front, it was a mixed bag with power as the top gainer, up 0.44 per cent, and FMCG the worst laggard, down 0.63 per cent.

Meanwhile, India Inc’s advance tax figures grew 171 per cent during the first quarter of 2019-20, prompting the tax authorities to say that the economy may be back on track after witnessing lacklustre growth in earlier quarters. In overall direct tax collection, Mumbai has registered 133% growth, collecting Rs 17,174 crore of advance taxes against Rs 7,356 crore in the same period last year, according to the data compiled by the tax department."
40,2019-06-20,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices got off to a quiet start Thursday morning but soon recovered losses as the US Fed's rate cut signal sent a dollar and the US bond yields falling and equities bounced globally. 

A gauge of global stock markets edged near this year's peak. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent while Japan's Nikkei gained 0.5 per cent. 

However, an over 1 per cent rise in crude oil prices remained a concern. Brent crude futures rose 82 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $62.64 as official data showed US crude stocks fell more than expected and as OPEC and other producers finally agreed a date for a meeting to discuss output cuts.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 97 crore worth of domestic stocks on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs sold stocks worth Rs 105 crore.

At around 9:40, the BSE Sensex was up 50 points or 0.15 per cent higher at 39,170. Meanwhile, NSE Nifty was at 11,703, up 12 points or 0.10 per cent at around the same time. 



The expiry of weekly options could infuse volatility in today's trade. The options data show an unclear picture as highest Put open interest was at the 11,700 strike while Nifty ended on Wednesday a few points below it, said Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services.

Analyst calls

 • Emkay Global has upgraded Divi’s Laboratories to buy from hold and revised target target price to ₹1,756 from ₹1,540. The brokerage said Divi’s has historically been very tight on its capex policy, spending only when it has clear visibility on the order inflows. 

 • Kotak Securities has maintained a reduce rating on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone with fair value of ₹398. Kotak said that the decline in Adani Ports’ share pledges since September 2018 is possibly driven by the cash flows realised by the promoter through stake sales. Potential deal with Total (Adani Gas) and buyback are steps in the right direction if such payouts are used to reduce group leverage, said Kotak Securities. 

• Nomura has maintained a buy rating on Fortis Healthcare and cut target price to ₹159 from ₹171. FY19 was challenging for Fortis, with uncertainties surrounding ownership and tight liquidity conditions, said the brokerage. Fortis Healthcare's hospital business recorded an EBITDA decline of 33% in FY19, said Nomura.Thursday.

 • Anand Rathi has maintained a hold rating on Techno Electric and Engineering with a target price of ₹253. The management has guided to ₹15 billion revenue in FY20 but the brokerage said it is conservative on the pace of execution. The company should attain a 18% CAGR over FY19-21, said Anand Rathi. Its constrained order book may to lead to modest sales and earnings growth in FY20, the brokerage said. 

 • CLSA has retained sell rating on Asian Paints with a target price of ₹1,285. Asian Paints’ FY19 free cash flow rose by 60% year-on-year, well ahead of earnings growth as peak capex is behind, said CLSA. Commentary is a bit cautious on FY20, although management has always been conservative – macro factors, tapering growth, and volatile crude are worries, said CLSA."
42,2019-06-21,Asian Paints,"IIFL has given a 'reduce' recommendation on Kansai Nerolac Paints (KNPL) with a target price of Rs 425.

Shares of Kansai Nerolac Paints traded at Rs 450.1 around 12:20 pm on 21 June, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 

FY19 saw KNPL foray into application tools (brushes, rollers) under the Soldier brand and adhesives under the Nerofix brand (in UP). 

It also launched products across the decorative (Impressions Ultra HD, Gloria Wood coatings) and industrial segments (coatings to reduce energy and material consumption). 

Acquisitions aimed to strengthen position in powder coatings (Marpol) and construction chemicals (Perma), as well as to enter new geographies (RAK Paints). 

Weakness in industrial demand along with input cost inflation drove a sharp 320bps moderation in Ebitda margin to 13.9 per cent in FY19 against 100-300bps decline for peers. 

This was despite a 3 per cent cut in ad-spends (against 25 per cent growth for Asian Paints) and flattish rebate levels. 

Also, working capital intensity rose by 14-days of sales to 79days due to higher inventories. This resulted in RoE moderating 350bps to 13.8 per cent, levels last seen during the FY13/14 auto weakness. 

""KNPL is investing in improving customer experience, manufacturing operations, and sales agility, and remains bullish on medium-term growth,"" the brokerage said. 

However, if auto demand does not improve in the second half of FY20 (impacting KNPL’s ability to retain input cost reduction) and ad-spends see further cuts, we see risks to KNPL’s decorative sales and, in turn, to 16 per cent FY19-22ii EPS, the brokerage added."
43,2019-06-21,Asian Paints,"Saurabh Mukherjea, Dalal Street veteran and founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, says when India’s economic cycle is at the weakest point, it will be hard to defend the rupee at 70 level over the next 12 months. Well-run IT and pharma companies will be the biggest beneficiaries of that. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


ET Now: Since you have a rather optimistic tone to this conversation, I assume either you have started shopping or your shopping list is ready. How are you using the current poor or bad headlines to your advantage in the market? I mean we both know good news and good prices do not come together. News is bad, but prices are good now. How are you taking advantage of that?


Saurabh Mukherjea: Our investment philosophy has been relatively unchanged for a long period. We continue to look for outstanding franchises which we think are available at reasonable prices. I reckon the lending activity in our country will end up getting concentrated in the hands of three-four private sector banks, and two-three capable NBFCs. We have invested in four of these lenders. So something like HDFC Bank. Bajaj Finance is also a stock we have bought quite aggressively for our clients over the past five-six months. We think it is a well-run NBFC with a further assurance of a large, cash generating corporate like Bajaj behind it.

Secondly, we expect a more fairly-valued currency to create a better environment for top quality IT and pharma firms to make money. Pharma has now been the flavour of the season for a lot of people. So we have taken advantage of that to buy two good pharma companies in one of our client’s portfolios. In IT services, we have made sure that we have got something like TCS in our bag, as we go into what I think will potentially be a year to one-and-a-half years of currency devaluation. So we try to keep our temperament on an even keel. We neither get overjoyed by election results, nor did we get too flustered by the events in the NBFC sector.

If you keep doing then and keep buying high quality names, what my 11 years in India have shown me, it can get relatively steady compounding returns through booms and busts. Ours is quite a unique market and it is a privilege, therefore, to be able to live and work in this market.


ET Now: Outside of financials, how are you strategically looking at some of the other pockets -- you have spoken a little bit about the auto space and there is still a question mark about the recovery there. Can, perhaps IT and pharma, be tactical bets against the slowdown that we are seeing as we talk?


Saurabh Mukherjea: On one hand, we do want to stay invested and have in our portfolio companies with good governance, high quality balance sheets, strong cash flows. On the other hand, we have to take the economic cycle into account. When the economic cycle is at the weakest point, the currency would give way comprehensively and, in our reckoning, it will be hard to defend the rupee at 70 to the dollar over the next 12 months. Hence, a 76-77 level becomes more likely. Well-run IT and pharma companies will be the biggest beneficiaries of that. Keeping in mind quality governance, quality accounting, high cash flow and strong balance sheets, we have chosen to go and buy pharma and IT companies in our client portfolios.

The other area I am getting very interested in is high quality smallcaps. They have received an absolute pounding over the past 18 months or so. I do not think this year has been any better for them than last year. There are some small companies which are looking decidedly tasty in terms of quality of their franchises and the prices at which they are available. Doing some more work on this should take us another couple of months to finalise the strategy. But the smallcap space is beginning to look interesting and one of the things I have always felt is when people get most disappointed and most despondent is when you should be most aggressive as an investor looking for high quality names.

When they are most exuberant, like there were on a day like May 23, you need to be little careful. In smallcaps, the situation is looking very interesting.


ET Now: I must flag that aspect of the market which you always focus on: individual stock picking. In this market when you are talking about serious price distortions, does it make sense really stick to a HDFC or a Bajaj Finance or for that matter some of these quality names which are great franchises but they may not give you the bang for the buck, because they are fully priced, that is where bulk of the concentration is, that is where large amount of institutional money has already moved in?


Saurabh Mukherjea: You need to look at the underlying compounders of a stock. Forget prices for a minute. Look at the underlying earnings compounding, and make a call at what rate do you believe this company’s earnings compounding can chug away at. If the earnings compounding of a stock is steep, say a Bajaj Finance or a Asian Paints or a HDFC Bank, if the underlying rate of compounding is steep, whether I buy it relatively rich or relatively cheap, the slope for my compounding is still pretty good. Now, the challenge in India is that these sorts of companies with steep compounding are at the most 30 in number. The vast majority of companies in the market have a much more shallower compounding slope; instead of 25%, they have say a 10%. When you have a shallow compounder, whose underlying engine itself is pretty weak, if you buy it expensive, you might not get any return over 10 years. That is a trap a lot of our largecap funds fall into, because they are running these enormous sums of money and end up buying a lot of the shallow compounders. With that kind of money, you cannot buy 20-30 stocks, you end up buying hundreds of them and you end up ramming your portfolio full of such shallow compounders. That is the challenge for large funds face in our country. For them, valuations are all important. Buying the market at these valuations clearly is a major challenge. But the irony for them is that at rich valuations when they get most of their fund flows, fund management becomes a challenge. You get most of the flows when you least need it, and when you can choose least number of companies with good valuations."
46,2019-06-24,Asian Paints,"By Saurabh Mukherjea

In an insightful book written 40 years ago, French philosopher Rene Girard explains how in our desires, we are programmed to imitate each other. That, in turn, leads to conflict and grief, which in turn creates the need for scapegoats, who can act as a lightning rod for our grievances. Great leaders are those who can game this construct by using religion, culture and other people as scapegoats.

“…in order to succeed, one must take up an old problem, one not fashionable at the moment, and radically rethink it… there is nothing, or next to nothing, in human behaviour that is not learned, and all learning is based on imitation. If human beings suddenly ceased imitating, all forms of culture would vanish. Neurologists remind us frequently that the human brain is an enormous imitation machine.”

– Rene Girard in Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978)

Girard, an original thinker with powerful insights

In 1978, Girard published this remarkable book, which was written in the form of a dialogue between the philosopher, Girard, and two psychologists. It provides deep insights into how societies evolve, compete, fight and resolve conflict. Those insights, in turn, have implications for how we think about countries and companies.


Girard’s hypothesis unfolds sequentially:
1. Human beings have an innate desire to compete with each other and rise in the world. At the outset, this desire to compete and create new things, conquer new frontiers is a healthy thing as it spurs creativity, innovation and differentiation.

2. Then a complication kicks in because human beings, being social animals learn from each other and copy each other. As a result, we start coveting the same things as others. For example, in isolation I have no incentive to covet a diamond, which to my mind is a worthless stone. However, if 20 people around me begin coveting diamonds (or admission for their children into a certain school or flats on Altamont Road or holiday villas in Goa), then I too am likely to covet the same.

Girard calls this “mimesis” i.e. we mimic each other in our desires. Notice that it is almost certain that we will covet things which are scarce in supply; hence diamonds are more coveted than water (at least until water becomes scarce) even though water is far more useful for us that diamonds.

3. As hordes of people start seeking the same things, competition (or mimesis as Girard calls it) intensifies. Then, in the heat of the battle, differentiation takes a back seat as all of us strive to outdo each other in acquiring these symbols of prestige. The logical escalation of this competitive battle is aggression vis-a-vis each other which sometimes culminates in violence.

4. During periods of intense competition, as unhappiness increases and grievances multiply, society seeks a scapegoat. The scapegoat is deemed to be responsible for all grievances although, in reality, the grievances arise from mimesis. The scapegoat can be a person or a community (e.g. Jews in Germany in the 1930s, Jews in Hungary today, Muslims in India today, Latino immigrants in Trump’s America).

5. Punishment is then meted out to the scapegoat so as to assuage the masses. In extreme cases, the scapegoat is murdered (e.g. Jesus Christ, Julius Caesar). In less extreme cases, the scapegoat serves out a period of punishment (e.g. Ram & Sita going into exile, ditto for the Pandavas). Figures in positions of power & influence – Kings in the ancient world, CEOs, Presidents and senior politicians today – partly exist to serve as scapegoats.

6. Since powerful leaders realise they can be readily sacrificed as scapegoats, they seek to institutionalise ways such that they can distribute the heat arising from society’s grievances (e.g. by creating a board of directors or a cabinet or parliament) while also increasing the supply of potential scapegoats (e.g. vice-presidents of a firm, various ministers and civil servants in a government).

A skilful leader who understands the above dynamic, moves pre-emptively to sacrifice a scapegoat other than herself to address society’s grievances.

7. Religion serves an important purpose insofar as it helps our leaders quell grievances with reduced conflict and/or smaller scapegoats. Similarly, in corporate life, ‘culture’ serves an important purpose as it forces people to focus on the bigger picture rather than the next promotion round. Ditto for nationalism at the level of the country.


Investment implications
Girard’s central thesis of mimesis (i.e. in our desires, we are programmed to imitate each other) leading to conflict and grief and that, in turn, creating the need for scapegoats is as simple as it is powerful.

We can understand its implications at several levels:

· At the level of the individual, we set ourselves up for a life of strife and unhappiness if we cannot have desires and goals which are different from the people around us. The more differentiated our desires and goals are, the lower the chances of us spending our lives fighting empty battles for wealth, power & prestige.

· However, if we do decide to aspire for the same things that many other people want, then we have to realise that our success, our ascendancy creates the risk that we ourselves shall become the scapegoat.

· You can apply this thinking at the level of the company as well. The less differentiated a company’s offering/business model is, the more likely that it will be engaged in intense competition with others. Such competition between similar companies is likely to result in almost all the player generating RoCE lower than their cost of capital. That, in turn, will trigger lobbying i.e. certain companies will push the government to make somebody a scapegoat. A picture-perfect case study of this is how the telecom industry in India has evolved over the past 20 years – all the companies having essentially the same product/business model and, as a result, none of them has ever been able generate RoCE above their cost of capital. Their almost daily efforts at lobbying in New Delhi led to the 2G scam and arrests that followed.

· For us to generate healthy returns for our clients, we have to look for companies that are either utterly dominant in their industries with Himalayan moats around them (e.g. Asian Paints, Nestle, Pidilite, Relaxo) or look for companies whose products/business models are highly differentiated and, hence, won’t attract competition for a considerable period of time.

You will hear more from us on the latter theme in the months to come. You can also apply Girard’s philosophy at the level of the country but that subject is best stirred on a different day and probably in a different forum.

45,2019-06-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks edged higher in Monday’s trade, with the benchmark Sensex rising over 100 points and the NSE Nifty reclaiming 11,750, only to reverse gains as reports emerged that Viral Acharya has resigned as the RBI Deputy Governor.

Crude prices jumped amid US-Iran tensions while Asian stock markets remained largely tepid, weighing ondomestic stocks.

At 10 am, the 30-pack Sensex was trading at 39,130.84, down 63.65 points, or 0.16 per cent. The index had gained over 100 points in early trade. 

The NSE barometer Nifty was trading below 11,750. 

A total of 17 of 30 Sensex stocks were trading in the green. 

Bajaj Auto, Hero MotCorp, Tech Mahindra, ONGC and Reliance Industries were among the top losers in the Sensex basket of stocks.
IndusInd Bank, Larsen & Toubro, Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, State Bank of India and Yes Bank were among the top gainers in the Sensex pack.

Most sectoral indices were in the green, but oil & gas, energy and auto pack were down almost 1 per cent. 

Meanwhile, RBI's Deputy Governor Viral Acharya has resigned six months ahead of the scheduled end of his term.

Analysts said Acharya's will add to the dovish tone to RBI MPC. 

""Viral Acharya's resignation adds more dovish tone to RBI MPC as he has maintained a hawkish stance during most of the meetings even after agreeing to the rate cut,"" said Sameer Kalra, Founder of Target Investing. 

""The bond and stock market should react positively to this news, but currency might have an initial negative reaction. We look forward to more aggressive rate cuts from the RBI since MPC minutes reveal that focus is on growth now,"" Kalra added."
44,2019-06-24,Asian Paints,"After the initial euphoria over the return of the BJP government, the equity market is looking uncertain again. There are several reasons why investors are shorn of confidence. The domestic economy is facing a consumption slowdown. NBFCs are reeling under a liquidity squeeze, forcing many to scale back operations. Market breadth remains very narrow.The trade war between an increasingly bellicose US and an equally unyielding China threatens to escalate further. Crude oil prices remain vulnerable to tensions erupting afresh in the Middle East. Bond markets across the globe have been flashing warning signs in recent months.Yet, there are some positive signs too. Domestic inflation remains low and interest rates are on the decline. With several conflicting indicators and mixed trends, investors can’t be faulted for their diffidence.How should investors navigate this maze of information which can help them make better investment decisions? Firstly, it is critical that investors interpret this news flow correctly. ET Wealth identified six critical signals that are defining the market sentiment. In the pages ahead, we examine each of these trends in detail and interpret the same for readers. Hopefully, this will help them take timely decisions to adjust their investment portfolios to improve their returns.Market breadth continues to be narrowIn the past year or so, only a handful of stocks have actually gone up, while the broader market has been listless. The market breadth, which is the ratio of stocks that are advancing or declining, has turned decidedly negative in the past three months. The ratio of advances-to-declines on the NSE has dropped from 1.08 in March to 0.59 in June. So, more stocks are losing value than seeing an uptick.More stocks declining than advancingThe market breadth has further narrowed in the past few months.

Experts say this is an outcome of a highly polarised corporate earnings growth. “Only a handful of companies are delivering double-digit earnings growth sustainably. Money is chasing this select set of stocks,” says Kunj Bansal, CIO and Partner, Acepro Advisors. When the market breadth narrows, the markets typically gravitate towards this creamy top layer of ‘quality’ stocks.5 scrips gave 97% of BSE 100 gains in a yearWhen the breadth narrows, markets gravitate towards quality stocks.

Analysts expect this phenomenon to continue for some time. The corporate showing in the coming months will give a clearer picture. The festival season will be in full swing and the impact of government spending during the election season will seep through by then. Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market expert, feels broader market participation is not expected in next few months. “I doubt the market will react positively to announcements in the Budget. Investors are more likely to wait for green shoots to be clearly visible.”Mid-cap valuations revert to discountWhen Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, mid-caps were trading at a significant discount to large-caps. But Modi’s election sparked a multi-year uptick in mid-caps. Expectations of faster growth in mid-caps on the back of a business-friendly government sent valuations soaring to stratospheric levels. However, with earnings not keeping pace with the rise in stock prices, the sentiment has now soured against midcaps. With frontline indices delivering healthy return on the back of a select few bellwether stocks, the valuation differential to mid-cap index is now reverting to near pre-2014 levels. The Nifty Midcap 100 index now trades at a PE of 31.5 compared to 61 barely a year ago. With this sharp correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has now become attractive, say experts. Many are suggesting that investors use this window to hike mid-cap exposure.Mid-cap valuation premium almost erodedAfter the correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has become more attractive.

The PE multiples of several mid-cap stocks have slid sharply. However, investors should not jump in because the mid-cap segment remains vulnerable to the slowdown and any liquidity crunch in the system. As the market focus shifts back to earnings growth and economic realities, any disappointments will push share prices further down.Valuations of some mid-caps have declined sharplyDespite the correction, some mid-caps are still not cheap.     Company Current PE 1 year ago PE   Indian Hotels Co  61.1 156.2   Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail  51.7 90.9   Jubilant Foodworks  54.2 85.4   Dilip Buildcon  30.3 57.4   Quess Corp  35.3 58.7   Bharat Forge  20.0 43.1   Godrej Agrovet  29.2 50.3   Sterlite Technologies  13.3 33.3   Sun TV Network  15.0 33.6   Escorts  14.7 32.6 Experts say that investors should stick to quality mid-caps. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital insists the valuations in mid-caps seem cheap on a relative basis. “These were overvalued earlier, and have not really become cheap now. Good quality mid-caps are still expensive,” he says. Sankaran Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, insists that investors should only take exposure to mid-caps through the SIP route with a longer investing horizon.Consumption demand is moderatingFor years, India’s consumption story powered the economy even when private investment flagged or global demand waned. In recent months, however, this consumption engine has developed a snag. Weak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a slowdown in demand. “Even structural trends are subject to cycles and there is little doubt that consumption is now showing signs of strain,” says Vetri Subramaniam, Group President & Head-Equity, UTI Mutual Fund. Automobile sales have steadily dwindled since October 2018. Nearly all major carmakers have revised sales projections downward citing weak consumer demand. Vehicle makers are cutting back production to clear the piling inventory at dealers. There is also a visible slump in demand for discretionary items like refrigerators, washing machines and other appliances. Even low-ticket essentials like toothpaste, shampoo and hair oil are reporting weak volumes.Consumer stocks have had a tough time on the bourses. However, barring a few exceptions, valuations have not softened much from earlier levels. On the contrary, several consumer stocks have seen multiples expand. Britannia Industries, Dabur India, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Voltas, Havells India and Titan Company are now significantly more expensive than before. Most consumer stocks will be vulnerable if earnings growth does not match up to market expectations.Many consumer stocks have tankedWeak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a demand slowdown.      Company CMP (Rs) PE  1 year price change (%)   Zee Entertainment Enterprises   338  20.7 -39.72   Mahindra & Mahindra   624  24.2 -31.61   Hero MotoCorp   2,648  15.6 -27.83   Maruti Suzuki India   6,582  26.5 -26.82   Page Industries   20,039  56.7 -25.36   TVS Motor Company   458  32.5 -22.98   United Spirits   539  59.5 -19.07   Godrej Consumer Products   658  28.7 -15.01   Avenue Supermarts   1,298  253.9 -14.67   Tata Power Company   65  8.0 -14.16 The ongoing monsoon will play a key role in how the consumption story pans out. An abundant monsoon is a crucial driver of rural sentiment and discretionary consumption. A week’s delay in onset of rains in the country lends no relief. Further, the India Meteorological Department has suggested that the strong El Nino weather pattern, which will keep rains muted, will likely only fade by August. This doesn’t bode well for consumer discretionary stocks, as lower disposable incomes will keep demand for high-value items subdued. Says Gupta, “Much of the slack is actually pent-up demand that is bound to come through in the coming months. But things could get worse before improving.”NBFCs facing severe liquidity crunchExperts say the consumption slowdown has been precipitated by tight liquidity conditions— particularly the cash crunch that has crippled NBFCs. With banks and mutual funds refraining from lending money to many such shadow banks since the IL&FS blowout, these have had to scale down their operations. This has shackled growth as NBFCs accounted for nearly a quarter of the credit growth in the past financial year. Much of this lending was for purchase of vehicles, appliances and other items. The revival of consumption partly hinges on the time it takes for liquidity conditions to normalise going ahead.NBFCs are now reworking their business models to tide over the liquidity crunch. The central bank has also proposed norms that will introduce liquidity buffers for NBFCs. As part of the new rules, NBFCs may have to set aside 60% of their net cash flows in government securities starting next year and gradually step it up in a phased manner. This is to ensure that the lenders have enough liquidity to fall back on in case of liquidity stress. But analysts point out these tougher norms could further crimp NBFCs that do not have a well-managed asset-liability situation. “The financially better placed NBFCs with strong sponsor support and well-established positioning in the ecosystem may be able to withstand it better than others,” says Jinay Gala, Senior Analyst, India Ratings and Research.Shares of several NBFCs have taken quite a beating over the past year. The fear of a contagion has led many to dump NBFC shares. Equity mutual funds have also cut their NBFC exposure sharply in recent months. Analysts suggest that investors should stick to NBFCs with strong parentage and healthy asset-liability positions.Several NBFC shares have taken a beatingFear of a contagion from IL&FS episode has led many to dump NBFC shares.

Other analysts, such as Gupta, suggest investors stay away from NBFCs for now. “Several NBFCs have very opaque structures. These firms have a problem and we don’t know the full extent of it yet.”Deleveraging by Indian companies continuesIn the last few years, several highly indebted firms had consciously embarked on reducing their debt burden. India Inc continues on this deleveraging trend. For the third straight year in 2018-19, domestic companies’ net debt-equity ratio showed improvement. In 2013-14, 61 BSE200 index companies had a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one, while 24 firms exhibited leverage in excess of three times. According to latest available data for these companies, 57 companies have a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one and only 20 companies reported a ratio higher than three. Further, the solvency position of these companies has also improved. Bansal argues, “The deleveraging exercise will separate the men from the boys. Stronger names will emerge leaner and fitter.”Many companies deleveraged in recent yearsThe solvency positions of these companies have also improved.

Data as on 17 JuneMajor corporations including Reliance Industries and Tata Group have also kickstarted a deleveraging exercise. RIL has partially reduced its debt by transferring Jio’s fibre and telecom tower assets and liabilities to two Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). The conglomerate is also planning stake sales in its refining and telecom businesses. Tata Steel, which accounts for nearly 90% of the Tata Group’s debt, plans to bring down its Rs 1 lakh crore debt burden to Rs 70,000 crore over the next few years. This process of deleveraging will improve profitability, but will take some time to seep through, reckon analysts. Gupta asserts, “Deleveraging is a lengthy process. It is best to stay away from highly leveraged companies even if they take steps to repair the balance sheet.”Inverted yield curve indicates recessionIn recent months, a prominent indicator of economic health has been flashing red across countries. The yields on long-term bonds are now lower than on short-term bonds. The yield is the return an investor gets on a bond. Typically, investors demand higher yields from longer-term bonds to compensate for the higher risk of keeping their money tied up for a longer period. But when yields on shorter term bonds rise above longer term bonds, it signals that the bond market is expecting trouble ahead. Such yield inversions have preceded several recessions in the past. The recent inversion in the US yield curve is the first since 2007, when the subprime crisis sent the economy into recession.Some nations are witnessing an inverted yield curveCountries not showing inversion now have done so in the recent past.     Country 2 year bond yield (%) 10 year bond yield (%)   Lebanon 11.88 11.04   Mexico 7.86 7.64   Canada 1.38 1.43   Japan -0.21 -0.13   Czech Republic 1.45 1.54   South Korea 1.49 1.60   Taiwan 0.49 0.70   United States 1.87 2.11   Singapore 1.70 1.96   Philippines 4.94 5.23   Norway 1.10 1.41 Apart from the US, several countries are witnessing the inverted yield curve. The phenomenon is not limited to developed countries. Even developing economies like Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Philippines have all flashed red at some point. Indian bond markets have not ventured into this territory yet. Also, experts maintain that the yield curve inversion is merely a transient phase and bond yields should normalise in the coming months."

Hopes of trade resolution
US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have agreed to meet at the G20 summit in Japan next week, raising hopes for a truce in the bruising trade war between the world's top two economies.


Expert Take
""We maintain our cautious stance. The near-term movement is likely to be driven by progress in monsoon as well as global developments. The G20 summit will be closely monitored, as it is likely to focus on efforts to settle the international crisis and give some indication on progress on US-China trade talks. Further, the crude oil price and currency movement will also be on the market radar""- Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking""Front line indices had a smart pull back, after uninspiring move over the previous fortnight.

55,2019-06-27,Asian Paints,"Charlie Munger, as much as Warren Buffett, has lessons for those who invest in Indian stocks. The central tenet of our 12 stock portfolio from a 25-stock investment universe is inspired by Munger’s approach to developing deep knowledge, building mental models and staying within a tight circle of competence.


“Carnegie was always proud that he took very little salary. Rockefeller and Vanderbilt were the same. It was a common culture in a different era. All of these people thought of themselves as the founder… If you’re highly conscientious and you hate to disappoint, you will feel the pressure to live up to your incentive fee.”

– Charlie Munger (Berkshire AGM, 2003)


The key insights of a giant intellect

A uniquely original and astonishingly capable mind, who learnt across multiple disciplines without taking a single course in university on business or finance, Charlie Munger’s life provides rich learnings for those who seek wisdom. At the core of Munger’s wisdom is the realisation that thinking does not come naturally to the vast majority of people in the stock market i.e. most of us do NOT think most of the time; we parrot/imitate and respond reflexively to what we read, see and hear. Therefore, if we can set up systems and processes and learn tricks that teach us to think, in fact make us think, we will gradually become better than most people around us.

This central insight from Munger is extremely relevant for investors in a market like India, where herd instinct is even stronger than it is in the developed markets and where accounting/governance inadequacies characterise even prominent companies.

Basis our reading of three superb books – 
Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger (2003) by Peter Bevelin, Charlie Munger: the Complete Investor (2015) by Tren Griffin, and Poor Charlie’s Almanack (2005) – we provide our summary of what we are trying to learn from this titan:


1. Continuously learning, thinking, building mental models & deep knowledge: In order to benefit from this model of focused learning, we need to be patient and we need to realise that there will always be people who will be going faster than us. However, if we persist, we will benefit from what is called the second half of the chessboard – the knowledge compounding heaven where the real action takes place. In Munger’s words, “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day — if you live long enough —most people get what they deserve.”

There’s another way to think about what Munger is saying. If we gradually build a repository of knowledge and accumulated experience of real world situations, we will gradually become more able to correlate problems we are coming across with the knowledge we have already accumulated. In the words of the psychologist-cum-economist Herbert Simon, “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”


2. Understanding our circle of competence and staying within it: A decade ago, Munger said in a BBC interview, “We have to deal with things that we’re capable of understanding.” At Marcellus, we have repeatedly been asked why we don’t invest in stocks which do not have high return on capital and strong cash flows. After all, the thinking goes, great investors are all about finding decent companies at bargain prices.

However, since we can’t second-guess how an ugly frog will become a handsome prince, we have focused on our core competence of investing in great franchises with strong moats and clean management. To quote Munger, “It’s obvious that if a company generates high returns on capital and reinvests at high returns, it will do well. But this wouldn’t sell books, so there’s a lot of twaddle and fuzzy concepts that have been introduced that don’t add much.”

Munger also makes the broader point that “knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant” and “acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.”

Munger’s friend Li Lu has restated this nicely: “The true insights a person can get in life are still very limited, so correct decision making must necessarily be confined to your ‘circle of competence’. A ‘competence’ that has no defined borders cannot be called a true competence.”


3. Focus on one or two variables: In the businesses he invested in and in the way he gradually built a vast body of knowledge, Munger learnt to focus on the one or two variables which drive success. In his words “In business, we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximising and or minimising one or a few variables—like the discount warehouses of Costco.”

As Farnam Street said in a blog honouring Munger, “When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Attempting to maximise competing variables is a recipe for disaster. Picking one variable and relentlessly focusing on it, which is an effective strategy, diverges from the norm. It’s hard to compete with businesses that have correctly identified the right variables to maximise or minimise. When you focus on one variable, you’ll increase the odds that you’re quick and nimble — and can respond to changes in the terrain.”

Warren Buffett has articulated this point of view from the perspective of an investor: “You only have to be right on a very, very few things in your lifetime as long as you never make any big mistakes… An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids big mistakes.”


4. Focus on outstanding businesses: Until he started collaborating with Munger, Buffett was focused on using Ben Graham’s cigar-butt style of ‘value investing’.

Munger’s influence played a major role in Buffett gradually abandoning this style through the 1970s and 1980s and moving towards investing in outstanding franchises like Capital Cities/ABC and Coca Cola. Munger deserves enormous credit for first saying: “Ben Graham had blind spots. He had too low an appreciation of the fact some businesses were worth paying big premiums for,” and then saying “Ben Graham had a lot to learn as an investor. His ideas on how to value companies were all shaped by how the Great Crash and Depression almost destroyed him, and he was always a little afraid of what the market can do. It left him with an aftermath of fear for the rest of his life, and all his methods were designed to keep that at bay. I think Ben Graham wasn’t nearly as good an investor as Warren Buffett is or even as good as I am. Buying those cheap, cigar-butt stocks [companies with limited potential growth selling at a fraction of what they would be worth in a takeover or liquidation] was a snare and a delusion…”

Interestingly, this resulted in an investment style for Munger (heavily influenced by the great Phil Fisher), which works nicely for us in India and has given us a portfolio of moated, relatively clean, well run companies like Asian Paints, Marico, HDFC Bank and Page Industries. In Munger’s words, “Once we’d gotten over the hurdle of recognizing that a thing could be a bargain based on quantitative measures that would have horrified Graham, we started thinking about better businesses.”


5. Carefully choose the people we work with & work for: We are fortunate insofar as hundreds of people send us their CVs. However, Munger says one has to be selective because people who do unwise things in one setting usually proceed to do unwise things in other setting as well. In Munger’s words, “…it’s just so useful dealing with people you can trust and getting all the others the hell out of your life. It ought to be taught as a catechism. … [W]ise people want to avoid other people who are just total rat poison, and there are a lot of them.”


Investment implications

Our team’s coverage universe of Indian stocks is only 25. Our Consistent Compounders Portfolio has only 12 stocks in it. We have five analysts in our team and each is required to dissect only 4-5 stocks. Why? Because we don’t think we can realistically ask our analysts to build deep knowledge on more than this number of companies. By ‘deep knowledge’ we mean: (a) familiarity with the last 15 years of annual reports of each of these companies; (b) deep understanding of every single major capital allocation decision made by these companies over the last 15 years; (c) a deeper understanding of the competitive advantages – or the lack thereof – of these companies than anyone else in the Indian stock market has; and (d) full understanding of accounting/governance tricks being used to flatter financial performance.

The two variables we obsessively focus on are a company’s sustainable competitive advantages and its accounting quality. All our effort goes in training and teaching ourselves to understand how clever companies build deep moats and how unscrupulous companies steal shareholders’ money.

The past decade has taught us that building deep knowledge of high quality Indian firms is unusually rewarding because most analysts/investors operating in India are seldom able to focus long enough on a company to truly understand its moats.

For obvious reasons, the management teams of these companies do NOT host conference calls where they spill the beans on the real moat of the company. As a result, if we can understand the same better than others, we should generate superior results over long periods of time. That being said, it is tough, grindingly hard work – not just because of the many hours spent reading but also because of the time and effort involved in tracking down experts who can provide deep, original insights into the workings of these companies.

From being one of the least favoured markets for corporate listing way back in, Indian exchanges have moved up the ranks significantly among emerging markets alongside Shanghai’s SSE and Brazil’s Bovespa. This is what a PwC survey has just foundNext​ The EM-DM juggle19 Jun, 2019Although developed market (DM) exchanges continue to be favoured for listing, their lead over EMs has narrowed significantly since 2011. The dominance of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) is not as great as before, with Indian exchanges, Shanghai’s SSE and Brazil’s Bovespa moving up the ranks, in recognition of the growing maturity of EM exchanges.Next​ Game of dominance19 Jun, 2019Looking towards 2030, PwC still expects companies from China and India to dominate issuance, views regarding the leading exchanges have changed dramatically. The same four exchanges, NYSE, Nasdaq, LSE and HKEX, are expected to maintain their leading positions, reflecting their unmatched levels of resilience and liquidity advantages. In 2011, the medium-term view of the top four exchange destinations was very different — with Shanghai in the top spot, Indian exchanges at number three and Brazil’s Bovespa in fourth place.Next​ Who leads capital raising in 2030?  19 Jun, 2019In 2011, respondents predicted that the Shanghai market would be the leading exchange globally by 2025, and India and Brazil would follow in third and fourth places. PwC’s current survey places these markets in sixth, fifth and 11th place, respectively.  While Shanghai’s popularity has fallen from 55% to 21%, India has also become less attractive despite strong activity levels over the past couple of years.NextWhat’s buzzing in IPO mart19 Jun, 2019Although Greater China remains the primary Asian market, India has seen a significant increase in IPO activity after a period of market downturn. India may  benefit from concerns by Asian equity investors over the US’s and China’s growing trade rift, as India is less involved in regional supply chains than other major Asian countries such as China and South Korea.

In 2017–18, 335 IPOs raised $17.4 billion, much more than in the prior five years. This is due to several factors. Political stability under Narendra Modi’s government and a positive economic outlook resulted in a number of large Indian IPOs coming to market in recent years, most notably in the insurance sector. Positive changes to the Indian capital market regulations further contributed to IPO momentum.Next"
54,2019-06-27,Asian Paints,"There is a stark divergence between Nifty constituents on both performance and valuations with one segment trading at a substantial premium and the other at a huge discount to the long-term average, said domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, adding that there is limited headroom for valuation re-rating at index level given the continued downside risks.

Some of the stocks where valuations are at a substantial discount to long period average are Eicher Motors, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Coal India and ONGC, said the brokerage.

Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries, Titan Company, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever and UltraTech Cement are trading at a substantial premium to their respective five or ten-year average price-to-earnings or price-tobook multiples, said Motilal Oswal.

Predicting the timing of fortune reversal for these names is always fraught with risks, more so in the current underlying economic scenario, the brokerage said.

“This polarisation on performance and valuations clearly underscores two things: one, investors taking continued refuge in the quality/earnings predictability theme in an environment of economic slowdown and two, there is a lack of pick-up in broader market’s earnings growth,” said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage said that the revival in Nifty earnings in FY20 is predicated on normalisation of credit costs in the banking sector. The banking, financial services and insurance space is expected to account for 70% of incremental earnings for the Nifty in FY20, the brokerage said.

“At 19.5x FY20E P/E, we do not see material room for further valuation re-rate,” said Motilal Oswal.

ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, Titan, L&T, Coal India, Infosys, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki India are top large-cap ideas of Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage’s mid-cap picks include Federal Bank, DCB Bank, Indian Hotels, Crompton Consumer, KEC International, Ashoka Buildcon, Aditya Birla Fashion and Zensar."

Expert Take

Global market rallied on account of trade truce between US-China and scope to maintain required oil supply from Opec. While sequential pickup in monthly auto sales and a likely proposal to simplify GST rate due to rise in revenue collection boosted the market sentiment.

5,2019-07-03,Asian Paints,"The outlook is relatively clear for the Indian economy. We are in a slow economic climate and that bodes well for consolidation of the market in the hands of a handful of well-run companies, says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW..

Nobody likes a quiet market but secretly last week, everybody was praying for a quiet market. D-Street wanted the market to stop falling and finally that has happened.A quiet market reflects the quietness in the economy and ahead of the first Budget of the new government, it is as good an outcome as we can expect going into a tricky situation for the economy. That being said, the outlook is less uncertain than a lot of people are making it out to be. It is relatively clear. For instance, in lending, we will end up consolidating both our banking and NBFC sectors in the hands of half a dozen lenders. 

Similarly, it is relatively clear given the trade situation that a mid 70s exchange rate for the rupee makes more sense. In that regard, IT and pharma stocks make a lot of sense. It is easy to say that in a macro downturn, there are lots of uncertainty, but in my reckoning, the outlook is relatively clear for the Indian economy. We are in a slow economic climate and that bodes well for consolidation of the market in the hands of a handful of well-run companies.


Technically speaking, we may be out of the woods. Markets have stopped falling. There is not much excitement and just two days are left to go. No one is even talking about what the deal is. Is the market not anticipating anything big bang in this budget?If you capture the crux of the market sentiment vis-à-vis the budget, then a couple of things are clear. Obviously GST is such a big part of our economy now. It has obviously not been captured by the Union Budget. It is a separate dynamic altogether. 

Secondly, in a way, the interim budget in February announced some tax cuts for people earning Rs 5 lakh or less, PM Kisan and so on. Given the limited fiscal space available, I do not think the markets got any great expectations of what will happen on Friday, July 5.


I was looking at some of your picks here. You are looking at key four-five names and for the long term, talking about defensive bets in IT and pharma. Would you be completely risk averse right now or would you would be willing to dabble in some of the other pockets?The truth we have historically taken to investing in India is that we have tried not to dabble, not to speculate and consistently focussed on running a portfolio focussed on high quality cash generators. We call them consistent compounders and in that context of running companies which are high quality cash generators, our outlook has been that whether it is in banking, FMCG or IT services, the focus is on companies with unbeatable comparative advantages in the sector. 

For instance in IT, TCS is a company we have recommended to several of our clients. The focus is on companies which are unbeatable and have comparative advantages. One has to buy them and sit back and watch them compound. There is very little scope in that sort of investing framework for short-term trading or short-term speculation. That is why we do not get that perturbed over the latest GDP print and the NBFC crisis and so on.


Some people have been looking either at contra plays. Any defensive play other than IT and pharma? Take for instance Asian Paints. It dominates the paints category with over 50% market share for the last 50 years. It is what I would call a consistent compounder. The stock is up 1700x or so in the last 35 years. Now that is a well understood consistent compounder. 

What I find very interesting about India is further down, in the market cap spectrum, you get similar companies. For instance, Relaxo is a stock I own personally. Relaxo is also in several of our client portfolios. In the northern Indian footwear market, Relaxo is now by far the dominant player. A lot of people do not know that it was Bata which created the Hawai chappal. Bata is out of the hawai chappal segment and Relaxo is now the dominant player there. 

It is a smaller company than Asian Paints and the market cap is in the vicinity of Rs 10,000 crore. But a category dominator like Relaxo has a bright future and there is very little dependence between Relaxo’s fortunes and the latest GDP print or the NBFC crisis and so on. These sort of stocks provide opportunities which does not really depend on the outcome of RBI policy or elections and so on. You buy companies which are category dominators and you compound with them over several years.


What else do you like? The businesses which are completely isolated from what the RBI does, what happens to US yields or the Budget and any other business which is isolated from all macro dynamics?A company where I think the description you are giving fits nicely -- isolated from macro dynamics -- is Dr Lal Path Labs. It is the category dominator in the path lab segment in northern and eastern India. In western India, it has some competition from Metropolis. It is a well-run high cash generating company. The stock has not done that much in the last couple of years. But it fits this description again -- dominant player, essential product, insulated from macro and political dynamics and I own it in my personal capacity.

We own it in a lot of our client portfolios. In India, there is no need to chase high beta or go after leveraged companies or indeed Nifty 50 companies with weak balance sheets. There are several smaller versions of Asian Paints, TCS. You buy those and patiently ride with them and make decent returns.


Why not Thyrocare? The numbers are promising and they can cut ost down in a meaningful manner. In a sense, they are the destructor in the path lab space?The return on capital employed (ROC) is the central dynamic which captures a company’s capital allocation. Both the ROC dynamic and on the way capital allocation happens in the DR Lal’s versus Thyrocare shows Dr Lal’s is the superior player. The other way to look at it is the hub and spoke network that Dr Lal’s has created. I would say the best player in the sector is Dr Lal. There might be some good unlisted plays in the sector which I am unaware of but in the listed space, it is head and shoulders above everybody else.


How much longer do you think this polarised nature of the market will continue? It has continued for two and a half years already?The way to think about it is easier economic climate gives lesser companies a chance to flourish. When you are in a tough economic climate like the one we are in where growth is tough, financing is becoming tougher, obviously the category leaders consolidate their lead further. For us to move away from this market where 8-10 stocks drive the entire gains of the stock market year after year to a market where lesser companies, the number three, number four, number five player in the sector does well, we need to see the economic climate becoming far more growth-oriented and the cost of capital coming down. I cannot see that happening in this fiscal at least. The dominance of the few companies driving share price returns in our country will continue for some time to come.


Would you be still bullish on IT considering the weakness in the dollar index? If the US economy slows down further, the rupee tailwind could become or end up becoming a headwind?Our main IT play is TCS and we have it in several of our clients portfolios. In TCS’s case, there are two parts to the investment hypothesis here; one is the currency sliding. At around, 70 to the dollar, the rupee is significantly overvalued and over the next 12-18 months, mid 70s for the rupee makes more sense. 

If you look at the current account deficit data for the full year FY19, 2% plus current account deficit print does suggest an overvalued currency. It is difficult for me to time that, but on company-specific fundamentals, TCS is scale gorilla in outsourcing globally. It is difficult to see how anybody Indian or otherwise is going to give this company a run for its money in terms of capabilities, efficiencies and outsourcing. 

So company-specific strength, a bit of a macro trigger around the currency come together even if the macro trigger does not fructify in the next six, seven months, we should still make good money from our holding in TCS. And if the macro trigger comes through, nothing like it."

6,2019-07-03,Asian Paints,"Polarisation in the equity market will continue at least till the end of this financial year, says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment Managers.

Equity benchmark Sensex and Nifty are hovering near their all-time high levels on the back of a steady rise in select blue chips.

Only 20 stocks in the Nifty pack have delivered over 10 per cent return to investors since January 2018, while 24 others have plunged up to 67 per cent during the same period. 

Mukherjea said the market needs a growth-oriented environment to come out from this phase. “We need to see the cost of capital come down. And I do not foresee this happening in at least this financial year. The dominance of few companies driving share price return will continue for some time now,” he said.

Mukherjea is long known for picking compounders on Dalal Street. 

He said a slow economic environment bodes well for consolidation of well-run companies. 

Commenting on his investing strategy in this market condition, Mukherjea said his team was consistently focusing on high quality companies that are cash generators.

As a piece of advice to investors, he said one should buy companies that have unbeatable competitive advantages, which do not get affected much by macroeconomic dynamics such as a GDP slowdown, NBFC crisis and a tweak in RBI monetary policy. 

He said companies like Relaxo, Asian Paints, Tata Consultancy Services and Dr Lal Path Labs fit this criteria. Mukherjea said he or his clients owned these stocks in their portfolios. 

“You buy companies which are categories dominators, and you compound with them over several years,” he said. 

Mukherjea said there is no need to chase high-beta stocks or Nifty 50 companies with weaker balance sheets. Smaller versions of TCS and Asian Paints available in the market which can provide decent returns going forward."
7,2019-07-06,Asian Paints,"The domestic equity market moved in a slow pace leading to the Union Budget. However, Dalal Street looked disappointed post Budget announcement. Holistically, the Budget was wholesome, rational and long-term goal-oriented.

Nirmala Sitharaman has stressed on measures to improve inclusive growth, reduce income inequality, build digital ecosystem, create a cashless economy and bring about a transparent and honest regime.

There were certain hard-core punches, which will change the dynamics in certain industries.

But what surprised was the move to increase public shareholding in companies from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. This is probably the biggest wealth-transferring move in the interest of larger good of the country, but from the stock market’s perspective, there will be an overhang of supply and the market at large will face the repercussions. This will change the demand-supply equation in the capital market and a number of largecap companies with a high promoter shareholding will bear the brunt.

The February 2019 Interim Budget was short-term oriented, given the pre-election compulsions, while post-election, the focus has shifted towards India’s long-term growth dynamics. 100 per cent FDI in insurance intermediaries will aid the insurance companies to boost premium growth and get a spot on the global financial map in order to mobilise global savings as insurance is highly underpenetrated with exposure to ~3.5-4 per cent in India.


Event of the Week

June car sales shrank by double digits for the third consecutive month in a row and the Budget did not look rosy from the auto company’s perspective. They will have to shell out more and put fresh capex in order to roll out electric vehicles as the Budget evidently took steps to boost electric vehicles. Plus, the proposed development of new metros will further dent demand for cars, especially in the passenger vehicle segment. This will be a huge negative for auto companies.


Technical Outlook

Nifty50 has finally turned downward and made a lower top for the first time, indicating a likely change in trend. The market has resolved the state of confusion and finally turned sharply lower, which will now take it all the way down to 11,400 level, the gap which had remained unfilled. ‘Sell on rise’ should be the strategy for traders in the short term.

Expectations from the Week

With the much-awaited event finally over, its overhang will continue next week as the offshoots of certain proposals will be visible in the capital markets. As the divergence between Nifty and Nifty Midcap/ Smallcap indices was way above the past few years in June, there is higher likelihood of a larger correction in largecaps compared with the broader market. A higher correction is, therefore, in the making and investors must look to book profits in largecap companies as the process of mean reversion has started. Years of outperformance will now be followed by prolonged under-performance.

Divest and avoid autos and highly-valued companies having high promoter holdings. The Nifty50 closed the week at 11,811, up 0.19 per cent.

Analysts expect markets to remain volatile for the next few days with focus now shifting on upcoming quarterly results where expectations remain muted and macro economic data.

Asian stocks continued their struggle on Tuesday after strong US jobs data reduced expectations of an aggressive rate cut by the US Federal Reserve at the end of July.

Globally, investors’ focus also shifted to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later in the week for clues on monetary policy as investors assess prospects for monetary easing following some conflicting signals on the US economy.

“The stock-specific mayhem has started again and this time, rank outperformers are also not spared. Hence, traders are likely to adopt a cautious approach and should ideally avoid trading aggressively for a while,” Chavan said.

Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, the important opening upside gap of May 20 is all set to be filled soon at 11,426. This gap is expected to offer support to the index and one may expect a minor upside bounce near 11,400-11,425 levels in the next few sessions.

“Nifty50 has seen a double top breakdown below 11,625 on the daily chart. It could trigger more panic. A strong support for the index is seen in the 11,500-11,426 range and the immediate strong hurdle is in the 11,620-11,690 zone,"" said Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities.

16,2019-07-10,Asian Paints,"By Himanshi Lohchab
MUMBAI: Shares of Titan Company plunged 12.3 per cent on Tuesday — the highest single day fall in three years on worries about the slowdown in its jewellery business — a unit that contributes almost 82 per cent to the firm’s revenues.

The weakness in the share price could persist till demand for jewellery revives led by softer gold prices or stock valuations become cheaper, said analysts.

“Till the time jewellery growth comes back or maybe when the company gives you some guidance how the demand is going to be, the stock may remain under pressure or continue to languish,” said Amnish Aggarwal, head of research at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher.

Titan’s jewellery segment posted a 13 per cent growth in revenues in the June quarter, below its full year guidance of 22 per cent, said Credit Suisse. The jewellery retailer said higher gold prices impacted demand.

Analysts said the extent of the fall in revenue growth in the company’s main business in April-June was one of the highest in recent years, disappointing investors who have been used to its consistent performance.

“The company was doing extremely well in the sense that numbers were beating estimates. But it always remained an over-owned and a high–priced stock,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president, IIFL Securities.

Titan, considered one of the flagbearers of India’s famed consumption story, has been among the top performers on the bourses in recent years. In last five years, Titan returned 336 per cent, while the Nifty gained 153 per cent.

The run-up in the share price had made Titan’s valuations expensive, leaving little room for disappointments. Credit Suisse, which downgraded the stock to neutral after the first quarter earnings, said its priceto-earnings ratio — a key valuation measure — at almost 48 times 2021estimated earnings is even higher than that of other large consumer staples and discretionary companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Britannia and Asian Paints.

A revival in demand for jewellery will be critical for investor interest to return to Titan. “The stock can only do well only if there are significant earnings upgrades, which now look unlikely given the near-term softness in growth,” said Credit Suisse.

Bhasin said a fall in the stock closer to Rs 1,000 would be a buying opportunity. The stock closed at Rs 1,099.10 after touching a low of Rs 1,072. “We think that in 1-2 months there should be a revival in consumption. By the festival season Titan will be regaining its form and heading back to where it was,” he said.


Navin Kulkarni, head of research, Reliance Securities expects the slump to last for three to six months.

“It’s a quality company and it should soon bottom out between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,050,” he said."

21,2019-07-16,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices have turned rangebound amid economic uncertainty and earnings jitters. Investors are in wait-and-watch mode to see earnings catch up with valuations, though analysts are not sure that is happening anytime soon.

Despite this, over three dozen largecap and midcap stocks on NSE could see strong price-wise action in the coming days. Some 41 stocks are looking strong on technical charts for a bounce, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled an bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. These counters have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Infosys, Asian Paints, Jindal Steel & Power, United Spirits, JSW Steel and UltraTech Cement besides HDFC Life Insurance, Equitas Holdings, DCB Bank, Quess Corp, GSPL, IGL, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Tata Sponge Iron, among others. 







The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile 69 stocks are showing a bearish trend. They Bharti Airtel, DHFL, Allahabad Bank, Indiabulls Real Estate, Colgate-Palmolive and Petronet LNG.

RBL Bank, UCO Bank, Radico Khaitan, PNB Housing Finance, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, VRL Logistics and The Mandhana Retail are also looking weak on technical charts. 







“Traders could find opportunities on both sides of the trade and, hence, one should remain stock-specific with a proper risk management strategy,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation based on a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, it has been consolidating and its earlier support at 11,640 is acting as a key resistance. “The index needs to convincingly surpass the hurdle in the 11,640-11,700 zone to regain strength. On the flipside, the 11,460-11,430 zone is the immediate support range to watch out for. The index is witnessing a time-wise correction. Unless we see a breakout on either direction, traders should maintain a stock-specific approach,” Chavan said.

The odds are in favour of the bears as long as Nifty50 trades below the swing high of 11,640, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. “The broader market indices are already reflecting inherent weakness. For Nifty50, the 11,500 and 11,461 levels will be the key levels on the downside below which it will be prone to a larger decline.”

26,2019-07-21,Asian Paints,"Benchmark equity indices Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the week in the red amid profit booking by foreign investors, mixed earnings and concerns over a slowdown in the economy. 

The 30-share Sensex declined 1.03 per cent for the week to end at 38,337 on July 19 against 38,736 on July 12. Likewise, 50-share Nifty declined 1.15 per cent to 11,419.

Going by the buzz on the Street, here are the five factors that are likely to chart market direction in the coming week.


June quarter results: More than 200 companies including Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Larsen & Toubro will announce their financial results for the quarter ended June 2019 during the coming week.

Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints, Apollo Tricoat Tubes, Can Fin Homes, Coromandel International, Mastek, Oriental Bank of Commerce, TVS Motor, United Spirits, Everest Industries, HDFC Life Insurance Company, Hindustan Unilever, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services and NIIT Technologies are among the other players that will report their numbers during the week

The market will also react to RIL’s June quarter earnings, which came on Friday post market hours. The oil-to-telecom behemoth posted a 6.8 per cent increase in consolidated net profit for the quarter on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

The company's consolidated net profit (attributed to the owners of the company) rose to Rs 10,104 crore, against Rs 9,459 crore reported during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.


FII inflows: Foreign institutional investors have offloaded shares worth nearly Rs 7,700 crore in July so far against an inflow of over Rs 30,000 crore during April-June. Any more selloff by FIIs during the week may further dampen market sentiment. The government has refused to provide any relief to overseas investors from the higher tax surcharge announced in the Union Budget.


F&O expiry: The upcoming week may witness more volatility as market participants will adjust their F&O positions as July series contracts expire on July 25. 


Global cues: On the global front, market participants would watch key macroeconomic data from the US starting from Redbook, Existing Home Sales on July 23, Durable Goods Orders, Jobless Claims, Fed Balance Sheet, Money Supply on July 25 and GDP and Baker-Hughes Rig Count on July 26.


Monsoon: The slowing economy concerns were further heightened as consumer good sales in rural areas have slowed down amid delayed monsoon rains. “The major crop and agri producing belt have seen rain deficit and it is posing another concern for the economy. Along with that, we are already seeing a rise in inflation for the last few months,” said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.

Cumulative rainfall stood at 15.8 per cent below normal till July 17 with weekly rainfall 19.8 per cent below normal."
27,2019-07-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their decline for the third session in a row on Monday, dragged by banking, realty, FMCG and financial stocks as government's reluctance to tweak foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) income tax surcharge continued to weigh on the markets. 

HDFC Bank was among the top losers in the Sensex pack as the markets witnessed a sharp sell off. The stocks of the lender cracked up to 4 per cent, after the bank reported a rise in nonperforming assets (NPAs). HDFC Bank on Saturday had posted a 21 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in standalone net profit at Rs 5,568.16 crore for the quarter ended June 2019. During the quarter, gross NPAs rose to Rs 11,768.95 crore which is 1.40 per cent of the total advances, compared with Rs 9,538.62 crore which was 1.33 per cent in the same quarter 2018-19 fiscal.

Analysts said that the markets were witnessing broadbased selling as disappointing earnings and reports of slowing economic growth were denting market sentiments. They were further of the view that the selloff by foreign funds was due to the government's reluctance to remove the applicability of the new surcharge on the super rich on foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).

Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak Securities said, ""Nifty has broken its previous bottom of 11,460 and is expected to remain under selling pressure in the near term. On the downside strong support is seen at 11,000-11,100 levels; the same can be tested unless any meaningful reversal is seen in the broader markets. Midcap indices trade around pre-election levels; high volatility is expected in this space. 11,000 remains an inflection point for the index for the next few months; Make or break of the same is expected to define the further course of the markets.""

Also, slow progress of monsoon weighed on investors' risk appetite as IMD said that deficient rainfall was expected over half of India this season. 

On the global front, Asian shares closed lower as investors reduced expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, while heightened Middle East tensions following an Iranian seizure of a British tanker lifted crude oil prices. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.4 per cent. Japan's Nikkei closed down 0.2 per cent on the more tempered Fed easing views and caution ahead of the domestic earnings season which starts this week.

Brent crude futures were up 2.08 per cent, at $63.77 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 1.80 per cent, at $56.63. The rupee slipped 18 paise down at 68.98 against the US dollar on account of some buying in American currency by banks and importers amid sustained selling by foreign institutional investors. 

BSE Sensex closed 305.88 points, or 0.80 per cent, lower at 38,031.13. While NSE Nifty ended at 11,337.15, down 82.10 points or 0.72 per cent.

In the 30-pack Sensex, 16 stocks ended in the green and 14 in the red with HDFC as the worst performer and YES Bank the best. Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, HUL and Bajaj Finance too joined HDFC on the losers list, slipping up to 5 per cent.

BSE Finance index recorded losses of 2.28 per cent followed by FMCG, Realty and Bankex index. While BSE Metal and Energy index were among the best performers. 

In terms of index contribution, TCS, RIL, Maruti Suzuki and Asian Paints were the top support while HDFC twins, Kotak Bank and ITC were the top drag on Sensex. 


Expert Take
A crack in the HDFC twins, Bajaj Finance will seriously impact NAVs of mutual funds which might face a further cascading effect. The vicious circle is deepening and the necessity of liquidity will eventually lead to large liquidations even in frontline stocks. Investors should mentally be ready to see further cuts in their portfolio values until at least till Diwali. They are advised to wait and not do bottom fishing currently.

Nifty50 traded inside the trading range of last session and formed an Inside Bar on daily scale on Tuesday. It witnessed a decent recovery from the crucial support at 11,300, but failed to surpass the previous day’s high of 11,398 and drifted lower towards the 11,300 mark.

The immediate structure of the index is under pressure till it doesn’t surpass the 11,400-11,420 range, while a hold below 11,300 level could extend its weakness towards the next support at 11,250 and then 11,200 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,300 followed by 11,200 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,400 levels. There was Put writing at 11,300 and 11,200 levels and Call writing at 11,350 followed by 11,400 levels. The option data suggested a shift in lower trading range between 11,250 and 11,500 levels.

India VIX moved up 3.21 per cent to 13.42 level.

Bank Nifty continued its weakness for the fourth consecutive session and drifted towards the 29,100 level. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale, as selling pressure emerged at higher levels. The index has been forming lower highs and lows for last four sessions. As long as it remains below 29,500 level, weakness could continue towards 28,888 level, while on the upside, a major hurdle is seen at 29,350 and then 29,500 and 29,650 levels.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,340 level with a loss of 0.17 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Page Industries, Asian Paints, PVR and Titan while shorts were seen in HDFC, Indiabulls Housing, Shriram Transport and Havells.

35,2019-07-23,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Price hikes may fail to prevent Asian Paints from reporting a tepid 1-3 per cent growth in profit when the company posts its June quarter results on Wednesday. Analysts believe that the paints maker may post a 6-10 per cent jump in volumes despite a strong base, but the company margin may see some pressure due to deteriorating product mix.

The profit growth will be impacted by higher depreciation related to new plants, said Phillip Capital, which expects profit to rise 3 per cent YoY to Rs 573.5 crore from Rs 558 crore posted in the same quarter last year. The brokerage sees revenue rising 13 per cent YoY to Rs 4,950 crore, while it expects Ebitda margin falling to 19.2 per cent from 19.9 per cent YoY.

Edelweiss Securities expect the paint maker to report 1.7 per cent YoY rise in profit on 8.2 per cent growth in sales. It sees volume growing at 5-6 per cent against 10.5 per cent in March quarter and 12.5 per cent in the year ago quarter.

“Price hike in paints has been 7 per cent YoY. But, considering unfavourable product mix (higher putty sales), the effective price hike is likely to be 2.5-3.5 per cent YoY. Prices of crude-linked raw materials like TiO2 and other monomers have declined from the peak, which should aid gross margin expansion. We, however, expect initial factory cost (Mysuru and Vizag) to slightly negate gross margin benefit,” the brokerage said. 

Reliance Securities expects the company to report 10 per cent YoY volume growth and 3 epr cent YoY pricing growth.

“Higher raw material cost and deteriorating product mix is likely to impact gross margins. Increased staff costs and other expenditure is likely to keep Ebitda growth under check. Ebitda margins are likely to compress by 229 bps YoY in Q1 FY20. The higher depreciation cost is likely to impact net earnings growth,” the brokerage said."
33,2019-07-23,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their losses for the fourth day in a volatile trading session on Tuesday as the markets witnessed selling pressure in auto, pharma and PSU banking counters. Meanwhile, IT and FMCG indices offered some support to the markets.

Investors mostly remained cautious throughout the day on disappointing June-quarter earnings as the HDFC twins continued their downtrend. Investors are now keeping a close watch on HUL, ZEEL, L&T and NIIT Technologies, who are scheduled to announce their June-quarter results later today, for further cues. Analysts expect volatility to persist in the coming sessions as the markets are expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings season.

Analysts said that markets have entered a bearish phase amid concerns over an economic slowdown and weak corporate earnings and believe that concerns over tax and muted Q1 results will continue to hamper the sentiments. Also, with lack of any fresh positive domestic triggers and uncertain global cues, markets may maintain a cautious stance for the coming days. 

Heavy foreign fund outflow and weak monsoon were also hurting investor sentiment, analysts added. IMD had recently said that deficient rainfall was expected over half of India this season. 

On the global front, Asian shares closed higher on expectations that the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.95 per cent while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.04 per cent. Meanwhile, European shares were set to rise for a third straight session tracking gains on Wall Street and in Asia.

32,2019-07-23,Asian Paints,"A year hence we will be in that position where we can look back at 2018 and 2019 and say 'thank God, we cleansed out the worst of the excesses in the financial sector', says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Are we in a spot of bother because FIIs have started selling? Domestic institutional investors do not have too much left in the fuel tank, and HNI and retail investors already have a big hole in their tanks.I suppose the way to think about it is that domestic flows dried up around February-March, so March-April-May the market ran up on FII money. Obviously the election results and the NDA’s emphatic mandate was greeted by even more FII money. But courtesy the tax announcements on 5th July, that FII money has also dried up. As a result, what we are seeing over the last three-four days is lots of downward pressure. Something will have to give. Either the government re-visits the thinking that has been applied to the taxation construct for FPIs or FPIs pull out more money and we see more downward pressure on the market. 

But on one level it is as simple as that -- domestic money dried up around spring. The FIIs pushed Sensex towards 40,000, but now the FIIs have pulled out and we are heading towards 35,000.


 What is the right way to approach the market? Just wait for all the dust to settle down and then take a look at what you could buy on a decline because some of the cream names have begun to fall as well -- the HDFC twins, the Bajaj twins, etc?It is worth drawing a distinction between the two types of stocks that are correcting. One group of stocks correcting was warranted a long time ago -- in some cases several years ago. Finally we are seeing those companies pull back. A lot of NBFCs and HFCs had rallied through 2017, 2018 and these stocks are obviously down 70-80%. As I said before, a lot of these guys will not survive. We are in half way through a consolidation in the NBFC and HFC sector. Even amongst the private sector banks we will see more pain. I do not think we are done with private sector banks' pain yet. This notion that the NPA cycle has peaked is a bit of a fantasy, I reckon. That is one element, what I would call a healthy correction. 


 Where this correction offers really juicy opportunities is, as you were mentioning, in high-quality compounders like a Bajaj Finance or HDFC Bank pullback. It obviously creates beautiful openings to buy consistent compounders/class franchises at decent valuations. That is something we are very keen on. We discussed the merits of buying top-quality companies and sitting patiently before, and that is what we continue to advocate. We have Bajaj Finance and HDFC Bank in our portfolios. I also own them personally, but the pullback there actually makes us quite happy. It gives us a chance to buy great names at better prices.


In your last newsletter, you have done a great comparison between HUL and Nestle saying that classic great compounders were expensive 20 years ago and this time also, it is no different. What falls in that bracket which optically looks expensive for a purist who looks at valuations and may not be excited to own them, but in hindsight may consider it a mistake?I will quickly just explain what I think happens in the market. A lot of people believe that HUL, Nestle, Asian Paints and HDFC Bank are all series companies. They see them as similar to blue chips but actually they are not. In that newsletter we explained why a stock like HUL is simply not in the league of an Asian Paints, a Nestle, or even a Marico when it comes to consistent compounding. 

Asian Paints, Nestle, Marico have track records of consistently growing revenues year after year, decade after decade, in double digits with ROCs consistently ahead of 15%. There are around 20-odd companies in our country which fall in this bracket where revenues are double digits year after year. It does not matter whether it is Lehman or the dot-com bust, these companies are able to grind out outstanding results. Now the point we have emphasised to our clients over the last 12 months is that with franchises of this calibre -- Asian Paints, Nestle, Marico, Kotak Bank, HDFC Bank -- you really should not be using PE multiples and PB multiples to ascertain their fair value. It does not work. You have to look at their ability to generate outstanding results over long periods of time and therefore buy them even at current valuations. I was saying this even last week before the correction. 

Buy even at current valuations, it is better to sit tight and let them deliver results for you and grow your wealth. This notion that you can look at a PE multiple and figure out whether the stock is cheap or not does not work for these elite franchises. But I do concede that there are probably no more than 20 such companies in our country and these are the sort of stocks that we have in our portfolios. I own them personally, so in that regard I am talking my own book.


We had some commentary from the RBI governor talking about how some of the rate cuts so far have been fair and that he feels they are enough to get the system going. Going forward, do you see a turnaround or a potential for growth kicking in? I know you are really positive on financials, but how would you factor in that commentary from the central bank?I will make three points here. Firstly, Shaktikanta Das deserves a fair bit of credit. From the time he took charge, he recognised the extent of the challenges the NBFC sector has faced, he consistently pumped liquidity into the system month after month and he cut rates consistently as well. 

Secondly, I do believe that the RBI still has enormous ability and I reckon they are applying their minds, but they can do more to arrest this NBFC crisis. It is not a question of cutting CRR and SLR. It is a common notion that RBI's cutting of CRR, SLR or the repo rate will help. It is not that easy. We need the central bank to step in and arrest the crisis of confidence in the balance sheets of listed NBFCs and HFCs. 

The bond market, the CP market and the money market simply do not believe these balance sheets anymore. The credibility of credit rating agencies is obviously dented given what has happened in the last couple of years. What we need the RBI to do is to step in and say 'We are going to examine these balance sheets'. Basically do what was called QR for the banks and we will certify the quality of the balance sheets. If recapitalisation is required, we will say as much. What that will do is at least tell the money market and bond market which NBFC's paper is worth buying and what NBFCs are best avoided. At the moment it is almost a generalised drift to oblivion for the entire sector, which is not good for the sector or for the country. We need the central to step in and inject confidence in the sector. 

The third point is that we will see a decisive intervention from the authorities over the next couple of months. There is a great deal of work going on and we will see an intervention which will lead to the best stocks in private banks and NBFCs rallying quite decisively on the back of the policy intervention. 


With an overhang like Dewan Housing, Essel Group or the Zee promoter leverage problem, what will happen to their exposure to banks? If these issues get sorted out, could that re-rate some of these NBFCs and beaten-down banks?We need a combination of fresh equity coming in. We need fresh equity coming into all of these structures because these are overly-leveraged stocks with too much debt and too little equity. In some of these structures, we also need better governance. So, it is a combination of the two. It is not just money, we also need the CP and CD market to see credible people who can provide credible governance, rather than many of these familiar characters who have been a part of our market landscape over the last decade or so. 

From the looks of it, there is enough interest in India that was in the States last week meeting pension funds and endowment funds. There is enough interest overseas for that sort of money to come into our country. In the next six months we will see plenty of ownership changes, fresh money and fresh governance. That should lead to the beginnings of a recovery. I reckon Shakti Das will keep liquidity plentiful in the system, the 10-year bond yield goes down. That is probably the beginnings of the revival in our financial system.


Give me a list of your classic compounders. We know Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, TCS. Anything else which you have added that according to you has the potential to be an earnings compounder?We have not discussed one company in as much detail in public before. But since you are prompting me, I will take the opportunity to mention Dr Lal Path Labs. Whatever we said about the economic downturn and the auto downturn, people in our country will continue needing Path lab tests as they are essential in life. In northern and eastern India, Dr Lal Path Labs is the largest player. Westward, Metropolis gives Dr Lal a run for its money. But in northern and eastern India -- the largest markets in the country -- DLPL is the dominant player. Its track record over the last six-eight years of growing the business, with ROCs approaching 30-35% and earnings compounding north of 25%, has been quite spectacular. In a sector where the informal-to-formal shift is already happening, the neighbourhood path lab is gradually getting crushed and Dr Lal Path Lab has a spectacular ability to compound the businesses without needing fresh infusions of capital. 

I do not think the stock has done that much since the IPO a couple of years back, so you cannot give the standard argument of that being expensive, etc. But I do not think is as applicable here. We have been buying it steadily over the last year or so and we remain biased to this day. We have it in our client’s portfolios and I own it myself.


 I know you are looking at it from a long-term perspective, but give me a sense of what we can anticipate in six months or a year? Are we going to see more pain? When do you see things turning around or is it too soon to tell? We are all human beings and we tend to exaggerate the current difficulties or opportunities and extrapolate them. There is a good chance that a year hence when we are talking on your show, we will not even be thinking about the NBFC and HFC crisis. We will be focussing on the opportunities ahead. It is worth putting the current crisis in perspective and not get too carried away or obsess over it. 

Instead focus on the fact that this country has grown for the last 20 years and will grow for the next 20. There have been great compounders who have generated 10x in the last 10 years, 100x in the last 20 years, and they will carry on doing so. If we just pullback from the day-to-day drama around the NBFC, HFC and private sector bank crisis and focus on the longer-term opportunity, we will all be better for it. I know it is hard to do. We all get gripped by the day-to-day drama, so I think a year hence we will be in that position where we can look back at 2018 and 2019 and say 'Well thank God, we cleansed out the worst of the excesses in the financial sector'. 

The way the financial services sector fell in the stock market from 40% to so near the 30% mark, and sectors like IT and pharma, which have historically shown great compounding, have perhaps gained some weight. We talked about TCS before and in pharma we like Divi’s Lab -- we have it in some of our clients portfolio. If you look at these stocks, they did not ride away over the last two-three years. I know TCS had a decent front, but Divi’s has had an uneven run and focussed on the long term. This country has generated wealth in the stock market before and it will do so again. Do not get too fussy about the current crisis.


The premise with which markets have worked in the past is that a promoter pledge is bad news. But I see it as a large source of capital for promoters where they can use the current business to raise capital to expand and grow other businesses. As more promoters are deciding to deleverage their balance sheets and reduce their pledges, the risk-taking capability at the promoter level is reducing. I do not know if this is good news or bad news!I am not so sure that promoters are doing this voluntarily. I reckon there is a great deal of caution on the lender's part in this whole loan-against-shares business, where you extend credit as a lender and the promoter puts sub shares as collateral. I think that industry is under pressure. You have mentioned some the more infamous cases that have taken place in the loan-against-shares industry. I would turn it on its head. What I was very intrigued by is that promoter-buyback activity is increasing and some of the counters where the buyback activity is increasing are high-quality companies. It is quite interesting to see that promoters themselves are aggressively buying back. I remember the last time this happened was in 2011-2012. 

You could argue that the rally began in 2013 August-September when the market sensed that the Modi victory was around the corner. The fact that promoter buying has increased is very interesting. I would turn it on its head and say rather than looking at the pledges reducing,it is better to focus on promoter buying activity which seems to be on the rise."

29,2019-07-23,Asian Paints,"Increasing uncertainty over recovery in demand has raised questions of an imminent slowdown. In such a situation, stability of a portfolio is more important than supernormal returns. Because in times of a slowdown volatility is minimal which indicates low expectations in markets. This means that in present market conditions stable returns would be a new ‘normal.’ This justifies investments in large-cap schemes, which fulfil this criterion.

For those investors who are extremely conservative and are more concerned about their principal investments, Mirae Asset Large Cap is a clear winner. The scheme’s fund managers Neelesh Surana, Harshad Borawake and Gaurav Misra have shown unwavering commitment to the fund house’s investment philosophy. There are three core principles to this philosophy. First, businesses, which are scalable and promise good returns on capital employed. Second, management, which has good capital efficiency and high cash generation. Third, valuation of the company.

These three core principles have ensured that the scheme has been ahead not only of its benchmark index but also its peers in terms of returns. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 13% and 13.3% returns, respectively, while its peers have given an average return of 11.3% and 9.6% in the same period, respectively.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers have shown high interest in private sector banks and in companies which are temporarily going through bad times but have sound and time-tested business and financial performance.

28,2019-07-23,Asian Paints,"The pledging of shares by promoters of NSE companies dropped to a six-year low in June following increased regulatory scrutiny and the negative sentiment attached to this by investors. Promoters of about 75 large and midcap companies including Sterlite Technologies, Adani Ports, GMR Infra, Emami, Indiabulls Housing, Indiabulls Real Estate and Jubilant FoodWorks redeemed pledged shares in June amid liquidity stress and a drop in stock prices.

“Given recent developments, both promoters and lenders are turning averse to share pledging,” said Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database Group. “Investors too are looking negatively at companies with high share pledge levels.”

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) last month said detailed reasons will have to be provided for pledging more than 20 per cent of the share capital or 50 per cent of the promoter holding. There’s also a closer watch on mutual funds’ exposure to loan against share (LAS) schemes. The percentage of pledged promoter holdings in NSE companies fell to a six-year low of 10.2 per cent at the end of June, according to Prime Database.



Seven companies — Sterlite Technologies, Mangalam Drugs & Organics, Himatsingka Seide, Indiabulls Real Estate, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Byke Hospitality and Cigniti Technologies — slashed pledged shares to zero in June.

Anil Agarwal-led Sterlite Technologies redeemed pledges worth Rs 3,400 crore last month. Indiabulls Housing and Emami redeemed pledges worth Rs 760 crore and Rs 610 crore, respectively, in June.

Investors look askance at high pledge levels as a downturn in prices can lead to these being invoked, possibly leading to a change in management, said experts.

In value terms, promoters’ share pledging declined by 7.18 per cent to Rs 1.95 lakh crore on June 30 compared with Rs 2.09 lakh crore on May 31, according to Prime Database. As a percentage of total market capitalisation of all NSE listed companies, pledged promoter shares dropped from 1.40 per cent in May to 1.33 per cent in June.

“After a few instances of chaos where promoters pledged their shares to take debt in unlisted companies to fund other businesses, mutual funds have forced promoters to discontinue these structures, which is one of the reasons for reduction in pledge of shares,” said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, chairman, Inditrade Capital.

Following a slide in the shares of Essel Group companies earlier this year, mutual funds that had given loans against shares came to a standstill agreement with the promoters. Under this, the funds wouldn’t sell the shares even though they had fallen below the agreed threshold, in order to keep the units viable and allow the group to repay loans by selling assets. Sebi subsequently expressed its displeasure at such standstill agreements. Shares of several companies with high promoter pledges witnessed a sharp selloff after the Zee Group crisis.

Max Financial Services, Ajanta Pharma, JSW Energy, Manappuram Finance, Adani Power, GMR Infrastructure, Reliance Capital and Asian Paints are some other companies that reduced pledges in June.

As many as 28 companies had the entire promoter holding pledged as of June 30. They included Gammon Infrastructure, IVRCL, McDowell Holdings, MSP Steel & Power, Raj Rayon Industries, Reliance Naval & Engineering and Rohit Ferro-Tech."

37,2019-07-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices started off on a firm note on Wednesday, tracking firm cues from the global markets, but concerns surrounding massive FII outflows, rising crude prices and earnings weighed on domestic market.

Meanwhile, IMF cut India’s growth estimates by 0.3 per cent to 7 per cent for 2019 and to 7.2 per cent for 2020, saying its GDP will grow slower on weaker-than expected outlook for domestic demand.

The volatility also remained high ahead of the July futures and options expiry on Thursday. India VIX spiked 4 per cent. 

At around 9.35 am, BSE Sensex traded 120 points or 0.31 per cent lower at 37,864 while its NSE counterpart Nifty 
slipped below the 11,300 mark to trade at 11,286, down 45 points or 0.39 per cent.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 2,608 crore on Tuesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 2,625 crore, data suggests. 

Oil prices rose, extending gains after an industry group reported a much bigger-than-expected drop in US inventories. Brent crude futures rose 24 cents, or 0.4%, to $64.07 a barrel, while WTI futures gained 22 cents. 

The rupee on Wednesday opened 15 paise down at 69.09 against the US dollar due to stronger greenback against major currencies and sustained foreign fund outflows. “Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 68.65 and 69.20,” brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market participants would keep a close eye on stocks such of Asian Paints, Jubilant Foodworks, ICICI Prudential, Canara Bank, Bharti Infratel, Oberoi Realty and Shriram Transport, Karur Vysya, IDFC First Bank, Monsanto India, Quess Corp and Syndicate Bank, which are among entities which will announce June quarter results today. 

HDFC Bank gained nearly 2 per cent to emerge as the best performing Sensex stock. Yes Bank, Power Grid, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank and Asian Paints were other gainers up over one per cent. 

Vedanta was the top loser, shedding 2 per cent, after reports that machinery worth Rs 2,250 crore in its Sterlite Copper plant is rotting. Maruti, M&M, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and Bharti Airtel were other losers shedding upto two per cent.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap shed 0.88 per cent and 0.40 per cent respectively.

On the sectoral front, all sectors declined and traded in the red zone. Oil & gas were the biggest loser, down 1.91 per cent, led by heavyweights such as BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum."
38,2019-07-24,Asian Paints,"The times are tough and he would rather watch and wait it out in media, NBFC and auto space, says Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The Zee deal is in its final lap. We do not know what the final contour would be. But what we understand is that in the next 8-10 days, something is happening in Zee in terms of stake sale. What will this do to the stock price?The deal valuations and the deal contours are going to be the catalyst for the stock. That is clearly how the Street is going to play that. The core numbers were quite okay because ad revenues growth was expected to be muted because of the new tariff order. The surprising element obviously was the subscription growth that has probably come through at this point of time and margin performance. From financial performance perspective, the stock is right there on the top when you talk about the media space. 

But when you are talking about the expected valuations of the deal, that is going to be the biggest catalyst. You probably need to wait it out for the next few days. 


What is your view on Shriram Transport Finance?Looking at the auto slowdown, the second line impact was going to come on Shriram Transport. But when you look at the granularity in terms of asset quality, the stage 3 gross NPAs at 7.4%, net NPAs at 5.7% have shown an increase. Also, because of the increase in asset quality pressures, the provision has gone up substantially to Rs 6-10 crore. 

This impacts the bottom line substantially for company which is probably in the space of auto and tractor financing. We have also seen tight conditions. It is going to be a very difficult task in terms of having that run rate in historical time periods when they used to clock huge volume growth related to the industry. Again, that reflected very positively on earnings as well. The times are tough. I would rather watch and wait it out. I am being very selective in NBFC space. 


Earnings have been pretty much in line or somewhat mixed in some cases because of the impact of the slowdown. Even when it comes to some of these names like Asian Paints and Jubilant, I am not sure if any cheer was to be expected, even if they do maintain their guidance.If you look at the historic world cup trends, the SSS (same-store sales) growth spurt during the World Cup. There might be an element of surprise when the SSS growth comes for this quarter. But whether they will be able to maintain that run rate is the critical question.


Are you buyer in autos or are you sitting on the sidelines now?Basically on the sidelines because what you probably seeing right now is a very transient phase for the industry as a whole. The volumes are down. The industry has gone through a lot of pain over the past two to three quarters but a return to genuine demand is still a couple of quarters away. We are still having issues in terms of the grappling of interest rates related to buying autos in terms of financing as well. There has been an inventory buildup in the system. There have been production cuts happen and that is an obvious sign of demand contraction. 

As for two-wheelers, it all depends on how the monsoons are expected to be fair and the kharif output and the realisations thereof will largely impact the growth for a lot of these two-wheelers. The transition to BS-VI, all the issues related to that, in terms of cost increases can have an impact on volume as well. So, I am waiting on the sidelines. 


Among banks, yesterday we saw SBI seeing a very strong selloff coming in. Is the mood worsening when it comes to even the financials in the short term, outside of those few names that continue to stand out.I would say the marquee names. A few banks have taken a hit. The expectations for banks in general is pretty elevated. Among better run banks, the expectation on the Street is that they will deliver on all parameters. But when you look at the disbursement growth, if you look at the marquee names like HDFC Bank or Kotak Bank, the slowdown is very evident in terms of loan disbursals. 

But compared to the others, all the other parameters that you look at -- the asset quality perspective and their capital adequacy tier I ratios are extremely strong. Liquidity has come back into the system. It is a matter of time if you probably assume demand coming back over the next few quarters these guys will outperform because they have already got the catalyst and capital in place to overrun the other banks at play. 

So the premiums are justified to a certain extent because the expectations are that they will be better off than the other banks at this point of time. Holding on to quality names in the banking space, especially the larger private banks, does make sense.


Which is one company where the management commentary is good and markets are not reacting to the positive commentary?It is very difficult to point out at this point of time but within the largecaps, most of the stocks have delivered.

Within the midcap universe, on a few of the midcap private banks like Federal Bank, I have been optimistic for a length of time. But the numbers and the way the management commentary has panned out, makes me think they have been very optimistic in terms of the large recognition that has already happened on the balance sheet. 

Their SME/MSME books are under some sort of stress but again the recognition that happened on that front is largely reflected through the credit costs and the advances growth should be quite reasonable because when you are looking at the huge market they need to cater to, a lot of NBFCs have vacated the space. Federal Bank and a few of the gold financing companies as well can have an upper hand but the parameters are set to improve and the adjusted book at the current levels probably looks very attractive as well. So, Federal Bank is something that I will continue to like in that space."

42,2019-07-24,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty ended with losses on Wednesday as selloff continued on D-Street for the fifth session making it the longest losing streak in over two months. The markets were dragged by auto, metal, energy, banking and pharma stocks as IMF's cut of India's growth outlook dampened sentiments.

The IMF on Tuesday projected a slower growth rate for India with a downward revision of 0.3 per cent for both 2019 and 2020 saying its GDP will now grow respectively at the rate of 7 and 7.2 per cent, reflecting a weaker than expected outlook for domestic demand.

Analysts said that concerns over an economic slowdown, weak corporate earnings and IMF's downward revision of India's economic outlook weighed on the domestic market. 

Heavy foreign fund outflow and weak monsoon were also hurting investor sentiment, analysts added. IMD had recently said that deficient rainfall was expected over half of India this season.

Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak Securities said, ""Nifty broke its recent bottom of 11460 and has been under pressure since then. On the downside trend support is seen at 11000-11100 levels; unless a strong reversal is seen there remains a chance of the same being tested. We expect volatility to remain high in the near term and the index to stage a strong recovery with support of 11000 levels. Midcap indices have been under pressure and currently trade near critical support levels; any upside momentum would indicate possibility of a strong reversal in the space.""

Asian Paints was among the top gainers in the Sensex pack gaining 3.42 per cent on BSE after the company said its consolidated net profit after minority interest jumped 17.7 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 655 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 compared with Rs 556.85 crore in the same quarter last year. The number beat ET Now's poll estimate of Rs 547 crore profit. 

Investors are now keeping a close watch on Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, who are scheduled to announce their June quarter results tomorrow, for further cues. Analysts expect volatility to persist in the coming sessions, as the markets are expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings season.

On the global front, Asian shares closed higher on prospects of fresh Sino-US trade talks. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.1 per cent and Chinese blue chips climbed 0.8 per cent. 

BSE Sensex closed 135.09 points or 0.36 per cent lower at 37,847.65 while NSE Nifty ended at 11,271.30, down 59.75 points or 0.53 per cent.

48,2019-07-25,Asian Paints,"The next two quarters you should have a hunting list and just buy good businesses whenever there is a fall in the stock., says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The earnings season was kicked off by IT with a bang, particularly on TCS, but midway through, we see That some of the mid-tier banks for are seeing a little bit of pressure. Will pain persist for another couple of quarters? What is your takeaway from the earnings?The pain would probably last for a couple of quarters more. Why I say that is because the earnings were not as bad as people were expecting. It was more or less predicted to be a washout quarter but the numbers did not disappoint the Street though the commentaries are surely disappointing the street. 

Largecap as well as the mid-tier banks have all been talking about a demand slowdown -- right from HDFC Bank to even RBL Bank. The SME sector is slowing down, the problem of credit which has struck the economy since the last seven, eight months, all have been deterrents for the economy and market. Plus, in consumer names, Dabur numbers were excellent, A 9.7% volume growth is an aberration in this type of an environment.

But if you listen to the commentary of this management. there was not much optimism for the next couple of quarters. So yes, there can probably be pain. If you ask me whether it is a blue sky scenario, no. But is it an opportunity in adversity? The answer is yes. The next two quarters you should have a hunting list and just buy good businesses whenever there is a fall in the stock. 


We are expecting some amount of a decline in volumes this time. Even though cement has been looked at favourably lately, in terms of earnings we are expecting to see revenues as well as PAT a little lower for Ambuja. What are your expectations and what is your view on the cement names right now?Clearly we have been quite positive on cement names. A few like UltraTech or Shree Cement has been bought into the portfolios in the last six, nine months. And yes, what a run it has had during this trying times. 

Clearly the budget which laid down a little bit of impetus on infrastructure plus housing for all -- is one segment. Low-cost housing or housing for all which still keeps on growing in an overall pessimistic segment. 

Our sense is that cement demand, cement realisations as well as capacity utilisations in the last couple of quarters has been trending upwards. So, cement probably merits a place in the portfolio. It looks more a cyclical story but for the next three years, it looks to be a structural story. We would probably consider cement with the more frontline names rather than the midcap names.


What about Yes Bank? On the back of the fund raising exercise that they are currently undergoing, there are still some concerns that given the state of the bank, the valuations will completely go out of the window and it might actually be difficult. On the other hand you got news coming in that some of these PE funds are just lining up to be part of that QIP. Would you still buy into a Yes Bank in case they are able to raise those funds or would you be completely averse to the story?We have been avoiding accidents at this point of time because as I said, quality has commended some premium in the market. I would not be able to comment on individual stocks but the sense here is that when your largecaps or market leaders also start to fall, buy the market leaders. If these stocks are too expensive, buy the next big one. If you feel that Asian Paints is costly, and that there are companies like Berger Paints, go in for Asian Paints and Berger Paints. We tend to remain with a couple of more market leaders rather than going into the space where we feel there will be difficulties in terms of not only losing market share but also losing business while you get into your balance sheet issues and sort those out.


Just when the sector dynamics were beginning to look up for telecom and most of these companies were beginning to deleverage, and the Street was also turning pretty bullish in the prospects of Bharti Airtel. Now comes this dampener in the form of big fines on Airtel and Idea Vodafone.We remain very cautious on this sector. In fact, we have not bought this sector in the last two-three years. My sense is though the debt equation was getting lower and the market was divided into three companies which are ruling the roost, it is still a crowded trade. Lots of people buy it as a contra trade but we would still avoid it. As you said, there are lots of such issues which can creep up and whenever the auction comes up, debt issues will come to the fore. Avoid this sector. There is so much of fall happening in the broader markets. The best stocks have started falling in the last 8-10 days. There are better opportunities to be in this type of businesses rather than being in the telecom sector at this point. 


Canara Bank and quite a few other banks have come out with numbers. Today it is the turn of Bank of Baroda. We can’t compare the numbers to last year’s because of the overall merger, but what is it that you are expecting?The earnings growth of a lot of these banks would be fair and watched into. In the last couple of quarters, there have been a lot of recoveries. The NPA has come down for a lot of PSU and corporate banks as well and the mettle of taking the earnings growth of Nifty or Sensex of the benchmark indices has been more or less done by all these banks. 

I think there would be a recovery at least in terms of sentiment for a lot of these banks. Probably PSU banks would not be in the hunting list but there seems to be enough evidence that with interest rates heading downwards, with inflation also trending down and probably a little bit of a boost or sentiment booster from the government or from the RBI would go a long way in giving the banks that extra zig. 
I can say that the BFSI sector which has been the darling of the market before the big fall, could continue and banks again probably could lead the rise whenever it starts."
46,2019-07-25,Asian Paints,"In the current environment it is difficult to expect very aggressive infusion of funds in PSU banks by the government, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

In an interview with The Economic Times, Aditya Puri seems to be saying that the worst of the NBFC crisis over and the doom is over,we can only move up from here. Do you agree?In the selloff that we have seen in the last couple of months, most of the sector and stocks are affected and yes we have been debating about the intensity of the slowdown and whether the worst is over or not. But looking at the ground level situation, it would be a bit early to decide that the worst is over because in the current environment there is a confidence issue and at the ground level, businesses are not looking up. People are in a cost control mode and it may so happen that the stock prices bottom out before the actual businesses bottom out. 

As far as NBFC sector is concerned, I do not think the worst is over because there are a lot of NBFCs where the provisioning has not been 80-90% and only over the next couple of quarters, will we get some clarity on that. I would stay cautious on NBFCs.


What are you making of these earnings in paints businesses and what is your view on Asian Paints in that light because even though some brokerages are still citing weak outlook, perhaps the worst is over Asian Paints as it has been steadily performing?If we look at the quarterly numbers, a very few companies have really surprised in terms of volume growth and overall outlook because even in companies in the FMCG or consumer discretionary space, we have hardly seen better than expected growth and the management outlook remains quite muted. So Asian Paints definitely stands out though the last two or three quarters were a bit muted on a YoY basis. On a muted base, the performance may look good but a 16% volume growth in the current environment is commendable by any standards. 

Also, on the EBITDA front, there has been a fair degree of margin stability and the company has been consistently gaining market share. So, there are very few companies which are displaying this. I do not think there is a broad trend and one should be a little selective and cautious rather than feeling that Asian Paints has reported good numbers, so there is no slowdown. I definitely think that one needs to be selective.


How are you looking at expectations for Tata Motors in trade? We were discussing it just a short while ago saying that be it the JLR kind of concerns that we have seen in China or across the globe, it is definitely been a slowdown. We are not going in with very high expectations. Just yesterday there was a second downgrade coming in for Tata Motors. Is that already baked into the price or is there going to be some further deceleration in the stock?Tata Motors has been a laggard and given the slowdown that we have witnessed in the global markets for the JLR products, even the automotive sector overall is not really showing any kind of an improvement. Plus JLR has its own set of issues -- be it US markets or UK or China for that matter. The expectations will continue to be muted for Tata Motors and in the current environment, one should not really take an aggressive positioning just because the stock has corrected. It may remain thus for an extended period of time. We have a neutral view on Tata Motors given the uncertainty around growth, currency risk and the fact that even the domestic market the CV cycle part because of the slowdown that we are seeing is going to take a while to reflect in the numbers. Definitely stay away from Tata Motors at this point of time. 


The Bajaj Finance management commentary on what they see ahead is going to be critical. What would you be looking out for?The numbers are going to be good as you said. We are looking at about 45%-46% kind of a growth but more importantly, given the high expectations that the market is working with in terms of the AUM growth and in terms of the overall NII and profitability growth. Is there any kind of an indication from the management about a lower growth given the slowdown and given the fact that the digital component of the overall business Bajaj Finance is facing some competition where HDFC Bank and some of the other banks are gaining market share. 

In the wake of that, market would be watching whether we are looking at a lower growth than 40% or 35%. We have been liking Bajaj Finance. It has corrected and may be a part of the upside that we had seen in earlier was because HDB Financials was to be listed and there is going to be some sort of a comparison between Bajaj Finance and HDB Financials. A part of this correction is also because of that but I definitely think that a serious correction in Bajaj Finance in the range of Rs 3,000 or thereabouts would present a great opportunity for investors.


Some of the PSU banks have continued to see pressure. We have not necessarily seen an alleviation of those NPA woes yet, even if they have stalled for the moment?We have seen decent bounce back in PSUs, particularly in State Bank of India. But if you look at the overall scenario, from a lower base after providing for a lot of NPLs, we are not really seeing any positive traction when it comes to pre-provisioning profits or the loan growth.

In the current environment to expect that there is going to be a very aggressive infusion by the government is also looking quite difficult. so in that environment we are not very positive on BoB. We are looking at a 15% kind of a growth in the net interest income but a sharp cut in the net profit on a quarter on quarter basis from 52 odd crore to almost about 8.8 crore. So overall numbers wise things are not looking too great so we are not recommending buying into the PSU banks per se. State Bank of India has remained quite good so selectively one can definitely look at buying into it but otherwise stay away from the PSU stocks."
47,2019-07-25,Asian Paints,"Global as well as domestic brokerage firms maintained their bullish view on Asian Paints after the company reported a 17.90 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 672.09 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2019.

It had posted a net profit of Rs 570.02 crore in the year-ago period.

Morgan Stanley maintained ‘Overweight’ on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,600 per share, while Macquarie retained ‘Outperform’ call with a target price of Rs 1,530.

Macquarie said that the management has indicated channel stocking led by innovative schemes. The foreign financial firm marginally raised EPS by 4.5-5 per cent for FY20-21 and expects Asian Paints to remain aggressive in channel push. 

The scrip was, however, trading 0.45 per cent down at Rs 1,476 at around 9.52 am (IST), while the benchmark BSE Sensex was up 286 points, or 0.75 per cent, at 38,133 at around the same time.

According to Edelweiss Securities, Asian Paints (APL) reported higher-than-expected financial results for Q1FY20. A double-digit volume spurt too came in ahead of estimates in spite of the high base of 12.5 per cent YoY. 

The brokerage house maintains ‘Buy’ on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,649, indicating an upside of nearly 12 per cent from current market price.

“We believe the product mix has slightly improved QoQ—a healthy sign. Benign raw material costs led to gross margin expansion of 198bps QoQ. Cost control managed to offset the initial factory set-up costs, leading to comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 136bps YoY. We continue to estimate double-digit volume growth in the decorative business as well as margin expansion (operating leverage benefit in new plants). Capacity expansion of 600,000KL bodes well for revenue growth,” Edelweiss said in a report."

49,2019-07-27,Asian Paints,"While the market is volatile, there are pockets of opportunities in the mid and smallcap segments. This would be the time to invest in good quality companies with a two to three year time horizon, says Shibani Sircar Kurian, SVP & Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


We have kick-started the first quarter earnings season and while a lot of the market direction was received from the earnings cues, the market once again shifted the focus to the budget announcements over the surcharge for FPIs, the auto slowdown, the entire FII sell off as well. July has seen a lot of FII selling off. Do you believe that would gain prominence as opposed to quarterly numbers and fundamentals?The budget caused its own volatility but now the market has clearly shifted focus to earnings. From an earnings perspective, it is a slightly challenging quarter, given the kind of growth and demand outlook that we are facing at this point in time. 

If you look at it for a year as a whole, we still believe that we are fairly on track to report mid teens earnings growth and therefore coming off almost three years of no earnings growth. This would possibly be a year where you start seeing better earnings growth trajectory. 

However, it has been a mixed bag across sectors. There have been some good ones, some bad ones and some earnings downgrades as well, but clearly the market is focused now on fundamentals and how things move from here on. The earnings growth and the earnings trajectory and the numbers to come will play a key role in determining the future course of action that the market really takes from here.


 HDFC Bank has been a very stable company. Quarter after quarter it has given inline set of numbers with very few red flags. Would you believe that is the case in this quarter as well?While I cannot talk specifically on a company, I can give you our understanding of how the consumer retail lending space and how the private sector banking space is really panning out. 

While there has been some moderation in terms of loan growth for the banks that have really reported numbers, the market share shift from the public sector to the private sector or even from the NBFCs to the private sector is continuing. The banks which have reported numbers are clearly growing at a pace faster than the industry and so that is one. 

Secondly, while management commentary has flagged off some risks specifically on the consumer lending side or the unsecured consumer book, the agri book clearly has not led to a significant rise in terms of credit cost as of now. What we are seeing is precautionary in terms of the management commentary and therefore may be higher provisioning in some cases. Having said that, the private sector banking pack as a whole shows clear opportunities here because of two things -- the shift in market share between loans and deposits from one segment of the banking space to the private sector banking space is still continuing. 

These banks are well capitalised and therefore in this kind of a scenario where there are concerns on liquidity, capital is the key and clearly from a balance sheet perspective, these banks are still reporting return ratios which are fairly healthy and these return ratios have not really been impaired in a big way. 

Also one pocket of opportunity that we see here is that a lot of the private sector corporate banks went through a lot of stress over the last three-four years, given their exposure to some of the large corporates. 

However, over the last few years, there have been changes in terms of risk management practices and our belief is as you go into the second half of the year, you will see credit cost starting to normalise and that leading to improvement in terms of their return ratios. While there are certain pockets of concern on the banking and financial services space, specifically on the NBFC and the HFC side, there are still pockets of opportunity within that sector.


United Spirits and Asian Paints results are out. For all means and purposes, these could be considered consumer facing B2C companies. Do you believe it is not done as badly as one would have feared?I would tend to agree with you that while volume growth has come off, but clearly we have been seeing very high volume growth and in this kind of an environment, it was expected that there would be some deceleration and that has really panned out. 

Plus the margins have been positive. Clearly, there is some pricing power and costs have been under control. All of this has led to a better margin profile. The issue with the consumption space is a two-fold one. Commentary on demand still continues to remain slightly muted and valuations are stretched. 

We are approaching the consumption sector in a stock-specific manner. Clearly, there are opportunities in this space where we are see growth continuing as well as valuations being reasonable. Some of these names are clearly featuring in our portfolios but it is a little stock specific, given the fact that valuations are stretched in pockets.


Do you believe that it is the China factor that is the niggling factor for Tata Motors?Again without getting into stock-specific names, our view on auto has been cautious now for a while. We believe there are three-four factors which are contributing to the downturn. One of course is there has been a demand slowdown. Two, There is a rural slowdown given the fact that rural income have not been growing. 

Thirdly the cost of ownership of vehicle has clearly gone up and regulatory changes are resulting in that cost going up further. 

Fourthly, there is this issue of shared mobility and how much impact that is having on demand. The key question is to discuss whether this is a cyclical slowdown in autos that we are seeing or whether this is a slightly more structural slowdown. The answer is still very unclear and as a result of which we are still watching out and are cautious on the segment. 

A few key leading indicators that we will keep in mind while we are approaching the segment is a)to see how discounts are panning out and if there are signs of discounts coming off which means demand is coming back. 

Secondly, inventory levels in the system are still very high and if that starts to moderate again, then there are indicators that demand is coming back but at this point in time, it does look like we could be in for a few more months of weakness. We are still cautious on the sector.


For investors with a longer term time horizon, which sectors should they look at? What looks good from a fundamental perspective?We find that there is a significant amount of opportunity to buy stocks in the mid and smallcap segments. One has to be selective but since the beginning of 2018 till now, the correction in the mid and smallcap space has been very severe and sharp and in fact today the valuations of the midcaps are trading at lower levels than what it was even in 2014. 

As a result, this is possibly an opportune time to look at high quality, high growth midcap stocks with a two to three year kind of a time horizon. However, one has to be very careful when you are doing stock picking clearly look at companies which are growing, which are gaining market share which have cleaned balance sheet and low leverage and which are able to generate high return ratios. However, there are a lot of opportunities. Some of the sectors that we like one is on the capital goods side. Capacity utilisation levels have been inching up and now are close to long- term averages. 

If you look at data in terms of order flows as well, there has been a pick up. While this is not private sector greenfield capex, but clearly capacity augmentation has resulted in order flow improvement which is resulting in some positive up move specifically with the capital goods space so that is one segment that we are watching out for. 

A proxy for capital goods is cement where clearly realisations have been positive. We need to see whether this trend of improved pricing power stays or the kind of price decline that we have seen in the recent past continues or whether the cement companies get back on track and the volume growth also holds up. But cement is a space that we like. 

On the financial side we are positive on the private sector corporate banks where there are clear signs of normalisation of return ratios as well as credit cost which will lead to better profitability and another segment that we like is on the life insurance space where we have clearly seen a trend where there is improvement in terms of growth of new business as well as margins because of the changing mix of the product profile where companies moving more towards protection and annuities which are higher margin products resulting in better profitability. 

While the market is volatile, clearly there are pockets of opportunities specifically in the mid and the smallcap segments. If one is careful and buys good quality companies this would be the time to invest with a two to three year kind of a time horizon."
50,2019-07-29,Asian Paints,"We would be more bullish on slightly larger cap companies like HCL Tech, Infosys, Mphasis as well. The scale and size would be a kind of a differentiator in this particular kind of an environment, says Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


ICICI Bank results were out on Saturday. Other than that, we have been tracking a whole host of names in the broader market that has seen some buying interest like Torrent Pharma, SPARC, IGL. What is going to be on your radar?Broadly ICICI Bank numbers, on the asset quality side, are well in line with expectations. Going forward, ICICI should continue to do pretty well in terms of what could be the upside in the stock. We believe it could go to a level of around Rs 490 odd from current level, giving a 1.8 time price to book to the core earnings as well as adding up subsidy valuations at a 20% discount. 

However, one concern that one sees in their result is that a lot of delinquencies seems to be happening in the Kisan Credit Card. The retail bad loans number has gone from 1.1% to 2%. Looking at the numbers that have come from Maruti or Bajaj Auto or even Havells, it seems to me that the rural seems to be slowing down quite drastically over the last couple of months. That is a big worry of concern with regard to slowdown going forward. 

As far as the broader market is concerned, clearly stocks like Torrent Pharma which you talked about are quite decent, despite some one-off challenges that the company has faced recently. We continue to remain quite positive on that and still believe that from here, you can get a 20% upside in case of Torrent Pharma because if you look at how they have done the Unichem acquisition or grown their domestic business, clearly there is a significant growth opportunity, especially in FY21 for the company.


What is your view on midcap IT companies? Could rising cost as well the slowdown in BFSI be a point of concern for some of the midcap IT companies?Yes, absolutely. Be it Cyient or Persistent, clearly there have been challenges in terms of how growth is going to come going forward. The annual contract value for the overall industry for this year is expected to come down to around 5% growth. We would be more bullish on slightly larger cap companies like HCL Tech, Infosys, Mphasis as well. The scale and size would be a kind of a differentiator in this particular kind of an environment. Most of the companies are transforming on a digital side but on the core earnings side, in core portfolios, we clearly see some headwinds for the sector and for that reason it make sense to be with some of these companies where growth continues to be quite decent.


The Finance Minister has said in an interview with ET that she did not see it as a liquidity crisis as such, but more a problem of lack of lending to legit or correct customers, alluding to the fact that there is a hesitancy to lend. What do you make of some of these comments that came in over the weekend?For sure, if the finance minister does meet these FPIs and gives a way out for them because changing from a trust to corporate structure is not that easy for all of them. One should remember that some of these guys have multi-country operations and for them to do certain changes just to invest in a particular market, is quite tough to do. 

If there are some changes, I am sure it will be welcomed by the market and what they have said over the weekend should be taken positively. With regard to funding, clearly there is some improvement in the system with regard to NBFCs as well. 

The challenge is that overall, in which market should one invest? Today banks have an issue with regard to CASA. Most of them are dependent on term deposits. The kind of NIM expansion which should have happened for banks is clearly not happening and the overall system where the velocity of money seems to have drastically come down because there is hardly any movement of money from one instrument to another. 

Overall if the finance minister does do that change and we do see significant cutting of interest rates going forward because our real interest rates are significantly higher than what the world is at. We are at more than 40% negative interest rate globally. If there is that change in terms of monetary policy as well as financial policy with regard to lower taxation, market recovery is bound to happen because there is money sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested. It just needs some kind of sentimental booster from the market.


Asian Paints saw some great movement last week on the back of continued delivery on earnings. What is your view on Asian Paints currently?Asian Paints was one of the few companies which clearly is telling the markets that despite the kind of slowdown that most of the other guys are talking, they have not witnessed any major slowdown in terms of volume growth. Going forward, we believe Asian Paints will continue to get these premium valuations. If you want to look at some other stock which is slightly less expensive than Asian Paints, Berger Paint could be an interesting buy. 

The earnings there is expected to grow at around 18% CAGR, at a multiple of around 44 or so, which from a traditional mindset is obviously high but considering that it is better to look at margin of safety in the market at this particular juncture, Berger Paint should also do well and overall the commodity price is also a quite benign for the sector. We are quite hopeful for the paint sector, especially companies like Berger Paints and Asian Paints."
51,2019-07-29,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Friday’s gains in equities proved to be shortlived as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty on Monday resumed their downward movement, falling up to 0.84 per cent.

Weak Asian markets combined with continuous outflow of foreign funds weighed on investor sentiment. “The market started the week on the feeble note and lost nearly one per cent. Weak Asian markets combined with continuous outflow of the foreign funds are weighing on sentiment. The market is largely focusing on weak domestic sentiment while global cues remain mixed,” said Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking.

Investors stayed away from riskier equities, awaiting anxiously for the Fed outcome on Wednesday. Uninspiring earnings and lack of positive triggers continued to keep risk appetite low. 

Here is a breakdown of the key highlights of Monday's session. Take a look:


400 stocks plumb 52-week lowsAs many as 405 stocks, including Bajaj Auto, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland and EID Parry (India), plumb 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, Asian Paints, Adhunik Industries, Banas Finance, Kratos Energy & Infrastructure, Mac Hotels and Procter & Gamble Health were among the 26 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


Upper & lower circuitsIndiabulls Integrated Services, Cox & Kings, Unitech, Essar Shipping, 5paisa Capital and SORIL Infra Resources were among the 242 stocks that hit their lower circuits. On the other hand, 118 stocks, including Jubilant Industries, Astec Lifesciences, Mangalam Drugs & Organics, 63 Moons Technologies, Electrotherm (India), HOV Services and Manaksia Steels, hit upper circuits.


Rs 1.36 lakh crore gone in a dayMonday's losses in equities dragged the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,42,45,433.92 crore from Rs 1,43,82,243.21 crore on Friday, making investors poorer by Rs 1.36 lakh crore in a single day!


Above & below 200-DMAsLarsen & Toubro, NTPC, Voltamp Transformers, NIIT Technologies, Mahindra Lifespace Developers, India Cements, Bank of Maharashtra, Adani Transmission and Max Financial Services were among the stocks that witnessed negative breakouts and traded below their 200-DMAs. However, JSW Energy, Grindwell Norto and Jubilant Industries were among those who traded above 200-DMAs.


74 stocks show potential for riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 74 counters on BSE, signalling these stocks may witness gains in the coming sessions. Among those stocks were Suzlon Energy, TCS, Mindtree, GHCL, HCL Technologies, Deepak Fertilisers, Binani Industries and Varun Beverages. On the other hand, Vedanta, HDFC Life Insurance, Power Grid Corporation, Ambuja Cements, Hindustan Unilever and PVR were among the 56 stocks that showed bearish crossovers.


140 stocks now oversold Momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 140 stocks, including Ballarpur Industries, Vodafone Idea, Tejas Networks, RBL Bank, HCC, Marksans Pharma and Tata Elxsi, in the oversold zone on BSE. On the other hand, VR Films & Studios, Goenka Business, Yashraj Containeurs, EIS and Mandhana Industries were among the 18 stocks that entered the overbought zone.


Auto top sectoral loserBSE Auto, with a loss of 3.55 per cent, finished as the top loser among the sectoral indices on BSE after the government proposed to hike registration cost on new vehicles. The index ended with all components in the red, with Tata Motors (down 6.52 per cent), Apollo Tyres (down 6 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 4.99 per cent), Eicher Motors (down 4.81 per cent) and Motherson Sumi Systems (down 4.34 per cent) as the top losers. Maruti's poor Q1 numbers also aggravated a selloff in shares of auto companies which have been grappling to cope with a slump in demand in the wake of liquidity crunch in the financial space, weak monsoon and changes in emission and safety norms. 


Vodafone Idea plunges 27%Shares of Vodafone Idea plunged 26.81 per cent to close the day at Rs 6.77 after weak results for the fiscal first quarter, which prompted analysts to fear that the telco could rapidly be relegated to a regional player if it fails to grow revenue in the coming quarters. 


Maruti shares down 4%Shares of Maruti Suzuki closed 4.26 per cent down at Rs 5,558.05 today. India’s largest carmaker on Friday reported a 27.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit at Rs 1,435.50 crore for June quarter on weak volumes and higher depreciation expenses. While the company’s slump in profit was broadly on the expected lines, projected near-term pressure on volumes and demand has prompted analysts to turn cautious on the stock. 


ICICI Bank climbs 3%Shares of ICICI Bank ended 3.32 per cent higher at Rs 429.30 after the lender’s June quarter earnings impressed investors on Dalal Street. Brokerages say the scrip has potential to rally 25-50 per cent in next one year, as incremental stress at the second-largest private bank moderates with the shrinkage of the pool of low-rated corporate exposure. 


DRL declines ahead of earningsShares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) closed 1.92 per cent down at Rs 2,652.55 ahead of its June quarter numbers. Post the market hours, the company said its consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for the June quarter climbed 45 per cent on year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 662.80 crore compared with Rs 456.10 crore in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, the profit surged 53 per cent."
52,2019-07-30,Asian Paints,"I do not see Sebi planning to put a cap on broker fees in PMS and AIF as a negative because the pricing and the disclosure in some of the products is not necessarily the best in terms of practices. That may be good for the industry, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

We are already grappling with the consistent sell-off from the FPI fraternity right after the budget. Now it seems the regulator may be tightening its noose on PMS as well as AIFs. It appears to be bad news overall for the markets. There does not seem to be any glimmer of hope anywhere in sight?I agree with the first part that there has been relentless selling by the FIIs and FPIs and as a result, we have seen a huge underperformance by the Indian market the whole of the year and more so after the budget. But the fact that the regulator is looking at some kind of norms or the current practices being followed by the participants in the PMS or the other structures which are available in the market, is not necessarily bad news. 

We have seen time and again that for mutual funds and for any other products in the market. It is the job of the regulator to look at the practices and take the feedback and put in place a mechanism which is in the interest of the investors. I do not necessarily see that as a negative because the pricing and the disclosure in some of the products is not necessarily the best in terms of practices. So, that may be good for the industry. I do not think we should read too much negative into it.


Would FIIs still think midcaps are expensive? Back home, everyone is hunting for value and are yet incredibly risk averse. Where would you be looking at in the midcap universe?Some of the small companies in the cement space definitely look interesting because that space is looking pretty good, particularly in terms of pricing and the fact that you will have some kind of an improvement post monsoon in terms of dispatches. 

JK Lakshmi and Ramco Cement are some of the stocks that one can really look at because there is a lot of uncertainty about earnings in many sectors and there are a few sectors like cement or may be some of the private sector banks and may be a couple of consumption names like HUL where the volume growth was about 5% odd in the most challenging environment and of course Asian Paints. 

The companies which are performing in this environment are the ones the investors should bet on versus the companies where the prices have corrected but one is really not sure about the business and where the debt levels are pretty high.


Apart from Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra is also slated to come out with its numbers today, What kind of commentary are you expecting and how have you read into the kind of Q1 report card that we have seen so far from the IT majors?Typically, this is a subdued quarter for the IT companies in general and in Tech Mahindra, we have seen that the guidance which they had given, both for telecom as well as enterprise solution, was not good. They had tweaked the enterprise business part a bit and the sense that we are getting is that in terms of revenue there could be a 1% dip there. Even the margins could dip by about 160 bps. Typically, Tech Mahindra margins have been relatively lower compared to the general IT services industry. So, net-net, in terms of expectations, they are pretty muted.

The only thing that people would be watching out for is whether there is going to be any kind of a clarity or colour in terms of the overall growth in the telecom space that one is really looking at and what kind of margins can one expect on a sustainable basis. Though in terms of valuation, the stock looks pretty attractive but in terms of growth, the performance may remain muted.


How you are approaching the telecom space? Is it Bharti versus Idea or it is an avoid for both?Overall, things are looking quite tough for the incumbent telecom companies as the operating performance has been extremely weak with high debt levels. More importantly, for any capex they need to do -- whether 5G or for the normal -- it is going to be quite tough. We have been liking Bharti for the fact that now that Rel Jio is already there and that entire competitive intensity is likely to come off.

You might see a bit of price stability but that is taking a while. Our sense is that if you have a one or two year kind of view, Bharti appears to be much better in terms of the balance sheet strength and the overall operating performance that they have. Idea definitely we would avoid at this point of time and more importantly if you see the actual performances in terms of call drops, etc, the network issues that are there it is pathetic in terms of servicing. It would take a while for the telecom companies to show up in terms of better investor sentiment.


 The preferred bets within real estate are Mumbai specific plays like Godrej Properties or Oberoi Realty. At a time when you are seeing real estate in doldrums and it seems that the pain is going to last for some more time to come, is this a good time to buy into DLF? They seem to be ahead of the curve when it comes to deleveraging their balance sheet?I agree on the deleveraging part. DLF has taken some steps and given the fact that the commercial side of the business, the lease rentals, have been good and we had some kind of deals where REITs were launched. These are the positives for DLF but given the overall environment that we have in our economy today, though interest rates are falling, the appetite to buy more into real estate is still not there.

For DLF, on the enterprise level and at the company level, the debt is still pretty high. Unless we see some kind of stability in the residential part of the business, it would be hard to make out a case for buying into a stock like DLF. Yes, because of the lower interest rates, if somebody wants to buy some of the real estate players, maybe some of the better ones like Godrej, etc, one can really look at it but overall we would definitely stay away from the sector for a while.


Would there be any concerns you have on the fundamentals of the Grasim stock apart from the fact that we have seen that rub off price drop yesterday.The structure of Grasim is such that, there is UltraTech and more importantly the remainder of the Idea stake. That could become a pain point for Grasim and the rest of their other commodity businesses like sponge iron and a couple of chemical businesses. 

I do not think there is too much of an issue. But because of the holding company nature and the investment that they have in the telecom, there is some kind of an issue going on in terms of the derating. That could have led to a weakness. On an overall basis, Grasim continues to look quite okay because the UltraTech part of the business where they have significant stake is shaping up well and the other businesses are also quite stable. I continue to have a positive bias on Grasim. Yesterday’s selloff could be either technical or with respect to their stake in the Idea I think.


What you are expecting from Axis Bank’s numbers this time around?In terms of the numbers, the loan growth could be in the range of about 15% to 16%. The key moniterables for Axis Bank could be the slippages because last time around the slippages were somewhere in the range of about Rs 3,000 crore on a total watch list of about Rs 9,500-10,000 crore. The sense that we are getting is that the slippages could be somewhere in that range about Rs 2,800-3,500 crore. 

Fillers that we are getting is that the gross NPL in terms of percentage could be a bit higher versus the last quarter at about Rs 5.7-5.8 crore. So there might be a bit of a negative surprise in terms of the slippages and gross NPL. The loan growth part should be okay and there might be a bit of a negative reaction when these numbers are announced by Axis Bank. Within the banking space, ICICI Bank definitely stands out vis-à-vis some of the other banks.


 What about Dr Reddy’s? How do you read into the kind of quarter that the company has delivered and the kind of management commentary that has come about?The numbers appear definitely subdued. The fact that some of their key products have got pushed into 2020 again because of some regulatory issues is not great news. The only positive takeaway could be that the generic business in the US is stabilising and there was a bit of a growth over there but the rest of the markets -- be it India or some of the other markets there -- has not been that great outcome as far as the Dr Reddy is concerned.

It would take time for some of these companies to come out with a stronger set of numbers given the environment that we are into both India and other markets. Within the pharma space, we like Divi’s Lab and Cipla because performance wise, these two companies are better placed.


What do you think about Zee in light of the fact that a deal could be imminent any time now and earnings this time are pretty much intact as well?It remains to be seen what kind of structure they are looking at and what kind of valuation they are going to get for the overall broadcasting part of the business that they have. The quarterly numbers for Zee have been quite good, particularly on the subscription side of it. One would really want to know what kind of overall structure they are looking at because both on the broadcasting and on the digital part of it, some clarity is required in terms of the thought process and plan that they have. 

Also one of the reasons why Zee was under tremendous pressure was that the debt level at the enterprise level was somewhere in the range of about Rs 13,000 odd crore. Post this deal, what kind of repayment are they looking at and what kind of debt level would they be comfortable with in the balance sheet is something that one would be watching out for. We also hear that for some of the group companies where Zee has a stake, there could be some kind of deal involving those also. So, that is something that could bring about some kind of some of parts valuation aspect for Zee. 

Overall, Zee remains quite interesting at this point of time because just a couple of days are left in terms of the announcement that the management made. So, depending upon the deal there might be some action in Zee at this point of time."
53,2019-07-31,Asian Paints,"The underlying economy is still quite strong and the double digit growth rates will come back very soon -- if not in the current quarter, definitely in the next two quarters, says Dilip Piramal, Chairman, VIP Industries. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


You have seen a strong double digit growth for eight quarters. You revenue growth is seeing a little bit of a struggle. What are some of the factors that are putting pressure on growth currently?There is no doubt that the Indian economy has slowed down in the last quarter of 2018-19 and there was an impact on sales. In fact, if I compare our sales growth to many other companies, which have just announced their results, we are doing quite good and that is the response we got from our stock analysts meet yesterday. So we are quite satisfied. We have had a good quarter looking at the circumstances and growth has come down. But the underlying economy is still quite strong and the double digit growth rates will come back very soon -- if not in the current quarter, definitely in the next two quarters. I am quite optimistic.


What is your volume growth at this time and how much is it that you are pencilling in for the future ahead? Can you cross the volume growth that you have been clocking till now and can you maintain those kind of growth levels for FY20?We have had 7% volume growth as against 9% value growth. In the same period last year, we had more than 25% sales and volume growth. I am optimistic but it is very difficult to forecast what has happened because the variances have been quite large, from 25% we have come down to 9%. So let us see.


Analysts say the product mix has been hurting you. Has there been a change there? What is the growth seen in entry level brands versus that seen in higher end products?We had some very severe competition last year in the product mix, especially at the lower level because some of the players had not fully entered that market. Our smaller player, Safari, is mainly in the economy segment but the other players were not there and they had made a strong presence there. So there was intense competition but the product mix is very healthy. 

In fact, we have a terrific product mix because we have four brands from Carlton, Skybags, VIP and Aristocrat and all our brands are doing quite well. In fact, that product mix is our strength. Our new products have been very well received and they have been well priced also. That is why our margins have come back now to last year’s levels. On the whole we are quite satisfied.


What is the scenario on the input cost front? Is there any pressure there on raw material prices? No, not really, because China buying has been very good. China is under great pressure from the US and so we are in a position to negotiate better rates. The rupee is also much stronger as compared to the 73 and 74 rupees a dollar we were looking at about six months ago. Now it has come down to less than Rs 69. So, we have relief on both the rupee dollar rate as well as on the actual buying prices from China. 

Our sourcing both in India and in Bangladesh also is quite good. There is not much pressure from cost at the moment. It was so in October-December last year but things are much better now.


 Could you elaborate a little on that? Have you managed to normalise the excess inventory imported from China and what is your current inventory level?
Our inventory levels are still quite high but we are regulating that and in the next two quarters, we will get back to normal. They had gone up quite substantially in March, when we have our peak inventory because April to June is our largest quarter and this ordering in China has to be done in October and the slowdown came after that, from January. From January to June, the sales were not growing at that 25% rate of growth. Inventories have been a bit high but by December, they should come back to normal levels.


With the increase in competition, has the price hike that you took in Q4 impacted demand? What about your outlook on your market share?There is no increase in competition. There are three big players and our market share is slightly above 50%. 


What can we expect from VIP going forward? What is the outlook for FY20?The main thing is at what rate should we grow because our growth margins are quite high. The higher the rate of growth, the better the impact on the profits. It is very difficult at this time to predict exactly how the rate of growth will be. We have had 9% in the first quarter which is quite good because many leading companies except for Asian Paints, all the results which have been announced, have been around 5%. The automobile industry has had negative growth. In that background, we have done well but it is very difficult to forecast whether we will have 20% growth or 15% or 10%. We just have to wait and see."
54,2019-07-31,Asian Paints,"There has been a capitulation of the market and I am not sure whether this is a factor, but I think psychologically investors are giving up, says
 Ajay Srivastava, CEO, 
Dimensions Corporate. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


We are attributing the downfall to a number of factors, but what do you think is spooking the markets the most?It is a simple equation of when a demand slowdown of this magnitude takes place and still there are negative policy disruptions like the EV policy, then obviously hope is lost, firstly because of the demand slowdown. Second is an active policy framework to address it. When the market finds that instead of a positive framework, it is negative, then you give up hope. What basically is happening now is people are giving up hope. So far we were trading with hope of lots of things going to happen and so on. But we have reached a point where people are just giving up. It is a capitulation of the market and I am not sure whether this is a factor, but I think psychologically investors are giving up. 


Each company we talk to, seems clueless about when and how this economic recovery is going to play out. Do you think it is going to be pretty much the state of the market as well? Is the pain going to be longer lasting and are we not going to stop sub-11K mark for the Nifty?Actually that is why I said that in the policy framework we see today, we do not understand that instead of a supportive policy, it is all negative. Look at the NHB guidelines of the subvention schemes that came out of the blue in a real estate market which is crying for attention. I do not blame the industrialists. They do not know what is happening. But I can tell you one thing. Investors know what is happening and they are voting with their demat statements. They are voting with their sells right now. They are voting with the short. Investors are very clear. 

Even industrialists are not that clear because perhaps they want to be polite and cannot be negative about their companies too much. But the fact remains that we are looking for a much-much bigger slowdown and impact that will ultimately come on to the banks. The bank lending and recovering will very soon become a problem area. If you cannot sell, how do you pay the loan? As simple as that. There needs to be a very strong policy between RBI and the government. And everybody has to come out and stop negative policy formation -- NHB, EV, etc. It just has to stop before you can get some confidence back in the system. Having said that, let me go to the other side of the argument. Lots of very good companies are now going very cheap. If you are not an investor, if you have never been in the market, if you have not seen mayhem in your equity accounts, I think you have got to be ready with a cheque book to buy some very good stocks that are now available in the market. I think you are reaching a point where if you are not over invested in the market, you could be on the buying side in a matter of days.


The list is so selective. Just day before you had ICICI Bank which impressed the street, but the twin Axis that everyone was betting on has actually disappointed with higher provisioning and slippages.At some point you have got to relate the value and the price of the shares to what intrinsically is going to be the worst case scenario for these companies. You are right, they may face pain over a certain period of time. But at the end of the day if you are looking at a longer-term horizon, they will bounce back. The good part is that the reason they will come in is not because they are doing well. The good part is that they will come in because the smaller banks will be left far behind. If you are an investor and if you have got any small bank in your portfolio, except unless backed by somebody serious, I would say you need to get out of it and get into the larger banks. 

If you have got the problems today with the smaller portfolio, get out. There is a lot of good quality stuff available in the market. Even in this market there are pockets you can buy. I will just give you an example, I am not giving you a recommendation to buy or sell. If you see Ion Exchange for instance, that is a quality stock in a quality industry. It is seeing so much trade now that you can get an opportunity to get into that at 610 if you want to sell at 680, or you get in at 680 wait it out and so on. Go case by case. It is going to be mayhem, but you will find pockets if you look at the multiplex guys. They have corrected substantially. Eventually there will be equilibrium in terms of share price and profitability. So plan your portfolio. These are the times when you really plan your portfolios and buy what you like most. Having said that nothing great will happen in the next three months, but also start planning your portfolio to buy some of these stocks because steep correction gives you chance to get back what you never thought would be possible just about a month back.


If investors are taking out their cheque books, where can they find opportunity even within the broader end of the market?See, it is very simple. You have to go for the large size and for the market leaders. If you go industry to industry, you will find that there are not more than one or two stocks that are the market leaders and are now becoming relatively cheaper. Obviously you will not go for Bajaj twins in terms of the finance because they are really very expensive stocks. You would tend to go for the other ones at some point of time. 

HDFC, HDFC Bank will stabilise and you would want to go back to those kind of stocks. Look at multiplex, as we discussed. If you look at the aviation stocks, you know every industry has one or two leaders, focus your mind there. Let us say people who missed out on buying Asian Paints, it has a stellar record for the last 20 years. If I am not wrong, it consistently rewards shareholders. You might want to start looking at each market leader."
55,2019-07-31,Asian Paints,"New Delhi: July turned out to be the worst month for Nifty in 17 years. The NSE benchmark is on course to end the month 6 per cent lower, marking its biggest fall monthly drop since 2002.

Market sentiment was hit this month following disappointing announcements in Union Budget amid tepid corporate earnings.

In July 2002, Nifty had registered a 9.35 per cent fall, which was also its biggest fall that year. The index has ended July in the red on five instances in last 17 years. It fell 2.93 per cent in 2011, 0.95 per cent in 2012 and 1.72 per cent in 2013.

FII have sold equities around Rs 12,000 crore this July, leading to major wealth destruction across sectors. Nifty shed over 700 points during the month. The overseas portfolio investors had brought in over Rs 80,000 crore during February-June.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told ETNow that the income-tax surcharge hurt FPI sentiment, adding to the market’s woes.

The pain is even worse in the broader market. BSE midcap and Smallcap indices fell 8.52 per cent and 11.16 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Within the Nifty pack, 44 stocks eroded investor wealth in July, with Coal India, YES Bank, Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj Finserve, JSW Steel, Grasim and M&M falling up to 21 per cent till July 30.

However, stocks like Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints gained up to 13 per cent to help cushion the fall. Among others, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid and Dr Reddy's Labs managed to deliver positive returns to investors.

“Poor Q1 earnings, a slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing NBFC crisis have dampened investor sentiments on Dalal Street,” said Hemang Jani, Head of Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We are cautious on the NBFC space. Rising credit costs and higher provisioning are likely to impact bottom line and credit growth. As per recent reports and data domestic growth will be weaker over the next 12-18 months,” he said.

Khemka of MOSL said, “The broader market has turned weak mainly because of poor fundamentals. The underlying earnings growth has remained elusive and Q1 numbers have proved to be a dampener for earnings recovery expectations for FY20.”

Jani prefers stocks like Ramco Cement, HUL and Asian Paints which have shown decent growth in a challenging environment."
6,2019-08-02,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended higher on Friday, thanks to gains in shares of heavyweights, including HDFC, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Infosys and Asian Paints.

After plunging about 411 points intraday, Sensex rebounded to end with a gain of 100 points at 37,118.22. Nifty settled 17 points higher at 10,997.35.

However, market breadth remained tilted towards the bears as 1,362 stocks declined against 1,097 that logged gains on BSE.

While some short-covering might have lifted the market, the sentiment was influenced after media reports suggested that the government was considering ways to check the outflow of foreign funds from Indian market.

There were hopes that the government may exempt FPIs from the tax surcharge and also do away with the proposal of raising the minimum public shareholding in listed companies to 35 per cent from 25 per cent.

""Indian market recovered in the second half of the trading day on optimism that the government is mulling over exempting FPI from super-rich surcharges. Additionally, better domestic macros like GST collection, PMI and Monsoon forecast in August provided relief that the economy will improve by the second half of FY20,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

We walk you through the key highlights of Friday's session:


Over 600 stocks hit 52-week lows
As many as 609 stocks, including ITC, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Vedanta, Hindalco, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Exide Industries, Escorts and DB Corp, hit 52-week lows on BSE.

ITC slips ahead of Q1 nos
Shares of ITC closed 1.12 per cent lower at Rs 264.60 ahead of its June quarter numbers. Analysts expect the company may report a price hike-led 10-14 per cent rise in year-on-year (YoY) profit for the June quarter even as volume growth coming in at 3-5 per cent due to higher base-year effect. 


JK Tyre plunges 14%

5,2019-08-02,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty reversed early losses to end in the green in a volatile trading session on Friday as media reports suggested that Finance Ministry and PMO held discussions over suggestions and submissions by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) regarding the surcharge issue. 

According to reports, the PMO took stock of the tax surcharge and its impact on the stock market and FPIs. FPIs have sought a roll back of surcharge as a confidence boosting signal from the Modi government. 

Indian government is likely to put a plan to raise the minimum public shareholding in listed companies to 35 per cent from 25 per cent on hold , Reuters reported quoting sources.

""The government is also looking for ways to ease concerns of foreign portfolio investors that have pulled out of Indian equity markets after a budget announcement of higher taxes for individuals and trusts earning more than 20 million rupees a year,"" the source added. 

Earlier in the day, the benchmarks witnessed heavy selling pressure after US President Donald Trump's decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods triggered fresh fears among investors. US President Donald Trump threatened to impose more tariffs on China, this time a 10 per cent of $300 billion in Chinese imports from September 1. Moody's said the new tariffs would weigh on the global economy at a time when growth is already slowing in the US, China and eurozone.

Analysts said markets may continue to remain on the weaker side due to negative global cues, mixed corporate earnings, slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing liquidity crisis in the NBFC space. Analysts expect volatility to persist as the market is expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings.

The markets were supported by auto and telecom stocks while Metal, Power and Realty indices capped the gains.

BSE Sensex closed 99.90 points, or 0.27 per cent, higher at 37,118.22. While NSE Nifty ended at 10,997.35, up 17.35 points or 0.16 per cent.

Global market was weak due to escalation in US-China trade war, but India recovered in the second half of the trading day on optimism as government mulls over exempting FPI from super rich surcharges. Additionally, better domestic macros like GST collection, PMI and Monsoon forecast in August provided a relief hoping that economy will improve by H2FY20

1,2019-08-02,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities continued their downward journey as headline indices Sensex and Nifty incurred strong losses in opening deals on Friday. 

The selloff aggravated after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose more tariffs on China, this time a 10 per cent of $300 billion in Chinese imports from September 1.

Global stocks took another beating with investors offloading riskier equities and piling into safe-haven assets.

In the opening deals, Sensex plunged over 400 points, while Nifty slipped towards 10,850.

On Thursday, Nifty closed below 11,000 points for the first time in five months after the US Federal Reserve dashed market expectations of a lengthy rate-cut cycle. 

Market observers say the impact of Budget on investor sentiment still continues. Moreover, subdued quarterly earnings and clear signs of an economic slowdown are serious concerns.

Sensex and Nifty have come off 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, from their all-time highs, hit early June, 2019. Since the Budget day on July 5, 2019, investors have lost 13.70 lakh crore on BSE. 


Factors that spooked markets:
Trump launches fresh salvo against China: While the trade negotiation between the US and China is lost in the midway, the US President Donald Trump said he would slap a 10 per cent tariff on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports starting September 1. This sent shivers down investor's spine across the globe. Asian stocks plummeted as investors rushed towards safe-haven assets. 


Fed commentary dashed hopes:The US Fed reduced the key interest rate by 25-basis-point but poured cold water on market expectations of a lengthy easing cycle. Powell characterised the rate cut as a mid-cycle adjustment to policy, citing signs of a global slowdown, simmering US trade tensions and a desire to boost too-low inflation. Markets took that as a sign that sharp further cuts were not imminent, Reuters reported. 


Deteriorating macros:India’s core sector growth slumped to its lowest in more than four years in June, reflecting the economic slowdown and the lack of pickup in investment. The index of eight core industries rose 0.2 per cent in June, down from 4.3 per cent in May and 7.8 per cent in the year-earlier, data released by the government showed, marking the slowest increase since the 0.5 per cent contraction in April 2015. India’s fiscal deficit in first quarter ended June hit 61.4 per cent of the budgeted target for the current fiscal, government data showed last Wednesday. The deficit was 68.7 per cent in the year-earlier period. 


Sustained capital outflow:The market has been witnessing sustained capital outflow after the Finance Minister proposed a tax surcharge on super-rich in Budget 2019. Since the Budget day on July 5, 2019, investors have lost 13.70 lakh crore on BSE. As per data available with NSDL, foreign investors took away Rs 3,003 crore from Indian financial market during the month of July. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 1,057 crore on Thursday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 561 crore, data suggests. 


Poor auto sales numbersOne of the major signs of the health of the economy, the auto sales numbers, have painted a grim picture. Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) reported a 33.5 per cent decline in total sales at 1,09,264 units in July, while M&M reported a 15 per cent fall in total sales to 40,142 units. Bajaj Auto reported a 5 per cent fall in total sales at 3,81,530 units in July, 2019. Such subdued sets of data further roiled the market sentiment.


Market at a glance:
In the 30-pack Sensex, only three stocks - Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints and Infosys were up.


Hero MotoCorp, HDFC, Bajaj Auto, ONGC and ICICI Bank were among the top losers in the Sensex index, falling up to 3 per cent.

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 3 were up and 47 were down.

Midcaps and smallcaps continued reeling under selling pressure as their sectoral indices on BSE fell over 1 per cent. 

Barring telecom, all sectoral indices on the BSE were in the red. Gains in shares of Bharti Airtel (up 3.46 per cent), Optiemus Infracom (up 2.07 per cent) and Sterlite Technologies (up 0.17 per cent) lifted the telecom pack up even as 10 out of total 13 components of the index were down."

7,2019-08-02,Asian Paints,"Do not look at short-term factors, sentiment, earnings, flows. You cannot really make money by focussing on those sorts of factors on any consistent basis, says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. Mukherjee says his focus has always been on companies with clean accounts, essential products and monopoly franchises. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What is your take on the fact that after today’s fall, sub that 10,900 mark, we have erased all of our 2019 gains and the Nifty has turned negative for 2019 for real?I have to confess that none of us at Marcellus really spend that much time figuring out what the market outlook is, what is going to happen next week or next month. We have never been. Our focus consistently has been to analyse and look for companies whose governance is good, accounting is actually bona fide, genuine accounts, companies who sell essential products and have monopoly franchises there in. 

So clean accounts, essential products, monopoly franchises and that is what we spend all our time doing. Honestly, we really have very little interest in knowing what the sentiment is today or what it will be tomorrow morning that sort of question is probably best asked to other punters who try to do short-term trading. 

Our emphasis has been to look after the 500 families whose wealth that we manage, to look after the wealth by focussing on consistent compounders, high class companies, say an Asian Paints or HDFC Bank or say Dr Lal PathLabs, companies that we own personally and that is it inside the 500 portfolios that we manage for family offices across the country.


One of the key issues has been that FIIs have been consistent sellers and have accelerated the selling post budget. What do you think can be done to bring FIIs back?It is important that there is no knee-jerk reaction to this. Obviously whatever has happened has happened, we are a large economy, one of the six, seven large economies in the world and I am sure the government did whatever it did on 5th July with the best intentions. There has been an inadvertent consequence, which is that some of the FIIs who have trust structures have ended with a higher tax rate than they or the government had bargained for. 

I think remedial measures can be found and it does not necessarily mean reversing the tax rate. A more liberal FII regime which allows foreign investors to invest more easily in India will lead to them coming in. I was in America 10 days ago talking to some of the pension funds and endowments who are discussing whether they will give us some money to invest and their view was that this remains one of the most attractive economies in the world to invest in. So there is an underlying foreign investor desire to invest in the Indian stock market. 

I am sure if the government comes up with a couple of measures with SEBI to make it easier for foreign money to come into India, the FII flows will return in due course. But again, one should not be trying to second guess FII flows or DII flows. If you try to second guess these sorts of things and make investments therein, it is a very dicey way to think about stock market investing.


How would you look at the earnings season because after all earnings will decide where the prices go?It has been very similar to the earnings seasons we have seen for the last 30 quarters odd in our country. If you do not have a capex cycle you are not going to see anything dramatically different in the earnings season. 

I am not so sure again why people get worked up every time the quarterly earnings season comes around. The economy has been in slow motion mode for six, seven years now and therefore in that context, it is a little challenging for companies to show decent earnings growth. 

There is obviously some companies of the ilk of Pidilite or Kotak Bank or a HDFC Bank, which can consistently chug out good numbers but their ability to chug out good numbers has been proven a long time ago. You and I do not need to wait for the next earnings season to assess that a Pidilite or a Dr Lal Path Labs will consistently grind out good results, that is a well established fact. 

What I am trying to repeatedly highlight is do not look at short term factors, sentiment, earnings, flows you cannot really make money by focussing on those sorts of factors on any consistent basis."

9,2019-08-05,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a zigzag show on Monday amid signs of further escalation in the trade war, a steep fall in the yuan, uncertainty over a major law change on Kashmir and weakness in the rupee. 

China’s yuan hit its lowest level in almost 11 years, triggering a sharp drop in emerging market currencies. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 90 paise down at 70.49 against the US dollar.

“Weak global sentiment was the top trigger behind Monday’s market fall. It seems the trade war is not going to end anytime soon,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

Losses in heavyweights from bank, NBFC, energy, auto and metal sectors dragged Sensex by 418 points, or 1.13 per cent, to 36,699. Nifty finished at 10,862, down 135 points or 1.23 per cent.

“The ongoing turmoil in Kashmir may further induce volatility in the market. Escalating trade tensions between the US and China will keep market participants on the edge and cause weakness in oil prices as well as the currency,” said Ajit Mishra, VP- Research, Religare Broking.

Here is breakdown of key highlights of Monday's session:


Investors poorer by Rs 1.6 lakh crore
Monday’s selloff dragged cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,38,37,963 crore from Rs 1,39,98,244 crore last Friday, making investors poorer by nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore. Year-to-date, investors have lost Rs 6.10 lakh crore in equities. 


645 stocks plumb 52-week lows

89 stocks look bearish
Momentum indicator MACD showed 89 stocks, including Titan Company, Lupin, Essel Propack, Equitas Holdings, HCL Infosystem, Kaveri Seed Company and Rain Industries, with bearish crossovers, signalling that these stocks may see losses in the coming sessions.

Spandana Sphoorty IPO off to a slow start 
The Rs 1,200 crore initial public offering (IPO) of Spandana Sphoorty Financial got off to a tepid start amid a global market selloff. By 4:45 pm, the issue had seen a subscription of 6 per cent, receiving bids for 5,69,789 shares compared with the total issue size of 98,22,367 shares. 


RIL shares fall 3%
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 3.48 per cent to Rs 1,143 after the global brokerage Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to 'underperform' from 'neutral', reducing the price target to Rs 995 from Rs 1,350 earlier. The brokerage said the company’s liabilities have increased significantly to $65 billion, while supply delays in refining and petrochemical, the faster roll-out of new commerce and potential stake sale in either of refining, Jio or retail pose key risks.


DHFL shares down 10%
Falling for the ninth session in a row, shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) finished 10.08 per cent lower at Rs 41.95 after reports that Deloitte has quit as the auditor of the cash-strapped firm. 


Venky’s (India) surges 13%

11,2019-08-06,Asian Paints,"I am relatively optimistic and in the next two months, we should be much higher from here and that should bode well for 2020, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Things seem to be back on track for now and positive momentum is building in a number of stocks. Also some earnings are out. Titan earnings showed just a touch of pressure. What is your take on the market sentiment and also specifically on Titan?The sentiment has been sour for both global and local reasons. But we may have been missing the woods for the trees. Oil is at $60 and below, bond yields are at four-year low and all that bodes very well for the government’s fiscal and current account. 

There will be a much needed stimulus for consumption and that is a buying opportunity. We know where the conventional weakness is, but three points will matter: one, the issue of transmission of money will be at the forefront. Second, some stimulus from the government and third, commodity prices getting so cheap will mean that inherently some industries will benefit. Three, industries which have done exceedingly well are paints, specialty chemicals and cement. All three are core in infrastructure and housing and autos and so on. 

So I think the pessimism is overdone. These companies guiding on the upside will see the much needed kicker firstly from the RBI via reduced rates and transmission of rates. I am relatively optimistic and in the next two months, we should be much higher from here and that should bode well for 2020. 


We have seen buying activity in certain pockets. Where would you jump in and buy at these levels? Would it be some of the corporate banks or would it be in midcaps?Clearly, we have been very bullish on four Cs – corporate banks, cement, construction and capex. Top it up with insurance. Insurance is a no-brainer. These stocks have been under our coverage and now they are making relatively newer highs on numbers despite the market making recent lows. So ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, SBI Life and HDFC Life would be four stocks. 

We also think some of the consumer discretionaries, select auto and consumer stocks could actually outperform. We have named some of the consumer stocks which have done well but we think as a contrarian play, auto is definitely looking for some stimulus and that will be a much needed shot in the arm. 

You could see relative outperformance from select passenger, two wheeler and commercial vehicle stocks in the next two to three months.


Some of these paint companies -- be it Asian Paints or even a Berger -- have done very well. Add to that, there have been sporadic upsides in earnings from Bata, Dabur as well. Within the FMCG sector, do you see opportunities to buy?Yes and you named them. So as a disclosure, Berger, Asian Paints, Tata Global, Dabur have all been some of our top picks. We continue to be overweight on them. You can add a Nestle that has been one of my top favourites when it was available for Rs 7,000. I have a target of Rs 14,000 by next year. That tells you that some of the pessimism is overdone in a lot of sectors and stocks. These 10 weeks are going to be slightly volatile.

But like I suggested earlier also, we think that 12-week SIP over here will be very beneficial once we get past the middle of October. Like I said, cement, paints, SRF (another stock under our coverage), packaging and the specialty chemical is doing extremely well.


Talking about SRF, what do you make of the speciality chemicals space? The stock is up about 16-17% on the back of numbers but what do you make of specialty chemicals as a sector?It depends on what is happening in China. We are still seeing huge benefit and margin expansion. The local logistics industry is definitely looking to do much better and so SRF, Atul, Sudarshan Chemical and Aarti are the four stocks which are under our coverage and are showing extreme strength. 

I would also be contrarian on select steel counters. Given that there will be an impetus from the government, local prices should start to see an uptick. If we see some more resolution on a weak Chinese yuan, other region steel producers can do extremely well. 


Where do you see the market from here? Do you see it maintaining these levels? My call for investors are the retail stocks. Please do not miss out this fear in the next 10 weeks. These 10 weeks will see all negatives getting priced in and you will be surprised on the upside. 

This Diwali could actually be very cheerful and I am relatively sanguine. After the 15th of October, three-four things can add on. Like we said, select consumer discretionary stocks, cement, corporate banks, capex, insurance -- buy a basket of stocks or maybe just the Nifty, Bank Nifty because that can truly outperform in the next 10 weeks and beyond. If we are correct, after the middle of October, you start to see an uptick than I can vouch for. That could be a longer term trend for at least a year to 18 months.


How do you look at the steel producers? Metals as a sector has not done well in the last few days. Would this be a buying opportunity?Correct. If I can name three stocks; it would be Hindalco, Tata Steel and JSW -- all three in metals and all extremely good value picks now. Tata Steel has a right outstanding at Rs 460 and is a partly paid share and the stock is available at Rs 400. There will be an impetus for the price to be above Rs 460 in the near future. The numbers are due tomorrow and all weakness will be played out. 

Iron ore prices have fallen and in the coming quarters, margins should get better. China weakness would be again a buying opportunity, given that demand supply will see some uptick after the monsoons locally. Also, just to add to it, the DHFL deal is a very big shot in the arm. A lot of the midcap banks which have proxy or have lent to it, should definitely see much-needed salvage there. If DHFL and Zee give a lot of comfort, then the whole sector’s and the market’s crisis of confidence should now abate. 


A couple of stocks are looking pretty good today, Bharti for example, the paint majors or even a Tech Mahindra. What is your view on Bharti?We have had a contrarian view and we thought that along with Jio, Bharti would be the best fit, given that they are in the process of reducing their debt in the South African business.

Secondly, their ARPUs have truly surprised, from an abysmal low of Rs 105, it came to Rs 129. It beat Jio’s numbers and it is telling you that data pricing is back and data volumes are growing. Both Reliance and Bharti would be standout performers. In fact, as a disclosure, we also think Reliance at these levels is giving you a very good opportunity. ARPUs are now definitely going to be on the way up, given that pricing is back. Bharti is a buy for a target of Rs 425."
12,2019-08-07,Asian Paints,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Wednesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 56 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on AU Small Finance Bank with a target price of Rs 760. AU Small Finance Bank is swiftly increasing its focus towards the high- yielding used vehicle segment and is capitalising under-penetrated opportunities in the MSME segment, thereby sustaining healthy growth momentum, said Motilal Oswal. The brokerage expects the bank to deliver steady 43 per cent earnings CAGR over FY19-21, aided by gradual improvement in operating leverage and margins. The stock ended up 3.4 per cent at Rs 657.75 on Tuesday.


CLSA has maintained outperform rating on Nestle India and raised target price to Rs 12,415 from Rs 11,750. Nestle’s second quarter CY19 result clearly indicates management’s rising obsession with growth, which is the key positive, said CLSA. This entailed tough decisions, reflected in the 100 bps YoY Ebitda margin decline, but management chose the difficult path, it said. CLSA has cut EPS estimate by 2-5 per cent due to a special dividend. The stock ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 11,832.10 on Tuesday.


Jefferies has maintained buy rating on KEI Industries with a target price of Rs 675. KEI’s June quarter results came above expectations driven by both revenues and margin improvement, said Jefferies. Debt levels are stable and EHV capacity utilisation should continue to ramp up over the next 12 months as orders are finalised, said Jefferies. It said KEI is a holistic play given its exposure to capex, consumption and engineering exports. The stock ended up 8.2 per cent at Rs 445.20 on Tuesday.

Nomura has maintained buy rating on Equitas Holdings and reduced target price to Rs 150 from Rs 165. Equitas’ first quarter results were a small miss on PPOP versus estimates, led by some moderation in AUM growth impacting fees, said Nomura. Unlike Ujjivan, Equitas has better visibility on a listing of the bank via its scheme of arrangements, and management commentary indicates that the it has gotten RBI’s NOC as well, said Nomura. The stock ended up 2.8 per cent at Rs 106.70 on Tuesday.

ICICI Securities has downgraded Berger Paints (India) to hold from overweight with a target price of Rs 333. Berger Paints has reported a healthy topline growth and betterthan-expected margins in the first quarter of FY20, the brokerage said. While decorative volume growth is in-line with its peer Kansai Nerolac, it fell short of leader Asian Paints’ high double digit volume growth, said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has downgraded the stock given the recent increase n the stock price. The stock ended up 4 per cent at Rs 346.8 on Tuesday."

14,2019-08-07,Asian Paints,"It could be because these are low value, low ticket and more repetitive purchase items where the impact of a slowdown will probably come at the last leg and that’s why the volume growth is still holding up, says Sameer Narayan, market expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Avenue Supermart is going to be under focus perhaps because RK Damani is looking to sell 1% in D-Mart to meet the shareholding norms. At Rs 1,470, would you buy the stock?In certain cases, you do not buy on a pure multiple basis. You look at a franchise and you see how the business evolves and scales over the next 5-10 years. A classic example is Trent. These are franchises that you only get to buy at say certain times. Otherwise, every time somebody wants to take a significant large exposure to D-Mart, because it is such a thinly traded stock, you typically cause a very large impact. 

So, today when there is an opportunity and a large block is available because of a regulatory situation, I am sure people would want more to evaluate entry rather than look at valuation or multiples.


It is that one opportunity, do not miss it?Absolutely.


Titan saw a hit on the jewellery side even though they managed to maintain margins. Gold prices are perhaps set to go up. What is the outlook? In Titan, one needs to temper growth expectations a bit because over the last three quarters, they had done exceedingly well on both store accretion as well as jewellery growth. Now with the sentiment being where it is, today people honestly do not have too much of investible surplus. You will probably find the growth not being at the same rate at which you have had it so far. 

But that does not mean that as a franchise their brand and their customer appeal is not basically pulling in because it is essentially a play on the buying behaviour from unorganised to organised and it is still pretty much there. Plus the valuations have corrected quite a decent bit. If you get a good price of entry from these levels, for somebody who is looking at a three-four-year story, it is a good idea. Plus, the entire new generation businesses of eyewear is showing growth and watches. This quarter, there was a one- off large institutional order, but the other segments are also showing that the growth play is across the four segments they operate in.


Why are paint companies selling?It is a quasi consumption play because in India, we had the entire do it yourself (DIY) market and the fact that there was a lot of optimism on housing front, led to paint companies which are seen as very good proxies as they also give the cost advantage of a rising or falling crude. 

In case the crude markets are in a bearish phase, then the cost will completely play in your favour and then you do not need to knock down your retail prices that much. So, there was a tacit pricing power that the sector was giving investors to play on. But what happened in the bargain was that valuations reached a zone and now one is wondering if even a 20% growth could be sustained. 


Why are paint companies reporting strong volume growth? Housing, auto are facing downturn. It is the monsoon season and a feel-good factor is missing. This is a category which will only do well when you are feeling excited about things.It is easier for a household to re-do their homes rather than buy another house. I may not have the purse or the availability to go in and buy a big house but I can definitely repaint my house. That is the buyer behaviour for you and especially in tough times.

But having said that, may be, a lot of dealer inventories were sitting there. One needs to see this over in the next three quarters. If you look at FMCG or any consumer facing businesses, one should always look at the rolling 12 months’ sales because YoY may not be a very apt example.

It is quite likely that -- a) the behaviour pattern of doing up a house versus buying a new one; b) Today these companies really use technology in a big way. Earlier, getting a house painted used to be a huge task but the way, companies like Asian Paints have come up with technology solutions for the retail customers, makes it superbly convenient.

Today, from more of an unbranded category, it has become a branded one and so to that extent, multiples should go up. That is where perhaps the story is.


A 25 bps rate cut by RBI is something everyone on the Street is talking about. What would surprise the market on the upside? 25 bps is pretty much expected and it is in the price. If RBI has to do some heavy lifting to spur growth, they need to be confident about the fisc. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, you have seen a tax revenue growth is 6-6.7%. Now the expectation for the year is 25%. So, you are actually way behind the mark on that. RBI would obviously be mindful of that. What they have done as a response is they have shifted the liquidity stance from being deficit to a decent surplus. Now they are also mindful of the fact that the rains have been good over the last fortnight but they have been very heavy so it has been the special distribution is perhaps not as good as one would have liked to. 


Could Yes Bank be a contra buy? Yes Bank can survive as a franchise if they are able to raise capital. Then you are pretty much buying a private bank at a PSU valuation?The first problem is that instead of the private equity which was earlier supposed to come in and pick it up, they are going the public route way and putting it out to institutional shareholders.

To that extent, the type of investor who comes in is not what was earlier envisaged but having said that, the money is still in. In terms of provisioning and the cleanup, the management has shown enough resolve. Yes they are willing to bite the bullet and in the last two quarters, they have ensured that they have not disappointed the street on that front.

But having said that, as a valuation, today the bank is available at virtually a default kind of a book value. Having said that, the question now is whether it will survive and whether three years out, Yes Bank remain in the current form or will it get bought and whether it will get worse before it gets better. Those are the key risks. 

From a trade perspective, since there has been such a sharp correction in price, you might get a 15-20% kind of a trade, the way we saw in DHFL yesterday because these stocks are so oversold that chances are there would be some amount relief.

But having said that, for a long term investor, am I going to see a business which will probably last the next four-five years? He still needs to see a couple of more quarters to see which way this capital is being put to work and what kind of an asset the people would look for answers.


Even a Dabur, Bata, Nestle and Pidilite’s numbers have surprised. Within this slowdown, those are the companies which have been beneficiaries and they have stood out.You are right. It could be because these are low value, low ticket and more repetitive purchase items where the impact of a slowdown will probably come at the last leg. That is the reason why the volume growth is still holding up. But the moment you go down to slightly more high value, high involvement purchases like a discretionary, you see the whole impact. In another quarter, the monsoon flavour will come in and FMCG may still hold up on the volume side for maybe a couple of quarters more. 

But having said that, the moment you start seeing government putting some big moves after Kashmir resolution and step up infrastructure investment in that part of the country, you will start seeing the optimism."
15,2019-08-07,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: RBI’s unconventional 35 bps rate cut failed to give any boost to investor sentiment and equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended Wednesday’s session with strong losses.

The market was hoping for some measures to address liquidity concerns for the shadow banks.

“The NBFC crisis is still plaguing the market, and there is a need to fix it. Developments in the global economy are also not favourable for growth,” said Deepthi Mathews, Economist at Geojit Financial Services. 

Global sentiment remained fragile while investors back home sought clues as to when and how the economy will start a bounceback and what measures the government may take to check FII exits from domestic stocks. 

“A downside risk to the lowered GDP forecast at 6.9 per cent in FY20 due to global growth headwinds and slowdown in domestic consumption hurt investor sentiment,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. 

The 30-share Sensex ended the day 286 points, or 0.77 per cent, lower at 36,690, with 22 stocks ending in the red. Nifty closed the day at 10,855, down 93 points, or 0.85 per cent.

17,2019-08-08,Asian Paints,"We are sitting on almost 50% cash and we see there will be interesting opportunities to deploy capital over the next two to three months, says Vikas Khemani, Founder, Carnelian Capital. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


It is great to talk from long-term perspective. It is great to talk about India as a great destination for a three-year or a five-year investor. But one has to be realistic about what is happening to the economy as otherwise, you are losing your portfolio value on a daily basis. How are you dealing with this storm? Are you raising cash or are you buying more?While having a perspective on the long term, you have to navigate short term, day-to-day developments. But the kind of environment we are in, is pretty much similar to what we saw in some sense in early 2009 or in 2003. It has happened before and it will happen again. We have seen market sentiments going from euphoria to panic and right now, it is in an extreme state of panic. I am not denying, there are real issues. The economy is definitely slowing down and there needs to be concentrated development or move by the government to kickstart the economy. 

But interest rates are coming down, oil prices are under reasonably good control. So, there is a mix of the good things and terrible things and that is where the market is right now. The way we have been playing it out is we have been watching the situation day in and day out. We are sitting on almost 50% cash and we see there will be interesting opportunities to deploy capital over the next two to three months.

I have said it repeatedly that the vintage of 2019 would be one of the best vintages, pretty much similar to what we had in 2014 because today panic is at its peak. Every day, you have new lows on most stocks. Negative sentiments are high. These are the typical good times to build portfolios but at the same time one has to be careful and mindful of the fact that on a day to day basis the developments on the economic front. We are very cautiously watching everything.


And in this caution, what is it that you are doing as an investor? Is there a strategy in place? Is there a list that you are buying on dips or at least keeping ready?No. We are at an interesting juncture in the economy where it will either improve from here or worsen further. These are two ways it can go. The key difference lies in the concrete measures being taken by the regulators and by the government to revive the economy.

Hence, there is no point in making a judgement and saying it is the best time and go out and deploy full capital. Concrete measures are being taken that will determine the speed of the recovery and will determine the timing of the recovery. What is important is whether it will worsen before recovery. 

We are really watching how and what steps are being taken by the government to have a flow of credit into the system. How fast NBFCs can get back to lending is a really big issue. So is how automobile demand can pick up and recovery can happen. A lot of things you are watching on a day-to-day basis but at the same time looks like that we are very close to the end. Maybe next two-three months will be more or less defining movements and will probably settle things down. We will be deploying capital only once we are comfortable that the worst is behind us and measures are being taken by the government to kickstart the economy and the supply of the credit flow into the economy. To me, that is the single biggest problem right now for the economy.


Anand Mahindra yesterday sounded an SOS for the auto sector saying that the deepening crisis in the sector would also impact the fiscal math. Do you agree the slowdown is going to be perhaps even more severe than anticipated unless solid measures are taken?Absolutely. I do agree that automobiles is facing serious slowdown problems. There are job losses and in fact some of the dealers are facing the heat. Many of them are planning to shut down. They are really losing money because demand has dropped significantly. Automobile, real estate are the real sectors that create employment. What we see is a vicious effectof credit supply crunch and demand reduction playing out. 

I am beginning to hear that stress in the SMEs is getting built and we have seen in all the banking portfolios, that the stress or NPA levels in the retail side has gone up. These are the worry signs and unless they are addressed in a very concrete manner, this can degenerate further. One has to watch the situation every day and see what steps have been taken. Whether it will degenerate before revival or revive really depends on what measures have been taken and hence every day on a regular basis, you have to watch out for what is going to happen to revive the economy. I am quite hopeful that the government will do something but we just cannot be complacent about it.


Are you saying that it will get worse before it gets better both for economy and for prices?I do not know if it really depends on what measures have been taken and whether coordinated aggressive measures have been taken to kickstart the economy. If that is done, we might see a quick recovery and if a muted approach is taken which is the current case, then we might still see some more downside. 

I do not know if we will have to wait and watch. Yesterday, the RBI governor made some move in terms of relaxation on the NBFC side, but it takes too long to percolate down in the system. The real estate sector is starving for capital. Job losses are happening out there and so that sector needs capital. Automobile needs capital and there are lots of sectors that need capital. We are not very sure. We will watch out till the end and we will invest only we feel things are moving in the right direction.


When you are watching out for that point of comfort, is it purely from an earnings point of view or would it also be from a valuation point of view? How would you balance the two currently? You have also been most comfortable with consumption. Would that be your top theme?Consumption and IT generally have been defensives and they are not reasonable in valuation. So, you have to hide somewhere. I am sure most people right now are finding comfort out there. Consumption is one sector which benefits when there is economic revival. Specifically, on the discretionary consumption side, we have seen a lot of correction across the board and we would definitely look to buy them as and when the revival happens because there you will get good recovery and good delta once the economy revives. We would focus more on that rather than the kind of hugely over-owned defensive staples.


Reliance has fallen 20%. It has got nothing to do with what is happening to the economy; the Jio business is independent, retail business is okay. They are a petrochemical company, they get money from refining margins. Those businesses are still intact and yet the stock is down 20%. The stock is almost in a bear market?Reliance had a great rally before it fell 20% for a long period of time and right now, we are seeing high leverage concerns cropping up. Some of the sell-side houses have written about it. When these kind of concerns around high debt is raised, people spooked and that is what is happening in Reliance. 

I am not saying it is not a genuine worry. It is a worry because as far as Jio is concerned, you need to see cash flow, you need to see some deleverage and I am sure the management recognises that as well. We will have to wait and watch how this deleveraging happens but I would say we are quite positive from a long term perspective both on the telecom business as well as the petrochemical business.


I was looking at some outliers here; Asian Paints, good numbers, Trent, Westside same store sales up 12%, Bata not bad, Marico okay, Pidilite good numbers. How does one read into these small pockets related to consumption? Why are they doing well? I am sure there are different signals but I would assume Asian Paints in a sense of isolation. I would not see it as a common trend in terms of consumption. It could be also because of the correction in raw material prices. I have not studied in detail the specific reasons for these two, three names which you mentioned. 

But the economy will always find some dichotomy. It is not that consumption is coming to a screeching halt Sometimes, individual companies are running some initiatives which turn out to be well. It could be inventory pipeline filling, it could be many more things. I would not read just one quarter and take it is a trend. One would rather watch out. 

There is no denial of the fact that there is a slowdown in the consumption and the economy. The question to answer is whether it will recover soon or take time. Some mixed pockets will always be there. You will hear some movies doing phenomenal business in the very same slowdown period. Now what does that explain? The fact is not that consumers have stopped spending. People would spend money but it is just that one has to look at a broader trend and connect the dots over a two, three quarter period to decipher a particular trend."
19,2019-08-09,Asian Paints,"In terms of food items and footfalls within the top rung retailer, consumers are not going to shift from brands they are besotted with. Never mind the recession or the slowdown, says Harish Bijoor, Brand Consultant, Harish Bijoor Consults. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Do not look at Indian consumer from the prism of soap, shampoo and oral care categories. Those are mature categories and are not the yardsticks of how the Indian consumer is doing. Do you think the current earnings season is only a vindication of a thought which you shared with us a couple of months ago?Yes, I think so because consumption is no longer a prism, it is a broad spectrum orientation of types of products that people are buying. There are two types of categories that we typically discuss; one is needs and wants category and the other is the desires and aspirations category. 

The needs and wants category in a slowdown or a recession is just not touched because grocery items, stuff that I would like to eat, stuff that I would like to possess, I would never compromise. Overall, definitely the consumer mood has soured and that is due to the growth rates that we talk about but it has not curdled yet. 

The curdling has actually happened in higher ticket items like auto and the worry is what happens in auto has a habit of cascading into lesser ticket items and if that is stymied, then we will be back on track.


In consumption, when there is a slowdown, that prompts some degree of down trading. We have witnessed that with D-Mart or Asian Paints sales numbers. We are in a process where the down trading has started and in the next quarter, the down trading will also become negative? There is worry in certain categories. Let us take a look at categories such as paints. In paints, there is likely to be that kind of downtrading but in terms of food items and footfalls within the top rung retailer, consumers are not going to shift from brands they are besotted with. Never mind the recession or the slowdown, I am continuing to buy it because at least it pacifies me. 

The point on garment is yet another point which is to say that there is a slowdown but I will still look good. I will not make compromises on those brands which I have been buying. 

One other point which is affecting the market today is the fact that a huge chunk of the generation says I do not want to own or buy, I want to outsource. That is also affecting categories such as auto, higher end categories like homes. People are saying I do not want to own a home, I can buy that home experience closer to my place of work; I do not want to buy a car, I can Uber it or Ola it. That is yet another thing which we must not ignore. The slowdown is not only about the economy, it is about the psychology and psychographics of individuals changing and saying hey, I do not want to own I will borrow.


How do you explain what is happening with apparel companies. If you look at Trent, Zara, Westside or even Aditya Birla Fashion numbers, the end of the season sales may actually perk up the volumes but are they even bettering their margins?Well it is sustainable because we are talking about two ends of the market and what we typically call the rag trade. One of it is that portion of the rag trade where people are buying stuff which are all about lower price and fashion. There is an impact. But when you talk about high price and branded fashion sold through the intermediary who is adding value and who is this great big retailer that we are talking about. 

Out there, the footfalls with the retailers are excellent at this point of time and the kind of footfalls walking into organised retail and the kind of experience they are seeking and getting, I think there is no compromise on that kind of purchase. People are also saying that my ticket size of up to Rs 4,000-5,000 on a garment is fine. At least, it is not as deep an item like auto of any kind. 

I think experience as well as service dimension is adding to the margins of these super retailers. Along with their margins being protected, margins of the brands that go through organised retail is also being protected."
20,2019-08-09,Asian Paints,"There has been a resilience in the performance of consumer staples as well as consumer discretionaries. Even bank have reported decent numbers, says Aishvarya Dadheech, Fund Manager, Ambit AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Looking at the way markets are panning out today, there has been some revival of sentiment on Street value buying. Short covering seems to be emerging. Do you think one can make a case that probably in the interim, a base is made in the market?Yes. If we look at the way things went wrong in the market in July, primarily because of the policies announced in the budget and especially the tax incidence, we saw a big drawdown in the equity market. There are talks about some reversal in the policy and that is why we are seeing this kind of a recovery happening. But one of the most important things which I also want to mention here that after the muted Q4, the expectations for this quarter itself was less. A slowdown is evident but if we look at the consumption sector which is a real indicator of the economy, the performance of consumer staples as well as consumer discretionary likes Nestle, HUL has shown resilience. Even companies associated with home buildings -- Asian Paints, Astral, Supreme, Kajaria have shown decent volume growth. 

The consumer discretionary as well as the staple segment has remained quite upbeat. Even if you look at the other sectors, banks have reported decent numbers though there is a slight commentary whereas on the asset quality, there might be some issues there. So far, things look good. Cement reported good numbers but it is led more by realisations. The point I am trying to make here is that the quarter has not been washed out. It clearly shows that things might not be that doomed as was being perceived by the market.


But there is one large company, the leader in the innerwear segment, that is seen as an indicator of the consumption segment and this time there was a negative growth there. We have seen Van Heusen and many other smaller players also jump into this high margin premium innerwear segment. What is your take there? Are there signs of slowdown emerging at the horizon? There is definitely some signs of slowdown but the situation got aggravated primarily by capital liquidity issues. The dealers and distributors are not able to rotate the capital and things are more or less stuck at that level, which is also impacting the growth in a bigger way. 

Even in our interaction with the management of all these companies, we are finding that their distributors are not able to rotate capital which is visible in the growth side. We believe that though there is improvement in the liquidity scenario in the last two-three months, post May, we are at a surplus liquidity. 

But the transmission of liquidity and the rate at the ground level is not picking up. I think some announcement will give confidence into the system and then the money will start flowing through. This growth will then getting reflected in the better way.


Ajay Piramal just said that there is enough liquidity in the system but transmission is not happening. There was special mention about transmission from the RBI governor in the policies as well. What is your view on NBFCs? If you look at the historical data of the last two decades, whenever there is a rate cut happening, transmission normally happens immediately in the debt market. But in case of the corporate bonds, the actual cut in the rate that ranges anywhere between 20% and 50% you see historically 5-6% transmission has happened. So I believe transmission will take more time to get reflected into the system. 

On the NBFC side, we believe this is an opportune time to invest into good and clean NBFCs where you have a lot of comfort on the liability franchise. The asset side growth is never a concern because we are a capital starved country. But this is the time to get into those NBFCs which can manage their ALM wealth, which have a very strong liability franchise and has adequate equity for that kind of growth along with very clean corporate governance.


What is your view on auto and auto ancillary ecosystem? How should one approach the entire space? There have been a slew of events which has impacted auto -- higher cost on insurance, transfer to BS VI, security, registration recently but the biggest hit was because of the liquidity crisis. Basically in auto sector, autos are not sold, it is finance which is sold. We believe that in the next six to nine months, we will see recovery coming back into the financial system and that will be the time you will start to see recovery in the auto sector as well, probably after Diwali.

On the valuation side, we believe this is the time to identify those market leaders which have been there for long and the intensity of those businesses will continue as our per capita income grows. We are very upbeat that these are the actual time to start getting into quality OEM names..


Passenger vehicles?Passenger vehicles will be the one which will rebound faster. Commercial vehicles (CV) might take some more time because it is deployed dependent on the economy scenario. I believe the OEM recovery will happen first and then we will see some recovery in auto ancillaries. I am very upbeat on their valuation because those are the balance sheets with huge amount of cash and they are good companies which are market leaders."

21,2019-08-10,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: Paint companies Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac have outperformed the benchmark in the last one month on the back of an 11% fall in crude oil prices and strong June-quarter results. However, rich valuations could constrict the returns these three stocks could give in the near term, according to analysts.

Shares of Asian Paints have gained 16% since July 5, while those of Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac have risen by 12% and 7.5%, respectively, compared with a 6% fall in the Sensex during this period.

With growth in the repainting segment on account of good demand in rural and small towns, and anticipated growth in construction activity over the next five years, these companies are expected to post robust growth in the coming years, but valuations are stretched at the current levels, said analyst.



 “All the paint companies have posted strong revenue growth, driven by sustained strong demand in the domestic decorative paints segment, helping paint companies to post strong volume growth during June quarter,” said Kaustubh Pawaskar, research analyst at brokerage firm Sharekhan. “Further, declining crude oil prices provide some visibility of better margins in the quarters ahead.”

Both Asian Paints and Berger Paints are currently trading at 70 times their trailing 12 months earnings, while Kansai Nerolac Paints is trading at 57 times PE.

Berger Paints reported 31% growth in consolidated net profit to Rs 164 crore in the June 2019 quarter on the back of high double-digit volume growth. The volume growth was higher than that of peers Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac, implying market share gains, but the stock is currently trading expensive at 50 times its FY20 estimated earnings, said analysts.

“Strong volume growth in the decorative segment; stable volumes in the industrial segment; YoY improvement in operating margins with benign raw material situation and strong earnings growth were the highlights of the results for Berger in June quarter,” said Amit Agarwal, analyst at Kotak Securities. “However, the valuations at the current price and factoring growth prospects look stretched”.

“We see another year of consolidation in ad-spends, as auto segment weakness continues to weigh on industrial margins in the near term,” said Percy Panthaki, analyst at IIFL. “Should a back-ended auto recovery not play out, we may see sharper ad-spend cuts that could hurt Kansai’s decorative growth and, hence, drive another year of decline in return ratios.”"

23,2019-08-14,Asian Paints,"FIIs have withdrawn around $3 billion but once they see growth, we can see them coming back also, says Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

It is now practically the end of the earnings season. What have been the key hits and misses according to you?It has been a mixed set of earnings. Corporate banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI, IndusInd have delivered good numbers, but there has been some misses also.Among FMCG companies, HUL growth has been modest though Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Nestle numbers have been good. 

Cement companies including UltraTech have come up with good results while auto and auto ancillaries’ performance has been below par. 

Largecap IT companies like Infosys and TCS have done well and the former has actually increased guidance. However, performance of midcap IT companies like Cyient, L&T Infotech has been below par. So, overall mixed results. We had expected slightly better but going ahead, we may see slightly better returns.


Sentiment on the street really seems to have soured with the overall FPI issue. The Prime Minister himself has said he is taking cognisance of it. Would you believe the kind of selloff that we have seen from FPIs is far deeper and has more correlation with the slowdown that we are seeing in the economy as well?The slowdown has definitely affected the sentiment. FPI tax was a trigger at that point of time obviously they wanted a certain structure and the budget had some different meaning for them. They were trying but more importantly, that was only a trigger and it is a domestic slowdown a little bit and obviously the US slowdown. 

If you look at US yield curve, earlier it was only 10-year and we were saying three-month is inverted. Now, even two-years may get inverted soon. The difference is narrowing. A major concern is that if there is a recession worry, if there are other areas all over the world and if so much is parked in negative bonds, maybe that is one of the major reasons. They have withdrawn around $3 billion but once they see growth, we can see them coming back also. 

They have gone out in September-October 2018 and then they invested again. In the last one or two months, again they have withdrawn. This flip-flop will continue and once the growth is visible, they may come back again.


As an investor, what is the right approach right now? Do you buy this decline, do you hunt for names, keep the shopping list ready? What are you advising your clients to do?If you look at domestic equity or India equity story, then mid to long term, it is a great place to be in and one has to have a shopping list ready. But given the concerns, as of now, whether we talk about Hong Kong or Argentina or about the US-China trade war, the flip-flop continues. So, do a staggered purchase and keep your shopping list ready because these times whatever portfolio you build, if you already own some stocks and you have conviction, these are the times when you will find them much cheaper at 10%-20% discount.

Overall, you will benefit but there is no hurry because the consolidation phase will take place and over a period of time you will get more and more opportunities. We have seen 20% of the stocks giving 80% of the return but in 20% of the time. We have seen how Reliance has fared recently but for many years, there was no return on Reliance. So you have to stay invested, you have to keep buying at regular intervals and keep holding good stocks.


What is it that you would identify or which sectors?We are again talking about the private banks, corporate as well as retail focussed and along with that, IT is also a strong bet because we have seen that the overall global spend on IT is still unaffected and the results of the largecap IT and IT services have shown a good growth in the coming year. That is what one of the Gartner reports says.

The monsoon deficiency is more or less gone and so maybe there will be some consumption pickup. We have seen some of the results like HUL and paints. Then comes pharma. There is US business, some kind of growth -- whether you look at Aurobindo, Lupin, Cipla and even Sun Pharma. There is definitely an uptick. 

These are some of the areas and obviously then going ahead we are positive about textiles and chemicals and because if the trade war intensifies, textile will benefit because India is the largest cotton producer, These are some of the spaces where we feel buying can be done."
24,2019-08-14,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty rebounded after yesterday's selloff in Wednesday's trading session supported by metal, auto and banking stocks as US delaying tariffs on some Chinese imports, brought relief to the markets. 

Trump backed off his September 1 deadline of 10 per cent tariffs on the remaining Chinese imports, delaying duties on cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods in the hopes of blunting their impact on US holiday sales. The US-China trade conflict has been disrupting global supply chains and slowing economic growth across the world.

Analysts said that investors also cheered easing retail inflation which left room for the RBI to go for another round of rate cut in October. According to Government data, retail inflation eased marginally to 3.15 per cent in July on the back of softening fuel prices even as overall food prices moved up. This was the first time in six months that the inflation rate dipped. 

The investors' sentiment were further bolstered on reports that the finance ministry may soon consult the law ministry on how to provide relief to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from the super-rich surcharge that was announced in the July 5 budget, analysts said.

25,2019-08-16,Asian Paints,"June quarter earnings season has ended on a mixed note with select companies from FMCG, paints and corporate banking space delivering better-than-expected numbers, even as those from auto and auto ancillaries and mid-tier IT firms failed to impress Dalal Street.

As many as 20 companies in the 30-share Sensex reported an increase in net profit for the quarter, while others posted a dip in bottom lines. 

Nearly 2,500 of the BSE-listed firms have announced June quarter numbers so far, out of which only 35 midcap and smallcap companies with at least Rs 30 crore profit reported over 100 per cent year-on-year (YoY) expansion in their bottom lines. 

Some of them did so on the back of exceptional gains. For instance, a one-time gain of Rs 1,291.20 crore mainly aided NIIT’s bottom line during the quarter

“If it is a one-time gain, then one should stay cautious even if a company has posted over two-fold rise in net profit. Investors should focus on consistent performers in stock selection,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics.

Among the top performers, NIIT posted 61 times, or nearly 6,000 per cent YoY jump in profit during the quarter, while InterGlobe Aviation, Usha Martin, Gokaldas Exports, Multi Commodity Exchange, IOL Chemicals and Deepak Nitrite reported profit growth in the range of 300 to 4,220 per cent.

Despite manifold rise in profit for NIIT, Elara Capital recently slashed the target price for the stock to Rs 157 from Rs 183. “We have lowered the target price, as we no longer factor in cash value for the minimum alternative tax (MAT) paid, although it can be offset against future taxes,” it said.

InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of the country’s largest airline IndiGo, also got some benefit from the grounding of cash-starved Jet Airways and improved performance on the cargo front in June quarter. Centrum Broking is bullish on InterGlobe with a price target of Rs 1,846.

Except for NIIT (down 1.85 per cent) and Usha Martin (down 6.87 per cent), net sales of other firms increased between 9 per cent and 40 per cent YoY. 

Among others, Pokarna, Adani Enterprises, Orient Cement, The India Cements, The South Indian Bank, Zydus Wellness, Tamil Nadu Newsprint, JK Cement, Kolte Patil, Hindustan Media Ventures, JK Lashmi Cement, Dalmia Bharat, Godrej Properties, Bank of India and Welspun Corporation posted 150 to 260 per cent YoY profit growth. Net sales of Kolte Patil, Zydus Wellness and Pokarna increased over 50 per cent YoY.

AU Small Finance Bank, United Spirits, DLF, Max Financial, Subros, Phoenix Mills, Trident, Seamec, Supreme Petrochem, Power Grid, Godfrey Phillips, Ipca Labs and Himachal Futuristic were among other companies that reported over 100 per cent YoY rise in quarterly profit.

Among Sensex companies, Tata Motors, Axis Bank and Bajaj Finance posted 94 per cent, 75 per cent and 43 per cent YoY rise in net profit, respectively, during the quarter. On the other hand, ICICI Bank turned around with net profit of Rs 1,908 crore against a Rs 120 crore loss in the same quarter last year. SBI reported Rs 2,312 crore profit against a Rs 4,875 crore loss for the same period.

Anand Rathi Shares and StockBrokers is positive on ICICI Bank with a price target of Rs 511. “With declining credit cost on account of lower slippages and adequate provision coverage ratio, we believe ICICI Bank is favourably positioned to deliver superior profitability and return ratios.”

Bharti Airtel posted a net loss of Rs 2,866 crore for June quarter against a net profit of Rs 97.30 crore in the same period last year. YES Bank, Tata Steel, M&M and Maruti Suzuki reported 30-92 per cent drop in profits during the quarter.

ICICIdirect gave a ‘buy’ rating to Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 400, despite the company having reported a loss for June quarter. 

The brokerage believes Bharti Airtel is well placed to tackle the industry pressure with an apt strategy of focusing on high-paying customers. “Bharti with a relatively nimble balance sheet post its Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, monetisation of Africa assets through pre-IPO stake sale and IPO fund raise of $750 million, coupled with further potential of deleveraging, can remain one of the major players in the Indian telecom space,” it said.

Arun Thukral, MD & CEO at Axis Securities, said he had expected slightly better numbers for June quarter.

Corporate banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI and IndusInd have delivered good numbers, but there has been some misses also, he said.

Among FMCG companies, HUL’s growth was modest though Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Nestle’s numbers have been good. Cement companies, including UltraTech, have come up with good results while auto and auto ancillaries’ performance has been below par, Thukral said."
26,2019-08-16,Asian Paints,"Our thesis has been that whenever there is subdued growth in the global economy, India still does well from a relative growth perspective, as well as from a profitability perspective, because most of the commodities remain in a range, says Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 


What kind of phase are we going through in the market? Is it time to conserve cash or to start putting the cash into whatever you are sitting on because the market has become fundamentally cheap?Clearly the time has come to start looking at equities, but that does not mean that one should be very aggressive at these levels. While the macros have been mixed, the valuations have come off. They are not as attractive as what would entail a complete lump-sum investment at this point. But at the same time, investors will definitely make money if they invest at lower valuations. We have seen that broader markets have corrected in terms of valuations over the last two years or so. While immediately there may not be any shining stars, but if you stop investing at this point of time, you may not be able to make a lot of wealth over the long term. So ideally one should continue investing at these levels as well. But again, you have to keep some gunpowder dry and look for opportunities if there is more volatility in the market.


How does one figure out that the market and economy will get worse before it gets better or whether the bad has already gotten worse and will start getting better now?If you look at valuations from a historical perspective, they have come off from the peak and are not as good as they were in the beginning of 2014 or end of 2013. So to that extent, there could be more downside if you simply go by a historical valuation range. And also when the economy is slowing down or has already slowed down, the management commentary, the anecdotal evidence, etc, is going to be very, very depressing and disappointing. This is the time when you have to keep patience and keep investing in the market with the hope that at some point of time there will be a recovery. It will be very difficult to point out when that recovery would be. 

In our sense, the recovery would happen when the transmission of lower interest rates would start happening in the economy. We have already seen about 110 bps repo rate cuts, but that has not gotten transmitted completely simply because there is a disruption in the fixed-income market. The companies that require money today have not been getting funds. Those who do not need it have the benefit of lower interest rates, as well as transmission. That needs to change and when that happens, I think slowly growth will pick up. Yes, it is a challenging time. But if you lose hope, then I guess equity is not an asset class for you simply because when you get equity at lower valuations, you will only be able to make more money when you keep patience.


 What sectors could you look at and, of course, the bigger question -- whether you should buy the decline? Are there pockets where you believe that the valuation is right while the growth story is still intact or at least there is visibility after the slowdown?Clearly there are three buckets of valuations in the market today. There is one bucket which is still expensive, but there is some visibility. For example, the FMCG sector despite the slowdown is one of the steadier set of businesses in this market. They continue to have better visibility compared to many other sectors, but the valuations are high. 

For IT, I would at least put the large caps within the same basket. Then you have fair range of valuations for many other sectors such as private-sector financials and some others. Then you have the third bucket which is completely beaten down today. There is no visibility. While it may look like they are very attractive, we really do not have the visibility to go ahead and make a large sum of investments into those set of sectors. 

Our approach has been to look at all three buckets, manage having a reasonable degree of insights into where the slowdown is and how long it can continue and see whether the current valuations give any margin of safety. If we find some margin of safety, we would enter into that space. It may not be any sector or a theme as such, but from a bottom-up perspective, wherever we feel that cash flows are steady -- while there is a slowdown in the economy the stocks are showing a subdued growth -- we are still okay. But we do not want to enter into companies that have governance issues or where the business model itself has changed completely in the recent past.


The auto names must be quite a 'no-no' as they seem to be going through a cyclical slowdown with the big structural overhang of EV stepping in?As you know, we had cut our auto position sometime in the beginning of 2018 itself and continue to remain negative on the industry. While optically it may look like the valuations have corrected because the stocks have fallen 40-50% from the peak, when you look at the earnings trajectory for some of these companies and look at the current valuations, they are still expensive. Given that and also the medium-term overhang of what happens to the auto sector given the increased penetration of shared mobility; the likely competition that will come from electric vehicles, etc. I do not think we are in a position today to thump the table and say that stocks have corrected and that at these valuations there is no risk at all. We still believe that there is enough risk in the auto sector given where things are.


How does one understand the global environment? What happens when bad global headlines start hitting us? We are getting hit and haunted by local bad news of slowdown, job cuts, recession and the auto problem. I shudder to think what happens when we get smashed from both the sides.Global headlines are hitting us even now. While there are silver linings like the commodity prices -- especially the crude oil price which has settled around $60 to a barrel -- that are a positive for our economy and companies in terms of profitability, etc. But yes, there have been clouds in the global economy as well. Our thesis has been that whenever there is subdued growth in the global economy, India still does well from a relative growth perspective, as well as from a profitability perspective, because most of the commodities will remain in a range. That is a scenario where Indian corporates will really do well on the profitability side, except for those who are directly dependent on the prices. 

Today the house is divided in terms of whether it is going to be subdued growth or a recession in the next few quarters. To that extent, our belief is that if it is subdued growth, then we are in a better position and will get some levy to correct whatever has happened in our economy because of lower commodity prices. But if it enters into a recession, then obviously there is an impact on our economy as well.


Anything in the midcap space -- the mood, crowd, general view -- that you are happy to go against because maybe sentiments and technicals are having an impact on the stock, business, company or sector?Yes, we have been buying mid and smallcaps over the last few months and we will continue to do so. But it has not been a particular theme of investment as such. There have been some stock-specific opportunities that we are getting every now and then due to external or technical factors. For example, how the market has seen some of the pledges going up or going down, etc. Overall we have been cautious, but we have been investing in mid and smallcaps and that strategy will continue into the future as well.


The earnings numbers have been mixed. Paints companies and retailers have done well. Asian Paints and Berger Paints numbers were good, Trent came out with good set of numbers. Aditya Birla Fashion numbers were not bad, D-Mart same store sales is still growing. But auto sales have plummeted, FMCG companies are feeling the heat. What is happening in the economy?I would differentiate paint from retail or FMCG. Our belief is that FMCG and retail will also feel an impact of slowdown, but it will be very minimal compared to some of the consumer discretionary sections of the business. We will continue to have a reasonable earnings growth, both for FMCG as well as retailers. 

If you look at paints, while they have delivered great numbers last quarter, maybe with the lag, there will be an impact on the paints segment with the economy slowing down because at the end of the day, usage of paints is a discretionary theme and that is also going to slow down going forward."

Media reports suggesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspired stimulus package for the economy may come as early as this weekend boosted the market.

""Prospects of the government considering steps to revive the economy with stimulus measures and recovery in crude prices due to easing recession helped the market. Until prompt and effective actions are announced by the government, the market will react to upcoming economic data which is weak,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The BSE Sensex shut shop at 37,530.33, up 38.80 points, or 0.10 per cent against the previous close. On the other hand, NSE Nifty index settled 18.40 points, or 0.17 per cent, up at 11,047.80.

Commenting on the market’s outlook, Sanjeev Zarbade, Vice President PCG Research, Kotak Securities, said: “The just-concluded earnings season was not encouraging and brokerage houses will soon scale down their full year Nifty and Sensex earnings. This will restrict upside in the near term. Trade disputes, global bond yields and currency will be the main monitorables for the market in the coming weeks.”

28,2019-08-17,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the red, following mixed macroeconomic data amid fears of a global economic slowdown. 

The 30-share Sensex shed 231 points, or 0.62 per cent, to end at 37,350 for the week ended August 16. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty lost 61.85 points, or 0.56 per cent, to end at 11,047.

The market kicked off the week on a bleak note on Tuesday as sentiment got hit after government data showed that India’s factory output growth, as measured by IIP, slowed down for the second straight month to 2 per cent in June compared with 7 per cent in June, 2018 and 3.1 per cent in May, 2019. 

However, the market pared some of the losses in the remaining two days of trade amid hope of a stimulus package for the economy from the government. Investors also took comfort as India’s retail inflation based on CPI eased to 3.15 per cent in July, 2019 from 3.18 per cent in June, 2019 and 4.17 per cent in July, 2018. WPI inflation also eased to a multi-year low of 1.08 per cent in the month of July, on account of cheaper fuel and food items. 

Meanwhile, trade deficit, the gap between imports and exports, narrowed to $13.43 billion in July from $18.63 billion a year ago, helped by a lower oil import bill.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the week. 


Stars of the week
Reliance Industries (RIL) advanced 10 per cent after Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) with Saudi Aramco to sell a 20 per cent stake in the oil-to-chemicals business. Besides, he also unveiled plans for launch of Reliance Jio Infocomm’s broadband services and a partnership with Microsoft to accelerate digital transformation of the Indian economy. Shares of the company jumped to Rs 1,278 as of August 16 from Rs 1,162 on August 9.

Indiabulls Housing Finance (up 9 per cent), Zee Entertainment (up 5.64 per cent), GAIL (up 4.68 per cent) and Power Grid (up 4.53 per cent) were among other top gainers in the Nifty index for the week ended August 16. 


Nifty top loser
With a fall of 5.61 per cent, Eicher Motors finished as top index loser for the week. Wipro, Adani Ports, HDFC, NTPC, TCS, Britannia and YES Bank declined between 3 and 5 per cent. Auto majors came under pressure after SIAM reported that automobile sales in the country witnessed sharpest decline in nearly 19 years in July, dropping 18.71 per cent, which currently also led to almost 15,000 job losses over the past three months. Maruti Suzuki shares slipped around 2 per cent to Rs 5,975 from Rs 6,100.

29,2019-08-19,Asian Paints,"Chief executives of consumer product companies are increasingly grabbing opportunities to join the boards of non-competing professionally-run consumer-facing companies in search of new ideas to grow their businesses.

One recent example of this emerging trend is Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director at Nestle India, joining the board of Asian Paints as an independent director in March this year. Varun Berry, MD at Britannia, is on the board of Page Industries since May last year while Vivek Gambhir, MD at Godrej Consumer Products, is on the board of Metropolis Healthcare since September.

Ullas Kamath, joint managing director of Jyothy Labs, has been serving as an independent director on the board of VGuard Industries since July 2014. The earliest instance of this trend is perhaps that of Anand Kripalu, CEO of United Spirits, serving on the board of Marico from April 2007 to October 2017.

From seeking promoters as independent directors like Harsh Mariwala and Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, consumer-facing companies are now looking at boarding CEOs of non-competing FMCG peers as they have increased their hunt to get independent directors on board.

And there is no conflict of interest.

“All of us are professionals and not entrepreneurs and, therefore, not interested party in the operations,” Narayanan of Nestle said. “As professionals we can be honest on family owned companies, and not dependent on the board membership to make a living. Asian Paints is a well-governed company, so we learn from each other as large organisations. Being on part of good companies is also therefore not a professional risk,” he told ET.

Kripalu of United Spirits said it is a win-win arrangement. “Companies get CEOs to provide an independent view and add value, based on their experience. Equally, the CEO can take back useful ideas to implement in his own company,” he told ET.


Consumer goods sector is facing a lot of disruption amidst digitalisation, increased competitive intensity and advent of ecommerce. The trend is global. CEOs of some of the leading consumer-facing companies in the world sit on the boards of other listed consumer-centric companies. For instance, Tim Cook of Apple Inc is on the board of Nike since June 2016, and Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, has been on the board of IBM Inc since September 2014. Dirk Van de Put, CEO of Mondelez International, serves on the board of Keurig Dr Pepper since April last year, while David S Taylor, CEO of Procter & Gamble Co, joined the board of Delta Airlines this month.

“Every company wants to replicate the velocity of FMCG products, distribution reach, supply chain to support the reach, branding and advertising reach,” said Berry of Britannia.

“FMCG products, by definition, have to be omnipresent and who wouldn't want their brand to replicate that status?”

Incidentally, FMCG is the only sector of the Indian economy to have dominantly depicted this trend. “It may be so perhaps because FMCG talent is highly fungible because of their core focus on consumer,” said Milind Sarwate, former CFO at Marico, who is now an independent director on several boards. “So, any space, except for high technology, finds FMCG talent useful,” he said.

Elaborating on the incentive for an FMCG company CEO to be an independent director on another board, Sarwate said, “There is the exposure to another industry — typically an industry not far too removed from FMCG. This widens the cerebral horizon, encourages a different kind of strategic thinking. Being on another board in a non-executive capacity enables a better understanding of governance processes. The CEO gets a grounding in being a board member — this helps in his or her own individual career. It helps the CEO build new, active and live networks. All that the CEO learns gets ploughed back into his or her parent organisation.”"

With the market still in a bear grip, technical analysts suggest avoiding leverage positions. Defensive picks like Asian Paints, Marico, Infosys, ITC, Titan, IGL and Dr. Reddy’s should be considered on the long side, they said.


Where are We? The Nifty closed in negative territory last week. However, it has managed to hold on to its previous week’s swing low of 10,782 levels which is quite positive in the short term. Based on the last two weeks’ pause in the downtrend, the index appears to be in a short-term uptrend i.e. a bounce or a retracement of the previous down leg. Hence, currently the Nifty is in an uptrend which is a counter trend and likely to bounce back to 11,250 levels.


What is in Store? As per the Elliott wave theory, the Index seems to have completed wave Y, and wave X bounce has ensued. The previous wave X bounce was 78.6 per cent retracement of wave W; hence a minimum of 38.2 per cent retracement in this wave X bounce is expected. So, the conservative target in the short term is 11,250 levels and the reversal in the short-term is pegged at 10,900 levels.


What Could Investors Do? The momentum indicators on the monthly charts have gone into sell mode with a negative divergence indicating that the medium-term trend has reversed from up to down. Since, the volatility in the medium term is likely to remain high; it’s a shortterm traders’ market for long and short trades. It’s just a medium-term downtrend within a long-term uptrend; hence the investors shouldn’t panic as once the market bottoms in the medium term, they can add fresh buy positions to their portfolio.

Short-term traders can buy Bata India, Pidilite Industries, Kansai Nerolac, Apollo Hospitals, Marico and HDFC Bank and hold on to it till the Nifty reaches our short-term target of 11,250 with a stop loss at 10,900 levels."

Technical Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio


Where are We? The Nifty is showing buying support around the 10,830-11,000 zone. This is a high polarity zone where the index found resistance early this calendar year. The Nifty is consolidating between 10,830 and 11,200. Till the time there is no breakout on the higher side, the market may find support around 10,800-10,900 levels. There is huge volatility as well.


What is in Store? On a higher time scale, the market is in a bear grip. Currently, the Nifty is retracing lost ground, the next level of retracement are 11,240-11,382. We are expecting the market to retrace at least 50 per cent of last fall from 11,981 levels before moving down again. The participation will be seen from large-caps and selected mid-caps. Small mid-caps and small-caps may remain under pressure.


What Could Investors Do? As long as the Nifty sustains above 10,800 on closing basis, one can trade with a ‘buy on dip’ strategy with an upside expectation towards 11,350-11,400. Closing below 10,800 will bring the bears back. Avoid buying in small-cap and small mid-caps, remain in defensives and low-beta counters. Weak sectors like auto may bounce back but selling on rally should be the right strategy for them. As the market is in a bear grip, leveraged position should be avoided. Any overnight exposure should be kept within risk appetite. Defensive picks like Asian Paints, Marico, Infy and ITC should be considered on the long side. Bear lovers may take rest till the Nifty is above 10,800."

34,2019-08-19,Asian Paints,"There is very little doubt that the country is going through a structural shift, away from physical savings towards financial savings. The Indian stock market does not have very many listed AMCs, but it does have several good insurers which are benefitting from the financialisation of the country, says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


We may be staring at a slowdown in autos, consumer durables, consumer discretionary but if the latest data from LIC is to be believed, the Indian insurance sector is still growing. What is your stake there?Over the last three years, we have seen flows into insurance, mutual fund flows and PMS. In our own PMS at Marcellus, inflows have been very robust week after week, month after month. There is very little doubt that the country is going through a structural shift, away from physical savings towards financial savings. The Indian stock market does not have very many listed asset management companies, but it does have several good insurers and it is no surprise that as the insurance companies benefit from the financialisation of the country, the stock market has fallen in love with them. 

My reckoning is this love affair with insurance will continue for a prolonged period of time as the financialisation of the country continues. Just one area of concern though is that we are set for a period of interest rates falling substantially -- 100 bps drop in interest rates over the next 12 months is not out of the question. Insurance companies do earn a big part of their profits from financial income from investment income so a big drop in interest rates will hit the profitability of Indian insurers but that is a short-term thing. If you were to take a structural view, having at least one of these insurers in your portfolio, would make sense. In some of our portfolios, we have ICICI Lombard though I personally do not have it.


How is it that you continue to buy only a handful of stocks? In the past also you have said that you would stick to premium quality stocks in this market. When we are looking at that scenario and given where valuations are currently, what really is the return potential for an average investor even if you are looking at a year or more as your time frame?What is interesting is that other than paints and FMCG, we also invest in life insurance and general insurance. What is very clear both in life and in general insurance is that you have no more than say two or three high quality life insurers and no more than two high quality general insurers. The numbers are as few as that and obviously these are massive industries they will grow enormously over the next 10-20 years.

Hence if you can lock into a high quality life insurer or a high quality general insurer -- someone who is building dominant market share in this industry, someone who has got deep competitive advantages -- either because of big data analytics or because of balance sheet strength, then you should be looking at 15-20% consistently compounded returns in spite of the current elevated levels of price to embedded value. 

So, just like with HDFC Bank, we are looking at price to book value. It does not make you any wiser about whether you make money on HDFC Bank. There should be similar holds on say insurers of the ilk of an ICICI Lombard or HDFC Life. These are high quality firms, they have proven over the last decade that they have built enormous competitive advantages and over the next 10 years, they will pull away from the rest of the herd even more than they are currently perceived to have pulled away.


What about pharma? I notice it is something that you are looking at and interestingly you have said focus on pharma companies with global businesses? What are you seeing over there?
The short-term trigger that I have been looking for for the last eight-nine months was the currency slide. I was a little surprised to see the rupee strengthen as we ran through the general election. Obviously we saw the FII flows came in and the rupee strengthened in the run-up to the general election results. But post that, the rupee is sliding as I expected and if you buy my expectation that the rupee will end up somewhere in the mid 70s over 12-month period, then this is a natural comparative trigger for our pharma companies. 

We have to be very careful about this FDA angle and it has become a bit of a black box. It is very difficult to second guess who the FDA will go after and in that context, I find Divi's Lab to be one of the better plays. It did have an FDA problem but it got out of it very quickly and because it does not manufacture end products which go head to head with western Big Pharma. Divi's is a supplier to western Big Pharma. It does not take on the western pharma companies head on. It gives us a lot of confidence that the FDA problems will be muted in Divi's going forward.

 Secondly, it has a dominant global market position in pain killers, around 80% of the world’s diproxen comes from Divi's, well run company, deep comparative advantages, valuations are undemanding to my mind and the short-term trigger over the next 12 months is potentially the rupee giving up say 6-7% of its value. We have Divi's in some of our clients’ portfolios. I do not personally own the stock.


You recently wrote that must ask difficult questions to find companies that can fit into coffee can investment philosophy. Elaborate for the benefit of our viewers on the behavioural aspect.All of us obviously got very caught up on the numbers -- what happened this quarter, what is the ROCE target? Beyond a point, those sorts of things actually tell very little about a company. What you are trying to understand is, is this a promoter who will play a long patient game and build a franchise with deep comparative advantages? If I were to meet the CEO of say one of the coffee can companies this quarter, the last thing I should be asking him how is current business? We all know it is a slowdown. 

So what you are trying to understand from a promoter is how will he allocate his free cash flows. He is generating surplus capital, how will he allocate his free cash flow, how does he choose his top two or three people who will report into the promoter, on what basis are they selected, what are the leading indicators that the promoter uses to monitor his business and what is the set of KPIs -- sort of dash board of indicators that he used to monitor his business? 

If you ask CEOs, promoters those sort of questions, you understand far more about their ability and willingness to play the long game and build a world class franchise. If you ask them about what is going to happen in the next two or three quarters, that is a bit of a nonsense question, there is very little value to be gleaned from that. He will tell you what he wants to hear, that yes things will be difficult but I will put up a brave show over the next two or three quarters. 

So we have tried to build an investment approach by reading 10-15 years of annual reports of a company before we go to see them and then asking questions about how the promoter runs the business, how does he select his top people, how does he allocate capital, how does he build comparative advantages. We found that to be a more interesting way to identify high quality franchises.


Post the rights issue, Vodafone has gone one way, Bharti has gone one way. There is very little to distinguish between them in terms of basic offering. But the way markets are choosing between Vodafone-Idea and Bharti there seems to be a big difference?I am not a telecom expert but if I apply the framework that has worked for us in other sectors -- be it biscuits, paint or indeed telecom -- we see two companies ending up accounting for 80-85% of the sector’s profits. I suppose implicitly what the markets are trying to figure out is who are those two and my reckoning at this juncture it looks as if we are heading for a Jio, Bharti duopoly and that is why I guess markets are a little concerned as to where does a Vodafone fit in a Jio, Bharti duopoly.


Where do you think this monopoly structure is already there and markets are not recognising it? Or it is up for grabs and we must recognise it and invest in that company or that sector?It is not that people do not realise Asian Paints’ dominance. What people do not realise is what is the implication of that for the cash flows that Asian Paints will generate over the next 10 years. So when this company went public in 1982, they already had 50-55% market share and in spite of that, the stock is up 1700x in the 35 years since IPO; around 28% compounded. If you look at Asian Paints at any 10 year slice of the firm since IPO, what you find is quite remarkable. Almost in any 10-year period, they will give you volume growth of 11-12%, revenue growth of 14-15%, profit growth of 18-19-20% and cash flow per share growth of 23-24-25%. Now if you keep compounding and remember the market share gains have not been massive really since IPO, but they are compounding cash flow for share pretty consistently at 23-24-25%. 

If you keep doing that, then even if the current PE multiple in Asian Paints halves over the next 10 years, if the cash flow per share keeps bounding ahead by 23-25% and you add back the dividend, you will still compound pretty comfortably at 20% on Asian Paints. 

I reckon a similar dynamic could end up happening in dominant players in life and general insurance as well. The point I am driving at is the human mind struggles to understand the impact of dominance over a 10, 20 year period and if you were to look at this on a global scale, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Google are examples that if you can continue building dominance or reinforcing your dominance over 10, 20 years, you make loads and loads of money and both the sell side analyst and I think the typical fund manager fails to comprehend the impact of that on your wealth."
37,2019-08-21,Asian Paints,"In the next two or three months, time will come to buy and concentrate more on Nifty40 stocks as compared to Nifty10, says Sandeep Tandon, Founder, Quant Group. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Everyone is convinced that we are in a downturn. The slowdown is real, markets will go down, nobody wants to participate and forget about selling on rally, stocks like Yes Bank and Suzlon and Vodafone are getting hammered despite rallies. Do you think the selling is overdone or is this just the beginning of a long winter?We look beyond fundamental also. Our key takeaway right now is from the risk appetite analytics point of view as well as the liquidity data which we track on a global basis. Let us look at the risk appetite first. In India, the Quant risk appetite indicator peaked out in January 2018 and since then, it is declining. We have seen the risk appetite being actually linked with the slowdown in economy. If risk indices or the risk appetite indicator is drifting down, it is a clear trend globally also and so is the case in India. 

As of last month’s data, it has not bottomed out. It might take two to three months more before it bottoms out and typically risk appetite indicators are linked with the smallcap and the midcap themes because they are more driven by the risk appetite and liquidity. Let us spend two minutes on liquidity also. India liquidity has peaked out somewhere in April 2018 and since then, it is drifting down. 

Globally also, the risk appetite has peaked out somewhere in January and it is still drifting down. But what is more important is the liquidity parameter which actually bottomed out in December 2007. I am looking at the global liquidity analytics point of view. They have been inching up. Both from the good liquidity and bad liquidity point, we believe stimulus liquidity and the private sector liquidity is rising in the developed market as compared to the emerging markets (EM). EM still remains soft on the liquidity. 

As a combination, typically the market peaks out when liquidity and risk appetite peak and it bottoms out in a similar manner. But from the Indian perspective, liquidity started drifting down from July onwards and risk appetite has not bottomed out. This clearly means that from a midcap and smallcaps perspective, some pain is still left. We are closer to the bottom. Maybe in another two or three months’ time, it will really bottom out.


There is this conviction that in two to three months, the sentiment will revive for equity markets. Would it take something from the government’s end, perhaps a stimulus, perhaps a rollback of the FPI surcharge or even some change with the LTCG quantum from one to three years, etc; Would it take all of that to revive and get the animal spirits back into the economy?A lot of expectations are getting built from the government perspective. Even if it comes let us this week, even then it could be a temporary support for the market. But from a medium-term perspective, our data point showcases that some amount of pain is still left and if you really look at from a larger perspective, when we talk about stimulus happening globally, and if I have to break it into different components. One part is bad liquidity or stimulus liquidity which actually started rising from April 2019 onwards and it is expected to move up further. If the Indian government also does something like that, we will not be surprised. So that trend is happening and we expect global liquidity to improve further. 

Maybe emerging markets will take a few more months to bottom out and everything India is also part of the emerging market. Within emerging markets, Brazil is the only emerging market country where the liquidity situation and risk appetite perspective is slightly better. All EMs are largely down.


Midcaps can fall 20-30% before the time markets bottom out in 2-3 months. Are you saying that 15-20% decline is still left in the market?From a broader market perspective, we are seeing some amount of extraordinary shorts or what we measure through our capitulative indicator or the short buildup in the market or fear index in some manner. We are seeing extraordinary shorts. We have seen a Reliance which rallied, as did some of the auto names. Currently, whether it is Axis Bank, State Bank, we have seen highest short positions in five years. 

The fear index is just spiking and some of the individual stocks will start bottoming, not the broader market in general because in the broader market, some pain is still left and maybe stock specific correction is much more likely rather than generalising that the entire market can correct 15-20%.


It is a market which is looking very, very fluid. How does one figure out that the pain in NBFCs is behind us? What are the indicators which will tell you that it is time to buy NBFCs?Coming to NBFCs and stocks in particular, I have to again link these with risk appetite and liquidity, which in particular drives NBFCs. I do not see that is the case on an immediate basis. The fall may not be very big from these levels but there is pain still left in these names. I will like to avoid these names at this juncture.


Why is there a de-polarisation in this market? The fund managers who are not buying Asian Paints, Trent, Bajaj Finance stocks are criticising the fund managers who are buying them, saying that you cannot buy good companies at any price. But those fund managers and those investors who bought these good stocks are the ones having the last laugh and making money in this bear market?I agree with you but if I break the entire Nifty into Nifty 10 and remaining Nifty 40 stocks, I agree that the polarisation has reached extreme levels. Both from the delivery and the market cap valuation perspective or the concentration risk perspective, we believe it has peaked out. 

So whether you talk about Titan or Bajaj Finance or some of the safer names like Berger and Asian Paints, because of the low oil prices are still holding on but most of the stocks have peaked out. In the next two or three months, time will come to buy and concentrate more on Nifty40 stocks as compared to Nifty10.


Going forward, where can one park money? Would you still look for value when it comes to the broader markets and stick to perhaps safe haven names? Since I talked about that, concentration is now moving towards new ideas and the people are trying to identify spaces which are under-owned. Look at classic example. Some of the insurance -- both general insurance and life insurance -- stocks have moved up in the last six months or one quarter in particular. 

So is the case with some of the asset management companies. These are growth areas from the next three, five, 10 years perspective and on a relative basis, they are still under owned. So that is one area where we like to park our money as compared to the private sector banks which is relatively overowned. 

So there are such certain spaces you have to identify. Some of the stocks in cement space, metals from a 2-3 months’ perspective are where you will see value. I will be more focussed on looking at some of the oil marketing companies, maybe the Power Grid or NTPCs of the world, which are closer to the bottom. I would like to look at opportunities in next 40. These are the names which we believe will qualify."
36,2019-08-21,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices opened on a tepid note following mixed cues from global peers with investors awaiting stimulus measures to arrest economic slowdown.

The 30-share index Sensex opened 29.28 points down at 37,298.73, while the 50-pack Nifty opened 1.15 points higher at 11,018.15.

As many as 17 stocks in the Sensex pack were trading in the red in early trade with YES Bank, Tata Motors, Vedanta, Tata Steel, HCL Technologies and Asian Paints falling between 0.70 per cent and 3.50 per cent.

On the other hand, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Sun Pharma were up between 0.50 per cent and 1 per cent.

Sectorwise, BSE Realty and Metal index were down over 1 per cent in early trade, while IT, Teck and Auto indices were up between 0.10 per cent and 0.50 per cent.



Ajit Mishra, Vice President, Research, Religare Broking said, “Investors are pinning hopes on any stimulus measures from the government to lift the sentiments. However, we continue to remain cautious on the markets in the near-term. We recommend that investors should utilise the market correction to accumulate fundamentally strong stocks trading at attractive valuations.”

In a scrip specific development, CG Power plunged 20 per cent for the second straight session after the company on Tuesday said an investigation by its board found major governance and financial lapses, including advances to related and unrelated parties as well as liabilities of the company and the group potentially being understated by hundreds of crores of rupees.

Shares of Oberoi Realty slipped 4 per cent after reports that the income tax department carried out searches at the group and its biggest vendor, Capacit’e Infraprojects, over transactions the authorities considered suspicious. Capacit’e Infraprojects was down nearly 15 per cent.

The Reserve Bank of India will release the minutes of its monetary policy meeting later in the day. Earlier, the central bank had lowered the repo rate by 35 basis points to 5.40 per cent during its August meeting.

The US markets ended in the red on Tuesday as investors weighed up the prospect of fiscal stimulus from some of the world’s biggest economies. Asian markets were trading mixed today as fresh worries about a global recession led investors to dump risky assets, with US President Donald Trump showing no signs of backing down in his trade war with China."
35,2019-08-21,Asian Paints,"Technically we are buying those companies which are double or 2.5 times the size in 2014 but at the same valuation it was in 2014, says Sunil Singhania, Founder, Abakkus Asset Manager. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW.

In one of your notes you are comparing the current market environment with Bollywood movies. So, what does Jo Dar Gaya So Mar Gaya mean?I meet lots of investors as we are raising the second fund which is more midcap and smallcap focussed. It is very difficult even to convince investors. We have tried to use Bollywood because everyone follows it in India and used some famous dialogues to give their perspective to what is happening in India. 


Jo Dar Gaya Woh Mar Gaya means if you are afraid you might as well be dead. I think fear is more now and even in a lot of companies which are now trading at below book, below intrinsic value, below replacement cost largely because the near term outlook is slightly muted, though they still have profits.


So is it time to take risk?It is time to take risk. Unless you do that, how are you going to make money? You can either be an investor who does not want to take risks in terms of profitability, in terms of the economic environment. Then 2017 would have been best for you as the prices then were not worth taking risk for; or you can take risk now when the economy is struggling slightly and the prices of the same stocks have fallen 50-60%.


You picked up an example from Three Idiots to say when others are in trouble, we feel happy?Yes, in Three Idiots there is this dialogue dost fail hota hai to dukh hota hain, but dost first ata hai to jyada dukh hota hai (You feel sad when your friend fails but even sadder when he comes first). We have tried to relate it to the fact that there are some factors in the world which are negative. Trade war issues are impacting some countries; falling oil prices are impacting some countries and then we have countries with negative interest rate scenario. 

If oil prices fall it is positive, if trade wars happen India is the least impacted in terms of their exports but indirectly impacted if we are able to attract those companies to set up facilities in India. Most importantly, India still has a fairly good interest rate with a stable foreign exchange reserves, we have never defaulted ever in our obligations. Our foreign exchange reserves are very stable, we still are net recipients of foreign money. Others’ problems can become a boon for India.


A year from now, can we say the famous punch line of Aamir Khan, “All is well”? We have to all start to convince ourselves that all is not as bad as we are making out to be.


For the economy and for the markets?I would say both will go hand in hand. Markets might as I said precede the economic recovery.


If not a very large permanent bottom, fundamentally we could be reaching a bottom. A 10% selloff could happen because of technical factors, Dow, trade war, Brexit but fundamentally speaking, 10% is there to lose and 30% is what you can gain in the next 12-18 months?I do not know how much to lose or how much to gain. I would say the risk reward is heavily loaded in favour of investments. Your chances of losing are much smaller than the chances of gaining. Another interesting study which we are doing right now is just comparing the conditions of the company in 2014 to 2019. There are so many good companies. I am not talking about companies which are obscure. These are good companies which have market cap similar to what they were in 2014 but the size of those companies in terms of sales, operating profit, debt equity ratio and in terms of net profit is 2-2.5 times of that was in 2014.

Technically you are buying those companies which are double or 2.5 times the size in 2014 and at the same valuation that it was in 2014.


Ultimately when you are buying a stock you are buying future profit. The point that you are making is that if you are buying some good NBFCs and barring consumer durable companies, you are buying them at market cap and profit levels as low as 2013 and 2014?With no business valuation built in, if you buy an NBFC, at one time book, you are giving zero value to the whole franchise.


Gold is suddenly available at the price of silver, to put it very simply?I do not know about that. I do not want to give hopes that prices will go up by 10 times but our competition is now with the alternative opportunities. I do not see real estate is going anywhere. For fixed income, you make 6.5% in fixed deposits and you have 3% as tax. So you are left with 3.5%. The equity from these levels should do significantly better than other asset classes. It is always good to buy when the prices are low rather than when the prices are high.


In a reverse swing segment, this time you are talking about pharmaceuticals. Again this is one of those dusty-rusty sectors. There are genuine concerns at the company level and at the manufacturing level. Why do you stick your neck out and say there is a case to buy pharma structurally and selectively?If you go back in history, the big run in pharma stocks started from 2008 and it lasted till 2016. The genesis of that was the market cap of the whole pharma sector in India was less than that of DLF in 2008. It was a screaming buy with prices very low and there was this huge tailwind because a lot of drugs internationally were going off patent. 

By 2016, you were looking at pharma companies which were trading at 40 times trailing and 50 times trailing and then you had a lot of headwinds; one was the growth slowdown because the generic prices started to fall. There was a big headwind from the US regulatory issues and almost all pharma companies had to go in for import alert or restriction.

As a result of the growth slowdown, PE multiples fell. We are coming to a stage when it is getting interesting. I am not saying that go ahead and buy anything and everything in pharma tomorrow. Pharma has become more individualistic in terms of the companies which you invest in, but the regulatory headwinds are receding because the companies in India have also realised that they cannot use shortcuts.

At the same time, a lot of these plants had issues and two, three years have passed and one by one, they are coming off the issues. Second, the pricing pressure, particularly in the US, is receding. The debt levels of generic companies like Mylan or Teva or some of the other ones have gone crazy and that is the reason for this big deal between Mylan and Pfizer also. 

The ability for them to keep on selling at lower prices is reducing. In fact, prices have started to move up and that should be good for India. We have had a 2-3% fall in rupee which again will be a tailwind for pharma. Valuations are now in your favour. You are getting large companies at 15 PE which was unheard of. 

These are high ROA companies. You do not have concerns of debt being very high in a lot of these pharma companies and so it is becoming interesting. Selectively, it makes tremendous sense to start looking at them and maybe over the next three, six months create some exposure to that sector. 


So buy US facing generic companies?No Indian facing companies are also interesting but they are very expensive. If you look at multinational pharma companies in India, over the last one year, they have moved up 20-25% and they have significantly outperformed the exporting companies which was reverse. There will be some movement again back to this generic companies which are more US facing.


Typically when the slowdown starts, you sell what is expensive. But Asian Paints is sitting at a 52-week high. NBFCs have melted down but Bajaj Finance from the recent low of sub-2000 is at Rs 3500-3600 now. I looked a Trent. The PE multiple has gone north of 80 times. D-Mart is still standing tall. Why good quality stocks which should have corrected have become more expensive? You can always find exception Eicher, Maruti. But those are auto stocks.No, I would say that some of the expensive stocks in other sectors have also taken a beating like Page Industries which were market’s darlings two-three years back. So it has been mixed. One common trait in stocks which have not fallen is that even in such a scenario, they have been able to maintain some growth -- 10%, 12%. Also, remember, the mutual funds money is still coming in. There has been net inflows and obviously portfolio managers do get impacted because they have to show the near term performances on a monthly, daily, weekly basis. There is a natural tendency in these kind of markets where there is so much uncertainty to go into companies or stocks where you are feeling or getting that feeling of safety. 


Is there anything wrong in it because that strategy frankly has made money. Asian Paints was expensive five years ago as was HDFC Bank.There will always be exceptions to those rules but Hindustan Lever for example made zero returns between 2000 to 2008.


ITC it is not giving you returns for the last few years.ITC has not given returns last five-seven years. Obviously, Asian Paints and Hindustan Lever and Nestles are the exceptions but we have seen other companies like Britannia, Page Industries, Eicher and Maruti fall. It has been mixed. As an analyst, there is a concept that the stock prices or the stock valuation should ultimately reflect the future earning potential. 

If there is this case of a company growing at 5-7% and trading at 50 PE, obviously at some point of time, this is going to break down. But if you have companies that are trading at 30-35 PE and still growing at 15-20%, maybe you can justify it. Even in this high PE companies, you will have to distinguish companies which are trading at the levels today because of technical reasons, that is money flowing into those companies. There is no dilution and so the pool of money has to chase a limited availability of stocks. 

You can basically invest in companies which are discounted compared to their future earning potential. We would go in for the second kind of thing. In fact, the second fund which we have launched has three criteria -- 15% or more ROE, 15% or more growth but less than 15 PE. So for us, this basket is untouchable. 



According to your analysis, the reason SIP is doing well is because the millennials in India prefer SIPs. That is a mega trend in making and that is reflective because now markets are cracking but SIPs are slow.I am sure our parents and their parents never even looked at equity as an investment. There were two-three reasons. One, savings were not available. Their whole salary or income used to go in meeting the basic roti, kapda and makaan for their family. Second is awareness was not there and third, at that point of time, equity market was perceived to be like a gamble rather than an investment avenues. 

Over the last 20-30 years, it has changed and a lot of credit is to be given to media, to the mutual fund industry which has popularised this concept of investing regularly and the new generation – one are aware; second, they are making decent salaries even at a young age and therefore they have disposable income to be invested and technology has made it very easy. 

At one click, you can invest. You do not have to fill 20 forms like you had earlier. So, it is a combination of these things and which is very healthy. If we are able to channelise more savings which goes into equity market, the over reliance on foreign flows has already come down and that will come down further. 

This can only go up because now you have this robo advisory and online firms and companies like Alibaba in China are becoming one of the biggest asset management companies in China. Hopefully in India also, we will have two-three-four of those kind of platforms available which will make investing easier and there is now transparency. People trust the mutual fund side or the organised way of investing side.


Alternates are doing poorly . That is also one factor which is at play. Real estate, gold frankly the alternates have not given great returns.I would say that is more cyclical. After four-five years that might change but the investors have realised that they need to have a balanced portfolio. Earlier 90% used to go in real estate, 10%, 15% into fixed deposit and that was it. Now the large investors have created family offices. They know the virtues of having a balanced diversification as far as their savings are concerned. This is also a very positive thing going forward."
38,2019-08-22,Asian Paints,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."
39,2019-08-22,Asian Paints,"We are remaining invested and my colleagues who manage the Asia fund also remained overweight on India throughout this period. We continue to look for stock specific opportunities and see this slowdown as a chance to buy some of the good companies at much better valuations, says Venkatesh Sanjeevi, Senior Investment Manager, Pictet-Indian Equities Fund. Excerpts from an interview.


How worried are you about the slowdown that we are seeing? A lot is hinging on what the government could potentially do to alleviate these concerns.Yes indeed! This slowdown is quite complex. Just the speed and intensity of the slowdown was unprecedented. Same time last year, we were talking about the economy doing quite well across different parameters but today we are at a different position right now. In terms of the intensity, when we talk to people from different parts of the economy like the real estate consultants or maybe the auto sector, they say that they have not seen such a slowdown in years or even decades. So it has been a quite complex slowdown, but you cannot say it is entirely surprising. 

To give a few examples, say commercial vehicle space. Commercial vehicles is an inherently cyclical industry. India saw a good cycle for about four years and you could argue that a cyclical slowdown was due at some point of time. Maybe the commercial vehicle axle load norms which were changed last year, allowing lorries to carry heavier weights, hastened the slowdown because the capacity of the system went up overnight. Similarly, when you talk about the NBFC space. After demonetisation in 2016, the entire space grew very rapidly and the growth was not very well planned. Some players were taking short-term borrowings to lend long term; the asset-liability was not matched and really that sort of growth probably was not sustainable. 

But what is complex is the slowdown in staples. Recently we heard about companies like Parle saying that sale of Rs 5 biscuit is slowing down that seems a bit more strange and complex in this particular scenario. Our own view is that this slowdown is cyclical and more temporary in most aspects and there is some sort of correction which needs to go through in parts of the economy. That takes time and the reforms which took place over the last few years would take time to get digested. So the slowdown in our view it is cyclical in nature. It is temporary and we are still positive on the long term outlook for India. The country offers a number of good quality companies and good quality management and which we are happy to bet on for the long term.


Apart from the FPI tax concerns, what would you like to see and do? What about other reforms?In the last five years, we have seen a number of reforms by this government. Some of it is complete and some of it is a work in progress. We would like the ones which are work in progress to continue and reach a logical conclusion. One area where reform is eagerly awaited is on the direct tax side. The Direct Tax Code is due any time soon. Right now. India has got a massive opportunity to participate in the global manufacturing supply chain with the US-China sort of issues happening. There are companies globally looking for alternate supply, manufacturing arrangements outside China and that is where India can actually step up and offer something of a scale, of a size which countries like Vietnam or Malaysia cannot probably offer. For this to happen, the government needs to be more proactive. Maybe ease the land and labour reforms and so we like to see government take steps on these sides. 

On the second issue, on the taxation side, frankly we do not know what is the actual stance of the government. Whether the increase in taxation was intended or was it an unintentional consequence because they were looking to increase taxes on the rich and super rich? So it will be nice to get some sense of clarity from the government on what exactly is the stance on this particular side. 

Both long-term reforms and shorter term measures are few things which the government has already done and we would like to see some more work on that. 


Would you like to also see fiscal stimulus because there has been a huge debate even today, given some of the comments coming in from the Chief Economic Advisor putting the onus on the private sector. What do you feel versus the government’s argument of maintaining the fiscal deficit ratio and yes what do you feel on that front?Well for a fiscal stimulus to happen, the government needs to have room in the budget which unfortunately is not the case. The government has maintained its part of fiscal consolidation and not just this year but over the last two or three years. And the government also mentioned that a lot of heavy lifting would be done by the central bank where they could personally cut the rates if inflation remains under control. I would keep my hopes on fiscal stimulus in the lower side, given the budget constraint although it could be a short term fix to solve the near-term issues. A bigger question would be what is the longer term view and whether the structural reform process continues or not. That is more important than the short-term fix.


Just a handful of blue chips like Nestle, Unilever, Asian Paints and HDFC Bank are withstanding this fall in the market right now. The rest are all bleeding. As an equity investor what is the strategy to cope with this selloff?The index is trading about 17 or 16 times one year forward which is roughly in line with long-term averages but the headline really does mask a lot of details. Like you mentioned, a few stocks are trading at extremely rich valuations while a few of the stocks are trading at pretty depressed valuations, some of the government owned names like ONGC, NTPC are trading multi-year low valuations. We look at this as an opportunity for active equity investors. Mispricing does come up and this is a chance to align our portfolio to where we think mispricing is significant and once some of these cyclical pressures on the economy normalises, some of the stocks which are mispriced could give fantastic returns. We are on the lookout for opportunities like this. 

We are continuously looking at different parts of the market. Incrementally over the last few weeks, some of our time has gone towards looking at consumer discretionary sector, the automobile sector where stocks have corrected quite a bit. I am not saying that stocks have become cheap now but it has come to more interesting levels. If the cyclical upturn comes in a couple of years, good quality companies which have the moat around their business model could have earnings which are much more than current levels. So I think opportunities are arising there.


When there is nervousness that we may actually see a further fall and further weakness. The broader markets of course, are in clear bear territory right now and have been for a while. Even if you are looking from an annual point of view, where do you see fair valuation currently for the index?See it is very difficult to give an index return estimate like that, We are stock pickers and not the index. The headline number could be very different from stocks which are different. I would refrain from giving a return estimate going forward but compared to let us say a year and a half ago, while most stocks were building in a very blue sky scenario, a high growth and high multiples play, some of it has corrected. If the scenario of cyclical downturn that has changed in a couple of years, the base case is not that India is structurally going to grow slower. Rather, this is a cyclical downturn which will take time to correct and once the correction happens and earnings pick up, a lot of companies can give much better profit growth going forward.


What kind of earnings growth are you expecting? Can we see an incremental pickup when it comes to earnings?Again, it is very different for different sectors. The private sector banks are probably in a better position now in terms of visibility of earnings given that some of them have lower issues on asset quality and they continue to gain market share in the loan segment and overall market. 

The visibility of earnings for private sector banks continues pretty strong as it used to be. For the consumer discretionary sectors, I have seen a slew of earnings cuts over the last few weeks but still a bit of optimism has been built in for the second half. There is a base effect which will come in as we go ahead but ultimately you need the economy to pick up and if the optimism is not reflected in numbers, there could be further earnings downgrades in the near term. 

But again, it is very difficult to predict earnings on a near or short term basis, the volatility could be there based on how things move around but we would rather look beyond the next few months and see where companies can deliver good earnings over the next three or four years.


What is the sense on India, right now post some of the tax concerns? Has the interest waned a bit? Secondly, coming to global dynamics, what is the likely impact that we might see here given that there is still a lot of uncertainty on trade wars and the Fed fronts?In the last couple of months, there has been being some foreign funds outflows -- some called these massive outflows -- but to take a step back for 2019 calendar year, we are still fairly decent positive inflows from the foreign investors. The last two months outflows could be because of various reasons. The valuations probably are fuller after the elections. Maybe there is a set of investors who worry about taxation change. So it is not one broad brush which can paint reasons across all investors. There are multiple concerns which have come out in terms of the economy slowing down and maybe some investors have got worried about that and hence more money is going to other emerging market countries.

But to speak from our perspective, we have not seen any outflow from Pictet India Fund. We are remaining invested and my colleagues who manage the Asia fund also remained overweight on India throughout this period. So from our perspective we continue to look for stock specific opportunities and we look for this slowdown as a chance to buy some of these good companies at much better valuations. 

Your second question was more on global impact of what is happening around the world. Again, different elements can impact flow of money into India but to name one or two, obviously what is happening with the Fed rate and what is happening with the expectation of the Fed rate cuts. And secondly, a general global risk-on or risk-off environment. Over the last few weeks, there has been a sudden risk off so you would have noticed money moving towards safer assets like gold or maybe the government securities. Most emerging markets, not just India, saw outflows in August. A global risk-off environment of course would be a bad scenario for most emerging markets assets.


We are already brittle, what can break us is if something awry had to happen with the global markets. Just looking at the way the yield curve has been moving, it really is a big fear as to when the big two -- UK and US going to face recession. Is that a legit worry you think? It definitely is worrying for overall sentiment. It is worrying for market for money to flow out. But ultimately it has to reflect in the earnings and growth of companies. In Indian market and Indian companies, a large part of the market is reasonably insulated from what is happening in the US. It is a largely domestic driven economy. You could argue that the tech sector in India has got a fair amount of exposure to what is happening in the US and that could call for some sort of downgrades on the tech earnings because US itself is a large contributor to tech earnings. But still, a good part of Indian economy should remain insulated from that and ultimately the earnings of these companies should not be impacted so much."
40,2019-08-27,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty opened higher on Tuesday, mirroring firm cues from global markets amid ease in US-China trade war fears.

US President Donald Trump on Monday flagged the possibility of a trade deal with China and said he believes Beijing was sincere in its desire to reach an agreement, Reuters reported. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 per cent after dropping 1.3 per cent the previous day. South Korea's KOSPI added 0.8 per cent and Japan's Nikkei rose 1 per cent.

Meanwhile, investor sentiment also got a boost following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to transfer a record Rs 1.76 lakh crore dividend and surplus reserves to the government. There are reports that the reserve would either be used to provide fiscal stimulus to a sagging economy or reduce off-balance sheet borrowings. It may also be used to meet the expected shortfall in revenue collections.

Domestic currency too rallied against the US dollar after settling below the 72-mark for the first time in nine months on Monday. The rupee opened 34 paise higher at 71.68 against the greenback.

The 30-share Sensex opened 164 points higher at 37,658, while its NSE counterpart Nifty rose 48.70 points to 11,107.

As many as 25 stocks in the Sensex pack were trading in the green in early trade with Tata Steel gaining the most with 2.77 per cent. It was followed by Tata Motors (up 2.76 per cent), State Bank of India (up 2.34 per cent), IndusInd Bank (up 2.04 per cent) and YES Bank (up 1.75 per cent).

On the other hand, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Asian Paints declined up to 1.64 per cent in early trade.

Barring BSE IT (down 1.17 per cent) and Teck (down 0.95 per cent), other sectoral indices were trading on a firm note. The Capital Goods, Metal, Auto and Power indices were up over 1 per cent each."
41,2019-08-27,Asian Paints,"If the crop is good after a reasonably normal monsoon, rural consumers may start to loosen the purse strings. Similarly, in urban areas too sentiment may improve after the government’s many measures, boosters and push to the economy, says Kunj Bansal, Partner & CIO, Sarthi Group. Bansal says in India there is no lack of money. It is only a question of risk aversion that seems to have come in the last few months and that should go away. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Has the sentiment on the ground turned around?I will answer the question of sentiment from two points of view; one sentiment of market and two, sentiment of the economy or the fundamentals. For the market, it has certainly turned positive in the short term and this I am saying as of yesterday 3:30 pm, looking at the indices. After that, let us keep in mind that another booster shot has been given by the RBI as well. So temporarily yes, sentiments have curtained positive. 

In the medium to long term, the market or the stock movement will always be a function of sustainable financials and fundamentals which is something that we are yet to see. The next visibility will come in the September numbers. Before that, if we want, it will come out in the monthly auto numbers. That is what we need to see. Last Friday, in the mid market there seems to have been some insider buying. But otherwise, till Thursday, when we also had a statement coming in from the chief economic advisor that there will be no stimulus package and the sentiment was continuing to go down. That now, certainly does not seem to be the case. 


We have been talking about the auto stocks. Post all these sops being announced and Maruti in fact seems to be pipped as one that will benefit the most, what do you think?Yes, so it will, especially after the stimulus package that was announced by the finance minister wherein clear three, four benefits were given to the auto sector. 

The ban on government buying has been lifted, the depreciation has been increased, the registration fee hike has been postponed. Of course, the biggest booster to the sector could be GST reduction which was not in the domain of the finance minister to do; that is under the GST Council’s purview. 

If that happens, that will be the biggest booster but pending that, whatever could be done by the finance minister, has been done. That is a positive. The market is looking for those one or two months of automobile monthly sales numbers to show some kind of trend that has bottomed out. We could be very close to seeing that, if not for any other reason for the reasons of base, let us recall that the slowdown started last year around September, October. So, that is something that could kick in. 

If we extend ourselves further to the December quarter, which is traditionally a festival quarter, we have to see if some recovery comes in then. That could come on the back of some good crop effect in the rural areas. While they may not have received the cash, but if the crop is good after the reasonably normal monsoon, hopefully rural consumers will start to loosen the purse strings. 
So will the case be in the urban areas after the government’s many measures, boosters and push to the economy. More importantly, there will be the sentimental impact. 


HUL is at a 52-week high, Bata at a 52-week high, Asian Paints at a 52-week high. Am I missing something? Isn’t there a slowdown in consumption?So let me throw some other stocks, not necessarily that this is investment advice. Godrej Consumer is close to 52-week low. Jyothy Labs close to 52-week low. Dabur here and there. Marico again close to 52-week high. There are two-three things. One, as we all know, the stock price performance as well as market in the medium to long term will always be a function of financials. Added to that, is the demand or the buying interest in that. 

In case of Asian Paints, it is clearly the financials. In fact, the number that the whole sector -- not only Asian Paints but other paints companies also -- gave in the June quarter was a surprise and based on some informal discussions and checks, it looks like the secondary paint market sales for replacement, repainting and all are seeing good demand even now. 

I would not be surprised if September quarter numbers turn out to be good.. For other bellwether stocks, probably being the market leaders, it is the money which keeps going to the safe haven and that is where we see some of the 52-week highs in some other stocks.


Bond yields are down. The 10-year closed at about 6.5%. It should inch up. There could not be a massive selloff but it should settle at 6.35%, 6.4%. Will this add as an impetus for PSU banks further?I do not know. I mean PSU banks is a very difficult space…


Not the smaller ones. First, there was recapitalisation; second, RBI dividend. Money is available now and after that there is a rally in bond yields.So two things – one, although you are specifically asking about PSU banks but one thing comes to my mind is can this inflow of RBI money to the government be now used an excuse by the government to announce that now we will not be going in for foreign borrowing? You remember post budget, that had become a consensus issue.


The sovereign bond is off the table. The finance minister said on Friday that it is off the table.That is a good thing that has happened. Now coming to PSU banks, in the shorter term yesterday we saw some rally post market RBI announcement. We can again see some trading rally but these are very good traders friends. I am sure the traders know their stop losses. But on a medium to long term investing, unfortunately the financial numbers, the fundamentals themselves tell us that the stocks probably are not going to give any sustainable return from now on also. 


You were saying earlier about the factors that may lead to a pickup on the rural front. Names like Britannia have given numbers that show they have been impacted by the slowdown. Do you feel the same factors apply for expecting a rural pickup that we may start to see getting reflected in these earnings as well?What I feel is that the pickups happen for two reasons. One is the actual money or actual increased earnings in the hands of people -- be it rural or be it urban; Two, simply the sentimental or the wealth effect. If because of the reasonably good progress of monsoon, an impression comes to farmers mind that his crop is normal, he will start spending. In my view in India there is no lack of money. It is only a question of risk aversion that seems to have come in in last few months and so that will go away."

44,2019-08-28,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Fears of recession in the US, sparked by deepening inversion of the US bond yield curve along with losses in index heavyweights sent Sensex and Nifty reeling ahead of the expiry of futures and options contracts. 

The US yield curve inverted further to levels not seen since 2007, rekindling fears of a looming recession and fuelling a selloff on Wall Street overnight.

BSE benchmark Sensex plunged over 300 points intraday, but recovered to settle at 37,452, down 189 points or 0.50 per cent, led by a rebound in HDFC and gains in IT stocks.

NSE Nifty settled the day at 11,046, down 59 points or 0.53 per cent. 

Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak Securities said, ""Nifty has been consolidating in the range of 10,700-11,200 since the past few weeks. 11,200 acts as a very strong resistance and crossing the same is critical for the index to resume its uptrend. On the downside breach of 10,800 is expected to infuse further selling pressure.""

Concerns over the state of Indian economy stayed as analysts believe government’s dole-outs may not do much to prop up demand. ""Band-aid announcements from the government will not help revive the economy,"" India Ratings said on Wednesday. Moreover, the GDP numbers slated to be released on Friday are most likely to be poor.

As per a Reuters poll, the Indian economy is likely to expand at its slowest pace in more than five years in the April-June quarter, driven by weak investment growth and sluggish demand.

In the Sensex pack of stocks, only six ended in the green with HCL Technologies (up 2.61 per cent) leading the charge, followed by Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HDFC, TCS and Asian Paints. ITC was flat. 

YES Bank stock dropped the most with 6.84 per cent. The stock witnessed heavy selling pressure after Moody's Investors Service downgraded the lender’s long-term foreign-currency issuer rating to ‘Ba3’ from ‘Ba1’, concluding the review for downgrade initiated on June 11. The bank's board on Tuesday said it plans to consider fundraising when it meets on August 30.

BSE Smallcap index declined mostly in line with Sensex at 0.64 per cent while BSE Midcap index slipped 0.92 per cent.

Barring IT, teck and realty, all other indices on BSE shut shop in the red with metals declining the most at 3.40 per cent.

Globally, MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.1 per cent, dragged down by European shares. The broad Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.3 per cent, with bourses in Paris and Frankfurt falling 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively."
46,2019-08-29,Asian Paints,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended in the red on F&O expiry on Thursday amid fears of global recession and concerns over US-China trade woes.

“The market remained weak on the back of uninterrupted selling by foreign institutional investors in cash market despite the rollback of additional surcharge by the government. F&O expiry also added to the weakness,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Technical Research, Kotak Securities.

45,2019-08-29,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices ended on a weaker note for the second day in a row, led by losses in financial stocks on expiry of August futures and options contracts and fears of a global economic slowdown.

Hopes of reconciliation on the trade war front failed to infuse life into the domestic stocks.

Asian markets trimmed gains and European shares along with the US futures edged higher after China’s commerce ministry said escalating the trade war won’t benefit either side and that it was more important to discuss removing the extra duties.

BSE's flagship index Sensex ended 383 points or 1.02 per cent lower at 37,069 while NSE barometer Nifty ended at 10,948, down 98 points or 0.89 per cent.

The advance-decline ratio on BSE stood at 3:5, meaning for every three shares that traded, two declined.

Midcap stocks proved to be more resilient to this selloff than Sensex. BSE Midcap index shed 0.17 per cent while BSE Smallcap fell 0.62 per cent.

YES Bank, down 3.61 per cent, was the worst performer in the Sensex where 20 out of 30 stocks settled in the red. State Bank of India, HDFC, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were among other top losers.

Vedanta, NTPC, ONGC, Asian Paints and Infosys were among other stocks that put up a good show, rising up to 2.72 per cent.

Shares of fraud-hit CG Power hit upper circuit limit of 5 per cent after the board sacked Gautam Thapar as its chairman with immediate effect. 

Sector-wise BSE Bankex and BSE Financials declined the most followed by energy. Healthcare and metals rose the most with 1.50 per cent and 1.27 per cent, respectively.

Globally, signs that Italy's latest political drama was over and hopeful noises from Beijing in the trade war pushed Europe's share markets higher on Thursday and paused the relentless steamrollering of global bond yields. European shares rose nearly 1% early on led by a 1.7% jump.


Expert View

Nifty settled with a cut of nearly a per cent on the F&O expiry day, after failed attempts to cross hurdle at 11,150 in the last two sessions. Volatility remained high especially in F&O counters due to unwinding and rollover of positions while the broader indices remained under pressure. In the absence of any major domestic event, global cues will continue to dictate the market trend. Indications are in favour of further consolidation in Nifty thus traders should focus more on stocks selection and trade managementAjit Mishra Vice President, Research, Religare Broking"

52,2019-08-31,Asian Paints,"The bulls made a smart comeback on Dalal Street during the week gone by after two weeks of losses, as the government announced a slew of measures to stem the economic slowdown.

BSE Sensex gained 631 points, or 1.72 per cent, for the week to end at 37,332, while Nifty added 193 points, or 1.79 per cent, to 11,023. 

The equity indices kicked off the week on a firm note after the government rolled back the enhanced surcharge on foreign portfolio investors on August 23, and also unveiled a slew of measures to boost the economy. RBI’s announcement of a Rs 1.76 lakh crore surplus transfer to the government further lifted sentiment.

The Union Finance Minister’s promise on Thursday to announce two more big steps to pump-prime the economy kept the momentum going.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that created buzz on Dalal Street all through the week:

BPCL (up 7.86 per cent), IndusInd Bank (up 6.51 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (up 6.25 per cent) were other top gainers in the pack. BPCL hogged limelight after the oil retailer announced plans to invest Rs 1,500-1,700 crore in building a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh by 2022. Media and entertainment stocks gained traction after the government approved 26 per cent FDI to digital media. This was previously applicable only to print media.

Top Nifty losers

0,2019-09-02,Asian Paints,"Stock markets are witnessing increased volatility, which is evident from the significant jump in the average VIX or volatility index levels. The fear index jumped 30% between August 2018 and August 2019, relative to -4% between August 2017 and August 2018. When market conditions are erratic, the systematic investing plan (SIP) mode of investing is highly recommended, as it allows you to invest small amounts every month.

The SIP mode of investing helps in minimising risks and promotes disciplined investment planning. It encourages regular savings that helps in wealth accumulation and proves very useful for risk-conscious investors. The arrangement enables investors to operate in both rising and falling markets and thereby helps them derive benefits of volatility. SIPs are generally used while investing in mutual funds where the units are purchased regularly using the fund’s NAV and it averages out the buying cost of units.

Experts believe volatility in equities will continue unless corporate earnings improve at the macro level. Under such conditions, direct equity investors can use the SIP route to invest small amounts in stocks at different intervals, thereby taking advantage of the unpredictable stock price movements. Most online trading platforms offer SIP in direct equities and allow investors to fix either the amount to be invested or the number of shares to be purchased at pre-defined intervals for a fixed tenure.

The online system automatically executes the transaction on the date defined by the investor. The intervals can be weekly, fortnightly or monthly. For example, an investor can decide to buy 10 shares every month or can fix Rs 5,000 to be invested every month. In the first case, the monthly invested amount will be Rs 2,520 (Rs 252 X 10 shares), if the share is trading at Rs 252 on the trigger date or the specified date of purchase. On the other hand, if the investor chooses to invest Rs 5,000 every month, the system will purchase 19 shares, utilising Rs 4,788 out of the allocated amount of Rs 5,000. The above calculations are just for illustrative purposes and does not include the impact of the brokerages or commissions that are charged by the respective trading platforms.

Data for 900 stocks with a market cap greater than Rs 500 crore were studied to identify stocks in which SIP investments have comprehensively outperformed lump sums across 1-year, 2-year and 3-year time frames. Closing prices on the last trading day of every month is considered, starting from August 2014. It is assumed that 10 shares are purchased every month and final investment value of the cumulative number of shares is calculated at the closing price of 19 August 2019. Annualised IRR is used for SIP returns and CAGR is used for lump sum returns.

Let us demonstrate the functionality of SIP in direct equities for a 3-year tenure using Apollo Hospitals Enterprise. In 36 months, 360 shares are purchased between August 2016 and July 2019 (10 shares every month X 36 months). The price of Apollo Hospitals on 19 August 2019 was Rs 1,484 and therefore, the market value of investments works out to Rs 5.34 lakh. The annualised SIP IRR works out to 15%. On the other hand, if 360 shares are purchased at the beginning of the tenure, which is on 31 August 2016, the purchase value would have been Rs 4.85 lakh (360 shares X Rs 1,348.85). The three year CAGR for lump sum works out to 3.2%. We found 18 stocks that have comprehensively delivered SIP annualised returns that were higher than CAGR lump sum returns across the three defined time frames. Let us look at four out of 18 stocks that not only have sound fundamentals, but their future price movements are expected to remain volatile due to their current rich valuations. As SIP works well when price movements are expected to remain erratic, systematic investments can be considered in such stocks.


Small, regular investments yield more

Investing through SIPS helps in minimising risks and encouraging regular savings.

Asian Paints
The company has reported strong numbers in the June 2019 quarter. However, analysts feel the current valuations fully captures the company’s growth potential and the market outlook is unexciting. The company has already surpassed Bloomberg’s estimated one-year target price and therefore, there is a likelihood of volatile price swings in the future. 


Marico
The company has maintained market leadership and posted strong volume growth in both domestic and international operations in the June 2019 quarter. The SIP mode is preferred here as analysts feel that the current valuations reasonably mirror the long-term growth opportunities and potential earnings fluctuations from the overseas operations.


Pidilite Industries
In the June 2019 quarter, recovery in volume growth and price hikes helped the company to deliver strong profits. In terms of valuation, ICICI Direct believes that the current price discounts major key factors like strong revenue, earnings growth along with strong balance sheet with healthy return ratios.


SRF
The company has reported strong numbers in the June 2019 quarter. A recent Edelweiss report believes that the chemical business will continue to see robust growth and overseas expansions will benefit the packaging films segment in the future. However, the report mentions concerns regarding over-supply in packaging films and auto sector slowdown, which will limit future price performance."
1,2019-09-02,Asian Paints,"BENGALURU | KOLKATA: Six in 10 Indian executives are overweight, reveals the Corporate India Fitness Report 2019 by health and fitness platform HealthifyMe, shared exclusively with ET.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Fit India movement’, rolled out last week, has therefore come at an opportune time as corporate India is struggling with physical fitness and lifestyle diseases.

Companies are responding to the challenge by making physical fitness a priority like never before & increasingly taking the app route to help employees tackle these problems. 

Organisations such as Cognizant, Godrej, Accenture, Infosys and American Express are either launching their own mobile applications or tying up with external providers to better engage with employees on fitness as well as measure the outcomes.

“Long working hours, irregular meals, intake of junk food, and lowered physical activity have made India Inc employees unhealthy and prone to diseases related to cardiovascular problems, cancer, high cholesterol, strokes, etc,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director at Max Healthcare.




Health apps not only catch the attention of the predominantly younger workforce but also provide specific data for actionable insights, he said. The Corporate India Fitness Report 2019, compiled after reviewing the diet and activity levels of nearly 60,000 working professionals in more than 20 companies over a period of 12 months, reveals that 63% executives were overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 23. BMI measures body fat among adults based on height and weight.

HealthifyMe has partnered with more than 75 companies in India, including Infosys, Nestle, HSBC, Asian Paints and P&G, said CEO Tushar Vashisht. The app includes Ria, an AI nutritionist, and more than half the app’s users send messages to Ria about what to eat, how to work out and how to smoke less.

Accenture has launched the Zoojoobe app, offered by external provider RoundGlass, as part of its ‘Truly Human’ programme, to help employees create better micro habits towards a healthier lifestyle. Within a year, the number of users has more than doubled.

“The app nudges employees towards doing things as basic as drinking more water and staying more active to forming better habits towards healthy eating and fitter living. There are more than 350 habits that employees can choose from,” said Rohit Thakur, lead of human resources, Accenture in India.

The company’s employees are also competing with each other to count daily steps taken and forming groups on similar interests such as running and biking.

Till date, more than 18,780 health challenges have been taken up by the employees.

American Express India has partnered with digital medicine platform Doctor Insta to provide round-theclock healthcare consultation services to employees and dependents. Over the past six months, active downloads of the app have increased more than 20% and the number of users has increased 30-40% year-on-year, said Kabir Julka, chief human resources officer, American Express India.

At Godrej, employees can track daily physical activities and teams can collectively achieve their fitness goals through the Feet2Fit app.

“The current trends of people subscribing to health-on-the-go apps and using their smartphones to track steps, record running mileage and monitor their calorie intake, encouraged us to roll out a fitness app. It also made it easier for team members to join activities on the app from across geographies,” said Sumit Mitra, head of group HR and corporate services, Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies.

HealthifyMe also has an ongoing partnership with Cognizant for Cognizant Health Challenge, a gamified digital programme that focuses on physical activities such as number of steps, hydration and dietary habits.

More than 40,000 employees participated in one of the recent 12-week programmes, recording about two billion steps taken, 184 million calories burned and a total weight loss of 9,840 kg, said Satish Jeyaraman, vice president of human resources at Cognizant."
2,2019-09-03,Asian Paints,"If we cross 11200 I think we can have a very good short covering rally can take us to 11600--11700 also, where everything will be forgotten because it would be 1000 points from the base, says Atul Suri, Founder & CEO, Marathon Trends - PMS. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


In summer of 2019 when Prime Minister Modi got re-elected, we thought that it would be an exciting summer. It has turned out to be a painful period. What has gone wrong? The state of the mid and smallcap stocks, reminds one of 2008. Excruciating pain, one-sided fall, complete absence of buying and only selling?
Absolutely. Today it is exactly three months from the Nifty top we had at 12100. Let us look at these three months of underperformance; we hear a lot of headline global news, you get a lot of these links of WhatsApps -- inverted yield curve, trade war, Trump tweets, Brexit problems. But the global markets are doing pretty okay! The US is 4% from lifetime highs. But in the same three months, we are down almost 9-10%. The smallcap index is down 17% after a dismal 12-18 months. There are pockets of problems in the markets. However, the bad news on economics, 5% GDP growth etc the market had been expecting to some extent.


This is yesterday’s data?Yes, because the fact is out of the 25 global markets we track, barring Argentina which has a problem, we are the worst performing market on a three-month basis. The markets are beaten down in anticipation of data, yes it can be a little worse than what was expected etc those are semantics, you will have a 100 point Nifty move etc. That is fine but the fact is the bad news was expected in the market. But what after this? The market is looking for action by the government. What I have been observing is a sense of denial. Till about a week ago, some bureaucrat was saying we are the fastest-growing economy in the world and that bubble has to burst. The feel, the need for some positive action is very important because as we know, this is a man-made crisis. There is no structural problem. Globally markets are fantastic, there is a lot of chatter but there is really no problem; the crude is below $60, bond yields are tanking, interest rate cuts are happening in India. So, it is very important to see government action. 

Let me out this in terms of markets and Nifty. We are sub 11,000. I personally think 11200 is a very important level for the market. We get to 11,100, 11,200 and we got exhausted and came back and this has been happening for the last one month. Till we go past 11,200, we will remain in the bear grip. Mind you bear market or bear shorting is tremendous. If you start looking at the data, there is a lot of bear hammering that is happening. To make the bears cover, you have to make them uncomfortable and they are sitting on pots of money that they have made in the last three months. 

It is only beyond 11,200 that we will be out of the woods. For me, that level is very important. But coming to the earlier point, the market is extremely oversold, yes bad news is expected, yes, things are not perfect hunky dory but the silver lining is if we see good government initiative, things will improve. It is just a sentiment issue. Everyone-- who is not even connected with the market is talking of 5% GDP.


Everybody has a view on slowdown, whether it is real or not.Absolutely. 


Are you saying that worst of the newsprint is behind us? Markets are a forward looking beast. You never make money based on yesterday’s data. How much of the bad news is in the price?A substantial part of the bad news is in the price. That is why even though bad news comes, we will sell off but beyond a point, recovery will come. We will fight, we will try to take out this 11200 which I think is going to be a very important level for me to watch. And the sectors that I would look for or spaces that I would look for are essentially banking.


A common friend, Mr Jhunjhunwala told us exactly the same time last week that he feels that 10500 thereabout is the bottom for the Nifty.It is possible. It is possible but the thing is that bad news is economically things are not going to turn by itself. You will have to see assertive action by the government or the government needs to be seen acting. So I personally think that this market really depends on what sort of government actions, what voices, what sort of body language is visible.


So are we in for a long winter?It will take us time. It is not going to be a turnaround. Yes, if we cross 11200 I think we can have a very good short covering rally can take us to 11600--11700 also, where everything will be forgotten because it would be 1000 points from the base but to take out 11200 is very important. Why I am saying this is because globally things are good. Global markets are strong, the macros are okay, it is just that we need to be able to come out of this bear grip. 

Why I am talking about bear grip is because if you look at data for the last three months, the FIIs have some Rs 23000-24000 crore negative but the DIIs have put in Rs 30,000 crore positive. Our net institution inflow is there of Rs 10,000 crore.


And I am not throwing in LIC and EPFO. If I add that data, the net liquidity from institutional investors maybe surplus?
Right. And the Nifty short position by FIIs is at record. These oversold levels I last saw in 2013 and beyond that I feel when you have such markets pull to one side very often, if there is no disastrous news, it is something beyond our control. If there is some disastrous news, it is a different story; but if there is no incremental crisis, the markets will spring back by the sense that they have been pulled to one side far too much. 


Let us understand the scenario here. Scenario number one, we do not see a rally but we see a mild recovery. Scenario number two, this is the best which we will get for the year and now there could be a gentle or a gradual decline and we may retest the earlier lows. Which scenario do you think will play out?I personally think scenario number one will play out. The reason is that the 11,200 level I have been mentioning will break out not based on something spectacular happening in India but rather global markets. I am very bullish on the US and European markets and in spite of Brexit happening, the UK markets. I feel the global markets look very good and if global markets do rally from here, there is no reason why we will get so stuck or so oversold. That is for me the biggest silver lining there is.

In India, bad news will continue. The GDP numbers are not going to turn around. They can get even worse next quarter but the important thing is what sort of government action is going to happen? If there is no government action or if there is no government pronouncements, that will be a big negative.


How come markets are not reacting to what has come out in the last 10 days? FPI tax has been reversed but FIIs have not come back. PSU banks merger has been announced. Instead of denial, there is a widespread acknowledgement from the government that we need to do something. They are talking and they are walking. Why have the markets not reacted?It will take time. They have been silent for far too long. The government should have fixed the FPI tax as soon as they realised that they had made a mistake. But it took them two months to even say something about it. They have been in denial and the fact is if you have been in denial,a band-aid is not going to solve it, you will have to put in a plaster. So a lot more activity is needed. Communication is a very important part of the game which I find was lacking with this government.


What are you doing for your clients long, short?Essentially I am a PMS, so I cannot be short. I am also sitting fairly invested, and my cash levels are low, but my largest allocation is to financials in the private bank space and consumption. Consumption actually was in a very difficult phase two to three months ago. Everybody was talking about how it is over in consumptions. But the numbers that came out for some of the consumption stocks which we have in our portfolio have propelled these stocks to lifetime highs. Lots of these stocks are touching lifetime highs. They actually have really helped the portfolio in the last month. 

Financials or what you call the private sector space, surprisingly even the larger private sector banks, have been a little on the back foot. The cause of the recent pressure on the market in the last one month surprisingly has been due to private sector banks -- the Yes Banks and RBLs. But even among the larger players like the marquee HDFC Bank, it has not been a pretty month. Otherwise, this is a stock that always stands out and is the first to rally. You are not seeing those kind of things. For my portfolios, the last month has been spectacular as far as the consumption revival is concerned, because we were overweight consumption.


You were plus in the month of August?That is right. It has been a positive month for us in spite of the index being negative.


You were not short?No, we are not short and we are 95% invested. You are able to muster positive returns in a very difficult scenario if you are in the right spaces and for me the right space, the multi-year theme for India is consumption. This is a very long term trend and we are trend investors. 


95% of the market is going down. You are betting on that minuscule portion which is going higher. You are betting against the trend and a trend watcher never does that!See essentially one is the market trend where I take a view on the market and that is if I am trading the index but I am trading bottom up in stocks. What you said is right that my universe two years ago would have been 50% of the market but as this long down phase is happening, sadly or worryingly this universe is compressing and you are right that we are all stuck. All those who are doing well in this scenario are stuck to that 5% of the market.


Does not make sense to do that. The last man standing will not stand forever?No, essentially very often stocks that fall less in falling markets are leaders of the next bull market. If markets revive, these stocks could actually be the leaders and there is always this thing that oh! they are very expensive, they have run up too much but I have personally seen and I have been veteran of many cycles -- stocks or sectors. Look at insurance as a sector. It is standing out so well in this market and then you go down and look yes earnings have improved. Yes there is under ownership. These things will set out and as a portfolio manager, it is your job to protect the client’s capital. These are the spaces where hopefully the drawdowns are low and when markets revive, they are the first leaders to fall less in falling markets and the moment markets go up, it will be the first to go up is what you are really trying to achieve.


Great point so I would spend some time here. The markets will recover -- today, tomorrow, this month, next month. One day, this bear market will become a bull market. You are making a case for the narrow stocks which everybody is criticising -- a case of sour grapes for those who don’t own them. So whether it is Nestle, Asian Paints, some insurance names or a couple of private banks?They will do well and you have to look at things across cycles. If the markets suddenly revise you will find that in the beaten downs midcap and smallcaps, we will have 5% gains but it is important to look at portfolio performance across the cycle. Two years ago, all the 
kachra (junk) stocks were the best performing stocks. If you held all these stocks, you would be punished. But when the cycle turns and you just cannot assess somebody on an upcycle, you have to go through a complete cycle and when the cycle ends, you realise what are the compounding stocks. 

Net-net in India, big wealth has been created by 50 compounders and these have always been expensive. I am not talking about a phase, I am talking about cycle over cycle 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. That is what we are there for. Ultimately, wealth is created in these phases.


Like a common friend of ours who always says that a flat at Peddar Road will always be more expensive that one somewhere in the suburbs of Mumbai?It is unfortunately a reality. We get seduced into that phase but the thing is that if you are patient and having in fortunate India we are a certain generation like our generation has seen a few cycles and we hopefully we learn from every cycle you realise that these have been the wealth creators."
8,2019-09-04,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: Of the top stocks that touched record high this month on BSE, more than half are consumption-linked, hinting that the slowdown in the consumption space has been selective and temporary and not broadbased and permanent in nature.

Of the 18 BSE500 stocks that have scaled fresh record highs so far in August, eight were linked to consumption: Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare, Nestle India, Marico, Hindustan Unilever, Berger Paints India, Asian Paints, Bata India and Trent.

Ironically, BSE FMCG and consumer discretionary goods and services indices are down 7 per cent and 11 per cent so far this year. Both these indices had hit record high levels last September.

Even though high frequency indicators and channel checks point to a slowdown, experts say it is concentrated in a few sectors and areas. Barring those, all is not lost. 

“Consumption has not really slowed down. The patterns are changing in consumption. People have been slow in taking loans, but they have been aggressive in investing in mutual fund SIPs and insurance products,” said Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director, KR Choksey Investment Managers. 

“People have been buying premium products while low-end products are seeing a slowdown. Bulk consumption items are slowing down, but premium products are doing well,” said Choksey.

Parle Products, the biscuit bellwether and maker of Parle-G, Monaco and Marie, has just hit the alarm button. The country's biggest biscuit producer that employed 1 lakh workers said it could end up mass-firing some 10,000 employees if the slowdown pain does not subside. 

It is not Parle alone which is facing the heat. Amid weak consumer demand, Britannia's net profit sank 3.5 per cent in June quarter. 

The auto sector has been the worst hit. The passenger vehicles industry in Asia’s third-largest economy suffered its worst sales performance in nearly 19 years in July as a slowing economy, higher ownership costs and floods in some states deterred buying decisions.

Sales tumbled 31 per cent to 2,00,790 vehicles last month from a year ago, data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) showed. This was the worst sales performance since a 35 per cent drop in December, 2000.

“Consumption has slowed down, especially on the discretionary side than the auto side. Now if I look at the consumption piece minus auto, then the numbers do not look that bad,” said Jyoti Vaswani, Chief Investment Officer, Future Generali Life Insurance. She pointed out that last year the consumption growth numbers were very high. 

“All the FMCG companies have reported 8 to 10 per cent volume growth. Now on a high base, if you are growing at 6-7 per cent, that is a good number and you are getting back to a normalised growth rate,” she said.

While consumption may have slowed down in pockets, it remains a promising long-term story in the world’s second-most populous country, with varied demographics and rising middle-income group.

“The way it is being made out that there is a huge slowdown is not the case in reality. If you look at the biscuit company itself, the volume growth was there in last quarter numbers and it does not take away the fact that there is some slowdown. But is it as bad? Probably not,” she said."
3,2019-09-04,Asian Paints,"There are certain clear signs of an economic slowdown, though its severity is arguable. But a key element almost completely missing in the market is a ray of hope — and retail investors will do well to look for it in large-sized companies. Large companies have the strength to weather demand fluctuations in the industry in which they undertake business. 

In contrast, mid- and small-sized companies are more vulnerable to market shocks given the scale of their business and balance sheet. Hence, it makes great sense to be with those schemes which have a high exposure to large-sized companies. Among such schemes, Mirae Asset Large Cap is a solid performer. Almost 85 per cent of the scheme’s portfolio is invested in large-sized companies. In the past eleven years of its existence, the scheme has progressively performed better not just with respect to its benchmark index Nifty 100 TRI (total returns index) but also with respect to its peers. This is true in most market cycles. 

Presently, the scheme’s fund managers — Neelesh Surana, Harshad Borawake, and Gaurav Misra — have carefully stuck to the fund house’s investment philosophy of investing in companies with high or stable return ratios and stable or rising cash flows from business. They have enhanced exposure to consumption-related ideas which include retail focused banks. In the past five-year and ten-year periods, the scheme has given 11.3 per cent and 15 per cent returns while its peers have given average returns of 7 per cent and 9.9 per cent, respectively.

10,2019-09-04,Asian Paints,"We would advocate investors to take fresh positions in a safe sector such as IT because rupee depreciation is providing a cushion to their earnings, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities. Excerpts from an investment in ETNOW.


What is your view with respect to the kind of mood that we are seeing on the Street? Do you believe we will continue to remain in a bit of a limbo?It is quite possible that markets tend to hug this line of 11,000 thereabouts with 200 points here and there, until we see improvement in terms of corporate earnings. We know that the macro figures that are coming out are not too conducive for the markets and therefore we will have a prolonged period of sideways movement now that the market has corrected quite sharply since the budget days.


What about the market? Any beaten down spaces where it has been raining losses and where there is an opportunity to buy?We would not advise people to get into stocks that have fallen far too much or sectors where the decline has been too large, because a lot of risks still exists in the market. While we do foresee that these risks will take some time to really get out of the system, it is better to remain safe in a market which is already beaten down and is likely to go down. Even if the forecasts are steady, that risk element does suggest that the downside cannot be ruled out. In such a situation, a safe sector such as an IT is what we would advocate investors to take fresh positions in because rupee depreciation is providing a cushion to the IT company earnings.

Also, one can look at some sectors which have the export touch. There are quite a few companies within that space and I would reckon that the other best space would be the banking space, particularly the efficient private sector kind of banks names can be looked at. Right now, the public sector bank positions are in a flux because we do not know the merger ratios yet announced for those 10 banks. Until then, it is going to be a little choppy and I would advise investors to stay away from the public sector banks for the time being.


Some decorative paint companies have reported fairly impressive volumes but is this growth sustainable for some of the key players? What is your outlook on Asian Paints, Berger Paints, etc.?So the good news for the paint companies is that when you have normal monsoons, you would have typically better outlook in terms of volume growth and that seems to have happened so far. The other bit of good news for the paint companies is that on the costing side, crude oil prices have fallen. Not only that, even titanium dioxide prices have over the several months been falling and that eases the cost pressure for the companies. Consequently, they can push in more volumes by doing small pricing changes on the lower side. 

It remains to be seen whether this hypothesis really gets played out post the monsoon during the festival season and the reason why I am saying so is because we have seen the automobile sales not doing too great in relation to the previous years’ numbers. There is a huge amount of inventory correction that is going on and that is a pointer to the fact that there is a massive slowdown in consumption, particularly for these high value items and particularly where discretionary spends are involved. In such a situation, the play out needs to be watched but the net assessment is with cost structures being taken care of, even a small volume growth can help boost margins as well as profitability.


What do you make of the fundamental news flow on Sun Pharma? SEBI has ordered an enquiry into the books of Sun Pharma?It is obviously bad news for the stock. Corporate governance is something that is quite valued by most investors. In fact, it is becoming the norm for most of the companies. The corporate governance standards have to be distinctly higher. Even for a large company like Sun Pharma, despite its earnings propensity, corporate governance is a key determinant of valuations for a lot of investors. 

In such a situation, until the name of Sun Pharma and its promoters are cleared, we will see periodic bouts of selling into the company. Nevertheless, on the fundamental side, it has its own business challenges. Pharma companies are facing huge price erosion in the US market for generics and Sun Pharma particularly in the past has not been able to digest its two large-ticket acquisitions -- Ranbaxy and Taro. 

Taro was initially quite successful but it is becoming a drag lately and that is getting reflected in the price of the stock as well. In fact, something similar is visible with most of the pharma companies. We would be very cautious with most of these pharma companies which in the past have been associated with one-drug- wonder sales in a particular year in the past. That phenomenon is not getting repeated anymore. You need to have companies investing substantially in distribution chains within US or brands within US, something like what Aurobindo had done in terms of acquiring Sandoz brands.

Those strategies might eventually work out over the longer period. We would hunt for those stocks within the pharma space who have such sustainable revenue drivers ahead."

15,2019-09-05,Asian Paints,"Steel stocks like Tata Steel, EPC stocks like L&T and a whole host of PSU companies which are sitting on massive order book positions are where you can take a calculated risk, says Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


One needs to take calculated risk in life and by life, I mean markets. Where are you taking these calculated risks?Deep cyclicals for one. I have not always been a great fan of cyclical businesses but bear markets make everyone a little wiser at the end of the day, unlike a steel you start buying gradually. Eventually all this mess within US-China is going to end and the global economy will pick up and steel prices will move up. If you gradually buy steel stocks which are available just now like Tata Steel at 0.6 times price to book. If they get the European business problem solved, the India business is really a power house for them.


If they are not able to fix Corus …Then they will bring it down to a level. At the end of the day, Tatas have been good at shutting down or selling off loss-making businesses. We have seen that in telecom for one. Something similar will play out in steel. We do not know what will happen or how it will happen but you have to have faith in the management. When it does, then over a two-three-year period, a stock like Tata Steel can easily double and that may give higher returns than something in the FMCG space or something which is overpriced just now. 

There is calculated risk in steel stocks. There’s a calculated risk in engineering procurement companies and it could be private sector like L&T. Then, there is a whole host of PSU companies which are sitting on massive order book positions, right from the likes of NBCC to Bharat Electronics to Ircon, Garden Reach, Cochin Shipyard. They are all somehow related to government orders -- be it defence, be it civil. They are sitting on order books which are anywhere from three to four-five years present sales turnover of these companies. 

The visibility is there and valuations are extremely attractive-- single digit or low double digit type of price owning multiple on a trailing 12 month, high dividend yield -- extremely high return on capital. But there is fear because of the PSU label and because near-term performance has not been good. This is where you are supposed to take a calculated risk and lastly we spoke about the pharmaceutical and I would just like to add the hospital business, companies have been doing pretty well over there.


When the FPI tax came in FIIs wanted it gone and now that it is removed, why are not they coming back to India?Now, there is a slowdown in earnings.


So, tax is never an issue and it is a known devil?That is true. Everything is known and so hopefully everything has got discounted in the stock prices and we may have a bottom in place. Let us look at the positive side. No bad news is good news for this market and it is difficult to see how the FIIs think and why they sell and why they buy, but tax certainly was an issue. May be, it triggered a selling pressure and that generally gets some kind of a flow and then bad news follows bad news and then you just do not get the sentiment right. This causes the markets to go down. That is part and parcel of the stock market and it is a bear phase. you have to face it and spend that time in the bear market and hopefully if you are patient enough, then you will have the fruits of a bull market.


 In 2017, prices were here, valuations were here. In 2019, where are the prices and where are the valuations?There are pockets of overvaluation still in the market and there are pockets of undervaluations but undervaluation is based on historical earnings. If an investor has the faith that wherever there is undervaluation, in those businesses, there are temporary problems in the sector or the company and eventually they will get resolved and the earnings will start moving up provide opportunity to make exceptional returns. 

There are stocks which are highly overvalued and still going at 50-60 times PE and PEG of about two and a half times or so. Investors are migrating over there but anyway liquidity is low on those stocks. They are kind of a safe haven to invest in right now, but whenever the bear market turns and the bull market starts, I do not think that is the place which will you give the highest returns.

Investing is of course taking a little bit of a risk and buying when the chips are really down and good quality companies which have a track record to generate exceptional returns for investors in the past but are facing temporary problems, which once resolved, would see the earnings return. Those stock prices are moving up and so it is tough to get into the right stock selection and maintain a good balance. But then, who said bear markets are easy to navigate?


But in that pain and in that trouble in the bad news are you finding opportunities just yet in the market anywhere?The maximum damage has taken place in the banking and financial services industry, especially banks and NBFCs and there are a lot of opportunities. NBFCs, which have been supported and sponsored by large business houses, are available at very attractive valuations and you may see a quarter or two of slow growth and some more credit cost, but the long-term trajectory is fantastic for these companies. These are well managed, have the brand equity and the backing to raise cheap liquidity and to lend it forward. It is a viable business model. A NBFC like Bajaj Finance has demonstrated its capacity in bear markets like this but even smaller players like L&T Finance, Piramal Enterprises, Cholamandalam or Aditya Birla Capital are all great buys from a long-term investors perspective. So, that is one pocket which we are quite optimistic on. 

Then there is this entire pharma healthcare space. While overall consumption has slowed down, the consumption as far as healthcare is concerned has actually increased and for the first time after many months, we saw double digit growth in domestic pharma sales as well. If you have businesses which have got strong domestic pharma or which are into healthcare like hospitals like diagnostics, they are doing pretty well. Some of them are slightly overvalued but these are good long-term secular businesses to invest in.


Would you hunt that at all in autos? Has the time come to take a look at or take a relook at that sector?No, in fact, we made a mistake in auto and now we are looking at ways of exiting auto. When you have such a sharp slowdown in sales turnover, clearly there is something structural and not cyclical. I go back to the phases of high growth industries which when going through structural changes like say a telecom or IT or pharma in the earlier form. They used to have these high growth phase of 20-25% and then suddenly the earnings collapsed and when the earnings actually recovered, they are in that high single digit to low double digit. 

Something similar will play out in automobiles as well where after a period of very high earnings growth and volume growth, it has completely collapsed and whenever this recovers, you will at best get a single digit or a low double digit type of volume growth. It will be highly cyclical and not create as much value. The best years for auto are behind us. We could go into the reasons -- uberisation, better public transportation, high cost of ownership etc. At the end of the day, there is a structural change taking place and investors need to recognise that. 

The only exception is commercial vehicles which also is a highly cyclical play and you could take a bet, if at all, on a company like Ashok Leyland which when the economy turns and we get back to 7-8% growth rates, then the volumes go up by 40-50% for a commercial vehicle manufacture like Ashok Leyland and earnings could double too.


 So what you are doing with your portfolio is that you are preparing for a better tomorrow. You want to prepare your portfolio which will benefit from economic recovery and that cannot be captured in autos and consumption.Absolutely that is the underlying mantra. There is no great money to be made buying a stock at 60-70 PE multiple. Mind you, we look at companies like Titan, which had a high degree of visibility, expensive valuation and growth rates also but then if growth rates collapse tomorrow and the downturn lasts for some more time, even then, Asian Paints will not get impacted. 


Given the volatility on the back of various news points, what is your take on Sun Pharma?We are positive on Sun Pharma. They are following the right strategy in getting into specialised products and a lot of strategy has been changed and they are focussing on the right products and the right geographies and attractive valuation mainly because of this overhang of corporate governance.

I do not see that much is going to come out of this particular controversy and whatever corrective action is required, they have already taken it. Its balance sheet is extremely strong and some of the acquisitions that they have done may take some more time to get the synergies out of it. But at this price, I do not think there is so much of a downside in Sun Pharma unless there is some fresh negative USFDA action or something new blows out on corporate governance side. 

From this point, it can definitely outperform the Sensex and the Nifty and you need to have a slightly longer term view on this company because the strategy which they are following takes a while to start playing out, but it is the right strategy given the conditions. 


Are markets paying disproportionate premium to some of the companies where near term visibility is there? Near term is two quarters and the companies are Asian Paints, Trend, V-Mart among others.I totally agree with you.


Does one buy them because they are safe or avoid them because they are expensive?Avoid them. If you are owning them, remain invested. Nobody wants to sell an Asian Paints even at 79 times trailing 12 months, but you cannot take a fresh plunge in these stocks.


You cannot take a fresh plunge in these stocks?I do not think so. I does not make sense. At whatever limited liquidity you have, you want to buy stocks which have the potential to turnaround. 


Then why not buy IT/pharma? Ray Dalio, Howard Mark are saying that a problem is going to happen in the world. If that happens, the dollar is going to strengthen, rupee is going to weaken. So, pharma/IT maybe are the businesses that thrive on a weak rupee.As I said, we are positive on pharma.


No I am talking about the generic, not the Glaxo, Abbotts of the world.I am very positive on the likes of Sun Pharma, Aurobindo, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla the generic companies. Yes I think that all of these companies have done a lot of change in their strategy. They have right sized themselves. They are focussed on the products in right geographies and they are getting more productive as far as their spending and their assets are concerned. They are not just launching products left, right and centre. They are being a bit careful as far as their selection of products and geographies are concerned. 

Considering that what they have gone through, base effect will benefit them, rupee depreciation will benefit them. At this point, there are more opportunities than threats. Of course, the US FDA will keep on, whenever that happens it is difficult to predict but by and large, you may see good times for pharmaceuticals over the next 12 to 18 months or so. 

If you want to protect capital, then right now, IT is a safe haven because there is going to be no collapse of earnings over there but there is going to be no expansion of the growth rates as well. You are looking at 10-12% type of growth rates which is fine in markets like these while elsewhere you are seeing negative earnings. It is one sector which is at least showing positive earnings.


Do you stick by with the TCSes of the world or do you go little bottom down the line and maybe NIIT Technology, Hexaware, etc.?I am not convinced on midcap IT. Maybe TCS, Infosys are expensive and the likes of say HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Wipro may have slight bit of outperformance but it does not matter. You can go with the best buy TCS, Infosys. They will at least protect your capital in times like this. We are in very uncertain times over here and if this lasts for some more time, the bear market, then where do you hide, where do you protect your capital if you have fresh liquidity coming in apart of putting some of it into these ideas which will benefit from whenever bull market starts. If your intrinsic requirement is to protect some capital and yet be in equities, then certainly IT has a role to play."

16,2019-09-06,Asian Paints,"Markets tend to price the real world a lot earlier and that is why they are called the leading indicators. Do not look for the economic numbers to say that the market will move from here on. The market will move first, says Tushar Pradhan, CIO, HSBC Global AM India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Are we in for a long winter or is this the darkest hour before the dawn? Is there a scope for revival?Markets are going to remain volatile and they will be driven by news -- both internal and external. It will take a lot more time to understand where the market is likely to go because the cycles are slower and take a lot of time before they recover. We are already in a slowdown of eight to nine months. So, is it going to be more gradual? Sometimes developments in the economy are a lot faster and they discount the stories much quicker. So in a sense, one would not try to feel that the market will take a long time to recover. 

The market recovery depends on two or three things. One is sustained earnings growth and some sort of stimulus is expected. If it materialises in some way, that is enough for the market to take strength on that basis. The fundamentals in terms of the cost of capital, i.e., the interest rates, are down. Liquidity is fairly comfortable. Globally, flows also are fairly robust because of the rate of yields elsewhere in the world. 

The entire investment community is looking for yields across the world. There is interest in yielding assets -- be it Indian assets or emerging markets. The ground work clearly is positive. I do not believe the market will remain low for long though the economic recovery can take a little longer.


Are you saying that markets will recover before the economy and that right now, fundamentals are ahead and valuations are lower?Clearly so because we have seen that the markets tend to price the real world a lot earlier and that is why they are called the leading indicators. In a sense, do not look for the economic numbers to say that the market will move from here on. The market will move first and then you try to see the kind of impact by looking at the economic numbers to say that was coming and this is what the market sensed. 

How far the market looks is a matter of academic debate. It could be six months or three months. Could it be looking one year forward? One does not know that but clearly the markets will give a signal that the economy is reviving by its movement before the economy revives and you think the market will move up from there.


You mentioned stimulus. Whatever have been announced so far, may have had some impact but perhaps not the kind of runaway impact that we were hoping for. as you also just mentioned it will take a little bit more than that. What kind of stimulus do you feel could really have more substantial impact and get things going in a more meaningful way?What one has to see is that the impact will be felt most where the stimulus is supposed to act on the biggest problem that we face today. The biggest problem that we face today is clearly in terms of non-performing assets and to a certain degree, even in the housing finance area where the NBFCs are in some trouble over funds that they need on a continuous basis. If there is something to deal with that -- whether speeding up of the processes or freeing up this capital which is suck for so long -- that will have a very dramatic impact. 

However, having said that, I am not saying that that is an easy one to take. There are many complicated issues there and it is not an easy one to address. But the point is that the stimulus cannot be broad in nature. It cannot be sentiment or an intent statement. The stimulus has to be real. It has to be felt as an impact to the most critical elements that we are facing right now in terms of slowdown. If the stimulus does address these issues, then the markets will take heed of that. But if the stimulus is in the way of a statement, an intent, pretty broad in nature, that is not likely to move the market, at least now.

It is very difficult to say what kind of stimulus can be expected but it has to be something that hits home quickly and where you can tangibly see a movement in terms of things going from bad to good and a pathway which is visible. If something like that comes through, then the market is clearly going to take to wing after that.


A lot of people believe that there is a bigger merit in looking at some of the small and midcap stocks because whenever the market tide turns, that is where you will generate high alpha. Do you believe in the same and if so, where would you hunt within the mid and smallcaps?The mid and smallcap space is very large -- by number of companies as well as the various segments of the economy that these companies operate in. It is very difficult to focus on any one or two. But coming back to your first question, in terms of where the valuations are, clearly the valuations are much more attractive here. But smallcaps, especially the ones which are much smaller than the average in the smallcap range, do not move in spikes. It takes time for them to develop a lot of momentum before they start moving very quickly. I would think that one should be aware of the fact that these movements become very dramatic in a very short period of time but they are actually preceded by a very long period of very low activity and valuations. 

Just because they are cheap now, I do not think they are going to bounce back. They will remain cheap and the story on earnings will need to continue to keep coming. At some point of time, the critical period arrives when suddenly valuations take off. If you see the movement in the small and midcaps over last 20-25 years, you will find that this is the case. I do not think now there is going to be any difference from what we saw in the past. If midcaps and smallcaps have had a tough time for two years, that does not mean that they will bounce back again just because of earnings turnaround.

It will take some time but I will still be in the camp that recommends a buy now because you never know when the actual best valuation or the bottom is reached. So, it is a good space to be in across the spectrum though not any particular choice at this time. But one has to be patient here as well and sometimes maybe the narrower market, the larger caps actually move first and that may be the place to be in if you want to see a quick bounce back. But the small and midcaps will be definitely very profitable in the intermediate term to long term.


What is the ideal scenario in this market? What is the pitch telling you -- play on back foot or front foot?That is a very interesting question. I think the wicket is a little tricky, which means that it is a little two-paced wicket, sometimes the ball keeps low and you are likely to get clean bowled and sometimes it actually does come at a very even pace, so that you can actually hit it back again. What I mean by that is sometimes the international situation is something that we are not really very aware of and it can give us one of those really strange deliveries. 

But the domestic situation is a lot easier to understand. The cyclicality of the slowdown is very evident. We do get these phases of low growth every three or four years and that is what we are undergoing right now. The inherent domestic nature of the Indian economy will ensure that no matter what happens to the world the consumption function is going to remain pretty strong. We do believe that even at 6% GDP growth rate for an economy of this size is reasonable to expect that the earnings cycle will continue in some period of time. 

So when it comes to the domestic scene, I would think there is a lot more visibility in terms of how that will turn. When it comes to international situations of course, we really have a very low rate of understanding in terms of how and what will happen but they do have an impact on our markets and that is really when I call this wicket two-paced that if we do get a good international backdrop, then the Indian economy has a much better chance of turning around. A turnaround in itself domestically will not mean much unless the world comes along with it. So in that sense not a very easy answer.

There is a bit of uncertainty globally and there is slowdown locally. Currently faced with these two things, one needs to be patient, focus on what is really visible and go with it. I would think that bat on the front foot, but be a little defensive. Before you come out with your strokes, a couple of defensive shots are called for. 


I met a very senior fund manager who said he is preparing his portfolio for the next bull market. Another said, this is a bear market, protect your capital. What is the right approach for an investor in this kind of a market ?Both the scenarios may be correct and true in their own time and are very assumptive of what is likely to happen. 

If have been investing for a bear market, then I know what to do; if I am investing for the next bull market, I know what to do. But I do not know whether it is going to be a bull market or a bear market, that is the case with most portfolio managers and that is something that we need to understand. 

If I have to construct a portfolio, I have to focus on two things; sustainability of earnings and diversification. In a situation where there is so much uncertainty, one should clearly remain diversified. We should definitely look at various parts sectors of this economy which show sustainable growth rates on the basis of their own individual stories and not relying on any broad brush economic backdrop. You would be in a very good wicket if you put together a portfolio which incorporates well managed sustainable earning stories and in a sense, be heedful of the valuations that you paid for and be adequately diversified across the economic spectrum. You will get really rich dividends if you follow this strategy. 


Do you believe that cyclicals, especially material stocks, need to be avoided? Why is that?We are coming to a conclusion that globally growth rates are slowing. That means global metals, anything dealing with materials and cyclicals are under a bit of pressure. Oil price clearly is an indication of where global demand for materials is. It is not really going to revive very quickly. We are struggling for growth in Europe, Japan and in most parts of the rest of the world except for the US where there is still significant growth. 

Given that backdrop, to bet on cyclicals turning around very quickly without any sight of general demand coming either from China or some other parts of the world make, makes for a tough choice at the moment. But global dynamics are very different and change very quickly. I would be wary of them but at some point of time, when we would call a bottom on those prices where we feel they are at a cyclical low and may be that is where the cycle globally starts as well. At the moment, there is enough softness to say be wary of global cyclicals right now.


At what price for would Asian Paints give you visibility? Three years ago, it was 40 times, today it is still giving you near term visibility and it has become 70 times. What is the right way to understand that I am buying may be 15% growth but is it right to buy a PE multiple of 30, 40, 50 or even 100?If one has answer to that question, one can win the Nobel prize. But for now, we can understand that the market is paying for visibility and sustainability. These two tick boxes clearly stand for companies which have a very large franchise, market leadership in a country where the penetration of such consumption is definitely going to increase no matter what happens to the economy. 

The market overpays for such sustainability at times when the uncertainties are high. I would think that part of the solution to this puzzle comes from there but there is no absolute price. I have really no idea because the minute the economy turns around and you have earnings growth spread across the large spectrum of companies and sectors, then nobody is going to overpay for this kind of sustainability. You have to judge that between what is a good company, what is the valuation and at what time are you getting into that valuations. 

One has to be cognisant of all of that which justifies the price and the value for that time but the situation changes and one needs to be very swift to move away from such stories, once the rest of the economy starts to do well."
17,2019-09-12,Asian Paints,"The government and the market needs to watch not only transmission, but also the availability of liquidity. Liquidity in the informal sector has virtually collapsed, says Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder, Complete Circle Consultants. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What are you making of the market texture? This move to 11,000 does not seem to be all that convincing .You are right. It will be good if we see some consolidation in the market because it is going to be a slow grind upwards and it is good if the broader fundamentals improve before the market really tries and makes a bit of a recovery. 

If you see the GDP print and break it down into consumption, that is down to 3%. Gross fixed capital formation which was trending 11% last year is down to 4% while export demand is halved. All three parameters involve the demand side -- which is consumption, investments and exports. Exports are flattish and seems to be struggling. Some policy intervention is needed. 

Also, there has been a very broad negative wealth effect. Real estate prices are depressed for four to five years, especially the residential prices. I am not even commenting on the real estate projects where the money is stuck. A 15% erosion in market cap is roughly about $380-400 billion. When there is a broad-based negative effect, it has an impact on the sentiment which in turn affects demand. 

Another thing which the government and the market needs to watch is not just transmission, but also the availability of liquidity. Liquidity in the informal sector has virtually collapsed. Even if you see the bank credit number, while the headline shows about 10.1%, bank credit to MSME is actually negative. There are a lot of steps to be taken and so rate transmission alone would not help. Liquidity to the last mile is also extremely critical.


What is your sense on the overall market? It seems the five-day runup has come to a halt. Does the undertone of the market continue to remain negative? Would we see some amount of pullback?The undertone remains negative and as pointed out earlier, we have to look at liquidity reaching the last mile. We have to see a serious reversal in demand and sentiment and we have to watch a few global developments as well. One interesting thing is to look at the dollar index. There is obviously an upward pressure on the dollar with global risk-off environment and money chasing dollar investment grades. 

And also there could a downward pressure with FOMC cutting rates. I am also expecting ECB to announce a bit of a QE which could see a bit of a reversal in this entire risk-off sentiment. We have seen commodity prices staging some kind of a pullback. From the near term, those are important figures but you have to be where the sectors or themes or stocks have managed to buck the trend and every downturn has a new set of winners.

In this entire downturn, life insurance, general insurance, FMCG, the large IT names, some of the MNC pharma names are actually bucking the trend as are some of the home improvement themes like Asian Paints and Pidilites of the world. It is better to be where we are seeing preservation, earnings growth and use only cyclicals when you see sharp corrections. It is going to be a slow grind and a long process and you really have to be patient in terms of buying into them. 


Insurance is the other theme that a lot of people are talking about from a longer term perspective. Where do you find preference within this space?I am extremely positive and I think this is a structural long- term story as far as both life and general insurance are concerned. We like SBI Life and HDFC Life. SBI Life is leading the industry in terms of the gross premiums it has collected. In their value to new business, they are clearly ahead with ICICI and HDFC coming second and third. 

The value of new business (VONB) margin is the premium which reflects the profitability of the new business source doing well as there as well. On the cost operating ratios, they are the market leaders, having the lowest cost operating ratio at almost 11.8%.

The movement from ULIPs to non-participative saving products is really shaping up well. Despite the market volatility, the ULIP portfolio has not done too badly. Also, in the overall assets under management (AUM), there is more than 25% growth as well. It is currently at about two times embedded value which is much cheaper than some of the other private insurers with HDFC being almost five times. Embedded value for users is basically a term used for insurers which is basically the net worth and the present value of future profits because the policies are of very long periods and gestation and they have a massive distribution reach.

There are 22,000 SBI touch points which is SBI and the affiliates. There are another 6,000 odd reach points with Indian Bank and Syndicate Bank tie-ups shaping up well. That is a massive distribution reach. The number of lives insured, the last quarter numbers were almost 2.5 crores. So it is gaining market share amongst the non LIC players very clearly. I also like ICICI Lombard in general insurance. 


How are you looking at some of the OMCs in trade? Brokerages are of the view that there are strong fundamentals, strong earnings momentum and that there is potential for the likes of BPCL and HPCL as well as IOC. What is your pecking order?That is an avoid for me for now because we do not know what are the plans as far as the divestment goes. If they decide to again merge BPCL with ONGC like they did with the HPCL, it would have a negative impact. Also, there is the fact that there has been some recovery in refining margins. The oil prices remain soft. So, it could be a bit of a trading or a tactical play but you cannot take a fundamental view on it.

 If you really want to look at this space and which is not really a refining and a non-marketing space, Reliance is a better play where you can have a more medium to long-term outlook. If you see the EBITDA now, the consumer facing business which is Jio and retail now make up 32% versus the traditional oil and refining and petchem business. It is a much longer play so avoid for me right now. Somebody wants to be a little tactical here. You can probably get into OMCs with the shortest timeframe, having your entry and exit prices in place.


What is your take on infrastructure sector as a whole?There are definitely some opportunities and there have already been talks of strategic divestment, of land parcels being put to good work. You just spoke about how the central government buildings can be redone. Other than that, there are a few players who are still looking good in the largecap, EPC space. L&T looks good. The order book remains healthy. 

The working capital ratios are steadily improving. It is a quasi infra play. L&T fits in the bill perfectly. NCC after a sharp correction from a value proposition looks good. They have been working on their receivables and working capital a bit. 

Another good plays in this space is KNR. One can look at this space and selectively buy on dips. But it will be a bit of a long drawn process with the investment horizon two-three year plus wide. It is one space where we are advising clients to buy on dips."
18,2019-09-16,Asian Paints,"Rohan Sharma, MD, RK Jewellers, remembers his favourite suits and why he admires Cristiano Ronaldo’s fashion game.

Go-to suit
“The three-piece because it’s timeless yet versatile. You can go classic with a solid colour or if you want to be playful, you can add a contrasting waist-coat. It goes well with or without a tie and you make a classy statement wherever you go. For me, a royal blue suit with a contrasting waistcoat is a no-brainer. My favourite is a blue pinstriped suit from Burberry.”


First suit
“I wore a black custom-stitched suit to my school farewell and it will always be special to me. I felt like I had stepped into adulthood that day, even though I was only 17.”


Wedded bliss
“I think I looked the best in a suit at my wedding. I wore a tuxedo paired with patent black oxford shoes.”


Style tip
“Get your suits custom-stitched and dry-clean them; they shouldn’t be washed at home. Hang them in zipped bags with silica sachets, especially during the monsoon.”


Slim lines
“I really like Cristiano Ronaldo’s slim fit suit game. He chooses to wear solid colours, which go with his personality.”


Signature element
“A gold and diamond tie pin and my zodiac sign-inspired custom-made cufflinks that my sister designed for me.”


Suits and sneakers
“I like to keep things classy and I feel sneakers with a suit become a silent cry for attention rather than a solid statement.”

25,2019-09-16,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty tumbled on Monday, dragged down by oil & gas and energy stocks following spike in oil prices as attacks on key producer Saudi Arabia’s facilities sparked supply fears sapping investors risk appetite.

Analysts said the spike in crude oil is likely to affect the fiscal position of net energy importers such as India in the medium term as uncertainties will keep market sentiment volatile.

The attacks reportedly shut down 6 per cent of the global oil supply. Brent crude was trading over 9 per cent up at $65.88 per barrel, while WTI crude was trading 8.77 per cent higher at $59.66.

Following the global developments, the rupee was trading nearly 61 paise down at 71.53 against the US dollar.

""The spike in global crude prices, even though temporary, will be negative for downstream OMCs (BPCL, HPCL and IOCL) and Castrol. We do not rule out the possibility of moderation in marketing margins on auto fuels — a$10 rise in crude and product prices may require OMCs to increase retail price of diesel and gasoline by Rs 5-6 per liter in the following fortnight. Sharp jump in global crude prices may also put pressure on refining margins amid slowing demand, besides increasing absolute quantum of fuel and loss. On the other hand, higher crude prices may be construed positively for upstream PSUs and GAIL,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

On the macro front, India’s wholesale inflation in August was unchanged at 1.08 per cent in August even as the prices of food items rose, government data showed. The wholesale price index (WPI)based inflation was at 1.08 per cent in July this year and 4.62 per cent in August 2018.

Analysts said that market participants are now looking ahead to the decision on interest rates and the statement from the US Federal Reserve chief after FOMC's two-day meet later this week for further cues on the direction of the market.

23,2019-09-16,Asian Paints,"Q2 is going to be very soft and at least some part of that softness is already in the price, says Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO, Equity, Kotak AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What do you make of the last week’s price action. Are you getting a sense that we are nearing a price bottom?It is difficult to say at this point of time. In a slowing economy, you have to be careful when you are selecting stocks because even the pockets where you believe growth is insulated and will continue to come, could have some impact. Also, over the weekend, there was a new negative development -- disruption of oil supplies from Saudi Arabia. We need to see whether the spike that we have seen as a knee-jerk reaction today will cool off and whether there is going to be some really negative medium term implication. That will set the tone for future direction of the market. 


One is really trying to assess and analyse what happens with this Saudi Aramco drone attack. Would you say a 10% move in crude is an exaggerated and knee-jerk reaction? How are you assessing the impact on India because prima facie this is bad news for India?At this point of time, it is too early to predict where it will settle down. Saudi has been claiming that at least partially it will be able to restore oil production and once market gets confidence that there is not going to be a medium-term disruption in terms of oil supplies, the price will stabilise. 

Until then, it is going to make every investor, every trader quite jittery because this is something which was not discounted by the market couple of days back and suddenly you have seen a big accident there. As far as India is concerned, until now, at least on the global commodity side, global liquidity and interest rate side, we had a very benign scenario. Now with this disruption, we have to see whether we will continue to get the benefit of benign oil prices or not. 

That will be something very key for our economy because we know the government does not have too much of a fiscal room to do something to pump-start the economy. In case oil continues to remain at higher levels, then that flexibility will continue to go down further.


One can see how the slowdown has really crippled the industry. This week’s GST council meet is expected to provide some respite for industry. Maybe a GST cut is coming in for the auto sector. On the sidelines, there is Maruti which has taken a hit on its market share. It has gone down to 49% to the advantage of Hyundai. How do you see the auto dynamic playing out and what would it mean for sector leaders like Maruti?We continue to believe that the worst is not over for the auto industry. There is huge inventory with auto manufacturers and dealers, which they are trying to correct. This festive season may not completely clear out that extra inventory and also there has been an overall change in consumer behaviour. The purchases are getting postponed and we will see that next couple of quarters are going to be difficult for the auto sector.

While the prices have seen quite a bit of fall from the peak levels especially in the passenger segment, we really cannot say that the valuations have corrected because going forward the earnings are going to get corrected much more sharply. Given that there is going to be a significant drag on earnings, just the price fall does not give much confidence to re-enter auto stocks, given that we continue to remain underweight on the auto sector in our portfolios.


The speculation in the market is that with this attack on Saudi Aramco, what happens to the deal with Reliance? Everyone was pegging their hopes high that with that stake buy, Reliance will be able to pare their debt down by quite a sizable quantum. Would you say is too early to speculate right now?I really do not want to speculate on this subject because we do not know the full dynamics of the deal. As we were communicated. it is at a very preliminary stage. Nothing was expected to happen in the next few days and we will have to wait and see how this new development affects the overall deal structure.


How are markets pricing in the earning season? Our expectation is very low and diluted. What is your view in terms of market positioning because we both know it is not what is the news, it is what is in the price. Sometimes great news is in the price, sometimes very bad news is also in the price.Clearly, first quarter earnings were below overall market expectations. Nifty earnings grew at just about 2% year on year basis. Given that, the hopes of a great turnaround in Q2 is also kind of diminished. We have seen numbers continuously coming on a southward trajectory. We believe that the market is not discounting too much a high number for earnings growth in this quarter. 

Having said that, the consensus analysts estimate still remain at a very high level and it is unlikely to be achieved. For us, even if we achieve low double digit earnings growth for the entire financial year 2020, that should be a reasonable number. Q2 is going to be very soft and at least some part of that softness is already in the price.


There have been attempts and measures by the government to boost housing infrastructure. There has been a lot of talk and planned orders. For example, on the infrastructure front, over this weekend we have been talking a lot about boosting housing. Are you looking at cement, high level capital goods or even real estate? Will we see a boost across those sectors?The government measures are definitely welcome but none of these measures on their own will be able to completely change the course of direction for most of the sectors in our opinion. It is going to be a slow grind and that is what we have priced in terms of our portfolios. Also, wherever we are making further investments, we are not expecting any V-shape recovery at this point of time. 

Yes. given that the consumption slowdown is very evident and also the valuations are still on the higher side, we are looking for opportunities on the non-consumption side. We have been looking at increasing our holdings in select industrials, cement stocks, chemicals and some gas utilities.


What is stopping you from buying pure consumption plays? Autos have become cheaper, select durables have become cheap, multiplexes companies are now trading at whacky PE multiples, diagnostics stocks are looking okay. Keeping Nestle, D-Mart and Asian Paints aside, rest of the consumption space is not bad too. Why are you not buying them?As far as FMCG stocks are concerned, I agree that business is going to be a lot more resilient for any slowdown or its adverse impact but the valuations are not so defensive, because most of the money has chased the entire consumption pack including FMCG, auto, etc. 

In the last five to six years preceding the slowdown, there was a lot of ownership and any small cut in terms of earnings growth or expectations can have a meaningful impact on stock valuations. As far as auto is concerned, we may have seen 30, 40, 50% correction in some of the prices, but that does not mean that earlier the valuations were fair and hence they have become cheap today. They were expensive at an earlier point of time and today there is no clarity in terms of which way the earnings are going to head.

We believe earnings are going to be significantly lower than last year and given that, even the optical valuation correction is not going to really help. We will see this pocket continuously seeing more money getting withdrawn as we have seen a lot of ownership in this segment. These are the negatives and hence we are not looking to really build our position on the consumption side. 

You may argue that even on the non-consumption side, the visibility of earnings growth is not great, but at least on a valuation basis they are better. We have not really seen such valuations in the past also and the ownership is very low. As the economy activity starts to gain ground, some of the non-consumption pockets will start to deliver better stock performance.


What about the classic two-wheelers -- Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj? Their PE multiples are in their teens. They give strong dividend and there is no debt on their balance. If rural economy comes back, two-wheeler demand will come back like a spring. What is stopping you from buying classic two-wheeler companies like Hero and Bajaj?We do have some exposure to two-wheeler companies but at this point of time we are not looking to add to that position while there is quite a bit of value in terms of dividend yield and the steady cash flow generation. There is also a disruption happening in two wheelers. There is going to be electric vehicle influx in the two-wheeler side. The incumbent companies have been a little slower than the competition, which again puts a question mark in terms of the sustainable valuations in case the electric vehicles start to become a larger component of the overall two wheeler industry. 

Given all this, while we continue to hold some position in two-wheelers, we are not looking to add at this point of time in terms of our portfolios."
24,2019-09-16,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: If drone strikes at Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities snowball into a geopolitical crisis between the US and Iran, the rally in crude oil prices may not halt anytime soon.

And that will be bad news for a host of Indian industries that use crude derivatives as inputs, from aviation to paints, tyre, oil & gas (OMCs) and auto ancillary firms, say analysts. 

On Monday, Brent futures jumped nearly 19.5 per cent to trade at $71 a barrel in Asia, clocking their biggest gains in percentage terms since 1991.

A sudden spike in oil prices is negative for oil marketeers IndianOil, BPCL and HPCL. But GAIL could see a positive impact, said Emkay Global, which added that a $65-70 a barrel range is ideal for ONGC and Oil India.

“Saudi oil facilities are now vulnerable to attacks by rebels, which would increase the geopolitical risk premium on oil prices. Saudi Arabia and its allies may also retaliate, leading to more tensions and a broader clash with Iran can be severe. The US may toughen its stance on Iran, contrary to the belief that the Iran-US standoff may have subsided after the recent resignation of US National Security Advisor John Bolton,” Emkay Global said.

Of the two facilities hit over the weekend, Abqaiq is important as it processes 7 million barrels of hard crude per day into light crude, as majority of refineries can only refine light crude and are dependent on it, said Sameer Kalra of Target Investing. 

The two facilities account for over half of Saudi production and 5 per cent of global crude supplies. Saudi officials said the fire has been controlled and production will be resumed in 48 hours, but video and satellite footages depicted a grim picture.

News that Saudi Arabia is planning to shut down about half of its output after the strike also had an impact on oil prices, said Pritam Kumar Patnaik, Head of Reliance Commodities.

In the domestic stock market, weakness was visible on oil-linked stocks; aviation firms SpiceJet and InterGlobe Aviation fell up to 5 per cent; paints stocks Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac lost up to 3 per cent and oil marketeers BPCL and HPCL tanked 5 per cent each while IOC fell 3 per cent.

""OMC and aviation stocks may come under pressure in the short term if oil prices sustain at higher levels, but sectors such as paints and tyre, which use crude derivatives, may get impacted only if the situation escalates substantially. One can wait to see if it is a one-off spike in crude oil prices,” said Sunil Jain, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Securities.

Since there is lack of oil buffer from Saudi’s significant spare production capacity, geopolitical tensions may add to global oil supply woes, said Kotak Securities. It noted that crude supplies from Iran and Venezuela have already been curtailed significantly amid sanctions from the US, while supplies from Libya and Nigeria have also shown vulnerability to disruptions in recent times.

""The spike in global crude prices, even though temporary, will be negative for downstream OMCs (BPCL, HPCL and IOCL) and Castrol. We do not rule out the possibility of moderation in marketing margins on auto fuels: a $10 a barrel rise in global crude prices may require OMCs to increase retail prices of diesel and petrol by Rs 5-6 litre in the following fortnight. A sharp jump in global crude prices may put pressure on refining margins. On the other hand, higher crude prices may be positive for upstream PSUs and GAIL,"" the brokerage said.

“The immediate range for Nymex crude will be $56 to $63 a barrel, but with the US accusing Iran of orchestrating the attack and Iran in turn threatening war, oil prices are expected to remain firm,"" Patnaik said.

For a country like India which meets 80 per cent of its oil demand through imports, any further rise in crude prices may have an impact on government finances.

Every $10 a barrel rise in crude oil prices expands India’s current account deficit (CAD) by 0.4 per cent of GDP. Every 10 per cent increase in crude oil prices can push up the inflation rate by 20 basis points.

Besides, a rise in crude oil prices can increase dollar demand, hurting the rupee-dollar exchange rate. A fall in the rupee lowers dollar returns for foreign investors, and makes their India investment unattractive.

""The government does not have too much room on the fiscal rise to really do something to jumpstart the economy. In case oil continues to remain at higher levels, I think that flexibility will go down further,” said Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO for Equity at Kotak AMC."
26,2019-09-16,Asian Paints,"KOLKATA: Leading paint company Asian Paints has entered into an agreement with Mahindra Logistics to strengthen its supply-chain in Eastern India.

According to a media release, Mahindra Logistics will be handling the regional distribution centre measuring one lakh square feet at Dankuni in West Bengal and the first leg of distribution from this facility. The services will be backed up by technologies for transport and warehouse management.

Mahindra Logistics CEO Pirojshaw Sarkari said given the association with Asian Paints over the years, this additional scope of work will add value to their supply-chain and enable them to achieve the desired effectiveness and efficiency.

27,2019-09-16,Asian Paints,"Oil-related companies were in action throughout Monday’s session, following a spike in crude oil prices after drone attacks on two Saudi Arabian plants on Saturday sent oil prices soaring.

And then, there were stock-specific actions. Smallcap firm OnMobile Global surged over 20 per cent after a stake sale by the promoter, while reports of KKR stake buy in beleaguered CG Power made the stock hit its upper circuit limit.

Overall, market sentiment remained weak on Dalal Street amid panic selling by investors after a 10 per cent jump in crude oil prices. The Sensex closed nearly 262 points down at 37,123 while Nifty settled 72 points down at 11,003.

 “Geopolitical risks have come to fore once again. Over the weekend, drone strikes on Saudi’s oil processing facilities added to trade war-related uncertainties and deteriorated market condition globally. Higher crude prices impact Indian economy adversely. No wonder, the Indian equity market ignored the important initiatives announced by the government to the support housing sector and boost exports,” said Gaurav Dua, Senior VP, Head of Capital Market Strategy & Investments at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Here is a lowdown on key movers and shakers of Monday’s session:

Crude drags aviation, paint & OMC stocks
Shares of airline operators InterGlobe Aviation and SpiceJet slipped up to 4 per cent following a spike in crude oil prices in international markets.

The bears tightened their grip on Dalal Street on Tuesday as benchmark indices fell over a per cent as crude oil prices continued to gain in the aftermath of drone attacks on Saudi Arabia oil establishments. A poor set of macro data from China also further hit sentiment.

BSE Sensex tumbled 642.22 points, or 1.73 per cent lower, at 36,481.09, while NSE Nifty ended at 10,817.60, down 185.90 points or 1.69 per cent. Volatility Index India VIX also spiked about 7.12 per cent to 16.01.

In the 30-pack Sensex, 3 stocks ended in the green and 27 in the red with Hero MotoCorp finishing as worst performer and HUL the best. Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Axis Bank and Maruti Suzuki too joined Hero MotoCorp on the losers’ list, slipping up to 7 per cent. 

Infosys and Asian Paints were among the other Sensex stocks that advanced.

Yogesh Mehta, Founder of Yield Maximiser said that worries over crude oil spike and its further impact on current account and fiscal deficit hit the market.


Here are five reasons behind Sensex’s fall today:

Saudi oil crisis: Monday’s record rise in Brent Crude futures severely hit market sentiment. Despite prices holding steady on Tuesday, the uncertainty around adequate oil supply remained.

Attack on two Saudi oil facilities halved the kingdom's output, which now threatens the global demand-supply balance.

The US being on wait and watch mode on whether to tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve also didn’t help the sentiment. 

""With regard to energy markets, the president has directed me to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if that is needed to offset any potential disruptions,"" Energy Secretary Rick Perry told reporters on a visit to Vienna on Tuesday. ""But looking at the supply numbers we are confident that the markets remain well-supplied.""


Technical: Formation of a death cross on daily charts on Monday also led to the fall in the stock market. The formation hints at more short term pain for Nifty. In the ‘Death Cross’, short-term moving averages (typically, 50-day moving average) of a stock or index cross below its long-term moving averages (usually 200-day moving average), and such a pattern generally points to further weakness for the stock or index.


Global Cues:  On the global front, Asian shares closed lower while European stocks were trading flat in morning trade as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.66 per cent.


China woes: China’s industrial growth rate slumped to a 17-year low, indicating all was not well in the manufacturing hub. US import tariffs and softening domestic demand were major reasons behind this. Industrial output growth slowed to 4.4 per cent in August, registering the slowest pace of expansion since February 2002.


Auto stocks tumble: Nifty Auto index closed 3.83 per cent lower, led by a slump in Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki, among others. Out of the 15 constituents in the index,all were trading in the red.

“Surge in crude oil prices may be the reason behind crash in auto stocks,” said Gautam Duggad, Head Of Research - Institutional Equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.


Fed meet: Investors were also edgy ahead of the outcome of the Federal Reserve policy meet. Market analysts are expecting a rate cut, however, there are concerns that the central bank may wait for more data before deciding to ease policy rates.

US President Donald Trump has been demanding aggressive rate cuts for a while now. “The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term,” he tweeted on last week."

37,2019-09-18,Asian Paints,"Till the time these uncertainties are over, you will not see a significantly sharp recovery coming into the credit cycle, says Vikas Khemani, Founder, Carnelian Capital Advisors. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

The crude will stabilise at some point. What happens to the market then?Crude has been on a downward trajectory. Last Saturday’s drone attack has led to a spike in crude prices. I am sure if it is not a war like situation, then it will settle down soon. I do not think we are in a structural bull market for crude oil. India can handle these kind of temporary setbacks. The only caveat is one does not know whether it is a war like situation or not. As long as it is not, it should be okay. In an otherwise uncertain market, this is the last news you would expect to be dealing with. 

Anyway, there are a lot of local challenges and this came as a spanner in the works and is inducing more volatility. One has to be careful but this uncertain period would get over sooner than later and we have had a prolonged period of uncertainty. I do not believe that we are getting into a structural downturn kind of economic cycle. It is probably somewhere in bottom and the only question is whether the upward move would have a sharp or a slow trajectory. There is no right answer for that. 

One has to keep watching events as they pan out every single day and keep making assessments. We currently believe that we will sooner than later stabilise and start seeing an improvement. The credit crisis which hit the Indian economy so badly has hit the bottom. One only hopes that no more events happen and you keep hearing new names. I will tick over a few more names there. Till the time these uncertainties are over, you will not see a significantly sharp recovery coming into the credit cycle. One has to keep watching it as it comes by.


Let us be compulsive bulls for a second. Can I safely say that markets have stopped reacting to bad news? They did not react to GDP, they did not react to that slump in auto sales. They have reacted to crude but looks like the markets have recovered. If the market stops reacting to bad news that means stock prices are nearing a bottom.Absolutely. This is a fair point and in the last couple of months, the market has made a nice range between 10600 and 11000 kind on Nifty. On any bad news, it probably corrects a little bit before bouncing back again. This also gives a sense that markets are bottoming out and settling down in this range. 

How long it takes to recover is uncertain. Otherwise, I do not have any doubt that probably the worst is behind us. The risk reward of investing into equities have started appearing significantly favourable. Only it might try your patience out before it recovers. But definitely, the risk reward of investing into equities is definitely turning favourable.


As an investor, should you already be buying this dip in the broader markets or should you wait for the froth to settle down? What is the right tactical strategy?You will never know what is the right time. You have to keep on deploying your equities in the market in a systemic manner. As a fund, we have started decreasing our cash level and deploying as and when we find the stocks you are looking to invest in are at the right levels. Broader markets risk rewards are falling into favour and you anyway got to do stock picking. We believe one should look to deploy on a regular basis because uncertain times give great opportunities.

If a bit of clarity comes in either on a macro issues or any of the uncertain issues right now, the stock prices would jump sharply. Uncertain times are the best times to shop around even though they try your patience out. One should look to deploy money within the next three-four months.


Are you fully invested or sitting on cash? About three weeks ago, we were sitting on almost 50% cash. Now, we are sitting on 30% cash. So, we have been deploying systemically. This is the best time and whatever sectors we like, every time, a little bit of uncertainty comes, you see a cut in the stock prices you go and buy a little bit more. 

Having said that, can stocks correct more. But that is what investing is all about? How do you keep your emotions out, how do you keep yourself away from day-to-day negative news flow and stay core to your investing conviction is where the investors get challenged. We do believe this is a time to step up your allocation towards equity. These prices would offer significant return over next three-four years.


If you were to look at buying opportunities in the broader markets, what would be some of the themes? Would you go for utilities, select pharma?  Currently we are quite positive on private sector banks and we think structurally things are favouring this sub segment of the market significantly. It will continue to do well. Availability of the funds, credit growth all are favouring this segment of the market and I would not be surprised if they give 20-25% return over the next couple of years. 

The second sub segment within the financials -- the non credit based financials, whether it is insurance companies or AMCs, there is a fairly large range of opportunities available. There are grest structural opportunities and we are looking at buying in every correction.

Amongst the consumption basket where India can never fail you, we have seen a significant amount of correction in consumer discretionary stocks. We have been buying and looking at the stocks in that particular area. So, financials and consumption are the top two segments in our portfolio where we keep on looking at ideas and investing opportunities. These are structural ideas and as and when the market demand bounces back, you will see superior growth as well as superior earnings growth in these businesses risks being protected. 


A report from Credit Suisse has come out today and they are pointing to the fact that this is the worst consumption slowdown in the last 15 years and that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Retail balance sheet will start contracting, new jobs will not be created and there is going to be a huge pressure on discretionary demand. Where do you think the expensive stocks like Britannia and Asian Paints move? I am not commenting on a particular house’s report but I have a very different view on that. There are two segments in the market; one believed that there is a complete gloom and doom scenario, demand is getting contracted and all the things just similar to what we saw after demonetisation. I am definitely not in that camp. Look at the June quarter numbers, starting from all the FMCG companies -- be it Dabur, Lever or paints companies -- to plywood companies to pipe companies and refrigerator and air conditioning companies, all grew 5-25% in volume terms. 

The June quarter was just two months ago. If there was a slowdown and no demand, then who were buying these products? I do not believe in that. 

Of course, in automobile, demand got impacted by unavailability of credit over the last two-three quarters. But other than that, by and large, the consumption cycle is not as broken as it is being made out to be. In my opinion, whatever impact we are going to see probably will be mostly in this quarter. We have the festive season coming in, companies will be filling up the pipeline. I am not a big believer in the theory that consumption in India is broken and we are beginning a downward cycle of consumption. I do not believe that at all.

In fact, I believe we will resume the moment the environment settles down and credit supply comes back to the system. We have to see how SMEs start getting credit flow, how HFCs start getting credit flow, how real estate developers start getting credit flow. If all that were to happen, then we will start seeing recovery across the board. That is the single biggest factor one should look for.


What would be your strategy within the auto pack right now?I think, in auto, the worst is behind us. Most of the stocks have stopped reacting to the negative news flow. We have the GST meeting lined up. If there is any cut in the tax rate, we might see a short term boost to the sector. Again, as the credit recovers and some measures on boosting short-term demand is seen, we might see this sector coming back, at least the inventory levels might. This might happen over the next three-four quarters. 

Our take on auto has been that you right now want to play auto only for 30-40% bounce back as and when these measures get taken and demand comes. But will auto get the previous levels of valuations? We have our own doubt because the market has been spooked and will start worrying about the possible headwinds ahead on the disruption side. Hence, one has to question whether auto would get those kind of valuations again. We will watch and wait very clearly that it has to be very clearly a short term trade and then re-evaluated again in light of the new developments."

36,2019-09-18,Asian Paints,"Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have sold stocks worth $4.73 billion during July-September so far, their biggest quarterly sell-off at least since 1999. Despite the selloff in last three months, net foreign institutional investment for the year so far is still positive at $6.54 billion.

A host of factors, such as slower-than-expected demand growth in major economies, geopolitical and trade tensions and a gradual weakening of the economic growth prospects in India have contributed to the risk aversion.

India Ratings believes foreign funds flow into India is expected to remain under pressure in the near to medium term despite the government rolling back tax surcharge on FPIs and benign global monetary policy stance.

FPIs pulled out more than Rs 30,000 crore from Indian equities during July-August after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her maiden Budget levied the tax surcharge on overseas investors. Ever since the surcharge was announced in July, foreign investors had been demanding rollback of the decision, and on August 23, the government finally withdrew the same.

Gautam Chhaochharia, Managing Director and Head of Research at UBS Securities, said, “The FPI tax was not the single biggest driver why they were selling to begin with. They were selling because they had pumped in a lot of money pre-elections in the hope that Mr Modi with a new majority will push through policy measures to revive growth and reforms. Then the Budget turned out to be a disappointment. I do not think this necessarily was a reaction just for FPI tax, it was a reaction to the overall disappointment about growth and then the slumping growth locally and also what is happening globally.”

Following the unabated selling pressure by foreign institutional investors, BSE benchmark Sensex has cracked 8 per cent since July On while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indice fell 10 per cent each.

As much as 80 per cent of Sensex stocks eroded investors’ wealth during the ongoing quarter, with YES Bank falling the most at 40 per cent. Tata Steel, Tata Motors, SBI, Axis Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, ONGC and Vedanta have cracked 15-33 per cent during July 1-September 17.

Among the top gainers, Infosys and Asian Paints climbed 13 per cent each.

Among FII-heavy stocks, HDFC has slipped 11 per cent in the ongoing quarter till September 17. Shriram Transport Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance, IndusInd Bank, Just Dial and Care Ratings have fallen between 3 per cent and 44 per cent.

Anshul Saigal, Head & Portfolio Manager, Kotak Mahindra AMC told ETNow that the immediate reason for the latest bout of volatility in stocks seems to be crude oil. “Markets have become nervous because of global reasons than domestic ones. Of course, there are domestic reasons as well, but the nervousness, in general, runs through emerging markets globally.

“In the small and midcap space, this nervousness has continued through the year and the markets are moving in fits and spurts and in certain periods, you will see a complete trend reversal. Since these data points are adverse, markets will reverse again. For an investor to time market moves is really a loser’s proposition. This is a market where one has to take a directional call and sit on it -- be it for the long or short term -- without worrying about volatility,” he said."
38,2019-09-18,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Snapping their two day losing streak, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended with gains in volatile trading session on Wednesday supported by metal and realty stocks as investors cheered retreating oil prices and progress in US-China trade talks.

Analysts said markets rebounded after 2 days of selling pressure as oil prices cooled off which eased inflationary and trade deficit concerns. Saudi Arabia's energy minister said that more than half of the country's daily crude oil production that was knocked out by an attack had been recovered, assuring that production capacity at its targeted plants would be fully restored by the end of the month.

Further, US President Donald Trump's comment that a trade agreement between the US and China was likely to happen either before or immediately after the American elections also bolstered sentiments.

43,2019-09-20,Asian Paints,"The policy indicates that the government is willing to forgo some tax revenue, maybe a little bit of fiscal prudence but ensure that the economy comes back to the 7-8% growth track, says Sunil Singhania, Founder, Abakkus Asset Manager. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


From market standpoint, is government cutting tax rate by a clear signal that they are now doing whatever it takes to revive the economy?There is no doubt about it. These are much more than what the most optimistic person would have expected as far as India is concerned. It is a big step towards reviving manufacturing particularly because of the additional benefits for manufacturing and overall sentiment. What we were seeing was sentiments were constantly ebbing and just this one step rolls the sentiment back into action. It is clearly indicated that the government is willing to forgo some tax revenue, maybe a little bit of fiscal prudence but ensure that the economy comes back to the 7-8% growth track. It is like a AAA or hats off kind of announcement from the government.



Some of the mega caps like Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints have shown earnings visibility. They were outperforming because markets were not optimistic about recovery in investment/capex cycle. Will the pattern in the market change now in terms of allocation?What typically happens is that when investors are not very confident about the other parts of the economy, money flows into so called defensives where earnings are assured or very stable. The moment the risk appetite returns, money shifts back into companies which can benefit from the recovery in the economy. There will be definitely some reallocation. 

This step also opens up expectations of many more steps from the government because maybe some scrappage policy or some more policy encouraging investments in manufacturing could open up. I definitely believe that money will flow into so called stocks which can benefit out of likely growth. Obviously the initial beneficiaries would be companies which are paying full tax and for them it would be a straight 10% increase in net profit. 

It also increases the earnings expectations and therefore the PE will start to look much more lower than what it is today, maybe a 5-6% increase in overall earnings for the Nifty because of the tax cut is definitely on the cards and that would mean that the PE which is 17 will start to look at 16 and with major impetus. Overall, the market should attract a lot of interest and there is lot of money waiting on the sidelines. When I met investors, they were all waiting for a trigger to enter the market, I think this is a trigger. So you will have follow on buying from local investors ans also obviously from global investors."

45,2019-09-21,Asian Paints,"A cut in the corporate tax is expected to result in the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006. The growth in the Nifty 50’s earnings per share (EPS) may be upgraded by 7-8%. This will be a significant improvement given that the index’s 12-month expected EPS had fallen by 5% to Rs 645 after the June 2019 quarter results – the highest earnings downgrade among the top global equity markets.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded the estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25% for FY20 from 13% earlier.

Kotak Institutional Equities revised upwards its earnings growth for Nifty 50 to 25% from 15% buoyed by the sharp cut in corporate tax rate. According to Kotak estimate, automobiles, banks, capital goods, consumer staples, diversified financials and oil, gas & consumable fuels will be key beneficiaries of the cut while electric utilities, IT and pharmaceuticals will see little or no impact.



 At present, there are twenty companies in the Nifty 50 with tax rate higher than 25%. They have a cumulative weight of 39% in the index. The prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30% in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty 50 soon, will be another big beneficiary considering its tax rate of 34% in FY19.

The average tax rate for the broader BSE 500 index was 31-34% in the past two fiscals with tax outgo of Rs 2.3 lakh crore. It accounted of 34% of the total corporate tax collection, according to Credit Suisse.

The lower corporate tax may also help in improving valuations of Indian equities given the possible improvement in the return on equity. They trade at 40% premium to the MSCI Emerging Market Index, which is close to the 10-year average of 41%. A year ago, it was over 70%. A possibility of superior earnings should help in widening the current premium."

Factors behind the market rally:

Corporate tax cutThe corporate tax rate cut is still the biggest reason why the market is up on Monday. The cut will benefit the top 1,000 companies in tune of Rs 37,000 crore, according to CRISIL. The measure will cost the exchequer in tune of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. The rate cut brings down the effective taxes on profit for big companies by up to 28 per cent and for relatively smaller companies the same comes down by 13 per cent. 


GST Council decisionOn Friday, the GST Council reduced taxes on a number of items and services to boost consumption. The biggest beneficiaries of the tax cuts would be hospitality and tourism industry as the highest tax slab has been reduced to 18 per cent. Rooms prices below Rs 999 will be tax exempt, those between Rs 1,000 and Rs 7,499 will be taxed at 12 per cent and rooms priced above Rs 7,500 will be taxed at the rate of 18 per cent. 

Status quo on taxes on tobacco also cheered the market participants as the Street was expecting a hike in taxes. 


US-China trade warHopes of an interim Sino-US tariff deal increased after the two countries described their talks as ""productive"" and ""constructive"". US Trade Representative's office issued a brief statement characterising the two days of talks with China as ""productive."" Similarly, China's Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as ""constructive"", and said they had also had a good discussion on ""detailed arrangements"" for the high-level talks in October. Additionally, the United States removed tariffs from more than 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies.


Nifty breaks 50, 200DMAsOn daily charts, Nifty broke above the 50 and 200-day moving averages (DMAs) that indicated a bullish trade setup. Friday's rally also negated fears of Nifty testing its swing low of 10,637 anytime soon. The 11,100-11,150 zone, which posed a strong resistance earlier, will now act as a support for the index on the downside, said Mohit Khanchandani of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.

51,2019-09-23,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The government’s move to lower corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent is likely to ensure Rs 72,000 crore savings for about 300-odd companies in the BSE500 basket.

Stocks like ONGC, IOC and Reliance Industries could add Rs 12,459 crore to profits. Metals and mining firms such as Vedanta, Coal India and Tata Steel may add Rs 8,820 crore to aggregate bottom line. Consumption stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints and Nestle India, among others, and capital goods companies L&T, Siemens and others may together see over Rs 11,000 crore addition to their profits.



Having said that, the stocks may not go on a relentless rally. Edelweiss Securities said after Friday’s big rally, upsides may be more modest from here on.

The brokerage projects Nifty at 11,600 by September, 2020. That said, the brokerage sees more opportunities to take on risk at stock as well as portfolio levels.

Goldman Sachs on Friday reasserted its positive view on India, and raised its 12-month Nifty target to 13,200 from 12,500 earlier, saying recent pro-growth measures, a boost to already the highest earnings growth in the region and a likely revival in sentiment further strengthen the positive investment case for India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said companies currently availing exemptions can opt for paying the new tax rates, only once the exemption periods get over. On the other hand, companies which will avail the lower tax rate will not be able to avail any of the exemptions.

Domestic equity indices saw their second-biggest intraday rally of the year on Friday, as the Rs 1.45 lakh crore tax relief brought down effective tax rate for domestic companies to 25.6 per cent from 34.9 per cent. Sensex galloped 1,921 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 38,014, while Nifty zoomed 569 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 11,274.

Meanwhile, MAT or minimum alternate 
tax which applies to ‘zero 
tax companies’ has been reduced to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent earlier.

“Looking at the PAT boost due to lower taxes and keeping the current Street expectations and valuations in mind, we could see a 23 per cent upside in the overall market in next 2- 3 years,” KR Choksey said in a note.

For benchmark Nifty, analysts now expect a profit growth of 24-26 per cent compared with 13-15 per cent earlier.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded its estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25 per cent for FY20 from 13 per cent earlier. Kotak Securities expects net profits of Nifty firms to grow at 25 per cent for FY2020 against 15 per cent projected earlier.

This assumes that companies will retain bulk of the tax cuts. In reality, some of them will pass on some of the benefits to consumers. If this happens, it would be the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006.

Among Nifty stocks, 20 companies with tax rates higher than 25 per cent have a cumulative weightage of 39 per cent in the index.

Prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut would include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30 per cent in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty50 soon, will be another big beneficiary, considering it had a tax rate of 34 per cent in FY19.

Meanwhile, apart from recurring earnings benefit, there will also be one-time gains on deferred tax liabilities for companies such as RIL, Ultratech, among others, and one-time loss on deferred tax assets for corporate banks, Edelweiss Securities said."

56,2019-09-24,Asian Paints,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Tuesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 65 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Indian Hotels and raised target price to Rs 178 from Rs 165. Indian Hotels got much needed relief from the reduction in GST rates and corporate tax rate in India, said HSBC. Hotels are likely to pass on the benefit to consumers to revive slowing demand, said HSBC. Shares of Indian Hotels ended up 8.2 per cent at Rs 160.40 on Monday.

• ICICIdirect has upgraded Asian Paints to buy from hold with a revised target price of Rs 1950. The recent tax cut by the government from 33 per cent to 25.2 per cent is likely to boost earnings of Asian Paints by around 12 per cent each for FY20 and FY21, said ICICIdirect. The brokerage believes a tax cut would help demand revival in the decorative paints segment, especially in the premium category of products. Shares of Asian Paints ended up 7.9 per cent at Rs 1804.25 on Monday.


• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on Apar Industries with a target price of Rs 698. The brokerage remains positive on Apar Industries as it is well placed to capitalise on the uptick in T&D with improved product mix leading to a strong 36 per cent compounded annual growth rate in profit after tax over FY19–21.Further, with declining capital intensity and improving profitability, we estimate return on equity to improve 568 bps to 17.5 per cent over FY19-21, said Edelweiss. Shares of Apar Industries ended down 1 per cent at Rs 563 on Monday.

• Antique Stock Broking has maintained buy rating on ITC with a revised target price of Rs 382 after GST rates on cigarettes remain unchanged in the GST council meeting on September 20. The breather to the cigarette industry continues, said Antique. This event coupled with the reduction in corporate tax rate, in turn provides, ITC another chance to revive its cigarette volumes, said Antique. The company will use the same for trade promotions, incentivise its dealers and push growth through the trade channel, said Antique. Shares of ITC ended up 7 per cent at Rs 254.7 on Monday.

• IIFL has upgraded Hindustan Unilever to add with a target price of Rs 2100. The income tax rate cut recently announced by government of India will prima facie increase HUL’s EPS by around 7 per cent, said IIFL. HUL is best placed within the sector to use this windfall to balance between strengthening its competitive position and improving profitability as in some of its core categories, competition is unlikely to enjoy this tax rate cut benefit, said IIFL. Shares of Hindustan Unilever ended up 3.3 per cent at Rs 2035.40 on Monday."
62,2019-09-25,Asian Paints,"At the time when the scuttlebutt among Dalal Street investors has been around stock picking, after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a series of measures to boost the Indian economy, value investor Rajiv Khanna is sceptical about this rally. 

He says new companies, for whom the FM has announced 15 per cent corporate tax, will get a lot of investment over time and, therefore, it is good thinking. Khanna said certain companies would benefit from the corporate tax cut. 

However, he said issues related to economic slowdown would take their own time to play out, unless the government made sure the consumer gets more money in their pockets. “That problem remains unaddressed,” he told ETMarkets.com in an interaction.

“I wish she (Sitharaman) would address that. The current rally is irrational exuberance. I am a bit sceptical about it, unless consumer gets more money in their hands,” he said.

Khanna, the brain behind Dolly Khanna’s multibagger portfolio, is one of the most successful stock investors on Dalal Street. This Chennai-based investor has a knack for identifying quality stocks at the right time and has pocketed stellar returns over the years. 

In the current market, he is still waiting for the economic slowdown to subside. “Let consumption start increasing, then I will start investing. At this point, slowdown is a reality. I am waiting for data points to emerge. I am not guessing it. I am looking for growth right now. Nothing at this point looks attractive to me. It is still a wait and watch for me,” said Khanna, whose portfolio is now worth Rs 200 crore based on the holdings as of June 30.

The aggregate market capitalisation of the BSE-listed firms swelled by over Rs 10 lakh crore in just two sessions till September 23. The market mood took a ‘U’ a turn after the government on September 20 cut corporate tax rate by almost 10 percentage points, as it looked to pull the economy out of a six-year-low growth rate and address a 45-year high unemployment rate by reviving private investment with a Rs 1.45 lakh crore corporate tax bonanza.

Khanna sold his stake in several companies through this selloff. He held six companies in his portfolio with over one per cent holding as of June 30 against 11 as of March 31, Ace Equity data showed.

The base rate for corporate tax for existing companies has dropped to 22 per cent from 30 per cent at present. For new manufacturing firms, incorporated after October 1, 2019 and starting operations before March 31, 2023, it was slashed to 15 per cent from 25 per cent at present.

Among other notable investors on Dalal Street, Mumbai-based value investor Vijay Kedia believes short covering took the market higher over Friday and Monday.

However, he said the market might not rise substantially from here on, because the problems at macroeconomic levels – including job losses and demand issues – have remained unresolved yet.

He sees subdued numbers for automobile sales and GDP growth. “Things that were in bad shape are still in bad shape. It will take time for them to improve. One should look for opportunities in the midcap space from October onwards,” Kedia said.

With an 8 per cent rally each, both BSE midcap and smallcap indices outpaced the benchmark Sensex index (up 4.71 per cent) on a month-to-date basis till September 23.

Abhishek Basumullick, Kolkata-based value investor and Chief Investment Advisor, Intelsense Capital, believes companies that are able to effectively manage returns on capital employed (RoCE) would be able to use the additional tax saving well. Therefore, investors should look for quality and capital-efficient companies and avoid panic buying.

One in every five companies in the BSE500 index has managed to post RoCE of over 20 per cent in last five years. The list included HUL, Britannia Industries, VST Industries, Hero MotoCorp, TCS, Care Ratings, Asian Paints, Bajaj Consumer Care, Mindtree, Whirlpool and Alembic Pharma.

Aveek Mitra, Founder, Aveksat Financial Advisory, says the worst for midcap and smallcap stocks is over. He advised investors to look for companies doing better than the industry or have good capex in the recent past."
63,2019-09-25,Asian Paints,"If earnings show green shoots, then confidence will be back and participation level should start going up, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Everybody is contemplating whether, this market will hit a new high and stay there or is the best behind us in the short term and markets will consolidate or fall? What is your view?What happened last week was definitely tectonic.This was the hard bullet that nobody expected the government to bite! It was done so quickly, going even against the DTC recommendations of 25%, we have actually brought it down to 22%. So it is a great move. 

Now, in the last three days, the so-called animal spirits were definitely unleashed. Today corporate India thinks that yes the government will act and the government is serious about ensuring that the economy is back on the growth track. So those are very big positives. But having said that, we do not see that there is a lot of commitment on part of the FIIs. Even in terms of recent stock movements, wherever the effective tax rate differential has been large, even within sectors like auto. For example, Eicher Motors was at 35% tax rate whereas M&M was at 25%. Therefore, the pronounced move that you have seen in the last three days in both these stocks has been very different

The market has clearly made a differential that once the tax rate has come down, it is for good and hence there has been stock-wise movements within sectors. Now does this lead to increase in capex? That is a function of what is my current capacity and the estimation of demand that I see here on. The monsoon has definitely been good. In fact, India has probably seen an excess monsoon for the first time after almost six years. 

So even though the rainfall distribution may not be great and you may not get a very big kharif output, at least the outlook on rabi crop is positive and that is a big sentiment booster. But look at it this way. In July, after the first quarter numbers were out, everybody bought the earnings down to 8-10%; today because of that tax cut, you are back to the expectation of 25% for FY20 on Nifty earnings. That is why the market is back where it is. But from here onwards, the big mover is the September quarter is earnings. If somehow this shows green shoots, then confidence will be back and participation level should start going up.


Are you betting on the consumption theme then? Given that some of those factors will see a revival in growth, will that positively impact these companies?Apart from consumption which is fairly well owned and well valued, the government is the big mover here. Today when you see the bills that were pending for long have started getting cleared, money is back into the system and orders are being given out. You will probably see the domestic cyclicals more in favour than perhaps consumption or FMCG. Apart from that, even where there has been a massive drawdown in terms of prices like in cases of PSU banks or where the tax rate was very high, those themes are likely to play out far better.


Are you betting on the consumption theme then or being positive on the outlook that given some of those factors we will see a revival in growth and that will positively impact these companies?Apart from consumption, which is fairly well-owned and well-valued, the government is the big mover here. So today when you see the bills that were pending for long have been starting to get cleared, money is back into the system and orders are being given out, I think you will probably see the economy facing, the domestic cyclicals probably more in favour than perhaps the consumption or the FMCG and I think apart from that even where there has been a massive draw down in terms of prices like some of the state owned banks or where the tax rate was very high -- those themes are likely to play out far better.


We saw IT, pharma the defensive plays so to speak, completely lag when the markets were on fire. Yesterday they were back in play. What does one make of it?Most of the tech space has been at 25% effective tax rate and to that extent, there will not be any immediate benefit because of the change in taxation. Also, they have not seen any upgrades and that is where the positive news is not forthcoming. Therefore, the optimism was not there on Friday and Monday. Yesterday, there were some sort of tempering and people realised a lot of catch-up has to be done. 

In case of a demand revival, it is likely to show up in these sectors as well because IT is a large employment generator. The other thing that plays out is that tax cut will definitely give some sort of positive sentiment on a capex outline which is a larger long term decision for a corporate. The next thing that probably needs to be looked at in terms of a followup is personal tax reduction, which will lead to a direct demand stimulus.

If you do both of these, then there is likely to be some amount of fiscal strain and because of that, one should definitely hear some positive action on the divestment front. Since only a few months are left for the fiscal to get over, the space for piecemeal steps like CPSE ETF probably will not move the needle much. One needs to look at real strategic divestments to get in big money. In case the government moves on that, it will set the market on the right track.


Do you believe that one is safer sticking to private corporate names?From here onwards, one has to look at the improvement in margins. Private banks have been fairly valued and so the asset improvement is likely to be visible in case the economy picks up in banks which have not been priced. Public sector banks would be a larger beneficiary of the incremental flow and the improvement in business due to a revival in economy.


Within consumption where is the opportunity to buy afresh? From Titan to D-Mart to Asian Paints, all are trading at exuberant valuations?The incremental flow will perhaps be not that high. Bigger returns are likely to be made where ownership is low and the delta is likely to be bigger. 


Why do you say that? Sometimes you need to buy simple compounding stories; over ownership, under ownership are important factors but they cannot be the only factor. Just because HDFC Bank is owned, why should you not buy it?You have a point there. But HDFC Bank, Titan, all these are franchise companies. Now franchise value is a very different connotation from the classic valuations that an investor would look at. You can make a SIP on them on a monthly basis.. Even on an individual case, you can keep buying them and these will compound because demand will be there. They will be able to run an efficient business model and there will be returns for the investors to make. 

But I thought the question was where will be the larger flow from here onwards for investors to look at in terms of allocating capital? I think one should make a case of allocation to these franchise companies which will continue on their growth path but don’t expect a large change in them because of the tax cut as perhaps in some other cases where the tax rates were far higher. That is the only limited point I am trying to make because the tax rate reduction is a profit opportunity that is available on a permanent ongoing basis for any corporate. That is where for a company with a 35% effective tax rate coming down to 25% effectively means a 10% secular earnings growth.


Which names would you pick up?Coal India and Eicher Motors are companies where there is some element of franchise value and an element of competitiveness, a monopolistic situation and these are places where one is likely to see a good pick up in revenue if the sentiment and the economy pick up.


Will you buy BPCL with this view or for that matter any PSU, thinking that tomorrow will be better for these PSUs?Our view on OMCs has always been good because they are fantastically run businesses, available at great value. These are also great assets for somebody to chase them. If BPCL and HPCL see the light of divestment some day, the amount of windfall they can unlock for the government is tremendous. Also, there would be a re-rating. For example, HP is available at 6 times EV EBITDA. These companies are fantastic cash machines. The petrol price deregulation mechanism is seamless. In the recent week also, the prices have been marked up appreciably. There is no reason for somebody not to go in for them especially when the entire auto sector, auto fuel retailing story in India is just about to be unleashed.

There is a strong chance of cash flow and appetite of investors for PSUs as a basket. The chances of a strategic divestment before the financial year runs out is far higher than what it was a month back. These are great stocks available at great value and a trigger of divestment also is a good tailwind. These can be prime stocks for long. 


What is your view on Zee?The business is in good shape. It is just that today there is a short-term overhang over how the promoters settle their debt and the stake sale and the discussions with the MFs etc. If there is clarity, the stock can perhaps retrace earlier levels because at Rs 30,000 crore, it is not a bad business in case the economy was to pick up from here.

Will you buy the Zee stock?At this price, it is a fairly good risk reward equation.


How are you mapping the price? Why is it good, why is it bad? Just because this has fallen or you think it has become cheap? Their OTT platform, Zee5, is losing money.Yes but the fact is it was not expected to make money from day one any way. When businesses and verticals are in investment mode, there is a certain amount of runway that is given them for them to play out in terms of accretion, content creation, etc. There is enough for us to give them some time and this overhang has perhaps seen a very disproportionate amount of price impact on the stock price. That is why I said that Rs 30,000 crore it is not a very bad risk reward equation given the fact that the business does not seem to have completely fallen off the cliff."
65,2019-09-25,Asian Paints,"Today the choices from the point of view of playing investment cycle are very limited. Give or take, there are three-four capital goods players and a couple of cement companies, says Gautam Duggad, Head - Research, Motilal Oswal Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Has the market run its course and the adjustment of the corporate tax rate cut is already in the price after that 8.5% move that we saw on the index on Friday and Monday?Gautam Duggad: I do not think one can look at an event of such magnitude from a prism of two-three days. Obviously, the initial reaction was very swift but one has to understand that the tax benefits are going to be there for perpetuity and therefore the adjustment in free cash flows and earnings and more importantly the ROEs of different sectors have changed sustainably because of this one move. 

While in the short term, the market may move here and there, but this is clearly a re-rating event not just from the point of view of a few sectors, but also from that of the country. This is because you are changing the ROEs sustainably on the higher side and therefore to look at it from the point of view of a few days of index adjustments or a few sectors’ swift runup will be bit erroneous. 


What would be your strategy at this point? Would you be reallocating fresh additions, waiting and watching? There has been one small change in our strategy. A week or so back, I had said that we are very positive on IT and other defensives. That is one change that we have made. Incrementally, there has been a sectoral rotation from IT towards domestic cyclicals like financials. We continue to stay positive on consumption because they are also one of the big beneficiaries of the tax cut and they already have a very high ROE. The growth prospect can improve, given that there is sentiment change overnight. 

After a couple of months or quarters, you can see consumption direction also improving. What has also happened is that some of the other sectors like pharma or utilities have not seen any meaningful benefit because in utilities, it is anyways a pass through arrangement and by and large, most of the companies are already low tax paying. 

So you will see some sector rotation from sectors like IT, pharma and utilities towards sectors like financials and consumption. At the margin also, some of the industrials, like capex oriented sectors because the immediate reaction from this move is that over a period of time, it can lead to improvement in the investment cycle, which has been virtually stagnant for the last seven-eight years. 

Once the corporate savings go up post this move, you will see an improvement in the investment cycle but it will take some time, it is not going to happen tomorrow or next week. But it does bring the conversation or investment cycle back on the table. 


Do you stick it out with the safer lot, the largecaps, and continue to deploy money in expensive Nifty names. Do you think higher alpha generation is possible within the mid and the smallcaps? Is there now a case for the broader market to recover as well?I agree with your view, but with a caveat that you will not see all sorts of midcaps participating in this rally. The largecaps will always move and that is what we have seen even in those two days when the markets rallied sharply.

Nifty has outperformed the midcap and small cap indices and even within Nifty, we have seen around 10 or 15 companies leading the charge. These largely belong to consumption, auto and financials. The fact of the matter is looking at it from a long-term prism is beneficial for companies with high growth and high ROE. Theoretically it should lead to a jump in their earnings multiple -- whether it is P/E or P/B -- it is a separate case. 

I was looking at this data yesterday for both midcap and smallcaps. The smallcap index is still down 36% from December 17 and midcap index is also down more than 20%. There is enough room for midcaps to perform from here because what midcap was lacking was confidence and risk aversion. This step of the government has removed risk aversion to an extent. If you see some earnings coming back over a period of time, there is definitely a case for midcaps to outperform from here. 

Again within midcaps, you will find some sectors with more dominance, especially on the financial side because their ROEs are getting an expansion of 100 to 200 bps. Secondly, sectors in midcap belonging to consumption or consumer discretionary will see more preference. You will not see midcaps which have some stress on the balance sheet or a lack of earnings visibility, performing despite this move. Only the quality midcaps and companies without any stress or issues on their balance sheet will outperform. But as a pack, we think from here midcaps can outperform.


There are some of the consumption plays that you are finding attractive. There has been a lot of talk about whether or not valuations justify adding more into those counters. On the other hand, we are awaiting further rate cuts or boost that we may see in the economy. What is your outlook? What kind of potential do you see on some of those names?Even six months back, nobody said consumption stocks are cheap. For that matter, in this entire cycle of last five or ten years. one has always found consumer companies expensive. I do not recall anybody saying Lever was cheap at Rs 600 or Rs 800. So at Rs 2,000, obviously it is not cheap. 

Most of us are trying to look at consumer stocks from the prism of one year forward PE which is bit a short-termish. While no one can deny that in the short term, their valuations are expensive, the fact remains that from the point of view of the consumer sector, there are two indirect benefits; a) The huge tax arbitrage of the unorganised sector gets narrowed. b) Post GST, this is another step which can further the shift from unorganised to organised. 

It is very beneficial for the leaders in respective categories in those sectors. Hindustan Lever, Titan or for that matter Page, Pidilite and Asian Paints are companies which were high tax paying. They are getting two meaningful boost from this. In the short term, you are getting a tax benefit and from a longer-term perspective, you are getting a market share gain and it changes the scale of competitive advantages for many of these companies. 

In the short term, it is very difficult to forecast what will happen and that is the framework that we have always followed in last four years. We have backed a couple of these names since last four or five years. While they have been expensive, they kept on getting more expensive because the earnings growth outlook was relatively better in a market which is hungry for earnings growth in other sectors. This shift will continue to play out and frustrate people who are looking at these stocks from a point of view of one year forward PE.


Many believe that perhaps it would be better to stick to investment-led themes with a lot of capital good companies, road construction, etc. That is finding favour as opposed to pure play consumption. Is there a higher degree of outperformance within that segment as opposed to consumption?Yes, but there is again a caveat. The investment cycle will take time to revive. It is not going to happen in FY20 post this tax cut. But what has changed is that the corporate savings will go up. In our estimates, we are seeing Rs 30,000 crore of extra profit for FY20 and that will keep growing year on year. But first, the sentiment has to improve and then only will demand come. After that, the corporates will start thinking about investment. Right now their capacities are underutilised. 

If you go sector by sector, the biggest beneficiaries of this tax cut are financials and consumption. They do not need any fresh capex. Metals is already in a deleveraging cycle. I do not think they are even thinking about a big fresh capex. Similarly, there is enough cement capacity in the system which does not need any fresh immediate capacity boost. 

The investment cycle will happen but not immediately. It can be a FY21 or FY 22 story. The good thing is that now both the fiscal and monetary policies are supportive of growth. The interest rates are also lower and at the same time you have got improvement in corporate savings post the tax cut. This clearly improves the visibility on investment cycle coming back. The problem is it will not happen immediately and the second problem is to find relevant investible place in that space. 

Today the choices from the point of view of playing investment cycle are very limited. Give or take, there are three-four capital good players and a couple of cement companies. Beyond that hunting for lot of investment cycle plays is a challenge for a capital allocator today."

64,2019-09-25,Asian Paints,"Companies which have a moat around them will have the ability to retain the tax cut and will benefit but in sectors where there is too much competition, companies will have to pass on the tax benefits and would not gain much, says Samit Vartak, Founding Partner & CIO, SageOne Investment Advisors. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW’s Nikunj Dalmia.


We are calling it the big reset, is it a big reset?Definitely. It is one of the biggest fundamental changes for India. Now, the question is whether it is a big reset for all the companies or if it is a big reset for selective companies. It is very important to understand that from the investment perspective. If it is a competitive industry with too many players at a similar level, it is going to be very difficult for them to retain profits. If their ROE goes up by 15% because of earnings going up by 15%, in a very short period of time, they will price each other out and then the ROE will come down to the same levels as they were before. 

But there are many industries where competition has been decimated and you will find it across various sectors -- be it capital goods, specialty chemicals or alloys. That is where the pricing power will be retained because such companies have built up the capacity over the last four-five years and the valuations are at multi-year lows or even at historical lows. That is where the opportunity is.

There are dominant players which everyone is aware of -- be it the top banks or the top NBFCs. They will definitely benefit. But the question is how much of that is already priced in. This is a rare opportunity where there is a real fundamental change but still people are very sceptical about the changes, especially the ones where the stocks are beaten down. But that is where the big opportunity will be and you need to dig through and understand the competitive environment in that specific industry and bet on the players where they are so dominant that it is almost impossible for the new competition to come in. Whether it is the offshore or domestic competition, it will be very difficult to build the kind of competitive advantages they have and these are very basic industries which are not going to be disrupted by any high-tech developments. 

If you talk to the PE or the venture capital guys, they are excited about a lot of disruptions that are going to come through in India. For them, many of the consumer-oriented distribution channels are very important. One does not know whether five years down the line and when distribution channels get disrupted, big moats of consumer oriented companies can be disrupted. So you need to be very careful on those aspects because if you are paying 70, 80, 90 times for earnings growth of 10% to 15% and if there is a big disruption which comes through in the next 5-10 years, the derating which can start can be a big hit on your portfolio.


So you are saying that yes, there is a big fundamental change in the economy but not every company or every sector will benefit in the same manner. Companies with a moat around them will have the ability to retain the tax cut; but companies who are just one more in the crowd, will have to pass on the tax benefits. Markets have gone up like in a rising tide on the hope every company would benefit.Yes, that is the general risk. When things change at an industry level or a complete macro level it is very difficult to retain the profits. Again I have always been talking about the theme of market share gain. Market share gains happen only if there is one dominant player and there are other weaker players. The difference between the competitiveness of these players is huge. All the dominant players across the sectors are the players who have grown at a significantly higher rate compared to the rest of the competition.

So, that kind of theme is going to accelerate and this theme anyway works across the up and the down cycles and this is a complete fillip that the government has given such companies and the profitable ones will get even more dominant. So you got to find companies where valuation is in your favour.


Are you fully invested in this market?Yes, we were not raising money until 2018. We have stopped taking funds.


Your view was that midcaps were reaching a bubble level. After that, reality has dawned and you raised capital after that. That was a great call. What is your call now?No, I think in this kind of market you need to be completely invested.


So one should not be biased. Just because midcaps have suffered in the past, they would continue to suffer and just because largecaps have made money, they would continue to make money?For me, the dominant player can be the largest player in that industry but if the industry is small, you know he may not be a largecap, but he would have as big a competitive advantages as many of the largecap players. That is where the opportunity is because even the best of such players have taken a hit because it is part of the midcaps. Suddenly, in the last two years, markets are differentiating midcaps and largecaps which generally does not happen and you got to differentiate by looking at the competitive advantages.


Differentiate between the businesses rather than the market capitalisation.Exactly and that is what the market has done and that is where the opportunity is.


Give me an example. You have identified themes or companies which are dominant and very good quality companies with higher return ratios though the size of the market may not be large? One such example is steel pipes. You know the steel pipes which are used in building factories, building airports, all kind of infra projects or even affordable housing where you use it for door frames. Steel pipes is a very basic industry but over the last five-six years, the number of players have shrunk. There are only two or three dominant players.


PSL used to be one, Man used to be one, some of those companies do not even exist now.Right. And I am talking about a cross section where they manufacture these square or rectangular pipes. The industry has been decimated and there are only a couple of players left who have built up the capacity. The return on capital is upwards of 25%. 

If this theme of attracting new capex and especially foreign money also comes in, India will go through a huge construction boom at least in terms of factories and the guys who have the capacity are going to benefit the most. It is a small industry; probably a $10-billion industry. But the biggest beneficiary of the capex build up will be top guy in this field. I find people are just not giving any valuation to such companies. I would say that their growth rate going forward as well as their dominance will be bigger than some of the consumer-oriented companies.

Many of the consumer oriented companies do not even manufacture those products, they just brand it. When you look at guys like Amazon with all of their private level products available on the website which are available at 20-30% discount and all of these companies now trading at 50-60-60 times multiple, I am not sure if their dominance is going to last for too long. It is an extremely competitive industry. 

Anyone can come in, get the product manufactured by outsourcing it and put its own stamp and sell it in the market. There is no real differentiation between the products. The competitive advantage is that some of these basic steel manufacturing companies are at various levels of dominance -- be it sourcing the raw material, working capital lines, the kind of rates they get, their manufacturing as well as distribution abilities. It is very difficult to build all those four aspects of the business. Dominance is going to last much more than many of the haloed consumer oriented companies.


There is one sector where the disruption is real and where disruption will change the way how future business would be conducted. It is the auto sector. EV is eventually going to cap the PE upside for a Maruti, Bajaj Auto and auto ancillary companies. Do you own auto or auto ancillary stocks?I am very careful about the auto or auto ancillary companies, especially the ones geared towards passenger vehicles side because there are huge headwinds. It is not just in India, globally also, all the passenger vehicle players are going through a huge structural change even in China, Europe and the US. 

So you cannot bet on themes where anyway there is a big disruption which may or may not happen in the next two to five years but definitely in the next 10 years. At the same time, consumer behaviour is also changing with the Ola, Ubers of the world. If I do not see 20% growth, I just avoid that kind of a sector and auto is one of those. 


Great compounders like Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance have always been expensive and the quest for a fund manager like you is to avoid the haloed, overcrowded stocks. Is there a learning for all of us when we look at some of these classic businesses but avoid buying them because they look expensive or are over-owned?During the last two years, one has seen the benefit of owning those quality stocks but two years is not a long period. You got to look over a cycle. Most of these companies barring maybe like a Bajaj Finance, typically grows at much lesser than 20% and especially the consumer oriented companies. So, if your returns expectations are in the range of 10 to 15%, there is no reason for you to go hunting for anything else. Just hold on to these companies and the valuations do not matter, if you are going to hold on to them for at least 15-20 years. So, it is a no-brainer for a passive investor. 

For a fund manager, if your return expectations cross 20%, you cannot hope for rerating perpetually in these stocks. They are already trading at such valuations that going forward, you can see only the earnings growth as your return. If the earnings growth is going to be 10-12% and if you are happy with those returns, then it is great for you. So that is my problem. But yes, there are certain companies like Bajaj Finance which I am happy to hold and I am fine overpaying for higher growth. But if it falls, like in the case of Page Industries. I held it for multiple years but by 2016, the growth rate fell below 20%.

As soon as the growth rate stops and comes back to the normalised growth rate, these companies lose their PE multiple and you would never know which company will go through that kind of a cycle. There will be only two or three such companies which will sustain it for the next 20 years or 25 years, but I do not know whether you have the ability because you would have said the same thing about Eicher or a Page and you may have the same kind of losses which a lot of midcaps have gone through if you have bought them at the highs. 

Now, in which part of the market is the risk reward in your favour? I would say it is not in your favour if you are buying at such valuations and if your time horizon is five or seven years. You can imagine that at a 10-11% growth, it takes seven years to double the earnings and 80 times PE multiple goes down to 40 times PE multiples. It can happen because historically they have never traded at such valuations. You end up making zero returns. 

Whether you want to take that kind of a risk, especially given that India can go through with this incentive -- once the higher growth rate phase starts and there are more alternatives available for investors to get into such companies. People will start to get out of those because in the last seven years, the rest of the universe had stopped growing and these were the only companies which consistently grew and that is where a lot of foreign investors as well as Indian investors flocked into these companies. If it reverses, I am not sure these companies will maintain such high PE multiples. 


There is a big if over when corporate India will start spending and when the earning cycles will pick up. Corporate capex was supposed to pick up in 2016. We are staring at the ugly reality where the government had to give a tax cut to kick start the investment cycle. What if it does not pick up? It is possible because it is not that companies will flock into the country just because of one incentive. Coming into the country has to become easy and starting a business also has to become easy. For that, the government has to go for the land reforms and then labour reforms. Given the conviction of this government, I think they will get it done. 

If that is done, you can look at the interest rate at lowest levels. Commodity prices including steel are at extremely low levels. The tax rates are at the lowest levels. I feel the tax cut move would not have been as valuable if it was done under any normal circumstances. 

The US-China trade war is giving you an opportunity where many American companies may shift to some other geographies, away from China. So you get this window and you got to grab it. If you do not grab it now, those companies are not going to shift their plants once they are already set up in Indonesia or Thailand or Vietnam. So the timing is extremely important. 


Can India survive in manufacturing? Made in India ended up becoming only a slogan by the NDA-1 government. Frankly in the last six years, with the exception of two or three large big ticket investments, nothing has come.Look at the chemical belt. After China, India probably is the dominant chemical producer. A belt was formed, right incentives were given and the ecosystem was there. That is what needs to be created. It does not need to happen across the nation. You find certain pockets where the land prices are really low, where the ecosystem is there, where you have the right skill sets. If it is planned well, I do not think we lack anything which any other country may have and if the government plans it right and has the right intention, it can be done. 


Would you say that you need a different strategy for every pitch? Sometimes go on the front foot and sometimes go on the back foot? In 2019, those who played a defensive strategy in the stock market, have benefitted. Do you think now it is the time to take a leap of faith and start buying risk in the portfolio? I am not in favour of buying risk. Obviously you can take a tactical call on that but it is betting too much on luck. I feel you find dominant players available at cheaper prices compared to historical valuations and they will definitely be more dominant three, four, five years down the line. Go after B2B players which are geared towards capital goods. 

Look at these steel pipes, electrical cable manufacturer because whether this theme plays out or not, they are dominant and highly profitable. They will benefit from it and they are exposed to the real estate sector. They are exposed to factories, all kinds of construction as well as the consumer-oriented retail business. 

There are certain niche businesses like alloys which are used in steel manufacturing and there are such industries where there are just one or two players, extremely dominant, almost impossible to get into those businesses because most of them have burnt their fingers and got out of such businesses. If India grows at a higher rate, their growth rate also can be significantly higher. 

If this theme works out and the commodity growth is higher like steel industry, these companies are trading at two, three, four times multiples with over 30% return on capital, sitting on huge cash, no issue of debt or balance sheet and promoter holding of 75%. Such companies can go through a huge re-rating as well as huge growth over the next five years. That is where the opportunity is.


How have you managed to convince your clients to keep calm? All midcap stocks have got beaten. Price damage and collateral damage has been there. What are you telling your clients? How should they keep the calm when the entire sector has got de-rated?No, it is extremely difficult because whatever you tell them, if they see damage in their portfolio, people get concerned. It is human nature because a fund manager may see visibility in certain companies but as a passive investor, you may not have the same conviction or visibility in those names."
67,2019-09-26,Asian Paints,"All stock derivatives will be physically settled from October series, that begins on Friday. Aiming to curb excessive speculation and volatility in share prices, market regulator Sebi last December issued a framework for making physical settlement of stock derivatives mandatory by October, 2019.

Of the 161 stocks that trade in the F&O segment currently, 50 stocks moved to physical settlement in April and July each.

The rest, about 45 stocks, will be moved to physical settlement from October series that begins on Friday. They include some of the frontline names such as Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel, Britannia, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, HUL, ITC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Reliance Industries, State Bank of India and L&T, among others.

Meanwhile, a few stocks will be excluded from the F&O segment from October series. 


How does it work?
Earlier, on the expiry of a series, any open future position, if left unattended and open, would automatically get closed (squared off) at the close of the session with the final closing price as the settlement price.

The difference of mark-to-market (M2M), i.e. the difference of today’s closing price against the previous closing price, would either get debit or credited as the case may be into the client’s ledger. This used to force traders to roll over positions ahead of expiry to avoid lumping of rollovers at the end of the series, which leads to excessive volatility.

But when the contract is physically-settled, this will not be the case, and would require actual delivery.

Here is a real-life example of various scenarios that can play out in case of long or short positions.


(a) Long Position: Let us assume, a trader is long on HDFC at Rs 2,070. On the expiry day, if the stock closes at Rs 2,095, irrespective of the price at which it settles, a delivery of the shares in a quantity equivalent to the lot size will be effected in the client’s account. In this case, the client will be forced to take delivery of 500 HDFC shares. Market participants will be required to maintain that much money with his broker, failing which the broker will sell the shares received as per relevant risk management measures. One lot of HDFC comprises 500 shares.


(b) Short position: Suppose, the trader is short on a HDFC futures contract priced at Rs 2,070 and the contract settles at Rs 2,095 on the expiry day. Since the contract was not be squared off, under the physical settlement mechanism, the client will be required to deliver the number of shares equivalent of the contract size, i.e. 500 to the broker. Now, since the client will not have these shares, it will result in a shortfall in delivery. The broker will then purchase the shares from the auction market and deliver the same to the exchange to meet client's delivery obligation. Here, the client will be liable to pay or receive the difference between the auction purchase price and the final settlement price that he/she got on the last day.


What does it mean for retailers?
Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, Consultant Technical Analyst at Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, says for retail investors, it would mean higher margin requirements in the last four days of the month, beginning Monday, until the expiry day.

As per Sebi guidelines, a broker will need higher margins beginning Monday, which will increase to 100 per cent by Thursday in a staggered manner.


Precautions
Analysts say market participants should take some precautions in this regard. First of all, they will have to remain vigilant and provide higher margins in the last few days, leading to expiry. If they miss out on this, the broker would be within his rights to square off the positions through relevant risk management policies.

If the trader is holding short positions, then he/she should remain watchful and make sure to square off. Alternatively, one should make sure he has equivalent amount of shares lying in his Demat account for a back-up and avoid any shortfall of delivery, as it may lead to the broker making purchases from the auction market, thus slapping him with the price difference.

If a trader wants to avoid either of these situations, he should make an early rollover on or before Monday of the expiry week to avoid such problems.


What’s in it for you?
Vaishnav says the step will not affect the market in any way, either positively or negatively. The measure is aimed at reducing volatility during the expiry week, but it is not expected to help much.

“Those who want to continue with open speculative positions will make rollovers earlier instead of waiting till the last two days before the expiry. Thus, this will not have any significant impact on the market,” he said.

Anup Chandak, Deputy Vice President F&O, Sharekhan, says volumes will pick up as everybody would square off and not take delivery.

“Delivery has more cost and exit is not so easy. And everybody needs to give delivery. That’s why the futures market came into existence earlier. The main impact will be that there will now be more volume and less volatility,” he said.

68,2019-09-26,Asian Paints,"The revival of the government plan to disinvest in Hindustan Zinc saw the stock surge. Its majority shareholder, Vedanta, also ended with massive gains. Banking and auto stocks were in focus, as traders adjusted their F&O positions on the expiry of September derivative contracts. 

Automaker M&M rose on news of Ford transferring its India assets to a JV with the company. Gains in the stock helped Nifty Auto index end with substantial gains. 

Positive news about the US-China trade war, softer crude prices and a strong rupee helped sentiments on Dalal Street, as Sensex ended 396 points higher to 38,989. NSE barometer Nifty climbed 133 points to 11,573. The broader market ended the day with gains, as Nifty Midcap index rose 0.86 per cent and Nifty Smallcap index 0.62 per cent.

“Wednesday’s global selloff was based on US political drama, which reversed on Thursday. While the Indian market recovered from profit taking after sharp gains, the momentum was broadbased with auto, bank and metal stocks leading the gains on expectation of better demand during the festive season,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.


Here is a lowdown on the key movers and shakers of Thursday’s session:

Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta surgeShares of Hindustan Zinc climbed 5.6 per cent to Rs 213.15 after reports that the government has revived the plan to private Hindustan Zinc. ETNow reported the government was planning the residual stake sale in the company and seeking legal opinion on the same. Vedanta, which holds majority stake in Hindustan Zinc, also jumped 6.5 per cent to Rs 166.15 on BSE and was the biggest Sensex gainer. India’s largest aluminium maker is also planning to set up an aluminium flat rolled products plant with an estimated capital expenditure of Rs 2,500 crore.


YES Bank cracks 5%Private lender YES Bank fell nearly 5 per cent to Rs 51.05 on BSE even after a statement from the lender that it was awaiting approval from the Reserve Bank of India to raise capital. In a release on Wednesday, the bank said, it “has applied to RBI for approval to increase the bank's authorised share capital. Subsequent to this, the bank will seek shareholder approval.” The bank plans to raise Rs 800 crore through the process. The stock was the biggest index loser in Sensex and Nifty. 


M&M jumps on Ford JV newsShares Mahindra & Mahindra jumped 6 per cent on BSE to Rs 567 after reports that the company would receive most of Ford’s assets in India after the formation of a joint venture. The venture, likely to be announced as early as next week, does not include Ford’s global business services division or an export-focused engine plant in Sanand. Bank, auto stocks in focus

Banking stocks were in great demand. ICICI Bank climbed 4 per cent, IndusInd and Federal Bank each jumped over 2 per cent. Nifty Bank index creeped up 1.5 per cent. Auto stocks saw interest from traders as Nifty Auto index jumped 2.5 per cent. The gains were led by M&M, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland.

1,2019-10-01,Asian Paints,"Talking to ETNOW, Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group, says if the government finally goes for privatisation of PSUs, that will be a very big re-evaluating factor for global investors. Excerpts:

After the corporate taxes and all the euphoria faded down and most market men believe that the government will have to do a little bit more. That little bit more has come. Strategic divestment of five PSUs is on the cards. Do you see the euphoria returning to markets?The euphoria has been back in the market since the tax cuts were announced. Still there was a one-time revaluation to gains. That will always be followed by some volatility and some correction has to be there, because that gives opportunity for fresh money to come in. 

Otherwise, the base for the next level of rise would not get made up. It is now getting supported by further news flow, of which divestment is one and unfortunately I have been of very high disbeliever in the government being able to do or willing to do or being able to do the strategic part of it. I would like to call it privatisation, if it does. It is not exactly divestment. It has been doing divestment for so many years. All the governments have been doing it. But selling one PSU to the other PSU is not privatisation.

For me, there has always been a tussle between the heart and the head and the government should go in for privatisation. But going by past experiences and by the constraints of the government, going by the fact that for them money is needed more in terms of timing early need, instead of quantity which also they need, it has pushed them to go in for divestment, selling one company to the other within the PSU place. 

If this privatisation goes through -- I am a great disbeliever how far this will go -- because some of the companies are too intricately involved in the economy like say BPCL. The policies which drive the business of this company are too much linked to the government. A private player buying a majority or a management control into it, will need to be assured of how much freedom he will have to run the company. 

Additionally, how much support will he continue to get from the government because running these kind of businesses which have been based on the government support of policies will be difficult. But if the government takes this bite of privatisation vis-à-vis divestment, that will be a very big re-evaluating factor for the market for global investors.


Will you buy PSUs? Why are you sounding bullish and not buying PSUs?No, I clearly said that I am a great disbeliever. For me it has always been a tussle between the heart and the head and another reason is that I have enough risk reward adjusted opportunities in the market.


It is not that Indian corporates have done something extraordinary. Keeping aside a few good companies, there are problems of execution, integrity and business and then there is a demand issue as well. In PSUs at least, there is no accounting problem and they would be disproportionate beneficiary of tax cuts. Also they are available cheap. Should one shy away from buying PSU stocks just because they have a prefix public associated with it?Before looking at the financials, for me and I am sure for you as well, the investment process starts by understanding the business ownership/management in Indian context. Mostly it is taken together. That is where the challenge used to be till date. The possibility of being able to find the government’s future plans on a sustainable basis for a medium to long term, always used to be challenging. 

They will change overnight or maybe if not overnight, they will keep changing based on the government political composition changing and even if not the minister changing and within that also, based on the government’s needs keep changing. That is where it becomes difficult to be able to take a longer term view or leave aside longer term, even medium term view on the policies that the company will keep following. 

I am happy to have lower returns. If I want higher risk, higher return, maybe this is what will play. Even now, if privatisation happens, then yes, BPCL, Container Corporation has the best financials, not Air India though. 

If I am willing to play that high-risk-high-return game, then yes. But if I want to be okay with lower-risk-lower-return, then I do have other opportunities? Last almost two and a half years have been very challenging for the Indian economy -- macro as well as micro.


There are a lot of money managers who are hiding in Asian Paints or Trent or some of these high PE stocks. These are good companies but is not that high-risk investing that you are buying high PE multiple stocks which look fashionable right now but in the long term there is a risk of time-wise correction and price-wise correction? Buying stocks at PE multiples of 70-80-90 that is also high risk in my book.Point conceded. Indeed, that also is high risk, there is no doubt. It is a question of which risk one chooses and that is what makes the market. Unless there will be different opinions, there would not be buyers and sellers.


Where else do you find that buying opportunity, if not PSUs?If I go by risk-adjusted reasonably optimum return, not very high return and not certainly very low return, on a broader sectoral basis, I still find opportunities in consumer stocks. The valuation of good quality managements is also becoming more and more premium because on a daily basis, we find a whole set of companies or business houses, going completely off the radar for medium-term investors. That is because of the various governance issues that are happening. 

Once that is happening, those investment opportunities are getting off the table. What is being left on the table is that the number is shrinking and that is where we are seeing the valuation because of the limited supply for the demand of money that is there. Let us keep in mind that post tax cuts, FII investors have still not come to India. So let us imagine a scenario wherein they decide that okay let us come back to India and the whole question of premium valuation will probably get left aside. So, we like consumers despite valuations being not as comfortable -- both durables and non-durables.

I still see opportunities in BFSI, leaving aside the public sector banking space. Two very secular themes which are right now playing out in the market are insurance and internet based stocks. 


There is only one stock -- InfoEdge?While the number of stocks available is lower, look at the valuation, price movement of the two recent IPOs -- IndiaMART InterMESH and Affle. It is not an investment recommendation. Maybe we will come to that separately, but just for the sake of discussion, look at the way their share prices have moved, look at the valuation they are trading at. 

First of all, when the IPO came, the valuation was not looking comfortable as was the case in the insurance space. Only time will tell if it will pan out longer. Going back to the late 1990s and early 2000, the way the IT sector was continuously being revalued, the way the infrastructure capital goods were being revalued in 2005-06-07, probably something thematic like that is playing out. 


Would you lay your bets in the metal stocks? Long term trends for metal stocks tend to bottom out between 0.6 and 0.7 times the book value. They are not there yet but they are nearing it and you have to buy bad news in metals, They are at the bottom of the cycle.You are right. The good news and the good prices do not come together in general for the market and stocks more so for commodities and metals. Metals are always a good trading bet now since traders could be short term in terms of intraday to a few days or weeks, or could even extend it to six months to a year.

But metal stocks have never been and possibly can never be really medium or long term buy and hold kind of stocks. At the current price to book ratios, they are reasonably close to the bottom and anybody wanting to take a trading bet of a few months to a year, can consider the space.


Why don’t you like PSU stocks?If you extend the chart over multiple time periods, you will find instances of significant underperformance of public sector companies. That is the answer. But there are a lot of trading people in the market who are indeed needed to provide liquidity for such stocks.


In case of State Bank of India, banking is 80% of its business. But they are taking the subsidiaries public, SBI Life had a brilliant listing. ICICI Bank is valued for all its subsidiaries. When will we start acknowledging that SBI subsidiaries are also good and are market leaders in every category? And they always have been market leaders, let us not forget this also. That is something that has been completely being ignored by the market. Probably the other factors keep dominating. One is the inconsistency of the policies of the owners of such business, particularly public sector business which is the government. 

Two, is the lot of directed business which probably used to happen but does not happen now. This is politically directed, industry directed kind of businesses that they have to do. 

Three is, as a result the pressure on the margins that comes to them even financially, we will clearly find the difference between the net interest margins, the return on assets or public sector banks and private sector banks.

SBI used to be around Rs 340-360 hardly two days ago and now it is at Rs 270! There is a big market for traders and they need these kind of stocks. They are the brave hearts and they know the risk that they are trading with."

Company Financials
 For the quarter ended 30-06-2019, the company has reported consolidated sales of Rs 5130.63 crore, up 2.24% from last quarter sales of Rs 5018.21 crore and up 16.86% from last year same quarter sales of Rs 4390.27 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 659.90 crore in the latest quarter.

Investment Rationale

The firm has raised FY20-FY22 EPS estimates by 9-11% to incorporate benefits from the sharp reduction in corporate taxes. Asian Paints remains one of Morgan Stanley's favorite long-term plays on discretionary consumption growth. Morgan Stanley said it is reluctant to push multiples beyond current levels."
4,2019-10-03,Asian Paints,"Crude is now range-bound and can trend lower. That will augur very well for Asian Paints. Plus, which is in the right market, growing 15-20% year on year., says Gautam Shroff, Co-Head, Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

FIIs had two problems – one, taxes were high and two, the government was not really responding to the economic slowdown. Government has responded to the economic slowdown. Taxes have been rolled back and disinvestment is moving in the right manner. Yet, FIIs have been selling to the tune of Rs 1,000-1,200 crore. What is going on?India is going through that crisis of confidence still and although we saw positive FII net figures for a day, there has been no follow up buying. But there is no specific reason for that. I think they are just taking some money off the table and it is going in other markets. Even the ETF flows have been negative for almost five weeks in a row. What I want to believe is it could be a very good day tomorrow where they get some indication that the financial system is stable and some words of solace comes from the Reserve Bank of India. 

Once that comes through, there can be a U–turn in flows. For the whole year, we have seen negative flows and it is only a matter of time before the year ends and we see a U-turn.


Are they selling because they are worried about Yes Bank, Indiabulls, PMC -- the financial sector or is this something which only hindsight will tell us?No, of course, these are the problems which has been the trigger but very clearly it is demand that everybody is looking for. What foreigners are very closely watching is where will the credit offtake come from? Today, banking credit is approximately 9% to 10% and the only thing they are watching is how the credit offtakes from here, given the gloom and doom mood on the Street.


What happens to cases like YES Bank? Even though all the pledged shares of Rana Kapoor have been sold by mutual funds, at this kind of stock price level, where their market cap is now sub 10,000 crore rupee mark as well, we have all kinds of damage that has happened in YES Bank in just a year and a half. How will they raise capital?Yes I agree that it is a sub 10,000-crore market cap now and today can be an interesting day which will decide the fate of Yes Bank, given that the company has come out in the open and said that all the pledges have been extinguished. There is no more pledge. The supply has come to an end


Will you tell your clients to buy Yes Bank today?Honestly no, I would want to stick to quality and largecaps…


Honestly that is exactly the answer we were looking for.We will still want to be with an HDFC Bank. If I want to play safe, I will buy HDFC Bank. If I want to play re-rating, I will play ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. If at all I want a risk-on trade, I will go to an IndusInd Bank. These are the three-four names that I would stick to in the banking space.


Buyers are not there. Somebody has to say that look that I am buying Yes Bank at the price of a PSU bank but their confidence is not there, because you do not know what is next?Yes I want to believe that it can be more of a retail or a punt. You can see a very big trading bounce in Yes Bank but I would not go and invest money or hold it long term.


I want to use the word re-rating because safety is something which is very well documented. HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance are the safe stocks. Re-rating is where you should look at and IndusInd Bank is one such idea. Apart from IndusInd Bank, across the market, where do you see scope for re-rating?ICICI Bank can be a re-rating candidate for the simple reason that it is at one 1, 1.5 times book, while as an IndusInd Bank is still more than 2 times book. All the NPA credit cycle is behind us, all the pain that Axis Bank and ICICI Bank had to see. They went nowhere for about three years and they are just coming back. 

We have a lot of confidence in what will take the wealth creation forward. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank is something that we are very confident about and that will create wealth going forward.


We saw that synchronised slowdown play out within the auto space. Now that auto sales have kicked and are showing some amount of silver lining. Could you break it down for us? In autos, we will still stick to two-wheelers. There is a big scope for two- wheelers to come back in a big way, given the upcoming festive season now. In the four-wheeler space, I would want to stick only to Maruti because the management has come out in the open and given some confidence that we are seeing demand returning.


 The month on month numbers also improving.Exactly. Maruti is one largecap that I am slightly comfortable buying. Otherwise, I would stick to the two-wheeler space. So, Eicher, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto.


SBI is down by over Rs 100. Share price has come down from Rs 360-370 to Rs 250-260. Nothing has happened which could be considered negative for SBI. Why is SBI getting a step-motherly treatment?A lot is in the price at any given point in time. After the top private banks that I named, I would take a broader call. Take a two-three year view from today. If the Indian economy has to go to the $5 trillion mark, it is not possible without an SBI. Every lane, every corner, if somebody has a branch it is State Bank of India. You cannot reach a $5-trillion mark without SBI’s participation. So, it is a buy. A lot is already in the price.


But we have reached from $1 trillion to $2 trillion not with SBI alone. We have reached to $1 trillion to $2 trillion without the support of SBI. Their loan book has not grown, somebody else has got the market share. It could well be that SBI’s market share could come down to 18% or sub 20% from 23-22%. Others may just gain market share. PSU banks’ share has come down from 85% to 60%.SBI was probably busy consolidating those five banks that were merged with it. It should take a U-turn and things should look up from here. A lot is in the price.


We have seen steady growth for select names in life insurance space like HDFC Life. But within the entire basket, are you seeing any comfort?
Insurance is the latest sector sought after by foreigners and by many investors. There is hardly any credit risk and we are also seeing a similar trend in the general insurance space. ICICI Lombard is our top pick. If somebody can grow for the next five-10 years consistently at 20% having such high ROEs, it is ICICI Lombard. I want to agree with you that insurance is the new space that is attracting capital in India.


But if car sales slowdown will that not impact a very basic business like ICICI Lombard because they still get a large part of their business from cars and autos?Their fortune is not really linked to the new auto sales because there was a change in regulation where you had to go and buy the policy for three years or five years at one go and this cash has to be paid up front. It was not really linked to the new auto sales. We have been seeing that go down for almost 10 months in a row now with the first kind of signs and green shoots that happened this month and with the upcoming festive season, the inventory that the auto companies have will be over in about 6-8 months’ time. They have all become very cognisant of their fresh production. They are keeping their factories shut for a day or two producing less and I want to believe that their predictive analysis will improve and going forward we will see that uptick coming.


While regulatory clarity would be a key for further divestment, that is something that the government is really looking at very closely. What are are seeing within the oil and gas space? Do you think that the fundamentals here are looking fairly attractive?India has the largest refining capacity and the Indian refiners are doing really well given their profitability. We really like Indian Oil, BPCL. BPCL has a lot of steam left and especially since it is on the government’s agenda of divestment, we could see a lot of action happening in BPCL. 

Over and above, there is a lot of comfort in BPCL, given that it has a very large land bank, their Mumbai refinery; at least 20 or 30% of the pumps. The comfort in the stock price comes from the margin of safety comes from the land bank and the business is doing very well.


That can be said about most PSUs.Yes.


Lot of fund managers are buying Bharti. Do you see merit in it?There is a lot of merit in buying telecom names and Bharti is one of our top picks. The whole industry is looking forward to the pricing power and the tariffs are going higher. The biggest beneficiary of the whole lot is going to be Bharti Airtel and that merits a lot of attention and investments from here on.


Why did Voda Idea collapse?One of course is about the quality and second is the allocation of capital that they need to get right. 


What you are telling your clients to buy in the consumption space?Nestle, Hindustan Unilever followed by Dabur and Marico is something that we are comfortable about and we want to believe that as the government spending is now coming back, these names will see the uptick in volumes, along with a darling stock of ours -- Asian Paints. We expect it will do very, very well.


You would not buy it afresh at these levels or would you recommend that to any retail participant because paints as a segment is one that has not quite fallen?I want to believe that their biggest raw material crude is now range-bound and it can trend lower. That will augur very well for Asian Paints. Plus, Asian Paints is in the right market, growing 15-20% year on year. It is in the decorative segment and does not have much exposure to autos.

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 5.50 points higher this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• IIFL has a buy rating on 
Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 1,850. The brokerage expects Asian Paints' Ebitda CAGR over FY19-FY22 aided by its moats, GST reductionled market share gains, benign input costs and moderating competitive intensity. This along with reducing capex intensity and recent reduction in corporate taxes should move the RoIC closer to the 45 per cent levels seen in FY15, said IIFL. Shares of Asian Paints ended up 0.3 per cent at Rs 1778.45 on Thursday.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained a neutral rating on 
Jubilant FoodWorks with a target price of Rs 1,400. The company’s medium term samestore-sales (SSS) growth prospects might fortify further if it passes on the benefit of the tax cut because not only will it gain on an absolute basis but also score significantly over Westlife Development, Yum Brands and Burger King, said Motilal Oswal. Shares of Jubilant FoodWorks ended up 1 per cent at Rs 1,322 on Thursday.


• Reliance Securities has downgraded 
Torrent Pharmaceuticals to hold from buy with a target price of Rs 1,740 after the US FDA issued a warning letter to the company's Indrad API and formulations facility. This warning letter is based on the Corrective & Preventive Action (CAPA) submitted by TRP to the observations raised by US FDA, said Reliance Securities. The brokerage expects new product approvals will be impacted in future. Shares of Torrent Pharmaceuticals ended up 1.4 per cent at Rs 1,690.10 on Thursday.

• Antique Stock Broking has maintained a buy rating on 
Raymond with a target price of Rs 1,240 after an associate company of Raymond sold a property in Thane. Increased focus on improving operational efficiency, building strong franchise-based distribution network, and enhancing product portfolio are likely to drive growth ahead for Raymond. Asset monetization will aid cash flows and could lead to reduction in debt levels. Shares of Raymond ended down 3 per cent at Rs 583.80 on Thursday.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has a reduce rating on 
National Aluminium Co and cut fair value to Rs 35 from Rs 38 due to expensive valuation. The brokerage met NALCO's management and learned that the capex towards 1 mtpa alumina refinery expansion and Utkal coal block should start from FY21. Inflated refinery capex implies only a 5-6 per cent RoCE and four years of completion suggest back-ended returns. Declining cash surplus makes high dividend yield unsustainable. Shares of National Aluminium ended down 6.6 per cent at Rs 41.95 on Thursday."

15,2019-10-11,Asian Paints,"All through September, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company went around shopping FMCG, PSU, financials, insurance, power and pharma stocks as the broader market witnessed big ups and downs following a major corporate tax cut.

BSE benchmark Sensex ended the month 4 per cent higher.

India’s second biggest fund house by asset under management bought over 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and PSU hydropower producer NHPC. Shares of these companies are down over 10 per cent each on a year-to-date (YTD) basis till October 9.

The money manager also bought more than 20 lakh shares each of Axis Bank, Equitas Holdings, Cipla, ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, GAIL (India), NTPC, BHEL, Power Grid and Kalpataru Power Transmission.

Barring ICICI Bank (up 20 per cent YTD), Kalpataru Power Transmission (up 16 per cent YTD) and Axis Bank (up 9 per cent YTD), other stocks are down 41 per cent YTD.

Financial stocks are drawing interest again following the recent debt and credit crisis in the market.

 “We are positive on select private banks and insurance counters, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Lombard,” said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Power stocks, which have taken a huge beating for several months, too are buzzing again.

“Traction in power demand could be a tad softer in the ensuing quarters. We look ahead to the new Electricity Act, which is expected to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament. We maintain our preference for NTPC, CESC and Tata Power,” Edelweiss Securities said.



ICICI Prudential also bought additional shares of IT majors HCL Technologies (18 lakh), Wipro (5.88 lakh) and Tata Consultancy Services (4.64 lakh).

Country’s largest IT services firm TCS on Thursday reported a 1.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 8,042 crore for September quarter, which was below Street expectations.

Haitong Securities has cut the target price for TCS to Rs 1,925 (Rs 2,170 earlier) post Q2 numbers. “We were surprised by the quantum of the miss on both revenue and operating profit margin in Q2,” the brokerage said.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added Bank of Baroda (16 lakh shares), Punjab National Bank (15.43 lakh shares), LIC Housing Finance (11.50 lakh shares), YES Bank (7.80 lakh shares), Kotak Mahindra Bank (5.28 lakh shares) and HDFC Bank (4.01 lakh shares) in the financial space.

On the other hand, it added Bharti Airtel (11 lakh shares) and Vodafone Idea (4.77 lakh shares) from the telecom space. Telecom stocks got a lift on Wednesday after Reliance Jio announced plans to levy a call connect charge on customers, easing the price pressure on its rivals.

Swiss brokerage UBS said Jio’s move is “a positive development for the sector, with a potential revenue and Ebitda upside of 10-12 per cent and 35-40 per cent,” since it will result in a higher outgo from the customer.

“If all operators start charging 6 paise per minute for all outgoing calls, the annual sector revenue and Ebitda can increase by Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 13,000 crore, respectively, although these numbers would trend downwards with gradually balancing (voice) traffic patterns,” UBS said.

The positive impact on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), it said, could be 13-15 per cent for Airtel, 55-60 per cent for Vodafone idea, and 32-36 per cent for Jio.

The fund house has also raised bets on the insurers, including SBI Life Insurance, General Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI Lombard General Insurance. These stocks have continued to outperform the broader indices amid the NBFC crisis this year.

Emkay Global Financial Services is overweight on ICICI Prudential (IPRU) and SBI Life Insurance (SBIL). “The volatility in equity markets and higher surrenders are the key downside risks for IPRU. For SBIL, the reduction in promoter stake to meet the minimum public shareholding (MPS) guidelines (needs 2.1 per cent stake sale by September 2020) is a key concern,” it added.

In the auto and auto ancillary sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 9.77 lakh shares of Ashok Leyland, followed by Motherson Sumi (6.19 lakh shares), Minda Industries ( 5.49 lakh shares) and Maruti Suzuki (1.34 lakh shares).

The fund house also checked into Balrampur Chini Mills, Dalmia Bharat, Polycab India, Rail Vikas Nigam and Wheels India. On the other hand, it completely exited Asahi India, Hatsun Agro, Jet Airways, Monsanto, Shalby, Tata Communications and Techno Electric.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 431 companies, and sold in 89 across sectors. It held 550 stocks as of September 30.

Tata Power, SAIL, Larsen & Toubro, SJVN, Hexaware Tech, ONGC, Spice Jet, JSW Energy, Container Corporation, Infosys, Asian Paints, CESC, Avenue Supermarts, MCX, Coal India, Engineers India and Gujarat State Petronet were among the top stocks the fund house offloaded during the month."

18,2019-10-14,Asian Paints,"As the US Fed moves towards quantitative easing, end 2019 and 2020 will prove to be a very interesting year for the under-owned segments and emerging market equities. In the Indian context, it will be the small and midcaps, says Anshul Saigal, Chief Investment Officer, Kotak Portfolio Management Service. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


If I look at the market from the Nifty prism, it does not smell like a bear market but the minute I turn my attention to small and midcap stocks, it reminds me of 2013 and 2008.You are right. I will explain this phenomenon in some detail. The equity markets are akin to a reservoir of water or a dam. It rains and the reservoir gets filled with water and it creates energy. You open the gates, the reservoir loses water and the water flows out. 

In the context of equity markets, the reservoir is the equities, the rain is liquidity. As liquidity comes into the reservoir or equities, equity prices move up. As liquidity is drained out, equity prices come down. While in the Indian ethos, rain is brought by Lord Indra, in the context of the equity markets, rain or liquidity is brought by the US Fed. So, if the US Fed turns off the tap, you see equity prices going down.

If we go into recent history, you will see that between 2009 and 2014, they expanded their balance sheet from $1 trillion to $4 trillion and kept buying equities and risk assets. Between 2014 and 2017, they kept the balance sheet flat at $4 trillion. In 2018, there were as many as four interest rate hikes and a reduction in balance sheet by $800 billion. So, the gates of equity markets from the reserve currency were opened and as a result, you saw Indian equity markets and in particularly, the small and midcap space as also the emerging markets correcting meaningfully. 

Now fast forward to September of 2019. In the last three weeks of September, we saw as much as $180 billion of liquidity being pumped in by the US treasuries. So, $800 billion were taken out in 2018, $180 billion brought in three weeks of September of 2019. If this liquidity tap is being opened by the US Fed, and from quantitative tightening we are moving towards quantitative easing, then 2019 end as also 2020 the whole year will prove to be a very different year and a very interesting year, particularly for the under-owned segments and emerging market equities. In the Indian context, it will be the small and midcaps, you go around the world and you will see that small and midcaps have been hammered out of shape. In our judgement, that segment should do well, as also cyclicals.


What is the best way to understand the NBFC space? Right now, the bear market survivors are HDFC, Bajaj Finance, even Chola or Sundaram Finance. When the bull market comes back, could these stocks be way higher than where they are? There will be a market share shift in the NBFC space. You will see quality, well capitalised NBFCs gaining market share. The other trend that you will see will be from the asset side of the balance sheet. NBFCs which have chunky loans will probably in the future lose market share and those that have granular loans will gain market shares. 

Essentially, granular asset side and sufficient capital on the balance sheet will benefit NBFCs going ahead. Whichever NBFCs have these characteristics, will gain share. The other aspect to this NBFC crisis is that whoever attracts equity capital at this time or is able to raise equity will again remain strong and will come out stronger on the other side of valuations. 

Whoever cannot attract capital will again remain a fringe player going ahead. This industry is going to see a lot of consolidation. The froth that we have seen in this industry over the last two-three years is now behind us. We do not anticipate that this froth to return in the coming future. Of course, there will be another cycle which will be 5-10-15 years ahead where a similar sort of situation will arise but not in the near future. Whoever comes out of this well, will do quite well going ahead because they will gain market share.


We have got a whole host of beaten out names that are seeing some momentum today. If we are to pick up certain stocks that could offer value at the current levels, any particular names that you would like to share with us?I would refrain from taking names but I would just say that in this market, you are seeing a lot of good growth companies with strong balance sheets which have seen growth in the last three to four years, as also in the last year, having corrected 50-60-70%. 

Our psychology will tell us to not invest in a company which has corrected 50-60% but this is precisely the time to go in and invest in such companies if their balance sheets are strong and their businesses remain solid because these companies will see an expansion in valuations going ahead. I see a whole host of them in the small and midcap space today. I also see a lot of cyclicals and PSU names which are at attractive valuations today. Those are the spaces that one should look. It is not too difficult to run screeners and come to names where balance sheets are good, valuations are reasonable, prices have corrected and businesses are strong and have grown in the last one to two years. 

Run those screeners and look for companies in the small and midcap category. It is hard from these prices to go wrong over a three to five-year period.


I was told that it is hard to make money in Nestle or a D-Mart because they are so terribly expensive but in the last two years what I have seen is more concentration by money managers, more PE expansion and decent earnings growth. What lies ahead for a Bajaj Finance or a D-Mart or for that matter Trent, or Asian Paints?You and I have been in the markets long enough to have seen the period of 2000 to 2009. If you bought an Infosys in the year 2001, it compounded its earnings for the ensuing eight years at about 35% to 37% year-on-year earnings growth. What did the stock do? Zero. It made you no money over a nine-year period. A quality company, with 35-37% earnings growth made no money over a nine-year period. It was the same thing with HUL in the same period. 

Valuations matter. At times like these, when there is polarisation in certain segments of the markets and those segments continue to do well, people forget that valuations matter but it is a heavy price to pay in the long term to buy at such valuations. 

Of course, within the set that you mentioned there will be some companies which will continue to do well despite expensive valuations, but at the margin, at a time like this the risk reward is highly favourable for cheaper names which have been hammered out of shape. Who is to say that for the next three months, there would not be volatility? There can be volatility but if you have a 3-5-year time horizon, there is a ton of money to be made in that segment and the risk reward is favourable. 

I would lay my bets against the over-owned large quality businesses which have seen polarisation and I will be in favour of those names which are under owned and having been impacted, the valuations have become favourable and their business models remain as strong as they were, till about a year ago."

25,2019-10-21,Asian Paints,"Dalal Street veteran Bharat Shah, Executive Director, ASK Group believes value buying is an exercise a stock investor needs to do all the time. He said wealth creation through multibaggers is not only about spotting the right stock, but also about having the wisdom and patience to hold on to it for a long period of time. Quality of management is the first principle of investing, and one should never lose sight of it, he told Ami Shah of ETMarkets.com in an interview. Edited excerpts:


How do you view the current situation in the market? Is it a good time to go value buying? How does one navigate this market?

Value buying is a perennial, forever exercise. No matter what the state of the market, you want to buy quality businesses at prices that are presenting value; in other words, at a discount to its intrinsic worth. That is what value buying is. Therefore, there is nothing specific about this time or that time. In the current market, there has been a dramatic restructuring and dramatic reforms have been unleashed. Just to name a few, GST has been cleansing the behaviour of businesses, demonetisaiton has been an effort to clean up behavior of individuals. RERA is aiming to clean up the biggest and probably one of the murkiest sectors of the country, which is real estate. It has been painful, but very necessary, exercise of cleaning up of the rubbish on bank balance sheets, which is altering both the lending and borrowing culture. For the first time, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act has put the fear of God into the minds of big industrialists and the promoters, who otherwise would not have surrendered the assets that they have clutched on to irrespective of whatever was the record in terms of doing what they had done with those assets.

These are very powerful structural changes. They have all combined together right now to change the character of the businesses. These changes are permanent in nature. To that extent, it is interesting to see the process of creative destruction, which is at work. Bad businesses and bad managements are being damaged. On the other hand, quality businesses and quality managements are flowering like never before. Bad capital and bad growth are getting retarded, and good quality growth, good capital and good businesses are thriving. This change is materially important, here to stay. To that extent, all investing has to reflect that reality.


Apart from the measures announced by the government, what else would you like the government to come out with to ensure that the economy gets back on track quickly?

As far as businesses are concerned and as far as economic activity is concerned, it is really the private side which has the responsibility. The role of the government is to provide necessary enabling laws, which in my opinion the government has been doing very effectively. Of course, there are some areas where reforms are still pending, such as land acquisition and labour reforms – there has to be some flexibility in terms of the ease with which one can hire and relieve labour. An important thing is to achieve parity in taxation on the agriculture side, which has been exempt. Agricultural income above a certain level, I think, must be taxed judiciously. Beyond that, I do not think there are too many things the government really needs to do. There have been clamours from certain sectors. For example – auto and some other sectors will demand this concession of GST or that concession, and I think the government has rightly not done any of those. The deep tax cut that has happened on the corporate side is a very powerful change. It is a permanent import, and not a one-timer. This is a more durable and it is a far more fundamental and fair change, because it can help everybody judiciously the same manner. These kinds of reforms are important. On the personal income-tax front, I would hope at some stage there will be some matching deduction. And yes, I would say a significant part of the public sector really needs to be privatised.

So, privatisation, reform on the personal income-tax, agriculture tax, labour and land reforms – these to my mind are among the significant remaining blocks. The government has done most of the other things, I would say.


You have seen many market cycles over the decades. Which sector have been the best value creators for you?

Identifying a performing sector is a very temporary activity. Investing is not about finding a sector. It is not about finding a fashion or a trend or a theme. It is not about judging an index or making some index predictions. Investing is a bottom-up art. It is about picking and choosing quality businesses run by quality and dependable managements. You can look for businesses that are sitting atop a large chunk of opportunity where the fundamental capability to grow is visible. Growth is vital, because without growth, equity becomes like a bank fixed deposit and after a while a negative bond. The task is to buy into that superior value-creating machine with some margin of safety, so that the underlying growth becomes annuity returns and the margin of safety is a one-time extra icing on the cake. That bottom-up stock selection and discipline is the approach. In addition, it requires wisdom to sit on a few good things that you have found, and not part with them in a whimsical or temperamental way for the temporary change or oddities in market behaviour. Not surrendering is vital.


Can you name some of the multibagger stocks that have delivered for you over the past decades – stocks where you really had the conviction?

Well, multibaggers happen. Many times, we think we are approaching a stock with a multibagger mindset in advance. I would say that is arrogance. You probably may figure out that a business represents enough virtues for it to be bought. Most importantly in a multibagger, it really happens when you buy a virtuous bundle of attributes or a package and you have the sagacity and wisdom to sit on it for a long period. It is the ability to sit on it for long enough duration, which actually has the greatest contribution to make it multibagger.

Whether it is Bajaj Finance or Bajaj Finserv or an Asian Paints or a Berger or a Pidilite or HDFC Bank or a Gruh Finance or a PI Industries, multibaggers happen when you identify the attributes. You can see that they are reasonably attractive as a combo and then you have the patience and wisdom to sit on them longer. Trying to predict multibaggers and buying them with that mindset is most likely to disappoint you and deliver inferior results. When Infosys was floated in 1990s and I had a good sense to buy it. It went up by a three-digit number, but did I really judge and did I know when I bought it that it is going to be some 150-times from the price that I bought? No. That will be utter arrogance to say, or it will be self-praise to say that one could judge everything in advance. All that one could judge was that here is a good management, people whom you can depend upon, right kind of professional behaviour and governance, that the business is a large-size opportunity, global in character and there were great attributes to the business which are amenable to value creation . On a conventional measurement also, the business was available at a reasonable price. Thereafter, it is just the patience of sitting on it in the market process, which made it multibagger. Think of something like Asian Paints. See if you had put Re 1 in Asian Paints 30 years ago, it is worth about Rs 850 today. In these 30 years, Asian Paints has not asked for a single rupee from you, no rights, no placement, no QIP, nothing. That is the beauty in a great high-quality business and the management that has sat on it for long period of time.


Over the past couple of years, we have seen a lot of first-time investors coming into the market. But these young investors are in hurry to make money? What do these young investors tell you?

I have not found anything of this kind. In fact, I have seen a growing maturity among our clients over time. The kind of questions they ask, the kind of periods for which they want to remain committed, their ability to ward off difficult phases in the market without losing patience is something which I growingly observe and appreciate. In my 31 years of investing career, if I think about the kind of questions and the kind of behavioural pattern of investors 20 years back, 25 years back or even 15 years back and today, there is a world of difference and there is far greater maturity, sensible behaviour and commitment to longer term and ability to discriminate that investing is not a ‘get rich quickly’ scheme. It is a journey over a period of time and that journey has to be done with patience and wisdom.


What is one lesson in value investing that you would like to pass on to the budding investors, particularly the millennials?

I think quality of management is the first principle of investing. One should never lose sight of it. A bad management can end up damaging even a good business in so many ways that you cannot imagine. Even if they do not end up damaging the business, they can certainly end up damaging an investment in a very bad way. Equally, bad businesses fundamentally just cannot create value. Finally, I would say errors of omission do not hurt you really, but it is errors of commission which can seriously set you back. When you miss something worthwhile and valuable, sure you lose an opportunity to make return from that good and healthy thing, but even if you have missed out something terrific you probably will get something else if you are on the right process and mindset, maybe less rewarding, but that is alright. 

But errors of commission can really set you back. Errors of commission occur when you make those fundamental transgressions or errors either in judging the quality of a business or in judging the quality of management or you try to profit out of rubbish, hoping that somehow either you are too smart to get affected by it or you are too lucky that you will get away with it, Neither of this is a sustainable one."

27,2019-10-22,Asian Paints,"Abhishek Ganguly, MD, PUMA India, believes that suits should make you feel confident and happy.

First suit
“I got my first suit in my first year of my MBA at IIM, Lucknow. It was placement season for our summer internship and there I was, armed with a new navy suit from a reputed tailor in Hazratgunj. The suit instilled a feeling of seriousness and anticipation as it heralded my expectation of the formal, corporate sector. My notion of the ‘corporate world’ evolved when I entered the sportswear business and so did my idea of a suit. It is no longer the formal stereotyped version I was initiated into.”


Style code
“My current go-to style is business casual. For me, the idea of a suit is anything but formal or predictable. It is how one pairs the blazer with the trouser, shirt, tie, shoes and accessories. The combination shouldn’t be banal, safe and obvious. It can be striking, contrasting or even plaid but, of course, not garish.”


Comfort first
“Choosing a suit is serious business in terms of the effort, time and money. But you must get the choice and styling right. For me, a suit is not a serious piece of clothing. It should make one feel comfortable, confident and happy. My favourite is a grey checked slim-fit suit.”


Abhishek Ganguly's current go-to style is business casual.

Suits & sneakers“Yes, but not with the regular fit, formal, black suit. A fitted blazer with contrast trousers, white shirt and a pair of sneakers is all you need for a sartorial look.”


Winning suit game
“Cristiano Ronaldo.”


When it comes to a suit…“You can never go wrong with a little experimentation.”


Most experimental suit
“A light pink suit with high water trousers.”


Most expensive suit
“A pinstriped wool suit from Burberry.”

30,2019-10-22,Asian Paints,"For us the big picture will always remain financials, consumer and IT and within that we will decide whether to broaden or not, says Samir Arora, Founder & Fund Manager, Helios Capital. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How would you characterise the environment, are we in for a long winter or is this the end of the trouble?It is a very good time. The Nifty is always supposed to be at peak because in theory the earnings and if the markets reflect in Nifty, it should always be at a peak. So ignore that for the moment. We should draw confidence from the fact that the government’s concerns about the market is at a peak or at least in high zone and that is where I put in my bets. 

Even if Infosys is down 10% and Nifty is merely flat to up, it shows that the market itself is also reflecting a little bit of confidence and we need that because for two years, the Indian market has done very badly and it is a broader market. We have a lot of room to go up.


Let us not talk about today, tomorrow, this week, next week. It is Diwali time and how do you view the market and the economy? Exactly a year from now, if we are interacting on the same forum, what kind of market and economy do you think we could be staring at?Obviously everybody knows that today the earnings are down and that our corporate earnings to GDP is low but that also is unsustainably low because anything which is outside of broad range, cannot be considered as the norm. 

For example, corporate earnings to GDP ratio is below 3%. It used to be 7% odd in 2007-08 when US was around 10%. So this 3% is a new for us. a), At some point, there will be a cyclical rebound, whether it is because of the fact that the government has granted a corporate tax cut or the economy has turned on its own or because the government seems to have given up so much on revenue front and there could be a bit of fiscal deficit. 

If you looked at what has happened in the last three months -- the cut in corporate tax rate in July, rollback of FPI rate hike, plans to strategically divest in BPCL and maybe in HPCL and also as Mr Modi said in New York, we are looking towards bringing down equity taxation to global benchmarks, the reaction of the market should have been better. It is just that because they started on a wrong tone and ever since has been trying to recover from that, the people are more upset. But if we just look at it as one big announcement on a big day, it would have led to a massive rally. 

The economy has many things going for it, whether it is lower interest rates or just the fact that there is a base effect, but we broadly know that those are cyclical phenomenon, maybe short cycle, maybe slightly longer but in the meantime, there are slightly longer term reform benefits from privatisation of BPCL and corporate tax cut and maybe under pressure some lower personal taxes and then maybe an LTCG or DDT going away, not because I wish for it which I do, but because the prime minister said it himself a few days ago.

He did not say literally but if he says that we have to bring taxes in line with global equity taxes, what does that mean? These are the only taxes which make us not in line with global standards.


We were just looking at last Diwali to this Diwali returns and it has been a 10% move for the Nifty. I am not even touching the broader markets. With all the presumptions that you were just making, what kind of index returns can we expect for the next year to come?Normally, I would think this should be more than 15-20% but last Diwali to now, the returns seem to be good because anybody who is a bit active had realised that from October, November, if you broadly had slightly fewer midcaps and financials, everybody should have done better than this 10%. 

But in the big picture, if you are on such a low base, whenever the rebound happens, it will be in the 20s in terms of earnings growth. This year, the government gifted lower corporate taxes, but to an equity investor, as long as the EPS increase is sustainable, it does not matter whether it came from lower taxation or higher activity. 

People always want higher activity because they think the higher activity is sustainable but we have to believe for the moment that the lower corporate taxes are not going to be reversed again. So, it is as sustainable and is actually simpler to get while we still wait for the top line to improve. But those things have a shorter life and that will happen sooner rather than later.


Last year, we saw major companies across sectors -- be it in real estate, NBFCs, banks or, FMCG collapse. On top of that, we got companies with balance sheet issues. When can we really see the earning cycle restart?It has happened already. For example, gold sector may be doing badly because of GST or demonetisation, but the companies that are left behind are growing in an environment whether the industry does not grow at all. Similarly, one day in real estate, we will see 80% of the developers are out of business because either they do not have black money or the customer does not believe that he can rely on them to buy an in-progress house. Plus 0% GST benefit versus 5% means that you will only buy a completed house. Whoever is left behind, will do well. The same thing is happening in financials. If earlier, there were 50 companies and every private equity and every bank employees who was fired wanted to start an NBFC. Now there will be less of those and the rest of the world will move on. 

So unless there are one or two disasters of the kind which bring down not only the company but also leads to a chain reaction, we are okay. We cannot be negative for so long because if I look at my own history, I have been doing this for like 25 years. We have rarely had three bad years in theory and I do not consider this year to be bad in any way. It is an okay year so far, but if you say broadly that we have had two bad years that is 2018 and 2019, I will tell you please rely on the power of the base effect, if nothing else.


Would you say some of the investors -- retail as well as institutional -- who bought into beaten down stocks like Yes Bank, Indiabulls, need to get out? There appears to be bad apples in every basket?It is absolute nonsense to believe that you will buy 10 companies and that is how you will make money because those 10 companies are the winners. It does not mean that when you started 10 years ago, you could have exactly honed on to those 10 companies. If you are buying many companies in which three go up and one goes to zero, you will make better returns than looking in a hindsight mirror. 

Who would have thought for Levers as a bad company in 1999 but till 2007, the market went up 21% per annum and Levers went up 2% per annum. Even today, can you say that Wipro is a bad company? But look at its returns from 1999 to 2007 and compare that to the index? Can anybody say Infosys was a bad company but today see what has happened? 

So, we rely on 20 companies because these 20 companies have done well in the past and this is me talking, who actually owns may be 12 of them and actually have been holding some of them for the longest possible time. But that does not mean that 100% of the portfolio can be built with these names. If life was so simple, Warren Buffet would not have underperformed for 15 years. The point is there is no formula, the formula is only of humbleness which is that there is no formula. 

Today there is a great interview by Bharat Shah in Economic Times saying
you do not start by buying multibaggers , you start by buying good companies and because you are able to hold on to them and because they sustain, they become multibaggers.


I have also understood that you can buy companies where you can predict the next three to five years of earnings. Who knows in 10-15 years, what will survive? So, where do you think there is earnings visibility of 15% to 18% and where valuations are reasonable? Where do you think CAGR returns for next three-five years could be double digit?Point is, we do not know exactly at which point the market broadens except that it is looking like that it can broaden relatively soon. If you have survived for two years without blowing up where your stock might be down 30-40%, but your earnings were down a little bit or did not grow up as much as expected. We also hold many of the stocks that have done well for everybody except that we just do not make our entire 100% of portfolio with those stocks, You always have to anticipate what may happen and today, I feel that the broadening of the market is near. I still will not go for 100% and even if it broadens I will not be 100% in midcaps names. But I think it will broaden. 

But from our point of view, the sectors that look good are the sectors that always look good except that we may not have had some stocks. For example, in the last one to one-and-a-half years, people suddenly started buying ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. Previously, for three-four years, they were not doing so. The big sectors do not have to change but within that, you buy newer companies or companies that may have done badly. 

For us the big picture will always remain financials, consumer and IT and within that we will decide whether to broaden or not. We have these $10-15-billion financial tech companies, companies that put logos on some hotels and they are about $10 billion and we have the newer private sector banks trading at say $1.5 billion. We recently saw when Indiabulls did not get a banking licence, its market cap fell by $3 billion or so. Even if we look at it from a Rs 700-Rs 800 price rather than some would have a Rs 1,300-1,400 price. That means the market valued Lakshmi Vilas Bank at effectively $3 billion. 

Now if you cannot connect that to other banks in India which are not going under, which are pure private sector and they are at 1.5-2 billion, then you can buy the same 20 companies again.


Would you say stocks like RBL or some of the newer private banks would be a buy?No comment on stocks.


What about some of these retail names that are trading at unheard of PEs, like D-Mart, Trent? They are super expensive and some have PEs of 100. Would you still be confident on their trajectory going forward? Would you look at getting into these stocks nonetheless?As I said, there are about 25 such names which could include Nestle, Asian Paints and many others. Out of those 20, may be we have 10-12 names. If I leave out HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank, which also fall in that category but where the numbers are, the growth path is easier to imagine. In other cases, we would have 40-50% in those names. So, it is a mix and match for us.

As far as I am concerned, every year or two, there are new funds that do well. If you are broadly up there for three-four years, you become top number there somewhere. You do not have to be literally in the strategy of that period. 

Right now, the strategy for this year and last year was go for highest quality, do not worry about valuations. I do not think that is a strategy forever. So, a rotation of funds happens. If we can be broadly up there for four years, we will be number one over four years. Therefore, for me the theory is very simple. It is called mix and match. You buy some of this, some of that. Some we are buying for future, some we are buying for present, some we are buying because they were good in the past and we believe they will be good but nobody knows anything about anything beyond a point, as today’s example of Infosys shows.


The song for this week was market badha ke rakhna hai in DDLJ style, tell me what is the Diwali week song then?I do not know about Diwali week, but this week I hope that the government does something. We have all timed up for that and if not literally this week, my bet of late has been that the government cannot end the game with just having a corporate tax cut. It must follow with other things because otherwise it makes no sense. The government has done something which is difficult philosophically and politically, Why not do other simpler things? So I hope they do those things. I hope the cabinet approves the BPCL divestment plan or whatever that they get something for Air India. But they must do all these things fast. If they see the market going up 5%, they should not relax just like we do not relax if the market goes up.


In the past, you have never liked PSU stocks. Are you relooking at them considering that the government is seriously looking at divestment this time?Budget is too far away. We need steps along the way, maybe this week. The budget is like months away. No, I do not buy PSU stocks because I still am old school. I do not even believe that so much is possible. Although that is a great thing that they have announced, but we do not have institutional capacity to do two deals simultaneously. We have not done that in our NCLT cases. 

Even if you see the number of stories that come out on business channels how this company is taking over that company, how this company is getting a strategic investor, in the end, these things take too long and therefore I would be very happy if it happens, but I am okay with my stocks.


 Given that what is happening to promoter balance sheets, what has happened to the Zee Group in terms of promoter leverage, how Bajaj Group is suffering because of excess exposure to power and sugar, there are a lot of challenges facing a lot of individual promoters. Where will the capital commitment or ownership come from?It will come from new companies in the sense that if you look at the tax cut, the animal spirit for the economy will come and it will happen relatively soon. More foreign companies will come to manufacture in India to take advantage of the new tax rate which is only valid if you start production by 2023 or whatever because you will save 20% or so import duty. 

The corporate tax is more or less the same now in the region and in India, you can save nearly 20% import duty for an electronic company or a consumer durable company. How can they not set it up when their margins are 5 and 10% or maybe a little higher at 12-13%? I think that will happen. 

Second, in India if they do a little bit of personal tax cut and all that and why is the BPCL or one of these privatisations important? BPCL is a profitable company. In theory, it does not matter to the government but the way we account for our fiscal deficit is that if you sell all of it at one shot, our fiscal deficit is under control. Therefore the government will feel that they can do a bit more of personal tax cut or maybe GST rationalisation, just because of the way we account for things. 

It will give them confidence to do more things and then the animal spirit will come. I can produce animal spirit for you in 30 seconds if you just now say that long term capital gains tax is zero. We do not have to start animal spirit from the real economy. tHE stock market is the cheapest way to get animal spirits because we are the least greedy among the economic players. If you give the stock market guys zero LTCG and maybe DDT, we do not ask for labour or legal reforms. We do not ask for land, we just start animal spirits from here and everything else which is connected will pick up.

The prime minister of India said in New York that we are aiming to get equity taxes in line with global benchmarks. If you lay down all the taxes related to equities, the only ones which do not align with global benchmarks are first is Dividend Distribution Tax and Long Term Capital Gains Tax for foreigners. Now since you do not have to do it only for foreigners, you might as well do it for the Indian public also and do it for everybody, just restore it back to Feb last year budget. The point is if the government is keen, this is how animal spirits can be raised. 


The fact that markets are reacting so viciously to a bellwether like Infosys on a whistleblower report on a couple of key transactions which may or may not be transactions that will reflect on earnings going forward. How are you perceiving the 15% knockdown that we are seeing today?I have always said that nobody knows anything about anything beyond a point. So this is exhibit A of that and secondly you go and say that I own 10 of the best companies, but the only way you know it is the best company is because the stock has not fallen. Otherwise, by no definition could you have not said that this is one of the best companies. But today they will not say it, even the guys who do not own it or the ones who own because the stock has fallen 15%.

Fortunately, we are neither long nor short Infosys. But in general, the idea is not to think that you know anything you can only remove as much of the negatives as you can and then you are subject to luck and circumstances beyond your control and that is why after being here for 25 years, I feel less in terms of having conviction of the highest level on any one company. No company deserves that and can get that highest level of conviction, that is the way life is."
36,2019-10-23,Asian Paints,"In case there is some merit in whistleblower’s allegations against Infosys CEO, that could mean very different outcomes, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Will you buy Infosys?What happened in the stock is quite unexpected because after what we saw two years back and the steps that were taken to restore confidence, these kind of allegations coming in a company known for stellar corporate governance perhaps numbed investors yesterday. 

The first thing one would need to know is how proven or substantiated are these allegations in the report and then there is also an overhang of a class action suit because the stock is ADR listed. That is making people jittery. After Nandan Nilekani stepped back two years ago and corporate governance issues were put to rest, nerves were soothed. But what has come out recently is quite damaging. Even though the valuations are not that expensive after the fall yesterday, there are a lot of significant events for which investors would look for answers before taking a shot at the business. 

Although the growth numbers were good, people were quite happy with the TCB wins in this quarter, but on balance, some clarity has to emerge for people to take a price call more than anything else because now it is not a question of just a business at a price. In case there is some merit in whistleblower’s allegations, that could mean very different outcomes.


It seems like Axis has delivered what the street wanted it to?Axis Bank is maintaining the trajectory of what we have seen over the last three quarters. Yes, there has been some sort of arrest on the asset quality deterioration and the fact that now the management has taken a positive guidance. Today loan growth is at 14-15% but the fact that some spots of commercial vehicle portfolio are showing some stress and at the same time, slippages are also not coming down as much as expected. Those are the red flags but having said that, the valuations have now corrected to about 2-2.5 times book.That is not too bad a price for people to look at, assuming that this trend accelerates further and normalised earnings are much more closer than what they were once the entire corporate credit cycle hit the bank.


What about Kotak Mahindra Bank? Would you be a little worried that the asset quality has come off and has worsened?One looks at Kotak as a torchbearer for what is happening on the borrowing trends etc. There also, the loan growth has fallen to 14% and there are the same stress points in CVs. There is some problem that is happening in the nuts and bolts economy because the CV portfolio is not picking up. That means there is less freight and people are not getting enough volumes. This means the payment cycles for most of the NBFCs who have given loans will sooner or later also start seeing a 30-day, 60-day kind deterioration in the asset mix. Those are factors that probably will concern investors going forward.


Would you dare to buy PSU stocks?PSUs have been classical value trap. For them, the only problem is that they are great cash machines available at fantastic yields. The only challenge is that one does not know that there is a) CPSE ETF overhang, b) the management prone to regulatory interference. 
That’s why these banks do not get valued as they should be, but having said that, there are a lot of names and large companies like Coal India, BEL. These are names where even today the outlook is bright, the valuations are very comforting and the government is making the right noises to make a change in these specific sectors. So be it the oil marketing companies, Coal India, BEL -- these are places where one would be more open to taking a bet.

These are the bets that one should definitely take from a 3-5-year horizon because the government has stated that they need to do the strategic investment and these are names where one will start seeing a lot of changes in perception.


Is there an opportunity in State Bank of India and other PSBs?
SBI has definitely given enough to investors to suggest that the worst of asset quality is behind us but having said that, starting this financial year, in the first quarter, we saw the banks taking back a lot of share from the NBFCs in the lending market and hopefully the trend should sustain even in the second quarter. But the problem is that today demand for credit is so low that despite this, even SBI is not looking at loan growth of more than 12-13%.

The challenge is that the moment credit cycle revives, it will probably lead to a lot of confidence coming back in terms of valuations being comfortable and subsidiary value getting discovered. Of course, that is also a very comforting point. 

Of course, if IBC implementation had been speeded up, things would have been even better and the confidence would have been higher. But the valuation is giving a lot of comfort, more so because today you see the disparity of a private financial available at two and a half-three times book. We are noe seeing a lot of asset quality concerns coming up, whereas as a PSU available at book and with the worst of the asset quality pressure behind them, that is where the trade off seems to be coming around.


What about Asian Paints performance? Today, in a slowdown kind of mindset, when a company comes out with and reports very strong decorative paints volume growth numbers, that is a very healthy sign which is also corroborating the fact that even Lever has reported very healthy underlying volume growth. but ne needs to get a sense whether and probably that is the reason why they are getting valued as well because most of them are 40 times plus in terms of forward earnings basis. 

The value is already there and from here onwards, either the core economy starts picking up so you see there is a switch of flow rotation. Then you see that there are better returns to be made elsewhere but otherwise till that time the pickup on the ground is visible, I think these will continue to be high trade where more funds will continue to be allocated. Investors are more likely to stay put here because visibility of earnings is better, even though the earnings growth may not be 20-25%, that is being expected on a revival basis but at least 10-15% is good enough for people as long as there is visibility. 

But the larger concern is that when the staples segment is quoting at 40-45 times forward from here onwards, there is no value argument. For a value investor, these stocks do not sort of make the grade."

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Citi has maintained sell rating on 
GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and revised target price to Rs 1330 from Rs 1240. GSK’s efforts to rationalise its portfolio by divesting multiple, tail-end brands and focusing on its priority brands portfolio have begun paying off – as reflected in low double digit topline growth and 20 per cent plus EBITDA margin, said Citi. The brokerage expects this trend to continue going forward but does not see a return to historical 30 per cent plus margin levels.

• UBS has maintained buy rating on 
Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 2120. In the September quarter, Asian Paints grew decorative paint volumes by 15-16 per cent much ahead of expectations, said UBS.

Shares of Asian Paints ended down 0.75 per cent at Rs 1766.40 on Wednesday.


• Jefferies has maintained buy rating on 
Newgen Software Technologies and revised target price to Rs 290 from Rs 372. The brokerage has cut EPS estimates for Newgen over FY20-FY22 to reflect weaker growth as well as resulting lower margins. Jefferies has retained buy as it expects growth to recover in FY21 which should also lead to sharp margin expansion. The brokerage is hopeful of traction in sales in the US market in particular which is a large opportunity for Newgen; India business should also grow better next year helped by a more favorable base. Shares of Newgen Software ended down 19.4 per cent at Rs 200.70 on Wednesday.

ICICI Securities and rolled forward target price to Rs 340 from Rs 320. The brokerage has raised earnings estimates to factor-in a better top-line and see a 15 per cent CAGR over FY19-22. Its valuation is reasonable and an improvement in its growth outlook could drive a rerating, said CLSA. Shares of ICICI Securities ended up 8.5 per cent at Rs 308.85 on Wednesday.

• Nomura has upgraded
 Bajaj Finserv to buy from neutral and retained target price of Rs 9500. The brokerage has upgraded the stock as lending business continues to deliver well on growth and asset quality and part of the disappointment in earnings for general insurance business is in the price.

39,2019-10-25,Asian Paints,"Go for good quality, good governance and growth; avoid leaders of last bull market: This bull market would be called the Swachh Bharat bull market and the most important thing would be corporate governance, says Amit Jeswani, CIO, Stallion Asset. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How was the last one year for your own portfolio? Looking at the next one year, what is the hypothesis you are forming?The most important thing is between 2003 and 2017, the bull market was about chasing growth and no one cared about corporate governance. This bull market would be called the Swachh Bharat bull market and the most important thing would be corporate governance, then growth and the last thing would be valuation! So even this will correct some day, but for the next two-three years, when you have good quality, good governance and growth, keep chasing those stocks. Just do one thing, avoid the leaders of the previous bull market. The previous bull market leaders were auto ancillaries and wholesale NBFCs. Just avoid that and look at newer leaders.

Typically, the stocks which hit new highs after a bear market, lead the bull market. Virtually all insurance companies are hitting life-time highs; look at diagnostic stocks like Dr Lal Pathlabs and other stocks as well. They are the ones to hit a new high. Look at electronic consumer electronics like whirlpool, Voltas. These are the stocks which have started the bull market and that is where the large money is. 

Look at Warren Buffett’s portfolio now. He is there only in four sectors -- financials, consumer, pharma, consumer IT. Apple is 25% of Warren Buffett’s portfolio and financials are 45% of his portfolio, consumer is 25%. We have to be in these four sectors. Look at his portfolio in 2009, it was broadly the same. IT was not there, consumer healthcare was. In the last 30 years, all Warren Buffett has done is buy companies which are getting better with size.


What is your reaction on the tax cuts which the government will be considering in the next couple of months. How do you expect the listed space to react and which are the sectors for which this tax cuts could be positive and which could be the negative ones?Only three crore people pay income taxes in India and only 98,000 of them show income of more than Rs 1 crore. It is going to benefit AMCs and it is going to be a negative for life insurance companies because 50-60% people do life insurance to save on income taxes. So it is going to be negative for life insurance companies.

Consumer spending is another phase. Consumer is a very long-term story in India. It is not going to affect HULs and all that. No one is going to have better biscuits but for consumer electronics, it is going to be a very positive. Consumer branded retailing is one space that looks good.


Talk to us about your own portfolio. Financials is one space you look at closely. What percentage of your portfolios is financial and how is the classification looking like?In our portfolio, between 40% to 50% are financials. We are always in financials. It is one space where you can make tonnes of money. We have the top two private sector banks, one insurance company, top NBFCs, one gold finance company and one general insurance company. That is broadly 45% of our portfolio and we are very bullish on that. We have one leader in the microfinance space as well which is growing at 40-50%. 

So financials is a place where I strongly believe one should follow technical analysis. I should not say that but financials are trending. In nature, if things start getting better, then everything starts getting better. In case of high quality consumer stocks like Asian Paints, you buy them whenever they fall 20%. So be a fundamental analyst on consumer stocks and be a technical analyst on your financials. There is no evidence which says that buying low price to book creates higher wealth in financials.In fact, buy more expensive financials.


Like HDFCs, Bajaj Finance of the world.Exactly and if they can dilute at that multiple, then it is great.


Piramal Enterprises board has approved Rs 5,400-crore fundraising plan. What are your thoughts on Piramal?In the last 25 years, no one has been able to make money in corporate lending in India. So, there is no evidence that corporate lending can make money in India. Piramal has large exposure to real estate developers loans. This thing will take time. It will probably auto correct but it will take time, may be one year, two years or three years, but growth is not going to come back and markets chase growth. 

These were the leaders of the previous bull market. We typically do not touch them. If you see, IT was the bull market leader. No one made money in IT between 1996 to 2000. Then it was pharma between 2009 and 2015 and no one made money after that. It was just a value trap. Between 2003 and 2007, the leaders were infrastructure, real estate, commodity stocks and there have been value forever. The leaders of the previous bull market were those auto ancillaries and wholesale-backed NBFCs. I do not think that we will get in there. So, the business might do okay but we are not looking there.


What are the areas you are nibbling, areas where clients are giving you additional money over the last couple of months?We have got one consumer tech MNC. Our portfolio is 45% financials, 25% consumer, 25% consumer tech and 5% is consumer pharma. We are very focussed on the consumer side and we believe that large money is made when there is large growth. The majority of our companies are growing at 20% plus.


One honest confession this Diwali. Areas where you got it wrong badly in the last 12 months?I got it 100% wrong in the NBFC crisis. I fell down 20%. We have hit life-time highs again after that. I was long Piramal, I was long PNB Housing, I was long Edelweiss. We cut all of them. I have made mistakes because we catch growth. Growth is where we catch the leader of the bull market. NBFC was a leader of the bull market we were 30% in NBFC that was our weight before the NBFC crisis happened. When the NBFC crisis happened, we understood that game is over, the trend is over and we sold out on all these NBFCs and got into quality stocks. We have recovered everything back and now are back to hit new highs."

41,2019-10-27,Asian Paints,"As Dalal Street ushers in a new Samvat year, three top money managers -- Manish Gunwani of Nippon India Mutual Fund; Navneet Munot of SBI Mutual Fund and Nilesh Shah of Kotak Mutual Fund -- share wealth creation tips and investment strategies for the New Year ahead during an interaction with Nikunj Dalmia & Aabha Bakaya of ETNOW. Excerpts:-


Let us get a sense of whether you are welcoming the New Year with festive cheer?

Navneet Munot: Lots of twist and turns as Nikunj rightly pointed out both on the global and domestic front. Mr (Donald) Trump’s tweets kept everybody busy and now it is a statistically proven that his tweets have impacted markets in a big waym, whether it is trade war, happenings in the Middle East which impacted oil prices, global slowdown now that we are witnessing. On the domestic front, I am sure a year back nobody envisaged that growth would fall to a 5 per cent in the quarter in India so obviously growth surprised on the downside. 

On the other side, a year back when we were discussing about the default by one of the largest AAA-rated NBFC, we were thinking that may be in a few months time right steps should be taken and then we would go past that but it has taken a much longer and now we are looking at a scenario where there are a couple of other NBFCs and HFCs have been troubled. In the next few months, if we are able to solve it, if we take concrete steps to get the financial sector out of the challenges, I am pretty sure that next Diwali will be far better. 

Growth has surely bottomed, global environment is slightly improving for India in a sense that money is abundant, money is cheap, people are looking for new investment destinations and the steps that the government has taken starting with the corporate tax rate cut and I expect think from that perspective it could be a good year for India.


Everything this Samvat is at its peak, peak of bearishness, peak of market cap destruction, peak of mess in NBFCs, peak of bad news in India; from peaks where do we go?

Nilesh Shah: Suppose you score half a century on very tough bowling pitch on the fifth day against most dangerous bowlers, and you score a triple century on a batting pitch with lousy fielding and lousy bowling and getting dropped 20 times, which score will give you better satisfaction? Numbers wise triple century looks better but in heart we all know that 50 is worth its weight in gold. So, if you look at last year, Sensex delivered roughly 10 per cent return on at 4 per cent inflation, that is 6 per cent real return. In the best of the time also Sensex delivered 6-7 pr cent real return, so we are not way off from the average despite all the twist and turns and you know series of lower growth numbers. 

When the news flow is bad, sentiments are bad, valuation obviously is also bad and if you buy at low valuations, if you buy at cheap valuations, probability of making money increases immensely. Of course, it would not increase tomorrow but who knows day after tomorrow so this is the time to put your head together, understand that valuations are cheap and if you buy quality companies run by good managers, I think there are better days ahead.


How confident are you that the worst is now clearly behind us when it comes to NBFCs, the financial mess and that we are headed in the right direction?

Manish Gunwani: For me there is a very definite data which is pointing towards a bottom. So, if you look at global growth, for example, this will be the longest period where global PMI manufacturing kept falling for 15 months. It has fallen successively and September was the first month it stopped falling and came back a bit positive versus the month before. 

Similarly if I look at domestic monetary conditions, I think we are definitely seeing that the good NBFCs, the good corporates, the spreads over government yields what they are paying are coming down. We are seeing banks cut deposit rates, banks cut lending rates, very small at this point of time. You are not seeing a typical 2013 or 2015 macro situation where because of coordinated global policy we had a V-shaped recovery, but at the same time if you look at each of these factors there is definite data that shows things are getting better. And, the good part about a slow recovery is, it lasts longer whenever it comes. For example we saw growth from 2003 to 2008 that came after 1997 to 2003 of a gradual economic slowdown.


Consumers are expensive and they were expensive three years ago, quality stocks were expensive and they are expensive right now but that is where all the returns are, so what is wrong in chasing them?

Navneet Munot: So, echoing the views that Nilesh has just mentioned that there are few stocks which have done exceptionally well most of them lie in the mega caps or the large caps but there are few of the mid and smallcaps, which are in that consumer quality space where the return on equity is higher, you still see some growth in a low growth environment and of course where are the perceived governance is far better. 

As a growth becomes more broad based, if we are able to tackle the challenges that are there in the financial sector as flows improved last few days, people would start looking at a wider set of universe. Then maybe you can chase quality and pay any price. I think maybe you just need a catalyst as Nilesh just mentioned once we see that catalyst, it will become a lot more broad based than what we have seen in the last one year. This has been one of the very narrow rally and 10-11 per cent growth that has come has come from a very narrow set of stocks, which is not good over a long period.


What is the catalyst that you are hoping for?

Manish Gunwani: I do think big strategic divestment from the government will be a big trigger because it will do two things; one is both bond and equity markets are definitely worried about the fiscal situation and whether in the second half of this year, especially on the state government side, which do not have access to RBI reserves or other non-tax revenues you could see a big squeeze on expenditure because once tax revenues are falling short and you have to meet a committed fiscal deficit number then the only option then is to squeeze the expenditure which pulls down the economy and you go into the vicious loop. A big strategic divestment would address that. 

Two is as we all know that PSUs, which are very value centric stocks and they have good dividend yield. Price to book and price to earnings multiple is very attractive but they have been suffering from supply through ETFs. Also the fact that it provides a big catalyst for them right if there is a strategic divestment which happens at 2 to 3 times the current market price for one of the PSU stocks, I think that whole universe would get re-rated and that will kind of pull up the index as well so on both sides from a macro-economic perspective and from a market centric perspective. I think that will be a big thing.


At the current price, fundamentally, how much downside is there?

Nilesh Shah: See, a lot will depend upon how situation evolves if oil prices goes to three digit obviously our markets will suffer, if today there is geopolitical tension in our border or outside obviously there will be impact on market. when you are investing in equity you have to take ups along with the downs and as I mentioned earlier today from a valuation point of view in small and midcap space there is limited downside, it does not mean that what is attractive cannot become cheap or what is cheap cannot become cheaper but then you will have to add more. That is how the disciplined asset allocation works. 

So, overall, if I see today you know even last year which was very tough, the largecaps did deliver 6 per cent real returns. This year it looks like corrective actions have been taken. Banking liquidity from May 2019 is positive, interest rates have been cut, PSU banks have been capitalised. In NBFC sector, some steps have been taken like securitisation with first loss so it has not yet become operational but hopefully once you have announced you will make it operational. If you see the currency which was overvalued is now little overvalued around fair value that will push exports. The strategic divestment is now right at the centre stage and hopefully it would not be like Air India. More importantly with China, which is resulted into higher trade deficit with India, there has been discussion about curtailing that. This Chinese trade deficit is converting our manufacturers to traders. Hopefully, if we can curtail that, it will be very positive so there are lots of corrective actions which have been taken and coupled with valuations, I will say there is limited downside in small and midcaps.


If I just put a portfolio of HDFC Bank or Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints.

Navneet Munot: Please add Kotak Bank..


Kotak Bank these stocks have done exceedingly well. But that is history now. Do you think now the names which could do well could be SBI or L&T or Tata Steel, largely cyclicals and deep cyclicals?

Nilesh Shah: It is a tough call.


Why do you say that?

Nilesh Shah: Because just because Rohit Sharma hit three centuries he cannot score fourth century that will be tough to say. In fact in HDFC Bank’s quarterly call, they said with that size they are creating a new bank every year.


HUL has created a Patanjali in last three years in terms of the turnover they are adding…

Nilesh Shah: Absolutely, and Khadi and Village Industries Commission has created two HULs over the years. So there is always nehle pe dehla but from a stock market point of view, over the next 12, 18, 24 months, we see small and midcaps delivering better returns than some of the marquee blue chips names. There are companies which are available below the cash value, there are companies which are available below the fair value at some point of time investors will discover them and they will go back to their fair value so if you are looking at a two to three year horizon, diversified portfolio of small and midcap may outperform the blue chip portfolio. 


What about insurance?

Manish Gunwani: It ticks a lot of boxes in terms of long term growth, very little chance of technology disruption. Between the two, I prefer general insurance over life insurance. I think in life insurance, still, some of the products are not very customer friendly, the valuations are quite expensive. Even for general insurance, the valuations are expensive but given the under penetration versus global opportunity, I think is more attractive in general insurance but yes both of them are good themes to play for the long term.


Will you buy autos for a comeback?

Nilesh Shah: So, again auto sector you will have to buy on a bottom up basis not on a top down basis. There are companies which are moving into hybrid in electric side that is probably where the future is. There are companies which are able to launch products which are quite innovative and in this downturn they have their order books full for the next six months. So if you are a company which is investing for the future and which is launching products which are more affordable with innovative features, certainly, this is the time to look at the automobile sector. 

The valuations have corrected and automobile sector went through a deep churn--the insurance cost went up, the whole debate about electric vehicles resulted in some curtailment in investments and launch of product, NBFC crisis dried down the flow of capital for buying of two wheelers and four wheelers. 

So, there are multiple factors which came together and most important thing we started adding many new features so you had aspiration of a first world car with income of third world, air bags, ABS, central locking, power steering that all kept on adding to the cost of the car which was probably making it unaffordable to the average person. Now over a period of time some corrective actions will be taken in this segment and this is where auto becomes interesting. If they are investing for future, if they are investing for features, if they can cut the cost of creating a first world aspirational car with third world income and we did that with Nano then obviously that is a great time to invest. 


Manish, is there anything you would stick your neck out and call this Diwali something that perhaps is not in line with general market mood?

Manish Gunwani: I do think that a lot of the cyclical parts of the market have a very good chance of doing well on a two-three years basis.


The theme for the current administration or the current government is that India is on course to become a $5 trillion economy and the entire policy making what we understand is actually centred around that so if India has to become a $5 trillion economy who will do all the heavy lifting will it be financials, will it be manufacturing, will it be consumers and how can one participate and make money?

Manish Gunwani: At least for the next two-three years, I do expect consumption to be the main driver of the economy and as economies mature then obviously the discrete consumption goes faster so I think retailing, general insurance, auto—everything should do much better than what it is doing today.

Navneet Munot: I think bottom-up stock picking there are opportunities everywhere as we discussed it earlier repeating the same point there are set of stocks that have done well rest of the market has become cheap. I expect a good cyclical recovery and then it is likely to become structural because the kind of reforms we are undertaking or we are likely to undertake in the next few months because of the compulsion will lead to a structural positives over a very long period of time.


Nilesh, what do you think?

Nilesh Shah: So if $5 trillion GDP target is target of government then it will take time to achieve but if it becomes target of yourself, myself, Navneet, Manish, and Nikunj, then it will happen much faster.


I think that is the most bullish I have heard him say today.

Navneet Munot: That is very important understanding that if it has to be a slogan like we have to get independence and then everybody even if you are cleaning the floor, if you are teaching somewhere or you are doing something else cooking food for somebody else everybody was working towards a Swaraj. I think Nilesh right point that everybody has to work towards that $5 trillion."

43,2019-10-28,Asian Paints,"Valuations of some of the high PE stock companies are reaching the bubble territory. Our big call would be that you have to move out of these companies and move into the so-called the boring companies which have seen some headwinds where earnings have been volatile but which have real assets and real earnings, says Sunil Singhania, Founder, Abakkus Asset Manager LLP. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

We have been looking at some of the highlights in the year gone by trying to perhaps take a step back from the echoes of what we have heard of the last few months with regards to the slowdown. As we enter the new year, what are you hoping for and which direction do you see things moving? Is the worst now behind us?We all know that last one year has been a year of challenges. A lot of headwinds have hit the economy in terms of slowdown, liquidity issues, asset quality of banks and NBFCs and so on and so forth. At the same time, we have also had some pretty path breaking reforms whether -- be it the corporate tax cut or even FDI in few sectors. 

All in all, it has been a difficult and challenging year. Despite that, we have had a reasonable performance from the market. Nifty has given positive returns, obviously the midcaps and small caps have not done as well but given the challenges which the economy is facing, the markets have held on pretty strongly. 

Another redeeming factor has been that both from foreign investors perspective and the domestic investors perspective, India continues to be a market where net inflows have been very consistent and robust. That makes for a good background and as and when we start to see the recovery in the economy happening, we would be headed towards a better market.


What are some of the picks you have going into the new year, especially with that outlook? What would you be looking at in terms of an opportunity this Samvat -- a multibagger or theme that you are bullish on?From time to time, we have seen some kind of over valuation or even bubble like scenario emerging in a lot of themes and sectors. We had the dotcom bubble and we had the power sector and the infra boom, followed by the pharma frenzy in 2016-17. We are seeing some of that emerging in some of the very high PE stocks. Over the last two-three years, quality stable companies and companies with high ROEs which nothing to worry about in terms of their management quality, in terms of their balance sheet quality and no leverage, have done very well. When companies do well, they attract more flows and then it becomes a self-fulfilling thing where you are buying the same stocks at higher and higher valuations and basically PE and valuations just do not matter any more 

We are reaching that stage where valuations of some of these companies are reaching the bubble territory. Our big call would be that you have to move out of these companies and move into the so-called the boring companies which have seen some headwinds where earnings have been volatile but which have real assets and real earnings. They are now trading at four-five times EV EBITDA and if we believe that India is going to grow, and that is the reason why we are in equity markets, then some of these companies and some of these sectors will start to see earnings growth which will surprise most of the investors. 

Our big call would be to move away from this neat clean, high PE stocks and start to focus on the core valuation matrices whether it is PE or DCF or any of the matrices which an investor is comfortable with. 

Our theme is to start investing in the broader markets, in companies which are being ignored but which would typically be companies with Rs 5,000-7,000-crore and below market cap. I do not know whether it is a multibagger or not, but I am very confident that at the valuation at which the broader markets trade at, investors would outperform by a big margin not only the Nifty but also some of the so-called quality names. 


Do you think taking risk in this kind of market is worth it or should one stck to capital protection?We have all been in this market for years and decades. I do not think any investor comes into equity markets to protect capital. There are other asset classes which are available if you want to protect capital. Very clearly, equity is all about growing wealth and when you are looking at growing wealth, obviously you would want to invest in a company whose valuation justifies the earnings going forward. In that respect, I would say that the broader markets now offer that kind of an opportunity. 

In terms of whether there is a risk, obviously there is a perceived risk and that is the reason why you are getting these stocks at such low valuation and ultimately we will have to take some risk but the price at which the stocks are trading, obviously makes that risk much lower. I would say, the risk is a perceived risk of near term underperformance but if you do all your basic fundamental analysis and use any matrices which the gurus of long-term investing would have mentioned and taught us, the answer would be very clear.


 So if somebody has to invest in the Samvat the Sunil Singhania way, would you say do not buy Bajaj Finance, D-Mart, HUL or Nestle, but buy from industrial cyclicals and beaten down midcap stocks?I am not saying just buy industrial and cyclicals. Obviously those companies are really cheap, but if you see, corporate banks have done very well. Despite all the concerns and all the NPLs, both ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and to some extent even State Bank of India have done reasonably well. In fact, I would say that they have outperformed even the retail banks. Even on the FMCG side, the larger companies have now started being in a lot of indices.

Nestle, Hindustan Lever and Asian Paints are in the Nifty and there is a huge corpus now in Nifty ETFs plus there is money which is coming into the passive funds and these funds are investing in these companies, not from a fundamental perspective but because they are part of the index. They have to compulsorily buy them. 

I would say to some extent, globally it is a phenomenon that passive funds are fuelling the huge inflows into companies which necessarily might not be great stocks from a fundamental perspective. I would say that consumption continues to be a great theme in India but if you go down the market cap, you are in a position to at least justify the valuation from a future earnings perspective. That is what we will be focussing on.


What are the Muhurat picks from Sunil Singhania?Sunil Singhania: We have seen over the last two-three days, two corporate banks have declared really good numbers. Both of them have a lot of steam left. There is still some disbelief in terms of how their asset quality and profitability are going to pan out, but if you dissect the numbers, the pre-provisioning operating profits for both have risen by almost 20% and the provisioning amount have fallen significantly. As we move forward, this trend will only get stronger. 

So I would say that both of these corporate banks -- one on the private sector and one on the public sector -- should do very well even in the next one year. Also, in both cases, their subsidiaries are adding value with each passing year, be it the life insurance company, the general insurance company, the insurance arm, the mutual fund arm and as also in one case, the credit card arm. So unlike my style which is more midcap. I would say that these two corporate banks still have a lot more room to go.


What your take is when it comes to the consumption space because you had gone on record to say that the pattern of consumption is going to change but actual consumption as a theme is going to continue to remain strong?Consumption is going to shift from staples to discretionary and a faster growth can be observed on the discretionary side. Also, our habits are changing. We want to look good,; we want to wear good clothes; we want to eat good food; we want to enjoy life by way of travelling, watching movies."

The average compensation for the top 100 of the batch increased to Rs 2.71 lakh for two months from Rs 2.45 lakh for two months last year. 

The placement season also saw an increase of 11.2% in the average stipend for women candidates which increased to Rs 2.33 lakh from Rs 2.1 lakh the previous year. This year 80% of the batch or 170 candidates received a stipend of Rs 2 lakh and above.

The companies that participated in the campus placement include Accenture Strategy, Aditya Birla Group, American Express, AT Kearney, Bank of America, Boston Consulting Group, Asian Paints, Beam Suntory, BYJU’s, Coca-Cola, among others.

There was a record 42% increase in the e-commerce/IT/Operation roles compared to last year with 47 accepted offers from recruiters such as Amazon, Adobe, Flipkart, Google, Media.Net, Microsoft, Ola, Swiggy and Uber.

45,2019-10-30,Asian Paints,"Most equity schemes of JM Financial Mutual Fund are topping the charts in their respective category with double-digit returns in the last one year. JM Tax Gain Fund is topping the ELSS category with 25% returns in the last one year, JM Value Fund is ranking number one with 18% returns in one year. Another scheme, JM Multicap Fund, is at the fourth position in the category with 24% returns. JM Core 11 Fund has also given superior returns of 23%.

Does this mean the fund house is on the way to stage a comeback? In other words, can investors bet on these schemes?

“The performance is largely in terms of the segment of the market which is brighter. Here high growth, high value companies have moved largely the performance of these schemes,” says Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

JM’s equity schemes are invested mainly in bluechip stocks like Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, Asian Paints, ITC whose recent outperformance is reflecting in its one year performance.

Mutual fund advisors and distributors say they are still not ready to bet on the AMC. Many advisors say they do not track the schemes of the AMC. They also claim they don’t have any communications or interaction with the AMC. 

“Since there is no communication from the AMC on anything and we have bigger AMCs which promote a healthy communication, we do not track JM schemes. The schemes started underperforming after Sandip Sabharwal left the AMC in around 2008. We stopped tracking the schemes after that,” says Prashant Maurya, partner, Citrine Financial Advisors.

JM Mutual Fund was not available for comments. 

The schemes are quite tiny as well. Mutual fund advisors say it is another reason to ignore the schemes from JM Financial Mutual Fund.

“These schemes do not have enough unique investors. In this case if one investor moves out it can impact that scheme in a huge way,” says Maurya.

JM Tax Gain Fund manages an AUM worth Rs 33 crore, JM Multicap holds assets worth Rs 139 crore, JM core 11 holds Rs 53 crore and JM Value Fund has Rs 124 crore assets."

48,2019-10-31,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: BSE benchmark Sensex scaled a fresh record high of 40,325 on Thursday, exactly 100 days after it hit an all-time high of 40,312 on June 4, thanks to a rally in select index heavyweights including Reliance Industries (up 9 per cent), Asian Paints (28 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (up 19 per cent) and Bajaj Finance (up 15 per cent). 

The 100-day period was marked by high volatility for domestic stocks due to unfavourable tax-related announcements in the Union Budget in July that triggered unabated outflow by foreign investor money.

That said, measures announced by the finance ministry to calm investor nerves, including rollback of some of the announcements and a long-awaited corporate tax cut, besides expectations of more rate cuts brought the market back to previous highs.

Stock like YES Bank (down 62 per cent), Tata Steel (down 21 per cent), State Bank of India (down 20 per cent), IndusInd Bank (down 20 per cent), ONGC (down 17 per cent) and Infosys (down 11 per cent) witnessed heavy selling during these 100 days, which capped the upside of the 30-share index.

“There is a strong momentum in the market as healthy Q2 earnings from big companies and attractive valuations of midcap and smallcap stocks are providing a favourable risk-reward to investors,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

“This positivity is likely to continue in the short to medium term, as concerns are fading in market with tax cut and clear government intentions to come out with more reforms in direct and indirect taxation,” he said.

Coming to broader markets, the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined up to 10 per cent during this period.

With a nearly 100 per cent rally between June 4 and October 30, Adani Green Energy emerged as top gainer in the BSE Smallcap index. It was followed by Religare Enterprises (up 98 per cent), Shipping Corporation of India (up 78 per cent), Garden Reach (up 76 per cent) and Dolat Investment (up 65 per cent).

On the other hand, shares of Cox & Kings, Talwalkars Healthclub, HDIL, DHLF, Sintex Industries, Sintex Plastics and Coffee Day declined between 85-99 per cent during the same period.

Gaurav Dua, Senior Vice-President and Head of capital market strategy & investments at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, expects the situation to improve for midcaps and smallcaps after the severe correction in last two years.

Almost 55 per cent of the broader market has corrected over 40 per cent, and value is beginning to emerge in certain pockets,” he said.

Paint and asset management stocks have hogged limelight in the recent past. From the midcap space, Berger Paints has rallied the most at 55 per cent since June 4, while Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management has gained nearly 50 per cent. ICICI Securities, Whirlpool of India, GMR Infra and Colgate Palmolive gained over 30 per cent each.

Indiabulls Ventures, RBL Bank, Edelweiss Financial Services and Indian Bank declined over 50 per cent between June 4 and October 30.

“Auto, cement, construction, corporate banks and consumption themes looking interesting after the recent correction,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP, IIFL Securities.

Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director at KR Choksey Investment Managers said the market’s fundamentals are absolutely in place. However, the market may take a small breather after the strong and fast rally.

Barring the BSE FMCG (up 5.35 per cent) and Auto indices (up 1 per cent), other sectoral indices are still in the red since June 4. The BSE Metal index has declined 15 per cent since June 4, while Telecom, PSU and Realty indices are between 8-14 per cent.

For sector-specific investors, Pankaj Pandey, Head – Research, ICICIdirect, advises positive stance on select BFSI, infrastructure or capital goods (a gradual pick-up in ordering activity from power T&D, defence, renewables and Railways will perk up revenue visibility, benefits of benign interest rates) and cement (expansion in volumes and positive operating leverage would be a good bet) stocks for the near term.

He said ICICIdirect also remains positive on IT, pharma and FMCG sectors. These are expected to deliver stable growth with relatively lower chances of downgrades in the current economic milieu. “We remain negative on oil & gas and metals (volatility in commodity prices and stretched balance sheets will keep earnings trajectory hazy),” Pandey said."

49,2019-10-31,Asian Paints,"BSE benchmark Sensex hit a record high on Thursday amid a rally in select bank, auto, IT and pharma stocks. The 30-share pack kissed the day’s high of 40,344, surpassing the previous record high of 40,312 attained on June 4, a gap of exactly 100 sessions.

The 100-day period saw high volatility as tax-related announcements in the July Union Budget triggered a selloff by foreign investors. FIIs sold stocks worth net of Rs 15,000 crore during this period. Domestic institutional investors absorbed the selloff and helped maintain some stability, pouring in Rs 63,000 crore, thanks to constant flow of money from retail investors.

Most analysts expect the rally to continue. However, gains may be capped for largecaps. They expect midcaps to join the rally from here on and outperform the frontrunners.

“Till March 2020, I don’t see more than 5-8 per cent upside in Sensex. Even though Sensex has hit a record high, the broader market is yet to join the rally. I have not seen this type of skewed performance. Therefore, I am very bullish on the broader market. Smallcaps and midcaps should lead over the next six months,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder and Managing Director of Equinomics Research and Advisory.

He, however, hopes to see 30-50 per cent gains in the broader market over next one year. Chokkalingam said the collective market-cap of Group B shares was Rs 7.6 lakh crore on Wednesday, down from Rs 20.63 lakh crore, 60 per cent, in March 2018, when the market peaked last.

Year to date, Sensex has grown about 12 per cent thanks to a rally in select index heavyweights, including RIL (up 9 per cent), Asian Paints (28 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (up 19 per cent) and Bajaj Finance (up 15 per cent). 


Sahil Kapoor, Chief Market Strategist, Associate Director at Edelweiss, pegs Sensex in the 46,000-47,000 range by June 2020, a potential upside of 16 per cent from current level. In the near term, he expects some consolidation.

Sanjeev Hota, Vice President and Head of Research at Sharekhan, expects 10-12 per cent of upside in Nifty from Diwali level till November 2020.

Nifty Midcap is down 6 per cent YTD and Nifty Smallcap index 11 per cent.

Both Kapoor and Hota expect midcaps to outperform going forward. ""Smallcaps are yet to respond meaningfully. Over the next 2-3 months, there will be more opportunities in midcaps and smallcaps,"" Kapoor said.

Hota expects good growth in specialty chemicals, private banks and some consumption names, whereas, Chokkalingam is bullish on midsized IT stocks, select pharma MNCs and commercial leasing businesses. 

""The market is clearly in a positive setup after the festive season saw improvement in demand and corporate tax rate cut provided the much needed earnings boost. Considering sequential improvement and earnings visibility, we believe the market will continue to trend upwards. We have a April 2020 Nifty target of 12,800,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance Securities."
50,2019-10-31,Asian Paints,"The troika of labour, land and personal income tax reforms are enough to deal with the supply side as well as the demand side issues, says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


A number of factors has led to the buoyant mood in the market. What do you think is the most crucial of the lot?Clearly, we are in an environment where the market is discounting economic reforms and in spite of a weak state of the economy the market is now focussed on other reforms that the people believe are likely to be announced in the next six months or so. So it is land reforms, labour reforms, income tax cuts, potentially dividend distribution tax cuts that people are rightly focussing on. This is something we have seen in India before. Something like 80% of the gains that the Sensex makes, typically comes in the two years following the general election and in that regard we are following a five year test.


What about the overall domestic macro environment and how are the markets reacting?There is a pretty predictable pattern in the Indian stock market because we have an election season where the first two years of a five-year election cycle have a few elections in them. That is where the bulk of the economic reforms in India generally takes place and as a result Sensex returns increase. If you look at Sensex returns over the last 40 years or so, 80% of the returns the Sensex have given have come in the two years immediately following a general election. This is when the market starts discounting economic reforms. We are going through that sort of cycle in our country that is what most people in the stock market are doing. They are beginning to discount reforms and in that regard, the current earnings season becomes less relevant. The discounting of a future economic recovery becomes more relevant.


How is this going to play out now? We have no immediate triggers as such, not until Budget, unless there are more surprises or announcements by the government. Even interim global cues seem to be now on track?The reforms that we need to look out for is not the tax-oriented reforms that the stock market in Mumbai gets very excited about. It is great for stock brokers to jump up and down about STT and so on. But the main reforms we need to look out for are around land reforms. I think the Prime Minister will have a crack at amending the 2013 Land Acquisition Act. It will be flagged well in advance at the Winter session of Parliament. 

The second area is labour reforms. Given the number of critical economic states where the BJP is in power, it make sense for the BJP to expedite labour reforms through the state governments and we will get some signal of that through the coming three-four months.

 If the land and labour reforms come through, you can start discounting an economic recovery fairly aggressively. This is far more important than STT and dividend distribution tax. The other leg is the Budget. Personal income tax cuts would be imperative in the Budget. Given the rate at which the corporate taxes have been pulled back, not to pull back personal income tax would be wrong.

This troika of reforms -- labour, land and personal income tax - to my mind is the troika of reforms which is enough to deal with the supply side issues as well as the demand side issues. That is the government’s thrust over the next six months or so. How much of this they can actually pull through is anybody’s guess, but they will have a pretty determinant go at it and that is what we are sitting here and discounting. 

Well run companies with strong balance sheets, strong cash flows are beautifully placed to exploit these reforms and that is where the market will once again come back to focussing on the category leaders, the Asian Paints, the HDFC Banks and Pidilites rather than going for high beta broken balance sheet plays, which have long since gone out of fashion in our country.


Overall,you are sounding constructive on the longer term picture, but what you are saying is that the kind of momentum that we are seeing currently is not something you get carried away with. Am I right?
We have is a very nice situation where the long term and the short term are converging nicely. Companies which can hold their P&L, their earnings through very weak economic down cycles such as the one we find ourselves, companies with strong franchise power, strong financial strength, good ROCs are also the companies that will benefit the most from structural reforms that the NDA is trying to expedite. 

They are trying to make this a more efficient economy and they are trying to push through land and labour reforms. Well run high quality companies are the best placed companies to capitalise on such a scenario. 

Focus on buying well run champion Indian franchises and you are well placed not to just protect yourself from this downturn, you are also well placed to capitalise on what looks like a pretty punchy reform cycle ahead of us in the next six to 12 months.


There seems to be quite different views on perhaps what is going to lead the rally. Banks seem to be a clear lead in that overall poll, but some are more tilted towards seeing a bigger opportunity in cyclicals at the moment. What would you be looking to invest in at this point? I have been living in India for 11 years now and I have spent a lot of time thinking this through; is it worthwhile punting on deep cyclicals as you put it, high beta broken balance sheet companies as I put it? My net-net realisation has been that especially for people like me who are managing other peoples’ money, it is irresponsible to invest in these sort of firms. They have not had a 15-year or 10-year track record of generating cash flows or return on capital.

 In many cases, there are serious accounting and governance issues around these firms with their accounts that they report. So yes, they look optically cheap but I would still contend, especially for people who are managing third party money, that they should stay away from many of these companies that you are calling deep cyclicals.They are cheap, but they might get a little expensive in the next 12 months as the market starts discounting a rally. These are poorly run companies with highly questionable corporate governance and accounting practices. 

So our preference at Marcellus remains on HDFC Banks, the Kotak Banks, the Asian Paints and Pidilites of the world. It appears conservative to buy these companies but I have seen in India over the last 10 years. If you consistently and sensibly invest in these franchises, you make anywhere between high teens to low 20s returns consistently and for someone like me who is managing other people’s money, that is a perfectly acceptable outcome."

1,2019-11-01,Asian Paints,"The painful bear hammering, led mainly by toxic debt and punitive government policies, seen in domestic equities over the past few months did not spare even quality companies. This is why as the market shows first signs of a bounceback, stocks that have been maintaining robust return on capital employed (RoCE) for last 10 years should be the first ones to draw investor attention.

Chances are that some of these stocks would emerge frontrunners and deliver handsome returns to investors in the coming months.

RoCE measures capital efficiency of a business. It is a measure of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for every rupee of capital (equity and debt) employed in the business.

Investing in companies with higher RoCE can reap rich rewards if it can maintain higher capital efficiency on new capital as well. In short, higher RoCE indicates better capital efficiency, which can will lead to better wealth creation for shareholders.

As many as 67 per cent of stocks that have a record of maintaining an RoCE of 15 per cent have lost up to 80 per cent of value in this correction.

With an 80 per cent fall since January 2018, TPL Plastech emerged as biggest loser on the list. It was followed by Wimplast (down 73 per cent), Kitex Garments (down 72 per cent), NBCC (down 71), eClerx (down 71 per cent), RPP Infra (down 69 per cent), Care Ratings (down 60 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (down 59 per cent).

Zee shares were under pressure through most the year, as worried investors sold the stock amid concerns that lenders may redeem pledged shares. The company has since managed to bring in some strategic investors.





BSE benchmark Sensex has advanced 18 per cent since January 2018 amid select buying in blue chips, while broader market indicators BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices dipped 18 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively.

“Some quality midcaps got hit badly in this selloff in tandem with companies that had corporate governance issues. This is an opportunity to buy,” says Vijay Kedia, MD, Kedia Securities.

“There are very few good stocks in the market right now and they may have bottomed out. We may not see any V-shaped recovery in the companies that have issues. They may recover partially, but it is very difficult to say if they will make money,” he said.

Data available with Ace Equity showed there are 117 companies that have been maintaining an RoCE of at least 15 per cent on BSE since 2009. Analysts believe after a steep correction such stocks can be good options to look at.

“Investors should look for such stocks, but there is a caveat. One cannot go by historical RoCE alone. One should look for prospective RoCE before taking any investment decision. In the current environment, several businesses have undergone massive business model changes, and hence, one needs to figure out how the RoCE will pan out in the future,” says Prabhakar Kudwa, Director, Samvitti Capital.

Meanwhile, among the chart toppers some stocks like NIIT Technologies, Asian Paints, Vinati Organics, Berger Paints, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Astral Poly Technik, Tata Consultancy Services, HUL, HDFC Bank, Relaxo, Titan, Morganite Crucible, Pidilite, L&T Infotech have rallied between 30 per cent and 133 per cent in this period.




Analysts feel many of these stocks have room to grow on the upside. Centrum Broking still has a ‘buy’ rating on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 2,042. BoBCAPS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda, has an ‘add’ rating on NIIT Technologies with a price target of Rs 1,600.

IDBI Capital Market is bullish on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490, while ICICIdirect has a ‘buy’ rating on Dabur India with a price target of Rs 550.

Some of these companies, which had debt in excess of Rs 1,000 crore as of March 31, delivered negative returns to investors in last 22 months.

For instance, ONGC had a consolidated debt of Rs 1,07,640 crore at the end of FY19. The stock declined 26 per cent between January 1, 2018 and October 29 this year.

Wipro, Dilip Buildcon, Godrej Consumer Products, Coromandel International, Hindustan Zinc, Aarti Industries, Coal India, Redington and Zee Entertainment had debt ranging from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore as of March 31, Ace Equity showed.

Kolkata-based Abhishek Basumallick, Founder and Chief Equity Advisor of Intelsense Capital, says looking at RoCE alone may not help. However, it is a very good starting point to spot stocks.

“Any company that can earn a decent RoCE over longer periods, especially if it is above its cost of capital, will be able to sustain the business and flourish,” he said."
2,2019-11-01,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Extending their winning streak for the sixth-straight session, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended marginally higher on Friday supported by metal, telecom and banking stocks.

The markets remained volatile throughout the day as speculators cheered positive Chinese macro data and a strong set of key corporate earnings which raised expectations of a better third quarter. But the gains were capped by weak macroeconomic data released after market hours yesterday. According to official data, output of eight core infrastructure industries contracted by 5.2 per cent in September, the lowest in the decade, indicating the severity of economic slowdown. The eight core sectors had expanded by 4.3 per cent in September 2018.

YES Bank was among the top losers in the Sensex pack, slipping nearly 8 per cent in trade ahead of its financial results for the quarter ended September 2019. There are expectations that the bank will continue to see challenges from consolidation in business, consequently affecting operating performance leading to degrowth in net interest income (NII) and preprovisioning operating profit (PPOP).

Analysts said that in the near term, markets may see some consolidation after the recent rally. They expect earnings season to dictate trend for the markets for the next few days as investors await fresh cues from the upcoming quarterly results next week. Also, the market participants will eye the release of US jobs data later in the day and fresh information on US-China trade deal.

TECHNICAL ANALYST, SUSHIL FINANCE


Where we are: The Diwali week saw the festive spirit rub-off on Dalal Street with indices hitting new highs on back of earnings optimism and fed rate cuts. Nifty closed the week at 11890.


What is in store: As we head into the November series, expect range-bound trade to continue with result based stock specific action. With formidable run-up in some of the large-cap stocks, some kind of profit booking in front line scrips cannot be ruled out. Looking at levels, 11920-11950 is the immediate target zone on the upside. Any move above 11950 may see Nifty heading towards 12000-12100 levels. On the downside, 11750-11600 support zone. Expect mid-caps to outperform front line stocks in coming sessions.


What you could do: Investors can look out for accumulating quality mid-caps at lower levels and build the portfolio from medium- to long-term point of view. Stock specific action on some of the frontline counters like Asian Paints, BPCL, Jubilant Food have had a good run-up and may see some profit booking in coming sessions. Stocks like Indusind Bank, State Bank of India, Apollo Tyres appear good accumulation candidates at current levels. Among the mid-cap counters pharma scrips Aurobindo Pharma, Alembic Pharma are showing intermediate bottoming out signs and can see upside in short- to medium term. Among the chemical counters, Tata Chemicals and SRF are good buying candidates."
4,2019-11-04,Asian Paints,"The Director of KTC India, Gurudev Ahluwalia, in an interview with ET Panache, shared his favourite colour combinations and tips for looking dapper at work. The top boss also revealed his favourites for smart business casuals. 


Go-to style

“I prefer smart business casuals. I feel more free in them. My favourite colour combination is pink and grey. I love pink shirts and grey complements that.”


Making an impression

“My first suit was a tailormade, one which I wore for a wedding. The first time I felt I looked good in one was at my graduation. The pride from finishing my course and looking good merged together.”


Best memory

This was when my company won the National Tourism Award for the first time. I wore my finest suit to receive it.

Point of source

I always have Zegna or Diwan Saheb make my suits. Their quality and attention to detail is unmatched. One thing to remember when choosing a suit is how you would colour coordinate the shirt and suit. For special occasions, I use either my car cufflinks, the ones that have my initials, or my eight ball ones. Your cufflinks and belt should go hand-in-hand with your tie.


Suit care

I always pack my suits and hang them straight. I also dry clean them after two wears.

Favourite piece

A charcoal grey suit from Zegna. The material is light. My most experimental suit is a beige coloured one.

You can never go wrong with…

A black or grey suit. Both these colours are standard when it comes to men’s suits.

Wearing a suit makes me feel

Confident. The way you dress can influence the way you feel about yourself.

5,2019-11-05,Asian Paints,"Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, has a buy on Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Hero and Bajaj Auto among the two-wheelers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Markets maybe going higher but institutional investors want to sell. What is happening?It is a perfect storm. The largest selling was by the foreign institutions at 10,700. We are at new highs and now they have turned buyers and it is routine that mutual funds will go for occasional profit, but the real money is that you had to bell the cat when fear was at its highest and generally the adage holds. FIIs generally sell low and buy high. That is the nature of the beast. So, flows will only get stronger. There is some consolidation at 12,000 but I am very optimistic now on the broader market. It is just a matter of time that we get to new highs today or tomorrow and we start to overcome the hump of 12,000. 

Let us talk of 2020 and that is where the real impetus lies. Midcaps will be the star, like in 2017. Flows is a matter of just one or two days’ aberration. Like I said, the largest selling took place close to 10,700 and now the largest buying will come closer to 11,700 and beyond. 


Why do you say that FIIs always sell low and buy high? In last 15-20 years, FIIs have only been buying and large part of the free floating blue chip stocks is actually owned by foreign institutional investors. Best performing stocks like Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Infosys, HDFC Limited have been owned by FIIs.Yes, that's the way it works. What about the likes of YES Bank and DHFL and Indiabulls? They are also very well owned by FIIs. I am not challenging the nature of the animal. It is the way the fund flows flow. Take out the data and you will see FII selling is maximum at a time when the markets have bottomed and generally at a high they are buying. I am not challenging their consistency. 

ETF flows are generally traders of an uptick and downtick. So all I am saying is that the smart money has made money but we were one of the few who were recommending and now at 12,000 there will be some occasional profit booking by mutual funds but the undertone remains, equities are in a very-very strong bull market and that is now global case. I am extremely positive with an 18-month view. Short term, the earnings and some development on macros will play a little bit of a dampener over here. 


M&M is recalling a batch of XUV300 units to fix faulty suspension components. Sales figures were anyway not encouraging. In any case, with the transition going forward to BS-VI, etc, diesel is going to be phased out. We have had some positive commentary coming in from the management.I would trust the management, one of the oldest automakers which has kept its identity right from the original Sensex. In M&M, all declines are buying opportunity. Their tractor sale numbers have beaten estimate and there is no BS-IV to BS-VI in tractors. 

So, this small recall will give you an opportunity to buy the stock. I think it is just an aberration. We are very optimistic on M&M and select autos now. The best thing is that the worst performing sector in the last two months has seen the best gains. Maruti from Rs 5,500 has touched Rs 7,700 and Eicher has risen from Rs 16,000 to Rs 23,000. Let the diehard pessimists wait for declines. We still think autos will see a huge uptick in 2020 and we are not investing with a three-month view. I have a buy on Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Maruti, Eicher Motors and among the two-wheelers it is Hero and Bajaj Auto.


A lot of market men now seem to be sounding off warning signals and how some of these high PE quality names may not give you as much return in the next decade or so. Would you say there is reason to worry about the high PE multiple stocks, that what they have done in the last five years may not be replicated going forward?

You have a positive view on auto going forward in 2020, while rating agencies are mostly behind the curb. Moody’s has cut Motherson Sumi outlook to negative. How would you position yourself amongst auto ancillaries?We have been positive on Motherson when it was in that double digit and around 100 levels. We still think they will garner more market share in the European business. Their China foray will do well but it would be Exide, Motherson and Apollo Tyre. Now as a caveat, these stocks have moved 25% from where we have been calling to buy these stocks. So take it with a pinch of salt. They have already moved up. You will look for decline but please do a SIP for the next three months. You will be handsomely rewarded in early 2020. 

As for Motherson Sumi, we think credit is going to expand stronger and they do not seem to have too much leverage. It is a very pertinent brand and they have reduced their overall dependence on the Volkswagen model and spread their basket well. This should relatively be a much better performer in the near future.


YES Bank has got binding bids of $1.2 billion and some more interest has come from a clutch of investors and family offices.It appears the risk of survival for YES Bank is over. Would you chance your arm and would you buy YES Bank at current levels of 65-66?Well it is definitely a contrarian trade. The who’s who of foreign institutional investors owned this stock at Rs 300 plus and now the who’s who is bearish at Rs 50. There is a fair chance that by January, you could see at least triple digit on this stock. The worst seems to be over. How fast they raise money is a matter of time. 

They have got a binding bid till the end of this month, but I can see five other banks. Earlier, I had suggested five midcap banks where I see a lot of value the likes of Federal, DCB, IDFC First, PNB and Bank of Baroda. If you took those five, there is more visibility, there is more transparency and there are no issues of backlog. I would suggest make a basket of stocks and include YES Bank if you are a little bit of risk taker. But please include the other five banks where the risk reward is very favourable for at least a 30% to 40% upside by next Diwali.


What is the size of the universe you are bullish on?I mentioned those five banks. Largecaps like GAIL, ITC, IndusInd, Hero MotoCorp and L&T seem very well poised. I am also extremely positive on both Lupin and Sun in the pharma space. I think that is a dark horse. And if I want to put my money on some riskier assets, it is going to be the award of the L1 contracts now, there is a 7.5 lakh infrastructure contracts which are going to go, out of which 1.5 lakh goes onstream now which will include the likes of Dilip Buildcon, NBCC, NCC where inherently order inflows will start now. Execution will be a matter of time and we know the past because of the elections and so on there has been a hiatus on government order inflows and so on so that should be a very good traction play where valuations are extremely comforting over here."
6,2019-11-06,Asian Paints,"Individual investors, including high networth ones, are seeking comfort in blue chips as the broader market has turned volatile.

The total number of individual shareholders in Nifty50 constituent companies increased to 2.33 crore as of September end, 2019 from 2.23 crore on June 30 and 2.16 crore as of March 31,.

As options dried up elsewhere in the market, these investors went for heavy buying in select Nifty stocks, trying to make the most of a market rebound. That, even when valuations of many of these stocks hit sky-high levels.

For instance, Bajaj Finance hovered at a price-to-earnings multiple of 51 times and a price-to-book value of 3.10 times on November 1 after the scrip jumped 130 per cent since December end, 2017.

Nestle India traded at a P/E of 85.40 against the industry average of 49.20. Its price-to-book value stood at 15 times on November 1. The stock has rallied 93 per cent in 22 months to trade around Rs 7,700. Nestle became a part of Nifty on September 27, 2019.

Are these valuations justifiable?

Sunil Singhania-led Abakkus Asset Management in a recent report, titled ‘The Big Call-Bubble in Quality?’ said some of the quality stocks have now reached the bubble zone and could give zero or negative returns over the next few years.

With over 22 lakh small shareholders, 10 per cent of Nifty’s individual investors were holding Reliance Industries, the country’s biggest firm by market value. The stock jumped nearly 60 per cent to Rs 1,457 on November 1 from Rs 921.10 on December 29, 2017. The domestic equity market has remained highly volatile during this period following Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps for mutual funds, credit crisis in the NBFC sector, general elections, unfavourable announcements in the Union Budget 2019, bleak macroeconomic data and adverse global cues.

More than 10 lakh retail investors held SBI, Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares each as of September 30. Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares have cracked more than 50 per cent since December 2017, while country’s biggest lender by assets SBI has largely been flat.

ITC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, TCS, HDFC Bank and Coal India were among other players in which more than 6 lakh individuals held a stake at the end of September quarter, 2019.

IDBI Capital Markets in October maintained a ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490. Among other largecap players, Emkay Global Financial Services is ‘overweight’ on Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Grasim, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, RIL and United Breweries.


Tables: Number of individual shareholders in Nifty companies
 
 
Among other ‘expensive’ Nifty stocks, industry heavyweights TCS, HUL, RIL, Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Titan Company, ICICI Bank, Britannia, Axis Bank and UPL are among other stocks whose P/Es hovered above their respective industry average as of November 1, 2019.

The P/E ratio measures the relationship of a stock price with its earnings per share.

Analysts say stock investing is never only about financials and there are always some qualitative and future growth aspects to it. “Every valuation methodology has one underlying principle: the value paid today should be justifying future earnings potential,” Abakkus said in a report.

The domestic money manager listed HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Titan, Siemens, Berger Paints and ABB among 27 perceived high-quality expensive stocks, where profit after tax and revenue growth stood at a CAGR of 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, in past nine years (See Table).

“We don’t think anywhere in the world at any point of time, companies have traded at P/Es of 50-100 for 10-15 years stretch,” Abakkus said in the report.



It said penetration levels of most of the products these companies produce are much higher today than what they were 9-10 years back, and hence, the growth over the next few years should be lower than what it was over the past few years.

On the other hand, the number of investors in the BSE Smallcap index stocks remained almost stagnant in last three quarters at 4.23 crore.

The number of individual shareholders in BSE Midcap index companies increased marginally to 1.37 crore at the end of September quarter from 1.36 crore at the end of the preceding quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed on November 1. The figure stood at 1.34 crore on March 31, 2019.

Analysts see more comfort in the second-rung stocks, which have been beaten down badly over the past 22 months. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have cracked 17 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC, says midcap and smallcap stocks are clearly giving more relative valuation comfort and that is where you will end up making more money than the largecaps over the medium to long term.

“We have been suggesting that investors should increase a little bit of allocation towards midcap and smallcap stocks. Even in our portfolios, wherever the investment mandate allows, we have been buying midcaps and smallcaps from across sectors,” he told ETNOW during an interaction."
7,2019-11-08,Asian Paints,"While the rating agencies are talking about us today, the markets are looking ahead and talking about tomorrow, says Srinivasan Subramanian, Managing Director, Investment Banking, Axis Capital. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What do you make of the Moody’s downgrade of India’s outlook from stable to negative? India is in the same bracket as Bulgaria, Colombia, Indonesia and the Philippines?We all know that the rating agencies do their job a little later and look into the rear view mirror while markets are looking ahead. That is the fundamental difference.


So, you will not pay too much attention to what the rating agencies have to say?I am not being flippant and I am not downplaying the gravity of the situation in India now. The situation is reasonably dire as the first quarter GDP numbers came out. The second quarter numbers are going to be broadly in the same range as the first quarter numbers. However, what the market is looking at positively is that the government is responding at multiple levels across the entire spectrum and not just in terms of corporate rate cuts or what they announced the day before in terms of getting the real estate sector out of the jam. It seems the government is saying that the economy is important and they will focus on it. It may take a couple of quarters for the effect of all these measures to come through. While the rating agencies are talking about us today, the markets are talking about us tomorrow.


But in the near term, do you feel there are challenges or would you say that we are out of the woods, those August slows are way behind us and we will not get back to those kind of lows in the near term at least?The bottom has been made. It will take a couple of quarters for us to completely get out of the woods. On the consumption part of it, we would expect the auto companies to pass on some of the tax rate cuts they will benefit from. They have been having excellent ROEs over the longer term. On a core ROE basis, many of the companies are in the 25-30% plus. If they come to 20% levels, they can pass on further price cuts and that is going to help revive demand. The bottom is done. I do not think we will go further below this, however, it might take a couple of quarters for everything to gather stream.


The high frequency data is still mixed. I can argue about Amazon and Flipkart sales doing well, but car companies are saying they are feeling the heat because of the BS IV emission norms and there is a drop. Mall footfalls have been strong but apparel and food companies are complaining of a very muted Diwali. Which data point will tell us the true picture of where the economy, earnings and the markets are headed?The data point to look at is the sales across different industries. Flipkart alone does not give you the sense; neither does the Maruti sales alone give you the sense. In broader market you will see consumption staples moving up a little quicker and pricing falls come through.


How should one understand what is the right price to pay for some of these great businesses like a Bajaj Finance or Asian Paints or an HDFC Bank? These are the companies where growth is. They have done exceptionally well in a difficult environment. What is your view on this very popular debate on D-Street right now — value versus growth, quality vs premium?It is not an either- or scenario. The Indian markets, over a long period of time, has paid for growth. So growth at a reasonable price is what one should look at. It is easy to talk about HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance and say that they are very expensive. Bajaj Finance. post the fundraise is around seven times current year and probably six times in FY21. However, on a PE basis, both Bajaj Finance as well as HDFC Bank are at less than 1x PEG and that is an important element to look at it. Have these companies been able to grow their earnings and keep the quality of assets intact? I would not look at earnings for companies in the financial sector, if the asset quality was not good. But these two companies have been able to show that irrespective of market cycles, they have been able to contain risk and the asset quality to the best of their assets. So, I would look at that. 

Asian Paints on the other hand, on a PEG basis, is significantly higher than 1. Therefore I ask myself, if I invest in Asian Paints, what is my ROE (and not the company’s ROE) on the price I pay? I am starting to ask myself those questions and for us, the good quality private banks, companies like Bajaj Finance are all still in the buy zone, However, if you take a company like Asian Paints, Nestle or HUL, in the long term, does it give me an IRR at the level from where I invest or in the next five years-seven years even if it take a longer turn? 

Unless the revenue jump is going to be significantly larger, I might end up getting a single digit IRR and do I want to own companies, however, good are, if they have single digit IRRs? But in Bajaj and HDFC, I see double digit IRRs — 15, 17, 18% stock price IRRs over the next three, four, five and even a longer horizon.


Isn’t there a similar concern with some of the insurance plays as well? The growth and the price multiples that these stocks are trading at, are just not coinciding. Is it time to take chips off the table when it comes to insurance? There has been a very strong runup in the entire cluster and can these kind of growth multiples go on in the near term?The reason why the market is extremely positive about the insurance sector and I should caution you that right now — as Axis Capital we cover only SBI Life Insurance, we do not have coverage on the others — but on a generic basis, the runway for growth for the insurance sector is extremely strong over the next 10-15-20 years. The same is the case with asset management companies. 

On paper these look highly valued but is there is an extremely long runway for growth for these sectors and companies? Definitely, yes and that is the price which the market is willing to give for growth. The Indian market is a growth-oriented play, it is not necessarily a value play, For growth at a reasonable price, one should look at India.


What is your thought when it comes to the auto space? Would you prefer auto ancillaries or prefer to look at the sector in a different way?I would rather play auto through the auto ancillaries because there are some good quality auto ancillaries which are able to get an increasing wallet share. While auto growth is cyclical and will pick up after the disaster in the first six, eight months, I would rather play it through the ancillaries because I am still not sure over a five, seven-year period how the EV is going to impact the existing ones. The ancillaries that are not going to be impacted by the IC engines going off are the ones I would like to be working with."
9,2019-11-11,Asian Paints,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, bought select FMCG, public sector companies and pharma players with both hands in October as September quarter earnings season peaked.

The fund house purchased more than 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and India's largest hydropower producer NHPC.

ITC last month posted a 37.06 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,173.72 crore for September quarter, while NHPC is scheduled to announce its number later on Monday.

Stock brokers are positive on ITC. Anand Rathi Financial Services in a November 6 report said: “With strong operating cash flows, continuous capacity expansions across businesses and a healthy balance sheet, we continue to remain positive on ITC over medium to longer term perspective. We maintain a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 352 per share.”

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other top buys in October included SBI, Coal India, REC, Bajaj Corp, Bharti Infratel, Neyveli Lignite, Cipla, Ambuja Cement, Federal Bank, Texmaco Rail, Tata Steel, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, Firstsource Solutions and J Kumar Infraprojects, among others.

The fund house added 2.50 to 95 lakh additional shares of these companies last month.

SBI, the country’s biggest lender by assets, reported a nearly six-fold rise in Q2 profit at Rs 3,375.40 crore, supported by a partial stake sale in life insurance venture.

HDFC Securities earlier in November gave a ‘buy’ call to SBI with a target price of Rs 312.

HDFC AMC also added shares of infra players IRB Infra (18 lakh shares), Larsen and Toubro (11 lakh shares), Dilip Buildcon (6.51 lakh shares) and PNC Infratech (3.89 lakh shares). Besides, it further bought Sun Pharma (23 lakh shares), Grasim Industries (21 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (20 lakh shares), GAIL (19 lakh shares), Indian Hotels (19 lakh shares), Delta Corp (17 lakh shares), Kirloskar Ferrous (16 lakh shares) and Mishra Dhatu Nigam (16 lakh shares).

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore. The company had posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore in the same period last financial year.

From among large cap firms, the fund house added nearly 6 lakh shares of the InusInd Bank and 3.87 lakh shares of Bajaj Electricals. Financial firms including HDFC, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and YES Bank also drew some interest of the AMC.

It further increased its exposure in Bajaj Finance, UltraTech Cement, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Dr Reddy’s Labs, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, M&M, Titan, HCL Technology and Adani Ports.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced 3.78 per cent, or 1,461 points to 40,129 in October amid robust inflows by foreign institutional investors during the month. On the other hand, BSE Midcap and Smallcap index gained 5.39 per cent and 2.94 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month included over 1 crore shares each in Infosys, ICICI Bank, and BHEL.

It also sold over 10 lakh shares each in Edelweiss Financial, Reliance Industries, SAIL, Ashok Leyland, Adani Power, HPCL, BPCL and Vedanta during the month gone by, according to data available with Ace Mutual Fund.

Commenting on general market trend, Kashyap Pujara, head of research at Axis Capital in an interaction with ETNow said, “What we are seeing as a trend is that not only have midcap valuations have become extremely supportive but also we have seen participation of institutions on midcaps go down by 600 bps. It is going to be a U-shaped recovery for the midcaps. They tend to do well when GDP growth surprises and we will see GDP recovery going forward. As the recovery gets a bit broad-based, we will definitely see midcaps outperforming the largecaps over the next two to three years.”"
8,2019-11-11,Asian Paints,"By Ronojoy Mazumdar
Surrounded by all the doom and gloom around the Indian consumer sector, a paint producer got so much love from investors that it is now the most expensive stock in the country’s benchmark index.

Asian Paints Ltd.’s price-to-earnings ratio of 80.1 makes it the highest valued on the S&P BSE Sensex Index. The paint manufacturer has climbed 29 per cent in the last six months -- when the broader gauge has gained 6.5 per cent -- and has hit a record high in the past month.

Investors value its ability to churn out a record profit at a time when management at other consumer-oriented companies have warned of the impact from an economic slowdown. Of the 39 analysts who cover the stock, just four have the equivalent of a sell call. India’s paint industry, which Asian Paints dominates with around 40 per cent market share, has been viewed as a haven.

“Asian Paints is likely to keep rising” thanks in large part to double-digit growth in its volume of paint sales, said Abhijeet Kundu, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd., who estimated the increase to be 15 per cent-17 per cent in the last quarter. “There are very few companies that are growing at that kind of rate.”

Asian Paints’s stellar performance is a contrast to its consumer peers. Titan Co Ltd., the country’s biggest jeweler, plunged 10 per cent last week after nearly halving its growth guidance for the second half of the year. Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer at Hindustan Unilever Ltd., India’s biggest consumer goods company, said “the demand outlook is definitely challenging” in an earnings call last month.


Bloomberg
Consumer businesses are suffering in India as the economic expansion has slowed to a six-year low, exacerbated by a credit crunch amid a shadow banking crisis. Consumers have also tightened their belt as the unemployment rate hit the highest in 45 years. Even the recently concluded festival season doesn’t seem to have lifted spending by much, with shopkeepers reporting a poor show.

Defying weakening consumer confidence, Asian Paints’ net income has risen for two straight quarters to a record 8.3 billion rupees ($117 million) in the July-September period. Over the past 10 years, the firm has returned investors almost 1,000 per cent, the third highest among stocks on the Sensex index.

To be sure, the company is not totally immune to the economic malaise. Its revenue growth has stalled this year, and an unexpectedly long rainy season also crimped demand. Asian Paints didn’t respond to emails and calls requesting comment.

Analysts say the weakness in revenue is due to price cuts and popularity of cheaper products rather than a substantial decline in demand.

For bulls, the company also stands out on management track record. Its decades-old tradition of prioritizing corporate governance, rare in a country that’s still dominated by family-run businesses, is valued by long-term investors.

Asian Paints is one of the rare companies in India that has always had a genuinely independent board, Saurabh Mukherjea, co-founder and chief investment officer at Marcellus Investment Managers, wrote in his book “The Unusual Billionaires.”

“If you want to build an institution where changes in the external or internal environment don’t matter, it has to start at the top with great corporate governance,” said Rakshit Ranjan, co-founder and fund manager at Marcellus. “I don’t think you could find 10 other companies in the country with the same level of corporate governance as Asian Paints.”"
10,2019-11-13,Asian Paints,"You may credit it to experience, skill, timing or sheer luck, but the fact is India’s top money managers for high net worth individuals (HNIs) managed to generate robust alpha in last one year despite strong market volatility.

Emkay Lead PMS, a multicap strategy run by Emkay Investment Managers, stands out on top, having delivered 33.40 per cent return between November 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

With an equal weight of 6.70 per cent each, Bajaj Finance, Astral Poly Technik, Aarti Industries, Maruti Suzuki and Britannia Industries were among the top holdings of the Emkay Lead PMS.

Sectorwise, the fund had 33.50 weightage to BFSI and 26.80 per cent and 20.10 per cent to FMCG and building materials. It generated 3.90 per cent return in October against 3.95 per cent gain registered by BSE200 index.

Sameeksha Capital’s Equity Fund Strategy delivered 29.90 per cent to emerge second best for the calendar year to date, data compiled by PMSbazaar showed. The fund house had 43.10 per cent exposure to financials and 25.60 per cent to industrials.

“Our strategy is multi cap and bottom up,” says Bhavin Shah, Founder of Sameeksha Capital. “We try to understand the intrinsic value of companies based on long-term forecast of free cash flow in case of a non-financial company or excess return on equity in case of a financial company. We only buy when a company is available below its intrinsic value. We particularly find opportunity, when sell-side may not understand the dynamics and maybe a lot of mutual funds have not caught up with the story,” he said.

Aviation, IT and consumer discretionary had 9.10 per cent, 7.80 per cent and 4.90 per cent weightage, respectively, in the fund. However, Sameeksha’s Equity Fund declined marginally by 0.13 per cent in October, but generated more than 12 per cent in last three months.

Sanctum Wealth’s Indian Olympians (up 28.20 per cent), Motilal Oswal’s BOP (up 28.07 per cent), Varanium Capital Advisors (up 28 per cent) and Ambit Capital’s Coffee Can (up 27.80 per cent) were among other top gainers of last one year.

Sanctum's Indian Olympians is a largecap-focused, concentrated PMS strategy. It says the objective is to generate long-term capital growth by investing in a concentrated portfolio of largecap companies having sustainable performance.

“We are predominately invested in financials and consumers in our strategy. Reducing overweight position in consumer discretionary last year and adding exposure in information technology sector worked really well, while, we had very low to nil exposure to utilities, industrials, commodities and communication services which helped us save on any significant drawdown,” said Hemang Kapasi, Portfolio Manager, Equity Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth Management.

Motilal Oswal’s BOP is based on four themes, which are related to PM Narendra Modi’s reformist measures including affordable housing, doubling of farm income, GST opportunity and migration of value happening away from public sector banks to private sector banks and NBFCs.

“Of course, it has to fulfil our additional criteria of structural businesses having good and capable management which can double profits in 3-4 years with a decent margin of safety. We suggest investors to invest for at least three years in this product,” said Manish Sonthalia, Fund Manager.

As of October 30, the fund had 66.21 per cent exposure to companies from FMCG, retail, banks, insurance and agriculture.

Ambit’s Coffee Can, which delivered 4.90 per cent return in October, had Page Industries, Asian Paints, Berger paints and HDFC Bank among its top holdings with maximum 31 per cent exposure to the building material space.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced nearly 17 per cent between November 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019, while the BSE Midcap index stood almost flat and Smallcap index dipped 5.60 per cent.

“It’s no brainer for largecaps right now,” said Sonthalia. There is far bigger value in midcaps and smallcaps . Funds flow is choked in midcaps and smallcaps because of regulations, etc. Prices are undershooting fundamentals in this space,” he said.

IIFL’s Multicap PMS (27.27 per cent), Sundaram AMC’s SISOP (27.10 per cent), ASK’s India Select (25.50 per cent) and Nippon India (25.10 per cent) also gained over 25 per cent in the past 12 months.

Sundaram’s SISOP is a multicap portfolio. The fund’s factsheet says it holds companies that maintain over 12 per cent RoCE/ self-funded models, led by high visionary leadership.

The fund had over 50 per cent exposure to Bajaj Finance, Titan, HDFC Bank, AU Small Finance Bank and Eicher Motors as of October 31.

IIFL’s Multicap holds 15-20 companies which are business leaders, have strong managements, lower leverage with large margin of safety. The fund generated 3.27 per cent return in October and 10.47 per cent in last three months.

ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Larsen & Toubro, Procter & Gamble, Crompton Greaves, Asian Paints, Siemens, Aavas Financiers, Muthoot Finance, Tech Mahindra and Creditacces Grameen were among the fund’s top holdings as of October 31.

Newly formed Marcellus’s Consistent Compounders gave 22.50 per cent in just six months. The fund was formed in December last year.

“Marcellus remains bullish on HDFC Banks, Kotak Bank, the Asian Paints and Pidilite,” Saurabh Mukherjea, founder and chief investment officer, Marcellus Investment, said in his latest interaction with ETNow.

“It looks conservative to buy these companies, but I have seen in India over the last 10 years that if you consistently and sensibly invest in these franchises, you make anywhere between high teens to low 20s returns consistently. For someone like me managing other people’s money, that is a perfectly acceptable outcome,” he said."
13,2019-11-14,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: Halfway through the quarterly earnings season, corporate report cards have largely managed to beat Dalal Street’s expectations on the profitability front, with commentaries also turning positive. 

This has led to expectations that better times could be ahead in terms of earnings, and there could be more upgrades compared with downgrades on the earnings front.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) in a report pointed out that among the 92 MOFSL universe and 28 Nifty companies that have announced earnings till November 2, sales for the Nifty companies have degrown at (-) 0.6 per cent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, while Ebitda has expanded 9.1 per cent and net profit 12.4 per cent against MOFSL’s estimates of (-) 0.4 per cent, 1.7 per cent and (-) 1.8 per cent YoY growth, respectively.

Excluding corporate-focused private banks, Nifty sales, Ebitda and profit growth stood at (-) 1.6 per cent, 4 per cent and 11.3 per cent YoY versus MOFSL’s estimates of -1.2 per cent, (-) 0.6 per cent and (-) 0.7 per cent YoY, respectively.

Of the 28 Nifty companies that have announced results, 21 surpassed, three missed and three met MOFSL’s expectations on the profit front. On the Ebitda front, nine companies surpassed, 4 missed and 14 met expectations.


Companies that have surpassed expectations on the profit front included JSW Steel, SBI, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, ICICI Bank and ITC, among others.




Guest contributor and other agencies 
“While aggregate earnings have been in line with estimates, commentaries are turning incrementally positive, especially on the consumption front,” MOFSL said.

“The reduction in corporate tax has largely resulted in better-than-expected profit delivery and restricted the pace of earnings downgrades. This, combined with various government announcements to revive the troubled sectors, has helped revive market sentiment,” it added.

Corporate earnings so far have beat expectations, helping the market stay upbeat and scale record highs amid optimism on the US-China trade deal, analysts said.

 “It’s an exp ectation beat for sure,” said Vinod Karki, Head of Strategy at ICICI Securities. “If you look at the earnings upgrade-downgrade scenario, it would seem there are more upgrades or neutrals compared with downgrades. This means the consensus was more pessimistic about corporate earnings,” Karki said.

For the MOFSL universe, though, the earnings upgrade-downgrade ratio has been balanced so far, with 31 MOFSL universe companies witnessing upgrades of more than 3 per cent and 29 seeing downgrades of more than 3 per cent, indicating a revival in the earnings momentum.

“However, things are not as bad as consensus was expecting. This is reflecting in the market as well. The earnings season has helped support the market,” he said."

NSE Nifty failed to surpass the previous day’s high and consolidated for most part of the session near the 11,900 mark. The index has got stuck in a broader 11,785-12,034 band from the past 13 sessions and requires a decisive breakout on either side to commence the next leg of rally.

The headline index formed a small bodied candle followed by Doji candle on the daily scale, which indicates lack of participation. Now, the index has to continue to hold above 11,850 to witness an upmove towards 11,950 and then 12,000, while on the downside, major support is seen at 11,780.

17,2019-11-19,Asian Paints,"Mumbai: Shares of paint manufacturers have been shining bright even as the broader consumption sector reeled under an economic slowdown.

Strong earnings visibility and consistent performance have kept investor sentiment upbeat on the counter. However, the strong outperformance may now pause given the rich valuations, said analysts.

Stocks of the top paint companies outperformed the 30-share benchmark Sensex in the near term as well as long term, making them prominent wealth creators, and darling of asset managers.

Berger Paints and Asian Paints are currently trading around record high levels. Berger Paints has delivered 50.29 per cent return for last one year, 275 per cent for five years and 2,223 for last 10 years. Asian Paints has jumped 33.44 per cent for last one year, 162.14 per cent for last five and 947.81 per cent for last 10 years.

Kansai Nerolac and Akzo Nobel India have also strongly outperformed Sensex over these periods. Akzo Nobel shares hit a record high earlier this month.

In the comparable periods, the Sensex gained 14.84 per cent, 43.90 per cent and 134.66 per cent, respectively.

Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, says the paint industry has very high entry barriers, which is why the top three established players –Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Akzo Nobel – are able to hold profit margins and the return on capital very well.

“The fundamental distinction between the paint industry and other industries such as airlines is that entry is easy in the latter’s case and so new entrants have come in and wiped out profit margins for established players such as Jet Airways, Kingfisher and now IndiGo,” Mukherjea said.

“In contrast, paints as an industry is any incredibly hard space to enter, and the top three incumbents have ruled the roost for last 20 years. They have consistently high margins and return on capital,” he said.

“Paints firms allow incumbents to benefit from the growth they see in their top line,” he said.

The Indian paints sector, estimated to be a Rs 50,000 crore industry, is classified into two main segments: decorative - which accounts for 75 per cent of the industry’s value, and industrials, which accounts for the remaining 25 per cent.

The industry consists of a mix of both organised and unorganised players, but former holds a major share of the market. Till financial year 2017, organised players had a market share of about 65 per cent, which has risen to 80 per cent post GST implementation. The top players in the organised sector are Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Berger Paints and Akzo Nobel, which together account for about 68 per cent of the market share.

In financial year 2019, the paints industry expanded at the rate of 12 per cent in volume terms and 15 per cent in value terms.

In general, the growth of the paint industry depends on a number of factors such as disposable income in the hands of public, urbanisation, economic development, monsoon rains, raw material prices, growth in infrastructure and recovery in real estate and auto segments, Care Ratings said in a report.

Care said government initiatives towards infrastructural development, schemes like Housing for All and a reduction in GST from 28 per cent to 18 per cent on the paint industry are likely to boost the demand for paints.

“Post RERA and GST implementation, unorganised players are not able to continue the business at the same pace, and demand is shifting to organised players,” said Rusmik Oza, head of fundamental research at Kotak Securities.

“The repainting segment is not slowing down, even though there is a slowdown in the new homes segment. The companies have good pricing power. So, a hike in input prices is being passed on, and GST rates have also come down, which bodes well for the sectoral leaders,” Oza said.

He, however, raised concerns that the stocks may have run up a bit too much, making valuations stretched.

Asian Paints’ price-to-earnings ratio at 80.1 makes it the highest valued on the S&P BSE Sensex index, according to Bloomberg.

“The valuations are too rich and not sustainable, and there could be a phase when they could underperform in the near to medium term until the real estate sector and the economy pick up,” said Oza. “Their fortunes will still be linked to real estate sector,” he added."
19,2019-11-19,Asian Paints,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."
18,2019-11-19,Asian Paints,"One can incrementally add companies where earnings are depressed and where there is scope for a cyclical recovery in earnings and some potential for PE rerating and which over the next two-three years, could generate alpha, says Mahesh Patil, Co-CIO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Earnings are here, markets are here.Earnings or markets are always anticipating future earnings.


But they are not coming.This year again, earnings have been downgraded. We were looking at the beginning of the year but as you move forward, the base becomes favourable. So, the next year earnings looks very good. That fact is there are some challenges. In the last two quarters, we have seen the GDP growth slowdown materially and that has heard the earnings growth across though the tax cuts have given a kind of prop. Despite the downgrades, I think the earnings growth this year is still looking at around 15% growth, which is not bad.


But has the sentiment changed from where it was a month back? Two things happened on the global front. As a result of the easy monetary policy, globally a lot of central banks have become very dovish. Global liquidity and money supply have started to increase again after contracting last year when US was tapering. We have seen the US going into quantitative easing (QE). The European Union is again talking about fiscal stimulus. So, the money supply globally has improved and that is giving rise to a feeling that there will be a revival in global growth. 

That has changed globally and you can see money supply coming in. Money is flowing back into the emerging markets and in the last two months, FII flows have been positive. On the domestic side, there has clearly been a slowdown. It is doing its bit now. There is a clear acknowledgement of the slowdown and various efforts have been made to address the slowdown including recent tax cuts or attempts to address the NBFC problems by providing more liquidity into the system. All that is giving hope. Equity is not about the current but it is about looking into the future. While the current earnings are bad and economic growth print this quarter will probably be the slowest, still things will start to improve from here. 

Rate cuts are also being slowly transmitted. Altogether, the market is feeling the worse is behind us and things will start to improve.


But the higher frequency data is disappointing. Inflation was higher at 4.5% largely because of vegetable prices. The SBI economist is making a case that the GDP is going to go below 5%in Q2. Telecom is in absolute disarray, leading to stress in the banking sector. On top of that, auto companies are saying that the festive uptick is over.What is that data point which gives you confidence that look the worst is behind us and there is light at the end of the tunnel?The market probably is slightly ahead. If you look at what caused the slowdown in the economy in the last two quarters, a), the government’s spending contracted quite a bit in the last two quarters because of elections and that money started to flow back into the system. We have seen the government starting to make disbursals, so that supply from the government side is slowly starting to come in. 

The rural economy has been fairly slow. The commentary from some of these consumer names has seen a slowdown even for auto names. The excess monsoon has created some kind of a havoc because of the reiterating monsoon. This season might still not be that great but it bodes well for the rabi crop and the water levels are good. 


While the current earnings are bad and economic growth print this quarter will probably be the slowest, things will start to improve from here.-Mahesh Patil
The rural economy should start to look up in the second half. That would help consumption a bit. We have seen rate cuts of around 135 bps in this calendar year. The transmission has been slow and for a lot of companies and corporates who want to borrow, the rates are still fairly high, spreads are still very high. That will slowly start to normalise. 

The problem in the NBFC sector is still not over but enough remedial measures have been taken over there and so there is no contagion effect. Also the good news is that wherever there have been companies which have been faced problem because of the global risk appetite coming back, there is money coming back. We have seen lots of investors -- whether PE funds or other investors -- coming in and trying to buy some of these distressed assets.

Some of these NBFCs are facing challenges on the liability side. As investors come in, that should slowly settle down a bit. We will see interest rate transmission starting to happen and that will help to stimulate some amount of demand on the retail side. These are some of the positives.

I agree that we will not see a sharp recovery from here. It will be a very slow and gradual recovery. Market at this point are probably factoring most of the stuff and we might not see a big upside from here from a near-term perspective. But globally, because of the easy money and low interest rates, valuations are fairly high. So, market could get into consolidation phase.


What has the strategy been in Aditya Birla? Where have you increased or reduced your exposure in the last month or two?In the financial services sector, in the last four-five months we have increased our exposure in the insurance space because companies there have steady earnings visibility. Valuations have now again been kind of priced in but we see a steady compounding over there.


What is the right way to value an insurance company? When you look at the IRDA data, which talks about new premium selling, there is a decline from 20% to 7% for three months in a row. Is that temporary and if som then why are markets excited about insurance stocks?When you look at the headline numbers -- just like a top line in a company is the sales numbers -- it is showing weakness because ULIPs are linked to the market. They are probably not growing as much as the adjusted premium equivalent, APE data. We call it equivalent to a top line for a company that is showing some weakness. But what is happening in insurance is that the more profitable products which is more protection, the growth is fairly strong there. Since there is under-penetration in that category, a lot of companies are now focussing on driving protection products where the ROE is much higher. So, the mix is improving and as a result, the operating profit growth is much stronger while the sales top line growth is weaker. In a normal parlance, if you compare with any other company, that is what is looking good and it is a more distribution product on the protection side. 

As banks drive distribution, that is providing a steady growth to the earnings or the operating earnings for the insurance companies. That is how you value those companies not on the top line but on the ROEV.


You are bullish on telecom. What are you expecting with regards to the pricing environment and how things will shape up?It has reached a point where for a couple of players, the overall profitability has come to a level where because of the government intervention also, there is a scenario where operators are willing to take price hike. It is going to be a long wait though because each company would have different dynamics depending on how the operating ratios are and how the debt burden is. That will decide in the longer term which companies will survive. 

Having said that, clearly we have seen the players. The largest player who was aggressive in the market has taken some indirect price hikes and that has given room for the incumbents to also take price hikes and it looks like finally the price war has bottomed out. If somebody has to earn a decent return on capital, there is room for more price increases down the line and that would be positive for the sector in terms of news flow and in terms of growth, because we are not going to see more growth coming in because of increase in penetration. 

We have driven penetration sufficiently. Obviously people will migrate from 2G to 4G and so data customer base would increase and that will drive the increase in ARPU going forward. We are fairly constructive on this sector. IT has to be considered on a case-to-case basis, but directionally it looks like the EBITDA numbers and growth will improve from here.


Where have you reduced exposure?We had reduced exposure in metals earlier because though there is some kind of risk on that could see some upside in the metal space, but by and large overall global growth outlook will still remain fairly tepid. We were very positive on metals last year but we have reduced weightage over there. We are underweight that sector. 

We have slightly reduced weightage in the consumer side also because of the valuations, though there is nothing too wrong over there in terms of a slight slowdown in growth. However, though we are down on consumer staple, we are still positive on consumer discretionary, consumer durable names. During the early part of the year, we reduced our exposure in autos but we are re-evaluating that as we are seeing some kind of bottoming out in terms of volume de-growth that we have seen in the last one year.


You have clearly said you are sticking to the Nifty companies, which you still see as growth companies going forward. You are also selectively looking at midcaps but gradually over the next year or two. How should one read that?In the last one and a half years, the market rally has been fairly narrow. A few stocks have done well and so there is a valuation divergence across the largecaps and also within the midcap space. It is still early days. Unless the domestic economy gains significant traction, we would not see the mid and smallcap stocks really participate in a big way. So, it is not going to be across-the-board but picking selectively because of the marked lack of interest in small and midcap space. Quite a few stocks are available at reasonable valuations. It is more a stock specific valuation call, which we are looking to add in some of these stocks.

If we see the domestic recovery starting to play out, then there will be wider participation in the mid and smallcap space across the board. One should still stay away from companies with high leverage or promoter concerns. The risk in the mid and smallcaps still remains fairly high. We are not seeing a broad-based rally at least in the near term but if you take a three-year view and try to build up a portfolio, I think there are enough pockets of value in the small and midcap space.


Big companies like Bajaj Finance, HUL, Asian Paints have gained market share. Small companies have suffered cost of capital, inflation. Are markets telling you that these may be expensive companies but they are the only ones growing in this downturn? What is wrong in just sticking to those 10-15 stocks?I would agree. These companies will continue to do well in terms of earnings, but somewhere down the line, as the markets and the cycle with liquidity and risk comes back, you would tend to move down the spectrum and other companies where multiples, earnings are depressed because of the slowdown that we have seen. 

You are looking at companies where you could see big returns over the medium to long term, companies where there is a potential of high earnings growth and PE rerating. Some of these larger companies have steady earnings growth. Because the earnings have been right and PE multiples are fair, there is no PE rerating scope. They will continue to grow at the pace of earnings which would be around 10-12-13-14%. It is not a time to move out from some of the large names, we are still having them in the portfolio. 

Incrementally one can add companies where earnings are depressed and where you could see a cyclical recovery or otherwise in earnings and some potential for PE rerating and over the next two-three years, these could generate alpha."
16,2019-11-19,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: The average stipend offered to students of Indian Institute of Management Indore by companies offering summer internships this year stands at Rs 1.68 lakh per month, up 12% from Rs 1.5 lakh last year, officials said.

Female students on an average have received 24% higher stipend than their male counterparts in the summer internship placements, officials said. The highest stipend offered was Rs 4 lakh, the same as the previous year.

IIM Indore has the biggest batch strength of 589 students in the class of 2021, including 258, or 44%, girls.

“Placing the largest number of students across all IIMs for the summers is a big task,” said Himanshu Rai, director of IIM Indore. “Our students are among the brightest in the world, and the summer placement offers are a testimony to that.”

More than 160 recruiters, including Amazon, Google, Boston Consulting Group, Ernst & Young, Deloitte USI, Hindustan Unilever, Aditya Birla Group, Goldman Sachs, and OLX participated in the placement process this year where 21% of the batch received offers for profiles in analytics and ecommerce domain.

There were 39 companies visiting the campus for the first time, who including Adani Group, Capgemini (ELITE), Diageo, GEP Consulting, Microsoft, Reckitt Benckiser, Salesforce, Walmart Labs and Xiaomi.

Companies offering roles in analytics and ecommerce included Blackbuck, Cisco, Media.net, Salesforce, Udaan and Walmart Labs.

Prominent recruiters in the consulting domain this year included Avalon Consulting, Bain Capability Network and PwC.

In the sales and marketing domain, companies like Aditya Birla Fashion Retail, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, Dabur, and ITC participated."
22,2019-11-20,Asian Paints,"SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give at least a 30% upside from present prices, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

On Aviation StocksThere has been a relative slowdown of the economy but a lot of it is getting addressed. The cost of money is definitely headed lower which means ease in travel and very lucrative rates maybe a thing of the past. Rates may start to head up. We have a buy on both the stocks on declines. There is regular bouts of profit booking which comes when IndiGo was Rs 1m750 and SpiceJet was Rs 145 . But again, these are the two listed companies. Personally, I prefer to travel by Vistara.

But on declines, this is a very consumer centric industry where 2020 should bode extremely well, given that we are very optimistic on the return of the consumer, the economy doing well and aviation as a conduit for that. 


On Telecom
Our clients have been laughing their way to the bank. We have been long on Bharti and Reliance as a disclosure and we are riding it. We think there is going to be a short term bout of profit booking which may last for two-three days but this is one sector which is going to bely most expectations. Most of the underpinnings are over. ARPUs are going to rise and we think there could be a fair package for both Vodafone and Bharti from the government.

We will work on that but we definitely think the government is going to give some relief. On the consumption side, you can see that we have been saying that ARPUs may have bottomed out and we thought that data is definitely going to get more expensive. A disclosure, Bharti, Reliance are two of our top picks. They continue to be in our portfolio and this week has been exceptionally strong for all investors who have held those shares on our account.

We are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months.-Sanjiv Bhasin


On PSU Banks
The weaker or the most hated sectors -- telecom and PSU banks are bouncing back. The Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel is a path breaking decision and the SBI chairman, smaller banks have said that write backs will be a part of the course as most of the provisioning is done. So, I am extremely positive on PSU banks. There is a Rs 70,000 crore of recapitalisation, which means almost 5.5 lakh crore of book will grow in the next three years.

We think you cannot go wrong given that yields are softening. They are awash with cash and they are going to definitely start the lending cycle on the retail side. So SBI continues to be our top pick. Along with that, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give you at least a 30% upside from present prices. 2020 may actually see PSU banks lead from the front


On Divestment 
The divestment candidates like Concor, BPCL & SCI have moved up very smartly.We think this is going to be a path breaking reform by the government. Strategic selloff last happened in 1999 and after that there has been a total hiatus. The government has decided that they have no business to be in business and that is a very positive move.

BPCL, Concor and SCI should set the cat amongst the pigeons. We are extremely positive. I think the valuations they will get will also be fairly impressive, given that all three businesses are monopolies. We have to see in the next three months, how fast the divestment takes place. The finance minister has already indicated that they should be done with it before March and it should see re-rating of the entire PSU basket. 

The government has the intension to bring down their holding to 26% in a lot of other companies like IOC and BHEL. These are all very good entry points because the unlocking of value will be huge as and when it takes place.


On Pharma Stocks
Pharma has been a very big underperformer. This is just about time where smart money is seeing rotation. By the way, pharma numbers, particularly the likes of Glenmark were very smart looking and now people have realised that pharma has consolidated enough and the worries of the FDA issues are now going to be on the backburner. Plus, generic pricing in the US may be back and they are spreading in geographies across the world. The local businesses for all of them have looked up so we are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months. 2020 could see pharma hugely outperform as a sector.


On Trends in Consumption SpaceThere are three parts. Firstly, these stocks have been the prime of most of the mutual fund portfolios. Nestle, Lever, Colgate and Asian Paints have taken the cake, even though numbers were not that sparkling. But they have been very expensive stocks and have been getting more expensive. For us, the game changer is these two three events which the government has done -- corporate tax cut, strategic disinvestment. The pass through effect of money where the mistrust is now getting allayed and you should see much easier pass through of money from banks as PSU banks start to lend very actively on all three -- discretionary, staples and durables. 

The broader basket will definitely outperform. We are not making a case for Nestle or Lever at these prices. We think in fact if the Nifty sustains over 12,000 and if we hit new highs which is just round the corner, then the broader market consumption should do extremely well. That means discretionaries like auto and select other FMCG stocks could be outperformers in 2020."
21,2019-11-20,Asian Paints,"The first requirement to spot tomorrow’s big gainers is an ability to identify the right industry in times of distress. When stocks from across midcap and smallcap segments are witnessing heavy selling, select counters from certain niche segments are hovering at record high levels despite the economic slowdown.

These stocks come from unusual sectors such as insurance, asset management, paints, footwear, retailers and cable sectors.

Starting with the insurance industry, shares of heavyweights like ICICI Prudential Life, HDFC Life, ICICI Lombard General Insurance and SBI Life scaled their record high levels over the past fortnight.

What is driving the sector?

Shyamsunder Bhat, Chief Investment Officer, Exide Life Insurance, says unlike NBFCs or banks, the insurance sector does not have NPA, liquidity or solvency issues. Almost all insurers are well-capitalised and with reasonably comfortable solvency ratios.

“This is one of the reasons we have seen investors come to the insurance sector. Investors are appreciating the value that this sector offers, which is what is reflected in these multiples,” he told ETMarkets.com.

In the asset management space, HDFC AMC and Reliance Nippon have proved their mettle. Both HDFC AMC and Reliance Nippon scaled fresh all-time highs of Rs 3,770 and Rs 378.10 on November 14.

“A very big trend is playing out in the insurance and AMC space. It has all the makings of a very large trend,” Atul Suri, Marathon Trend-PMS, told ETNow.

MSCI, the world’s biggest index compiler, last month added Berger Paints, HDFC Asset Management, ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life to its India index.

Paint companies Akzo Nobel (Rs 2,275), Asian Paints (Rs 1,833) and Berger Paints (Rs 534) are doing a colourful job in financial portfolios with their recent record performance.

The paint industry consists a mix of both organised and unorganised players, but the organised players occupy a major share of the market amid the ongoing liquidity crunch and slowdown.

“Post RERA and GST implementation, unorganised players are not able to continue their business at the same pace, and demand is shifting to organised players. The repainting segment is not slowing down, even though there is a slowdown in the new homes segment. These companies have good pricing power. So, the rise in input cost is being passed on, and GST rates have come down, which bode well for the sectoral leaders,” said Rusmik Oza, head of fundamental research at Kotak Securities.

With a 50 per cent year-to-date rally, Relaxo and Bata are buzzing on Dalal Street with their strong outperformance against the benchmark Sensex, which advanced 11 per cent during this period.

Footwear players are planning to strengthen their presence in the domestic market. Bata India in October said it would make its presence stronger by adding 500 stores in next five years, focusing mainly on smaller markets. The company recently reported a 30 per cent YoY rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 71.30 crore for the September quarter.

Dolat Capital, which has an ‘Accumulate’ rating on Relaxo, believes the company is likely to increase its distribution reach in southern and western markets going ahead.

“Store addition and premiumisation are likely to accelerate growth. We continue to believe that the company has attractive product offerings and has the ability to premiumise portfolio at the lower end of the pyramid,” it said in a report on November 5.

Shares of Polycab India and KEI Industries are trading around their all-time levels in the cable sector. Financial stability and demand for their products seem to be key to their success. Polycab posted 115 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 191.82 crore in Q2FY20 over RS 89.20 crore reported for Q2FY19. KEI’s net profit jumped 83 per cent YoY to Rs 76.02 crore during the quarter under review.

Brokerage firm Angel Broking has a ‘hold’ rating on KEI with a target price of Rs 661. The brokerage expects KEI to report net revenue of around 18 per cent CAGR at Rs 5,872 crore during FY2019-21E mainly due to higher order book execution in the EPC segment, growth in EHV business and higher exports.

On the bottomline front, Angel Broking foresees around 29 per cent CAGR to Rs 300 crore over the same period on the back of strong volume growth.

Phillip Capital says Polycab’s product categories, strong business model, superior reach and brand recall offer investment comfort – especially in a competitive economic environment.

“Over the next two years, RoCE and RoE will be 24 per cent and 18 per cent, and operating cash flow will be Rs 760 crore. Currently, we expect earnings growth of 29 per cent CAGR over FY19-21,” it said.

Shares of Trent and Avenue Supermarts are also in demand.

Edelweiss Securities says Trent provides an opportunity to invest in four strong brands – Westside, Zudio, Star Bazaar and Zara. “Rolling forward, we retain 12-months’ forward price-to-equity (PE) multiple of 50 times to Westside, 35 times to Zara and price/sales of 1.5 times to Star Bazaar to arrive at a target price of Rs 590,” the brokerage said. Trent traded at Rs 500 on November 15.

All the above-mentioned stocks scaled their new highs between October 30 and November 15."
20,2019-11-20,Asian Paints,"We are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Mukherjea also says getting high teens to low 20s returns consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


There is every reason why one should not buy telecom stocks. In the next 10 minutes, we can find 15 reasons why one should not buy telecom stocks yet Bharti is at a 52-week high. What is going on?I guess there are probably enough people out there who are hoping that that the industry consolidates around two players and Bharti benefits from that from being one of those two players. I do not see any other logical way to understand this other than the fact that a number of investors out there are making a punt that they are in a two-player industry. Bharti will get its fair share of spoils. I cannot give you anything more substantive than that, I am afraid.


Can we imagine our life without power? The answer to that is no. But have shareholders of power companies made money? The answer is “no,” at least in India. Do you think telecom is like power? You need telecom but for minority shareholders, telecom companies will struggle now?Most regulated industries in India are similar -- whether you look at airlines, telecoms, power, infrastructure or real estate. Wherever the regulatory construct is such that the regulator or the government calls the shorts in terms of who gets in, who stays out and what are the rules of the game, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make any money. That is the rule of thumb I followed in my 11 years in India -- stay away from sectors where the government or the regulator determines the rules of engagement. In such a sector, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make money be that telecom, power, real estate or airlines.


ETNOW sources seem to be indicating that today the cabinet is going to decide on disinvestment in BPCL, Concor and SCI. Earlier also, the finance minister had indicated that disinvestment process is going to come to a close and she hopes to close in on that by the financial year end. Would you say though that the best is already in the price somewhat?I am not so sure how easy it will be to make money from high quality privatisation plays such as BPCL and Concor. Both are actually very good quality assets but I am not so sure how easy it will be for minority shareholders to make a punt on them and make money. What is more encouraging, what is more upbeat for the generally is that the government is clearly saying that in the next 6-8 months, we will move towards privatisation or large stake sales. That is probably the most bullish step forward towards privatisation we have seen in 14-15 years. The last major privatisation was made by NDA-1, a good 20 years ago. Beyond the stock specifics, this momentum in selling class assets is very encouraging for the market as a whole.


Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real.-Saurabh Mukherjea


What is the overarching theme that you are going with in the current environment? Is it domestic focussed names, is it valuation? Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real. 

Secondly, we look for companies where the products are as close as is possible to be essential for day-to-day life in India. We are trying to avoid companies where the product or the purchase is discretionary in nature. 

Third thing is barriers to entry. Clean accounts, essential products are very good to have but you need to have barriers to entry to make sure competition does not come and take your profits away. And when we find such companies we go and buy as proactively as we can without losing sleep on what was the PE multiple yesterday morning, what it will be tomorrow morning. We found in India around 20 such stocks; half are already in our portfolio and hopefully in the next year or so, we might find a couple of more stocks like this. 

As and when the economic environment becomes less hostile, we might become a little bit more adventurous in our stock picking. Over the last couple of years, it has been very tightly defined mantra, clean accounts, essential products, very high barriers to entry.


Sunil Singhania said buying a good business and buying a good stock are two different things. D-Mart is a great company, Indigo is a great company, a classic compounder which you own. Something like Aventis is a great company but if you are buying them at PE multiples of 50, 60, 70, the chances of making double digit returns for next three years are very rare. Do you think those classic compounders which you like and which are based on previous history, return ratios, ROE and ROC, they are outpriced right now?Sunil Singhania is a long-standing a guru, a friend, I have learnt from him in the years to come and we hope to learn a lot from him in the years to come. I learnt from him two years ago as to how to think about setting up an independent asset management business. Sunil is saying if you try to do what we are doing in India and try to do this in America, you will get slaughtered. 

In most efficient markets like the UK, USA, Germany and Japan, it is very difficult to maintain return on capital at 40% or even 30% over an extended period of time. Most glamorous well known American or Japanese firms will have return on capital of barely 15%. If they get to 15%, they will be celebrated on TV channels in America, on the covers of magazines and so on. 

Our country is unique amongst the world’s 10 largest economies in that we are the only large economy which has around 20-25 companies whose ROC is a million miles above their cost to capital for decades on end. When we say million miles, I am saying 40% ROC for a very extended period of time. If you can keep return on capital so far above the cost to capital for an extended period of time, it gives you a mountain of free cash flow and if you keep reinvesting that money in the business (as we have seen in India over the last five, 10, 20 years and even last year), you get a very high chance of keeping earnings growth around 20%-25% mark.

If we take one example of the several in our portfolio, this is exactly what Asian Paints has done for the last 30 years. Asian Paints 20 years ago was trading at exactly the same PE multiple. Asian Paints over the last 20 years has given close to 100 times returns. Nestle 20 years ago was trading at pretty close to the same multiple. Nestle over the last 20 years has given close to 80-90 times your money back. I do not know about the next three weeks or next three months, but I am pretty confident that if we carry on focussing on this type of company with very high barriers to entry, with return on capital being well above the cost to capital, we chug back plenty of free cash flow into the business. Whether you are Asian Paints, Pidilite or Dr Lal Path Labs, you reinvest the free cash flow back into the business. 

In a poor country like ours, the growth potential is immense. Even in a downturn, you are seeing these companies -- Asian Paints, Dr Lal Path Labs and even Page Industries -- which is a big part of our portfolio, give you volume growth between 9% and 19%. That gives you a sense of how far we have to go in terms of development to our country. 

PE-based investing has a big place in everybody’s portfolio. In the west, PE-based investing, value investing as it is better known as, is the definitive way to manage money by and large. It works in India as well. There is a small set of companies in our country which are able to keep return on capital very high and thus earnings growth is very high and if there you invest even at 100 times PE shown over the last three years and in my books I have shown over the last 20 years you still make very healthy returns, high teens, low 20s returns. 

If I make high teens, low 20s returns for our clients consistently, that is a pretty decent outcome for them. We are not claiming we can do 30-40% return by timing the market or by getting the PE multiples right, but high teens to low 20s consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India.


You are completely staying away from power, metals, real estate pockets. If we do see an overall pullback which we have already started to see when it comes to the market regardless of the fundamentals or growth indicators, do you see more participation across the board?The most interesting one will be auto and as we all know October has been a pretty decent month for the auto sector where everybody is trying to figure out whether October is the beginning of the auto revival or whether it is a flash in the pan. What we have started to do in some of our client’s portfolio is, selectively buy one of the two-wheeler companies. I am not at liberty to disclose the name but we are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios not because we expect the two-wheeler revival to have begun a month ago and from now on it will grow, but given the quality of the franchise, the high ROCs, high cash generation the sheer quality of the corporate governance, we felt that the two-wheeler company was just too deliciously cheap to be ignored. 

We will see if the two-wheeler company carries on showing us that even with low volume growth they can hold up their business, you might buy some more. I am not so sure cars and trucks are going to recover quite as quickly as two-wheelers. I think two-wheelers are likely to recover quicker than cars and trucks because their ticket sizes or purchase are smaller. But this is probably the biggest sector if one wanted to play a potential economic recovery. More than cement, steel or real estate, two-wheelers and the auto would be the industry to look at. There are several good auto ancillaries which are absolutely smashed in terms of valuation. Again, these are cash generative companies with strong balance sheets. So, auto, auto ancillaries would be my favourite play on economic recovery as and when we get visibility on that."
23,2019-11-21,Asian Paints,"One-off deferred tax gain supported bottom lines for much of India Inc during the September quarter. But that should not take away credit from those which managed to grow bottom lines on the strength of top line expansion.

September quarter earnings season broadly turned out to be better than expected, which took BSE benchmark Sensex to its record high mark. Sensex scaled a fresh all-time high of 40,676 amid the ongoing earnings season.

This was one of the better earnings seasons anytime in last three or four years, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Adviser.

“A number of companies have beaten Street expectations. I am evening out the earnings growth because of the tax adjustments which a lot of companies have done because we had the tax cuts in the middle of the quarter. A lot of companies adjusted that in the second quarter,” he said.

For instance, despite a drop in top line, Tata Steel reported a 6 per cent increase in consolidated net for the quarter at Rs 3,302 crore, thanks to the new tax regime.

JSW Steel posted 22 per cent rise in consolidated net profit, mainly due to a writeback of deferred taxes and accrued incentives from previous years. But the company’s revenue from operations actually declined 18.5 per cent to Rs 17,572 crore from Rs 21,552 crore a year ago.

But Mavani also points out that going by pre-tax profit or Ebitda number, a large number of companies also managed to grow on their own, actually showing margin expansions that beat Street expectations.

Data available with Ace Equity on November 6 showed 71 firms listed on BSE as largecap, midcap or smallcap reported over 100 per cent rise in net profit in Q2.

Even some of them like Dr Reddy’s Lab reported over 100 per cent expansion in net profit despite a 25 per cent rise in Q2 revenue. Others like SBI reported manifold rise in bottom line due to a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

SBI posted nearly six-fold rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter, supported by a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

Bottomline of the public sector lender grew 485 per cent to Rs 3,375 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 576 crore in the same period last year. Gujarat Gas, GSK Pharma, Indian Bank, Jindal Saw, NIIT, JK Tyre, Deepak Nitrite, Motilal Oswal Finanical Services, Bank of Maharasthtra and Avani Feeds were among other major players that reported over 100 per cent profit growth in Q2.



Besides one-time tax gains, other income, improving asset quality and corporate-related actions supported bottom lines of select companies during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services reported 3,297 per cent profit growth at Rs 142.3 crore in September quarter against a Rs 4.5 crore in the year-ago period, while Indian Bank reported Rs 359 crore profit on increasing income and improving asset quality by controlling loan slippages and other factors, a top bank official said.

A sharp drop in provisions for loan writeoffs in the home finance arm during the quarter supported the bottom line of the Mumbai-based firm. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said a strong momentum was seen in the market is due to healthy Q2 earnings from big corporates. “This positivity is likely to stay in the short to medium term as concerns of the market are fading with tax cut,” he said.

Out of top 71, five players reported over 100 per cent sales growth, 25 others posted 10 to 70 per cent increase sales. Others reported up to 10 per cent rise or fall in net sales during the quarter.

Some 73 firms from across sectors such as consumer food, TV broadcasting, banking, NBFC, plastic products, power generation and engineering, among others, reported 50 to 100 per cent bottom line expansion.

The list included players like Multi Commodity Exchange, Bandhan Bank, SRF, GTPL Hathaway, Kukuyo Camlin, Varun Beverages, EIH, Petronet LNG, PSP Projects, Torrent Power, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, UltraTech Cement and Aarti Drugs.



“Corporate earnings have been subdued or below expectations over the past few years. However, we are starting to see a revival in corporate earnings growth, and expect it to pick up pace from H2FY20. This will help to drive the markets going forward,” said Sampath Reddy, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.

He said the recent corporate tax cut would provide a boost to corporate earnings over time. “We believe a bottom-up research-oriented process, coupled with growth at reasonable price (GARP) approach will help deliver superior returns over the long term,” he said."
24,2019-11-22,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Extending losses for the second straight session, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty slipped on Friday dragged mainly by IT and telecom stocks as investors exercised caution and avoided long positions amid mixed global cues.

Analyst said that fall in IT stocks amid reports of changes in US work visa requirements aimed at protecting American workers fuelled the overall weakness in the market. Also, concerns over delay in US –China trade deal and Fed minutes fueled negativity in global markets.

Analysts said that market participants are waiting for fresh triggers on developments around the US-China trade deal and India’s July-September GDP data due next week. The GDP data which is due on 29 November is likely to indicate whether the slowdown in the Indian economy has deepened. Analysts expect markets to remain rangebound in coming days and feel midcap stocks may see more traction.

Global markets
On the global front, Asian shares made a slight recovery on Friday after hitting three-week lows on the previous day, with gains limited by investors' uncertainty over chances of US-China striking a preliminary deal soon to end their trade war.

European stocks too opened on a positive note in morning trade after a bout of selling this week on US-China trade deal worries."

IPO update: CSB Bank sails on Day 1
Kerala-based CSB Bank’s IPO got fully subscribed on the first day of bidding on Friday. The initial public offering (IPO) received bids for 1,20,87,450 shares against the total issue size of 1,15,54,987 shares, reflecting 1.05 times subscription, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange. The quota reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed 10 per cent, while that for retail investors was subscribed 5.60 times.
In another development from the IPO-mart, realty firm Puranik Builders has filed fresh papers with markets regulator Sebi to raise an estimated Rs 1,000 crore through its initial share-sale.


Telecom stocks ring louder
With a 7.85 per cent rally, the BSE Telecom index emerged the biggest gainer on the exchange. It was followed by Healthcare (up 3.06 per cent), Power (up 0.97 per cent), Metal (up 0.82 per cent) and Bankex (up 0.16 per cent). On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”


Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.

RIL nears Rs 10 lakh cr valuation
The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark helped by the continuous rise in its share price. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike. With a market value of Rs 9.80 lakh crore, share of the company signed off the week with gains of over 5 per cent at Rs 1,546."
0,2019-12-03,Asian Paints,"Investors’ interest is likely to sustain in companies such as Varun Beverages, Endurance, Amara Raja, Bata, PVR, Gujarat Gas, and Asian Paints that have been able to improve financial performance in the second quarter despite the challenges in the economy. These companies were successful in reporting better business growth than their respective sector averages.

Varun Beverages, one of the largest bottlers of Pepsi, reported 60 per cent growth year-on-year in volume at 124 million cases in the September quarter helped by recent acquisition and growth in the rural market following greater availability of electricity.

Amara Raja Batteries, a supplier of batteries to auto companies, reported 24 per cent growth in the operating profit following a double digit revenue growth from the replacement market, which offset the pressure on earnings from sales to automakers. Also, a change in revenue mix in favour of high value products resulted in 370 basis points (bps) margin expansion to 17.2 per cent.

Endurance Technologies, an auto ancillary company, outperformed the industry growth on account of increasing volume from new automakers, 10 per cent growth in the replacement market and increasing content per vehicle from the existing customers.

India’s largest paints maker Asian Paints had double digit volume growth in seven quarter in a row after the company enhanced focus on low margin, low end products. It has recently launched an ultra-economy emulsion which is priced 20-25 per cent below its regular economy emulsion to maximise benefit of the cut in the GST rate.

Domestic and foreign investors have increased holding in these companies. For instance, Sundaram MF, Blackrock and William Blair raised holdings in Varun Beverages. UTI Asset Management and L&T MF added some of these companies in their portfolios, according to Bloomberg data.

5,2019-12-04,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty reversed losses during the last hour of trade to end higher in a volatile session on Wednesday, supported by IT and bank stocks after reports suggested that US and China were moving closer to a phase-one trade deal despite tensions over Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

Dalal Street, which was trading on a negative note, reversed course after reports said that the US and China were closer to a trade deal.

The US and China are moving closer to agreeing on the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in a phase-one trade deal despite tensions over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, Bloomberg reported quoting sources.

Earlier in the day, markets fluctuated between gains and losses as investors avoided long positions amid tepid global cues.

Market participants also remained cautious ahead of ahead of RBI's monetary policy outcome, which is due on Thursday.

Analysts said that market participants are waiting for fresh triggers on both domestic and global fronts for more clues on the direction of the market. Investor sentiment in the near term is likely to remain muted due to weak macro data. But any developments around the US-China trade deal and RBI monetary policy outcome may influence market mood in the coming days.

Tata Motors was among the top gainers on BSE gaining over 7 per cent after its Jaguar Land Rover sales in the US climbed 6 per cent year-on-year in November and 19 per cent month-on-month.

Meanwhile, the government on Wednesday approved the launch of India’s first corporate bond ETF (exchange traded fund), which will allow retail investors to participate in India’s bond market. The Bharat Bond ETF aims to provide funds to central public sector undertakings and other government organisation through bond issues. They will have two maturity periods -- three and ten years. The ETF will track an underlying index on risk-replication basis.

In terms of index contribution, ICICI Bank, Infosys, TCS and Tata Motors were chart toppers while RIL, L&T, HDFC Bank and ITC were the top drags on Sensex.


Expert Take
“Market turned positive supported by moderate growth in India Service PMI data for November and optimism over RBI monetary policy. RBI is likely to give more focus on economic development as benign oil prices deliver headroom for further monetary action which provide cushion for private spending. The early signs of recovery in services sector provided impetus for IT index to outperform while prevailing positivity on rate sensitive stocks supported a broad based rally,” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

3,2019-12-04,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: If a low price-to-earnings (PE) ration gives you comfort while buying stocks, market performance this year might puzzle you.

Investors are chasing high PE stocks in recent times, pushing stock prices higher, thanks to growth visibility and next-to-nil governance issues.

And analysts are not worried. They expect many of these performing counters to sustain their high valuations. 

This was visible in the top gainers of BSE200 basket this year. Data showed 32 BSE200 stocks jumped between 30 and 125 per cent this calendar despite having an average PE of 50. Twenty-three of the 32 stocks have trailing 12-month PEs of 40 or more, data compiled from corporate database Ace Equity suggests. 

Info Edge, which commands a PE of 84, has jumped 74.41 per cent this calendar. Drug maker Abbott India has climbed 67.75 per cent even at a PE of 51.1. In case of Info Edge, the industry average PE stands at 53.3, AceEquity data suggests. In the case of Abbott India, the industry PE is 26.5.

JM Financial said it is positive on the Info Edge as the core businesses have delivered superior performance consistently. It noted that the business of 99acres reported over 20 per cent growth in billings in September quarter, even in a weak underlying market. The brokerage sees more upside on the stock.

In case of Abbott, ICICIdirect cited the drugmaker’s strong growth track in power brands and capability of new launches on a fairly consistent basis – 100 products in the last 10 years – to justify a ‘buy’ rating.

It noted that the company has maintained dividend payout of 35 per cent in the past four years, with cash/share of Rs 793 in FY19.

Berger Paints and Bajaj Finance have soared 50 per cent each this calendar. While Bajaj Finance commands a PE of 48 times, Berger Paints enjoys a PE of 77. The paint's industry PE currently stands at 64.1. For Bajaj Finance, the industry PE is 25.3.

Post its Q2 results, JP Morgan said Bajaj Finance’s numbers are positive. It said while it took note of the punchy valuation, it felt they can sustain as the NBFC continues to deliver sector-beating loan and EPS growth and ROEs.

The same is not the case with Berger Paints. Emkay Global said while it sees good earnings visibility, valuations at 58 times FY21E EPS are expensive and the stock’s 15 per cent premium over Asian Paints looks unjustified.

Whirlpool of India, which has a PE of 56.4, has surged 56 per cent. Analysts are positive on this stock, but sees limited upside after the recent jump.

Among others, Bata India, Nestle India and Varun Beverages are some other high PE stocks that have performed well this year. 

Bata’s Q2 numbers showed margin improvement on a YoY basis for the 14th successive quarter.

“Although near-term valuation seems to have peaked, the company is well-placed in the sector, which has a big opportunity size. We believe it can be a good buy for the long term,” Edelweiss Professional Research said in a note.

Steward & Mackertich has initiated coverage on Varun Beverages with a ‘Strong Buy’ recommendation, valuing the stock at 30 times its CY2021 EPS.

Meanwhile, PI Industries has rallied 76 per cent so far this calendar. The stock trades at 45.3 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share.

“It would be too much to hope for investors to suddenly worry about super-rich valuations of growth or quality stocks,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.

In a recent study on BSE100 stocks, Marcellus Investment Managers found that there is no significant correlation between starting period valuations and subsequent long-term returns.

Instead, in each of the historical phases, there has been a strong correlation between earnings growth rates and share price returns, the study concluded.

Shares of AMCs HDFC AMC and RNAM have rallied 125 per cent and 121 per cent, respectively, this year. Their PEs stood at 61.6 per cent and 41.1 per cent, respectively, and EV/Ebitda at 43.3 and 28.9.

Adani group stocks Adani Transmission and Adani Gas have gained 62-67 per cent this calendar with PE values of 46.6 and 55.6, respectively."

10,2019-12-06,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: A fall in bank stocks send benchmark indices lower on Friday, a second straight session of fall for Sensex and Nifty, even as global environment remained favourable. Analysts blamed lack of rate cut from RBI and concerns over rising fiscal deficit for weak market sentiment.

BSE flagship index Sensex ended 334 points or 0.82 per cent lower at 40,445 while its NSE counterpart Nifty closed below the 12,000 mark at 11,921.50, down 97 points or 0.81 per cent.

For the week, 30-pack Sensex declined 0.85 per cent while 50-pack Nifty shed 1.19 per cent.

Market at a glance
In the Sensex pack, seven stocks ended higher while rest ended lower with YES Bank falling the most at 9.82 per cent.

Shares of YES Bank declined after Moody's Investors Service downgraded the private lender’s credit ratings, citing stressed assets and low loss-absorbing buffers against those assets. It also assigned a 'negative outlook' to the company.

SBI, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, M&M and HDFC were among stocks that joined YES Bank on the losers list.

However, Kotak Mahindra Bank with a gain of 1.48 per cent emerged as top gainer, followed by Tata Steel, RIL, Asian Paints and TCS.

Shares of Vodafone Idea shed 5.34 per cent to close at Rs 6.92 apiece after company chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said that the teleco ""will have to shut shop"" in absence of any government relief.

Sectorally, however, telecom was the only sector that shut shop in the green. All other sectors on BSE ended lower. BSE Auto and BSE Finance were the top losers.

Broader market trailed benchmarks, with BSE Midcap shedding 1.26 per cent and Smallcap sliding 0.86 per cent.


Expert Take
“Clouds over economic growth outlook and premium valuation influenced investors to stay away from rate sensitive stocks. While rising 10 year yield due to spike in inflation and potential slip in fiscal path may result near term consolidation in the market,” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services.

Global marketsWorld shares ticked up, buoyed by comments from US President Donald Trump that talks aimed at dialling down the damaging trade war with China were ""moving right along"". Trump's relatively upbeat tone in comments on Thursday was enough to encourage riskier bets by investors, despite a lack of agreement over whether existing tariffs should be dropped as part of an initial deal to ease the long standoff.

European shares, including the broader Euro STOXX 600, gained 0.3 per cent in early trade, with indexes in Frankfurt and Paris up by similar amounts, Reuters reported."

12,2019-12-09,Asian Paints,"There is a lot of news flow plus we will have the inflation data and IIP figures on 12.th So, let the macro data come out and then decide, says Sandip Sabharwal, asksandipsabharwal.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


It has been a good quarter so far -- October, November, early December, but now things are looking bad. Can things get ugly?
The market has been good for select largecap stocks. After making a comeback, midcaps have given up some of their gains. One can pick out a few which have done very well -- some multiplex companies, some pharma companies. Divi's Lab actually hit a 52-week high on Friday. Some specific companies here and there are doing very well. Some of these pathological lab midcaps are doing very well. Dr Lal is up 60-70%. So, very specific micro stories are doing well. 

Macro-wise, the global low inflation phase was missed by us in two ways. One, the RBI and MPC during the Urjit Patel regime, kept liquidity too tight, rates too high when there were no inflationary pressures and so companies suffered. Some companies which were doing well, saw their businesses going for a toss and demand fell. 

The moves this year has had a muted impact as of now. So, whether it will have a positive impact next year is something which we have to see. Right now, it is not so significant. Secondly, we also missed the bus in terms of raising the sovereign bonds. There was fear mongering but global yields were so down in August-September, that the fear of higher fiscal deficit and higher borrowings domestically was not there in the near term. The policy response has been slow. The only real substantial reform at this stage has been the corporate tax rate cut which is real and significantly positive. I will not discount that. 

But then, despite a lot of other announcements like the AIF for housing or the NBFC refinance or many of the other things or even the release of arbitration money to companies, nothing really has happened on the ground. If those things do not happen, then slowly people lose interest and on top of that, if you have some other markets doing well like the US market, you do not take emerging market currency risk. What is the incentive for people to come into India where the economy is actually at 4.5%?


Would you consider buying any of the beaten down midcaps or would you just stay away given the way the market is right now?There are a lot of beaten down midcaps but in the near term, if the overall market view is slightly cautious, one would avoid it at this stage. Let the flows play out because this week itself, there is going to be so much news flow on trade, on the UK elections and also the US Fed meeting. Plus we will have the inflation data and IIP figures on 12 December. Let the macro data come out and then we will see. 


No one is talking about the fact that there are two ticking time bombs. One is the telecom sector with its AGR dues. That spooked the market on Friday regarding effect on YES Bank or SBI. There is no resolution there. The deadline for AGR is January end? Three months, Supreme Court gave three months so I do not know exactly the date.


The second time bomb is the YES Bank fund raising on 10th. If that fails, it is going to create chaos and then markets will start assuming that YES Bank is going to go belly up and in that case there will be pressure on banks!Unfortunately, Ravneet Gill has got himself in a bind. He has committed $2 billion to everyone. Now he is trying to get that $2 billion whichever way. My view is that even if they get a billion dollars, they should raise it from whichever investor RBI approves of and that itself will be sufficient for them to go through for some time. They can cut down on growth and sustain the bank. The day this entire list of investors came in, I was doubtful because we have never heard those names before.


What about telecom? Kumar Mangalam Birla categorically said on a public platform that they would shut shop if they do not get relief.Finally it is not his money, It is a public listed company. The Birlas hold 30-35% in most of the companies. Every company has individual shareholding. So you cannot say that they made so much money in Grasim. They are making losses here and so they should fund it. It does not work that way because every company in equity is limited liability. Every business is a separate business. 

Now my calculations show that both Vodafone-Idea and Bharti will add around Rs 5,000-6,000 crore of revenue because of the tariff increases which they have done. For Bharti, there will be Rs 5,000-6,000 crore of additional income, combined with equity fund raising which they are proposing and which they can sustain. But Vodafone-Idea with the Rs 50,000-crore writeoff that they did, even if they gained Rs 5,000-6,000 crore in revenue every year, assuming that they are not losing subscribers, then it is a 7-8-9 year process for recovering just the AGR dues. Even before that, their balance sheet was stressed. 


Maruti is raising production after 9 months of cuts. There was also news of price hikes a little earlier. With the EV overhang being pushed down the line, is 2020 going to be a better year for auto than expected?2020 should be a better year but unfortunately we have come to such a pass that just a 5% increase excites people. That is the irony of the situation. People were just becoming happy if there was no decline and now there is a 3-4% increase. But that is not what is going to push this economy. You need maybe 12-15% kind of growth or 10-15% kind of growth for the capacities to get utilised for employment to get generated, for the entire ecosystem which supports auto industry dealers and auto suppliers, Everyone has to revive 2-3-4% here.

2020 should be a better year for auto but unfortunately we have come to such a pass that just a 5% increase excites people.-Sandip Sabharwal


A Credit Suisse report talks about how expensive consumer stocks are and slowdown there. What happens to the consumer staple space now? Leaving out Asian Paints and HUL which have grown, the space is in serious disarray.What will happen is that because of valuations and near-term concerns, we could see some corrections coming in those stocks. People have been buying those stocks only. That is where the maximum money has gone in. There could be some profit taking on the table but this report could be a bit late because typically when inflation moves up, rural incomes move up because the inflation impact on wages in the rural areas is pretty positive.


But this time it is only onions!No, the basing has happened in a lot of products -- be it pulses or other agri commodities. We are seeing some uptick there and if the rabi production is also good, then we get that cycle going. I would think that this report would be slightly late in the day. If the market view is cautious in the near term, then we could see some corrections coming through but I would not support most of the arguments. Some arguments are coming that the telecom tariff hike will impact consumption because people had to pay more. I do not think that will be very significant.


PSU banks took quite a beating and post the RBI’s move, we are expecting to see further pressure on SBI perhaps today as well. What is your expectation? How do you see some of these banks move?Yes, near term, we could see some pressure because the 10-year bond yields could have bottomed in terms of yields and we could see them rise near the Budget as people become more concerned about fiscal deficit. That will have a negative impact on financials. Now, many of the private sector banks tend to be insulated from that but PSU banks tend to take a hit. So if the bond yields keep trending up, we could see some more selloff.


Would you read too much into the resignation of Axis Bank CFO Jairam?No, I do not think so. One-off resignations should not impact the overall performance of the bank as such unless this is followed by some other top level exists subsequently, which we do not know about. But just because of that people should not be negative.


Plus it has happened almost a year after Amitabh Chaudhry has taken over as CEO & MD at Axis Bank. Successive quarterly numbers have come out. This is not a case of Ravneet Gill coming in YES Bank and the top brass changing. It could be a personal reason also. Yes so that is what I am saying that just because of one exit, nothing changes. He might have just got a better opportunity. So, who knows? Every exit is not a negative exit.


Right now, markets are talking about SBI’s exposure to telecom. But nobody is talking about ICICI Bank’s exposure to telecom. Markets are not talking about what could go wrong for ICICI Bank, everybody is talking about what could go wrong for SBI and YES Bank. Why is that?ICICI somehow seems to have avoided a lot of potholes like DHFL and IL&FS. ICICI also turned out to be the one which was smarter and got out early or did not have too much of exposure. On telecom, I am not really sure how much ICICI’s exposure is, but I believe it will be much lesser than many of the other banks. To that extent, they are getting the credit. But that said, it has also outperformed so much so that it could give up some gains.


Crude and inflation are the two things which will force RBI to rethink and that is what they have done. Vegetable prices going higher means inflation goes higher but somebody makes money in the supply chain. Crude goes higher and nobody makes money, it is cash out of your balance sheet?When import prices go up or imports increase, you are paying more to the outsiders. That is pure economics. Brent is near $64 and it has gone up by 12-13%. I think to that extent, it will have an impact. Now these production cuts also have been announced just over the weekend. We have to see the actual impact, going forward. Crude has shown resilience despite all the economic woes -- not falling much below $60. If there is a spike up, then that could be an additional risk."

18,2019-12-16,Asian Paints,"Calendar 2019 remained a confusing year for investors as the broader market remained sluggish amid tremendous selling pressure even as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty scaled record highs.

However, a couple of stocks defied the trend and stepped out of this pattern to deliver up to 2,200 per cent return for the year till December 13. On a year-to-date basis, smallcap firm Best Agrolife soared the most at 2,192 per cent to Rs 260. It was followed by ABans Enterprises (up 976 per cent), Leading Leasing Finance (up 286 per cent) and Kavit Industries (up 258 per cent).

The start of Calendar 2019 was marked by a lot of uncertainty and concerns in the financials space. The outcome of the general election was surprisingly decisive, and it became a key factor to hold up stock valuations. A few missteps in the Budget then added to the macro-economic worries, forcing the government to roll back those measures and later announce a series of new steps to try and turn around the economy.

These have revived hopes that the economy will soon be able to stem the slowdown and turn the ride over the medium term.

Now, the market’s hope for a turnaround in the broader market hinges on this trend reversal in the macro-economy. Despite a rally in the select second-rung counters, Amar Ambani, President and Head of Research at YES Securities, says the consolidation in midcaps and smallcaps will continue for the major part of Calendar 2020.

“The midcap cycle ended in early 2018 and you would not see a bounceback anytime soon. We do not expect Calendar 2020 to be a great year for midcaps and smallcaps. There is a chance of 15-20 per cent rally in them, if Nifty keeps on moving upwards. For a fresh cycle to emerge in midcaps, we have to wait till the end of 2020 or 2021,” he said.

Among the stocks that defied the broader market downtrend in 2019, 26 more than doubled investors’ money in a year. They included Adani Green, Parle Industries, Jump Networks, Aavas Financiers, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management, HDFC AMC and CreditAccess Grameen.

Ambani says select private banks, PSU lenders such as SBI and insurance companies should be able to generate robust alpha in 2020.

Brokerage Dolat Capital expects telecom, public sector undertakings to be top themes to play in 2020.

Commenting on the telecom sector, Dolat Capital said: “After battling the flurry of bad news on the regulatory front and hyper-competition in the trailing three years (SC’s AGR blow being the most recent), we expect the news flow to remain positive on tariffs and/or relief measures.”



On BSE, 66 other stocks gained between 50 and 100 per cent during Calendar 2019. Cantabil Retail India jumped 99 per cent to Rs 253.10 as of December 13 from Rs 127.50 on January 1.

Among other top gainers were Hindustan Foods (up 98 per cent), Ion Exchange (up 97 per cent), Astrazeneca Pharma (up 94 per cent), Radix Industries (up 93 per cent), Ozone World (92 per cent) and HLE Glascoat (up 92 per cent).



Buying in select heavyweights took Sensex higher by nearly 14 per cent during the calendar year. With a 54 per cent gain, Bajaj Finance emerged the top gainer followed by ICICI Bank (up 49 per cent), Bharti Airtel (up 49 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 41 per cent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 35 per cent) and Asian Paints (up 21 per cent).

While the rally in top-rung stocks has started rubbing off on some of the second-rung stocks in recent days, the BSE Smallcap and Midcap indices are still down 9 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, on a year to date basis.

The top wealth destroyers of the year would easily be Cox and Kings (down 99 per cent), GBL Industries (down 99 per cent), Talwalkars Healthclubs (down 97 per cent), McLeod Russel India (down 95 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 95 per cent).



Arun Kejriwal, CEO at KRIS Research & Advisory, sees value in those midcaps, which were able to withstand the storm that hit Indian equity market in 2019.

“It’s been a tough time for corporate India. Only those players which have been able to cut cost and at least hold on at current rate of sales, even if without much growth, are the counters you should look at. In the NBFC space, small finance banks, housing finance players and companies related to the microfinance space look interesting to me,” he said."
19,2019-12-17,Asian Paints,"India’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market index is set to rise as the Finance Minister on Friday confirmed implementation of the Budget announcement of increasing the statutory foreign portfolio investment limit in a company from 24 per cent to sectoral foreign investment limit effective April next year, said Morgan Stanley.

“Using the current list of constituents, we expect MSCI India’s weight to rise by about 70 bps (basis points) in the semi-annual index review of May 2020, implying passive flows of US $2.5 bn (billion),” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said MSCI India’s weightage in MSCI EM will go up to 9.6 per cent from 8.9 per cent.

Companies have until March 31, 2020, to reduce the FPI limit through an approval of the board of directors and a special resolution passed by shareholders. Such companies will retain the option to increase the FPI limit to a maximum of the foreign sector limit at a later date.

“Once the FPI limit increases, it cannot be reduced. Thus, unless companies pass board and shareholder resolutions, all companies in India will irreversibly have their FPI limit at the sector limit after 31st March 2020,” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said India’s free float market capitalisation rank has been lower compared to its market cap and GDP rank because of high promoter holdings and low foreign investment limits which has constrained active and passive allocations to India from abroad.

Larsen & Toubro, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, Britannia, Tata Steel, Bharti Infratel, Titan, Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra and Divi's Laboratories are among the stocks that are likely to see the most increase in weightage given the subsuming of foreign limits.

Among the public sector stocks in the MSCI India index, NTPC, Power Grid, HPCL, Petronet LNG, Container Corporation and REC could see an increase in weight.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Holdings, United Breweries, Power Finance Corporation, Biocon, Indraprastha Gas, ACC and MRF are the large-cap stocks in the BSE 200 index that could be included from the subsuming of the foreign limits."
28,2019-12-18,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Ever wondered which stocks on Dalal Street managed to be the equivalents of cricketing stars like Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Mr Consistent Virat Kohli in Calendar 2019? 

Reliance Industries, of course, turned out to be the biggest wealth creator, Indiabulls Ventures the fastest and IndusInd Bank the most consistent. And that, not just in 2019, but for the past five years.

These were the findings of the annual wealth creation study published by Motilal Oswal Securities. Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director, has been publishing this study every year for past two decades.

Just like run-machine Kohli’s form has made him the face of Indian cricket, Reliance Industries has become the face of a Rising India, by turning out the biggest wealth creator on Dalal Street. The oil-to-telecom behemoth added whopping Rs 5.6 lakh crore to investor wealth, the highest ever, in last five years. 

A 78 per cent surge annually over the five years has earned the Indiabulls Ventures stock the fastest wealth creator tag, something that can be the market equivalent of India’s topmost one-day cricket bowler Jasprit Bumrah.

IndusInd Bank emerged the most consistent, appearing among the top 100 Wealth Creators in each of the last 10 Motilal Oswal wealth studies. It also recorded the highest price growth CAGR of 49 per cent between 2009 to 2019, ahead of Pidilite Industries’ 40 per cent rise. 



Overall, Dalal Street’s top 100 wealth creators delivered Rs 49 lakh crore to investors between 2014 and 2019 at a pace of 22 per cent compounded annually. It was double the 12 per cent growth rate that Sensex stocks clocked during this period, the study revealed.

Among the biggest wealth creators, Reliance Industries was followed by HDFC Bank, which added Rs 4.08 lakh crore to investor wealth. TCS (Rs 3.65 lakh crore), Hindustan Unilever (Rs 2.39 lakh crore) and HDFC (Rs 1.80 lakh crore) emerged the other big wealth creators of last five years.

Bajaj Finance (78 per cent jump CAGR), Bombay Burmah (68 per cent), Aarti Industries (67 per cent), Sundaram Fasteners (55 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (55 per cent) made up the list of other fastest wealth creators. 

Meanwhile, other than IndusInd Bank and Pidilite Industries, Titan (up 40 per cent in 10 years), Shree Cement (39 per cent in 10 years), Asian Paints (34 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (34 per cent) made it to the list of consistent performers in the Motilal Top 100 list of stocks. 

Five years was the longest run as biggest wealth creator for RIL from 2007 to 2011 and for TCS from 2013 to 2017."

30,2019-12-19,Asian Paints,"Excelling in selling and distribution of consumer products, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have time and again found it tough to crack the consumer services market. Companies that have ventured in the services business have not been able to make it a significant contributor to their overall revenues and bottomline, despite having a presence in it for over a decade.


The performance of the decadeold laundry services of Jyothy Laboratories has deteriorated in recent years, even as the company has put in more money in the business in the past two years. The business incurred a loss in each of the past two financial years.

Kaya, a skincare business, has been loss-making for the past three years. The skin clinic business was demerged from Marico in 2013-14. The Kaya stock has lost three-fourths of its value since its listing on the bourses in 2015. Last year, the company shifted its emphasis from capital-intensive formats, such as own stores, shop-in-shops, to a widespread distribution network across general and modern trade channels.


ET Bureau
Decorative paints company Asian Paints entered the home improvement segment through acquisition of Sleek Group in 2013 and bathroom fitting business Ess the following year. However, the businesses continue to remain loss-making more than five years later.

In the second quarter earnings call, the company’s management said that both the segments within the home improvement business faced challenges given the slowdown in the real estate construction sector. However, both the businesses registered good growth with continuing focus on network expansion.

With Pureit, HUL made an entry into in-home water purification service in 2008. However, over a decade since its launch, the company is still trying to get its strategy right. It is currently realigning its portfolio strategy towards premium devices.

Investors of FMCG companies need to be wary when their companies expand into service-oriented businesses. Deep pockets and strong brand equity in consumer goods do not necessarily translate into success in the service business.

“Services business requires a different mindset. Unlike in case of products, the companies do not have total control on the last-mile delivery of the service”, said Abneesh Roy, research analyst at Edelweiss Securities."

34,2019-12-24,Asian Paints,"Some of the stocks and sectors are at multi-year lows; in terms of valuations, they have very attractive dividend yields and those are some of the themes that we like, says Amit Khurana, Head of Equities & Research, Dolat Capital Market. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.



How would you slice and dice the consumption basket? What would you be looking at-- staples or discretionaries? Also, keeping valuations in mind, where would you go hunting within that basket?We have been favouring discretionary over staples for some time now and within discretionary, we are preferring the names which have had a better ability to clear up the inventory. Voltas comes into our preferred picks play. One of the few companies which did not have to take a price cut while the market was slowing down and they were able to clear off the inventory quite a bit without having to compromise on the margins or pricing. 

Among staples, the valuations are too rich. While we are not negative on the models themselves, but the price that you are paying, in some cases, seems to be ridiculously high. We are not comfortable with that as a segment. Within discretionary, the other segment which we liked was paints which has very significant tailwinds because of lower raw material costs which played out in the second quarter. 

Maybe some spill-over effect is likely in this quarter as well. But, we are through the peak of the volume trajectory for the year and therefore at best, one would expect these stocks to sustain. But again, one of the players is quite richly valued. We preferred Asian Paints versus Berger Paints in that context. But overall, our take is that the next couple of quarters will probably see these stocks meander around and not do too much. From a return perspective, we are not very bullish on consumer as a category.


What do you think the markets are likely to witness in 2020? How do you look at the polarisation going ahead in the next year?That is something that we have been trying to view for the last so many weeks. Our take is that 2020, from an Indian perspective, could be a tale of two halves. The first half will probably confirm that there is a bottoming out of the overall economy and the valuations in the midcap and smaller cap space. Probably, if we get better visibility going into the second half of CY2020, you will see a build up of premium in some of those names and sectors. 

Having said that, there are some very interesting aspects also as we go into the New Year. One of the things we are really looking at is the deep polarisation in the market. Very rarely have markets been so dichotomous. We believe there will be a trigger over a period of time to unwind this situation because you cannot always have 15-20 stocks driving the market. There will be a broadening, driven by the visibility from bottoming out of the broader economy and recovery of the earnings for the beaten down names. That is the broader hypothesis we are going around with. Some of the stocks and sectors are at multi-year lows; in terms of valuations, they have very attractive dividend yields and those are some of the themes that we like.


What about healthcare and I am not talking about pure play pharma universe here? What about the allied spaces-- labs, diagnostics as well as the hospital pockets? Some of those stocks have given handsome returns in 2019. Do you like anything here?We do not have formal ratings. I am a bit surprised by the way some of the stocks have performed and got re-rated. It did come as a positive surprise. But there were more stock specific factors, especially the balance sheet deleveraging which a couple of companies did and then the return of volume growth in some of these models which were otherwise getting impacted because of pricing and volume pressures. 

This year, they have been able to recover in all those parameters and that really led to a significant re-rating in the market. We probably missed out on that. We did not expect such a major re-rating for those stocks and a major recovery in the earnings trajectory for some of those names.


You have mentioned earlier that you were looking at the broader market. Within that, would you suggest going extremely stock specific, given that we have seen so many of these stocks beaten down? Are there particular themes that you would pick up?We are backing up a few macro themes. Names which are quite beaten down, especially the PSU pack. Some of the public sector units ex the banks, are quoting at fairly attractive dividend yields. They are quoting at almost one time price to book. That is one of the pockets that we are looking at to make an allocation. 

They may sound a little defensive and low beta names but we believe that the environment we are in, it makes sense to have a fair allocation on those because there is very low downside risk but also from a portfolio stability perspective. these names will hold on to the portfolio for any untoward event. That is one theme that we are backing up. 

We have preferred picks from BFSI space in our portfolio and our argument is simple: as long as there is delivery, there is visibility of earnings and better risk management in those models, we do not mind paying premium for those.

The second one will possibly play out quite remarkably in the next couple of quarters, thanks to the operating leverage for some of the names. These will be the companies which have an exposure to debt, but are not over leveraged. These have a healthy balance sheet and a fairly healthy debt to equity ratios. 

We believe there will be a major pass through of the interest rate reductions over the next couple of quarters. While the RBI has not cut rates in the last cycle and the odds are still split on whether we will get a rate cut in February review, we believe that the ability of banks to pass on the rate cuts over the next couple of quarters will be far more pronounced. That will have a material impact on some of these sectors which will get a tailwind because of lower interest costs over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe this will start playing out in the next couple of quarters and those names are also on our radar. 

The third theme, which is more sector specific, is telecom. While it seems to have become a consensus now and some money is already made, we still believe there is enough tailwind to play out in the sector and we prefer Bharti as the preferred play to take an exposure on this sector. Reason: There is a much better pricing discipline from the players and there is a far more pronounced support from the government to ensure that there is a three-player market and the price hikes go through. 

We are also expecting a significant policy support from the government in terms of how it would like the companies to pay up on the dues. We believe there is still money to be made on telecom and CY20 and this could be one of the themes to back up for. 


What is your view on the banking pack? While some are trading at one-time price to book, there are also names which are trading at three-four times. Those are typically private sector banks. We have preferred picks from BFSI space in our portfolio and our argument is simple: as long as there is delivery, there is visibility of earnings and better risk management in those models, we do not mind paying premium for those. 

Amongst the PSU banks, we have backed up SBI through the CY19 and that continues to be the only PSU bank that we like. 

From a broader perspective, there is going to be a significant change in the way the models are operating and the way the banks will behave. The gains from NBFCs to banks are yet to play out and we would expect that to be take place over the next couple of years. Therefore, we are preferring some of the private sector banks.


What is your take on commodity plays like metals and steel makers in particular?Metals have been showing a pretty positive uptrend but in our recent sort of interaction across the industry, the price hikes do not seem to be sustaining that well. We did see some price hikes getting absorbed and then the discounting came back into the market. 

So from a fundamental perspective, I am not very sure whether this is the right time to go aggressively long. But having said that, the global news flow seems to be far more sort of positive to support this trend.

We will probably see this sector and stocks sustaining these levels, but purely from a domestic perspective, we are not finding evidence of a very major uptick in volumes or pricing as yet. I would reserve my judgment on that."

39,2019-12-30,Asian Paints,"NEW DELHI: Following a volatile session on Dalal Street, BSE benchmark Sensex ended marginally lower while its counterpart Nifty eked out small gains.

The broader market fared better than benchmarks with BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices, ending 0.29 per cent and 0.75 per cent higher, respectively.

Market at a glance
In the 30-pack Sensex, 18 stocks ended in the green and 12 in the red. ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, TCS, Asian Paints and Axis Bank were among the top losers on the index.

Meanwhile, Hero MotoCorp, Nestle India, M&M, Bharti Airtel and Tata Steel were the top gainers, rising up to 1.47 per cent.

In the BSE sectoral space, five out of 19 sectors ended in the red with BSE IT leading the charge, down 0.29 per cent. BSE Auto, up 1.36 per cent, was the best sectoral performer. Auto stocks gained ahead of the release of the auto sales numbers for December, slated to be out on January 1. BSE Metals, up 1.25 per cent, was the second-biggest gainer in the BSE sectoral landscape.


Expert Take:
Market was rangebound, premium valuation and lack of fresh triggers influenced investors to take a cautious approach on heavyweights. But reasonable valuation of midcaps and smallcaps attracted inflows leading to outperformance in the broader market. We expect this polarised valuation not to sustain as there could be a shift of money from the overvalued largecaps to midcaps in 2020.
