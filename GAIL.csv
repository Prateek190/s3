5,2018-01-01,GAIL,"State-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd today said it has commissioned the country's second largest rooftop solar power plant.

The firm has installed a 5.76 MWp (Mega Watt peak) solar plant at its petrochemical complex at Pata in Uttar Pradesh, a company statement said.

The plant over the roofs of warehouses covers a total area of 65,000 square meters.

""With an expected PLF of around 15 per cent annually, over 79 lakh KWh (or units) of electricity is targeted to be generated for captive use of India's largest gas-based petrochemcials plant,"" it said.

Tata Power Solar had in December 2015 commissioned a 12 MW solar rooftop project in Amritsar, which produces more than 150 lakh units of power annually and offset over 19,000 tonne of carbon emissions every year.

India plans to have 40 GW of rooftop photovoltaics (PV) by 2022. This is part of its target of having 175 GW of non-hydro renewables capacity by 2022- made up of 60 GW onshore wind, 60 GW utility-scale solar, 10 GW bio-energy, 5 GW small hydro and 40 GW rooftop solar.

It currently has 60 GW of renewable energy capacity.

GAIL Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi said the company as a marketer of benign natural gas is thrilled to integrate captive solar PV towards achieving lower carbon footprint at its installations.

Captive solar power initiative of GAIL will reduce carbon emissions by 6,300 tonnes per annum and help India achieve climate goals, the statement said. ""GAIL's solar rooftop project is also a step under 'Make in India' with Indian vendors entrusted for manufacture, supply and execution."""

10,2018-01-04,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Amid talks of merger of public sector oil and gas companies, the government is considering a proposal to split GAIL (India) with the marketing operations spun off into a separate company. Sources told TOI that the plan is being discussed in the petroleum ministry as the Centre is unhappy with the state-run player’s performance in building a pipeline network in addition to a possible conflict of interest in its role as the infrastructure provider as well as a carrier. 

“It is like building a road and also deciding who can ply and at what cost,” said a source, who did not wish to be identified. The plan to split the company, which was set up mainly to develop gas sector infrastructure in the country, has been discussed in the past too, including by Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, but it did not materialise. 

Natural gas transmission and marketing are the core businesses of the PSU, which has also diversified into petrochemicals and renewable energy. Last year, GAIL earned over 70% revenue from marketing operations, while over 40% of the profit came from natural gas transmission. The discussions come at atime when the government is working on completing ONGC acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation to bolster both the entities. 

The deal will help the government garner around Rs 35,000 crore by way of disinvestment receipts. While other merger plans will wait until the next year, Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil have made a pitch to take over GAIL, a news agency reported last month. The sources, however, said the government would first prefer to unbundle GAIL before deciding on consolidation. 

“By this time the entire country should have had a pipeline network but we have been very slow,” said a source, adding that pipelines and delivering gas at doorsteps is a major thrust of the Narendra Modi administration. Although the government is discussing the plan, sources clarified, there is no formal decision on the issue, which will be finalised only after consultation with all stakeholders."

12,2018-01-05,GAIL,"Hello! Here’s a lowdown on top macro triggers that may move the market on Friday. This report was compiled from agency feeds.



PSU Banks to Get Rs 80,000 Cr Funds from Govt
India’s biggest state-owned banks are likely to get Rs 80,000 crore of fresh capital this fiscal year after the government sought Parliament’s nod for additional spending toward the infusion. Major beneficiaries may include State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Indian Bank, said people aware of the matter. State-owned lenders rose on the news with the NSE PSU bank index closing 2.69% higher on Thursday, compared with a 0.59% advance in the broader market index.


FMCG products, Auto Sales Grows Fastest in 5 Yrs
Purchases of consumer products and automobiles have recorded their fastest growth in nearly five years, underpinned by a good monsoon and improving market sentiment after the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) among other macroeconomic factors. Demand for daily groceries and home and personal products peaked in the year ended November with 9% volume growth, the most since 2010, according to the latest data provided by the world’s largest research firm Nielsen. Passenger vehicle sales rose 8.7% to 3.2 million units last year, the fastest since 2012. 


PSU Banks & Moody'sIndian government's decision to pump Rs 2.1 lakh crore in the ailing public sector banks through various channels is expected to help narrow the gap between the capital profiles of Indian public and private sector banks according to global ratings firm Moody's. Additionally, its Indian affiliate Icra has said that the deterioration in asset quality -- in terms of gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) -- may peak by FY2018, but elevated levels of provisioning on these NPAs will continue to negatively affect the banks during FY2018 and FY2019. Moody's expects that the package will facilitate the two key policy initiatives of non-performing loan (NPL) resolution and Basel III implementation.


More Reforms for Ease of Biz GoalWith four months left to implement reforms to make doing business easier, India is targeting 90 measures including quicker construction permits, simpler registration of new companies and Aadhaar-based identification of directors to achieve a higher ranking in the World Bank's annual listing. This time, India has one month less to implement the steps because the World Bank has advanced the deadline for submission to May 1 for the next set of rankings, usually announced in October. The Department of Financial Services will consider doing away with the requirement of providing a company seal to open a bank account. 


Fitch on Indian Growth India has the potential to grow at an average of 6.7% per annum over the next five years and will be the fastest growing large economies, global ratings agency Fitch has said. Even though this rate of growth is lower than the potential and what policymakers have been aspiring for, it is ahead of the 5.5% growth estimated for China and Indonesia, who are joined at the second fastest rank. The country is set to witness a continued robust growth in the working-age population in the next five years, bolstering growth potential, it said, adding Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and Brazil will also benefit from a similar trend. 


Plan to Split GAIL?Amid talks of merger of public sector oil and gas companies, the government is considering a proposal to split GAIL (India) with the marketing operations spun off into a separate company. Sources told TOI that the plan is being discussed in the petroleum ministry as the Centre is unhappy with the state-run player's performance in building a pipeline network in addition to a possible conflict of interest in its role as the infrastructure provider as well as a carrier. . The plan to split the company, which was set up mainly to develop gas sector infrastructure in the country, has been discussed in the past too, including by Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, but it did not materialise. 


Airfares May Go Up 13%Flyers in India should brace for a fare hike this year. Rising fuel prices and an increase in cost of operations due to the Goods and Services Tax could result in airlines raising fares by about 13%. The cost of operations for carriers has gone up 27% after GST was introduced in July. Jet fuel is currently out of the purview of GST. India's aviation market, the fastest growing in the world, has boomed primarily on the back of low fares and capacity added by airlines including Indigo, SpiceJet, Jet Airways and Air India. The likely fare increase would mainly be on tickets bought at the last minute. 


US Markets on a HighThe Dow Jones Industrial Average broke above the 25,000 level for the first time on Thursday and other major indexes scaled new records, propelled by strong US private jobs numbers that added to a stream of robust economic data from across the world. The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017, on the back of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda and solid corporate earnings. Wall Street carried the momentum into the new year, with the benchmark S&P index closing above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settling above 7,000 a day earlier.

28,2018-01-10,GAIL,"Rising crude oil prices would expand the need for working capital and raise energy cost for Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the nation’s largest refiner and fuel retailer, chairman Sanjiv Singh said in an interview to ET’s Sanjeev Choudhary. Whether price controls come back to soften the impact of sharp rise in prices of petrol and diesel on consumers is a call that the government will have to take, Singh said. Edited excerpts:


Crude oil prices have risen more than 40% in the past six months. What does it mean for IOC?
We prefer to see lower prices because when crude prices go up, the product prices also go up. So, from the company’s point of view, it would mean higher working capital and higher energy cost. And the profitability of the company will depend upon the margins that are available in the global market at different prices range of crude.


Given the current oil price trends, do you fear domestic price controls could come back?
Let’s see. Ultimately, it’s a government call. But you see the government decided to free the prices after considering all the aspects. Earlier also, when crude prices were above $100 per barrel, diesel was controlled, and the government was providing that kind of subsidy. Now, if the government feels that the prices have to be capped at a certain level, then they will have to find out ways of providing subsidy.


Are you able to pass on the entire rise in fuel prices to consumers today, as you did when prices were lower? Some analysts are concerned that rising prices may have begun hurting IOC’s gross marketing margins.
We are changing the prices with the global prices. Otherwise, how do we do business? It’s a fairly transparent mechanism by which we are working it out. I am confident that the system is working. If crude goes to $100 per barrel, probably it willbe a different call since prices will be very high. But at least in the present range, it’s working.


What happens if prices continue to rise like this?
Let’s see. Even before we can prompt that subsidy mechanism may again come in, it may be excise duty, it may be VAT reduction, it may be GST, because ultimately we all are expecting that these products would also get included in GST.


How are you dealing with increasing private competition in fuel retailing? They have taken away a market share of about 7-8%.
We are not afraid of competition. It brings in efficiency and more value to the customer. In terms of market share, you will see it going down by a few percentage points for Indian Oil because we are the largest player.


IOC had earlier expressed its desire to acquire GAIL. How seriously are you pursuing that?
GAIL is strong in gas infrastructure. We also have pipeline infrastructure. They are in gas sourcing, we are also in gas sourcing. So, from infrastructure integration point of view, it makes sense.


Are you trying to persuade people for this?
I don’t think it requires persuasion. Indicating our interest, and submitting our logic is good enough for us to indicate our seriousness.


Have you received any concrete offer from Saudi Aramco on buying stake in the proposed mega refinery?
It’s just talks right now. They cannot even give us a concrete offer because today we haven’t even frozen the configuration.


Have you shelved some of your planned brownfield expansion due to the proposed mega refinery?
No. Brownfield expansion will help quickly add capacity; it is low-cost expansion. In fact, we are expediting it because we need capacity.


How is IOC preparing to deal with the rise of renewables?We are not going to deal with renewables, we are going to deal in renewables. We are investing in three biofuel plants. By my standards, today they do not give the desired IRR (internal rate of return). But as a strategic move we have decided to invest in these. Oil and gas, I strongly believe, is not going to go away. Tell me, if you have to buy a single car today, will you go for the petrol car or a battery car? If it is your fourth car, you may go for a battery car. For a company like Indian Oil, the bigger challenge is to meet the oil and gas requirement till it is needed. If it is needed till 2050, we have to be there. I can’t say that I have switched to battery manufacturing, so I will not make petrol.


IOC is diversifying into fertilizer business. How is that progressing?We, along with NTPC, Coal India and state fertilizer companies, are building three urea plants at Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni at a total investment of Rs 18,000 crore. All three plants will be ready by 2020. The demand for urea is going to stay strong in future. This is a good diversification for us as we know how to run process plants. Besides, these plants will become anchor customers for gas grid."

33,2018-01-11,GAIL,"Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) will begin the process to auction gas distribution licenses for hundred cities this month, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said.

The government has been encouraging the consumption of natural gas, aiming to raise the share of gas in country’s energy mix from the current 6.5% to 15% in future. Expansion of gas distribution networks to more cities can help boost consumption by households, vehicles and factories.

PNGRB, the downstream regulator, has already given away gas distribution licenses for about 80 cities across the country, and a roll out of 100 more licenses can potentially boost gas consumption sharply. But city gas auctions in the past have been marred by declining interest from the industry, delays and policy hurdles, resulting in far fewer than targeted distribution of licenses. India has about 1,282 compressed natural gas (CNG) stations and about 40 lakh domestic piped gas consumers.

For more than a year, the regulator didn’t have enough board members to be able to quickly decide or award licenses. But with vacancies having filled recently, the board is likely to get back to its job faster. 

The government is also targeting to aggressively expand pipelines to secure gas supplies to more and more cities. GAIL, ONGC, BPCL, Indian Oil and Oil India are together planning to build a gas grid in North-East and link it to the Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline, currently under construction, Pradhan said. GAIL is building the 2500-km Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline, with the financial support from Centre. 

The government is also working on bringing the second wave of reforms in the oil and gas sector, Pradhan said, without elaborating. 

He, however, rejected the idea of letting the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) evolve into an independent regulator with its cadre of experts, arguing that India’s upstream sector is yet to mature for that. DGH is the technical arm of the Oil Ministry and also acts as a regulator of the upstream sector but depends mainly on the borrowed personnel from state oil companies. 

Pradhan also defended market pricing for petrol and diesel, saying the decision to deregulate these fuels were well thought through. In markets, where these fuels are available cheaply, these are available only to a smaller section of consumers, Pradhan said, citing the negative consequences of having administered prices. 

Petrol and diesel prices have been rising in the country in line with rise in international rates for the past few months."

GAIL had in 2012 signed a 20-year deal to import 2.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG from now-cancelled Shtokman LNG in the Barents Sea. Gas under this contract was indexed to average price of customs cleared crude oil imports by Japan, called Japan Customs-cleared Crude or JCC. Deliveries were to start from second quarter of 2018.

Sources said the benchmark has been changed to Brent crude oil with lower indexation.

Exact price changes were not immediately known.

Also, deliveries have been staggered. GAIL will begin with 0.5 million tonnes (MT) buy in the first year, which will be ramped up to 0.75 MT in the following year and then to 1.5 MT in the year thereafter.

Entire 2.5 MT would start flowing only in year four or five, sources said, adding that the quantities not taken initially would be bought during the remaining period of the contract.

Gazprom will supply LNG from Yamal LNG project in the Arctic peninsula, they said, adding that supplies have been delayed due to weak demand at home.

The intervening period would be used to find customers for the Russian gas.

Last year, India got US energy major Exxon Mobil Corp to lower price of LNG from Gorgon project in Australia, saving Rs 4,000 crore in import bill.

In late 2015, it had renegotiated price of the long-term deal to import 7.5 million tonnes per year of LNG from Qatar, helping save Rs 8,000 crore.

In a press statement, GAIL said it has ""successfully re- negotiating the long-term LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) originally signed in the year 2012"".

Without giving details of the changes, it said an amendment to the contract was signed today.

A long-term LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement building up to 2.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG on DES (Discharge-ex- Ship) basis was executed by GAIL with Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore (GMTS) in the year 2012, the supplies under which are scheduled to start in Q2 2018.

""The two parties have agreed to an adjustment to the price and volume of LNG supply thus enabling GAIL to develop incremental gas markets to offtake these volumes thereby mitigating volume risk,"" it said.

The deal, the statement said, is a step for GAIL to diversify LNG portfolio by spreading price reference indices across multiple geographies so as to provide consumers greater flexibility in service.

""This chapter of relationship between the two companies opens up exploration of further opportunities in portfolio optimisation and LNG swap dealings for mutually beneficial outcomes,"" it said.

The SPA signed in 2012 is a 20-year LNG sales and purchase agreement following the signing of an earlier Basic Framework Agreement (BFA) by the two companies on 18 May 2011. With start of the LNG supplies from USA and Gazprom in 2018, GAIL's LNG portfolio would increase multi-fold bringing it in the league of some of the largest traders of LNG in the world.

India has used its status of Asia's third largest LNG buyer to renegotiate deals with Australia and Qatar.

Petronet LNG Ltd, India's biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, in August 2009 signed a 20-year deal to buy 1.44 million tonnes of LNG from Exxon's share in the Gorgon project in Australia. The deliveries under the contract started last year.

Exxon Mobil Corp has agreed to charge 13.9 per cent of the prevailing Brent oil price at the port of delivery rather than previously decided 14.5 per cent of the oil rate at the port of loading. The delivered price was considered too high and so price was renegotiated.

Delivered ex ship (DES) is a trade term requiring the seller to deliver goods to a buyer at an agreed port of arrival. Under FOB, the buyer has to make the shipping arrangement.

India had renegotiate in 2015 the LNG pricing formula with Qatar's RasGas to buy the gas at half the original price."
51,2018-01-16,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: GAIL has renegotiated the terms of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchase deal with Russia’s Gazprom originally signed in 2012, which will bring down the price GAIL pays for the gas in a global market where spot gas prices have crashed in the past three years. 

“The two parties have agreed to an adjustment to the price and volume of LNG supply thus enabling GAIL to develop incremental gas markets to offtake these volumes thereby mitigating volume risk,” GAIL said in a statement. 

GAIL and Gazprom had earlier agreed to purchase up to 2.5 million tonnes of LNG annually in 2012. The supplies would begin in the second quarter of 2018.

GAIL didn’t quantify the effect of renegotiations on pricing or volume but sources said GAIL will pay less for gas now than under the original contract, and will also have the flexibility to offtake much less than the contracted volume in the first 2-3 years of the 20-year contract. The pricing terms achieved by GAIL with Gazprom is better than in the two other deals that have been renegotiated by India in the past two years with Qatar’s RasGas and ExxonMobil’s LNG project in Australia, sources said.

A sharp drop in gas prices, which are mostly linked to crude prices, in the past three years have ignited efforts by gas buyers to renegotiate pricing and other terms with suppliers. GAIL is also renegotiating contract terms with its US suppliers to cut prices.

It took one and a half years for GAIL to conclude renegotiations with Gazprom resulting in the new contract being indexed to Brent Crude oil from Japan Customs-cleared Crude previously, sources said. 

“This deal is a step for GAIL to diversify LNG portfolio by spreading price reference indices across multiple geographies so as to provide consumers greater flexibility in service. This chapter of relationship between the two companies opens up exploration of further opportunities in portfolio optimization and LNG swap dealings for mutually beneficial outcomes,” GAIL said. 

With the start of the LNG supplies from USA and Gazprom in 2018, GAIL’s LNG portfolio would increase multi-fold bringing it in the league of some of the largest traders of LNG in the world, the company said."

77,2018-01-20,GAIL,"GUWAHATI: Assam industry minister, Chandra Mohan Patwary on Saturday said that Centre has in principle agreed to come up with gas pipeline from Barauni in Bihar to Guwahati in Assam.

Patwary informed that Centre is working on new fiscal package to attract investment into the state. The earlier policy of North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP), 2007 has expired.

He said that earlier policy has failed to attract desired investment in Assam.

Patwary added that to give impetus to industrial activity the government has notified 160 kilometre long industrial corridor near Guwahati. “We have around 6000 acres of ready to use land available in the land bank.”

78,2018-01-21,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Oil & Natural Gas Corporation will use a mix of debt, cash reserves and proceeds from a planned sale of stakes in IndianOil and GAIL to fund its acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, the chairman of India’s largest oil explorer said. 

ONGC needs to pay Rs 36,915 crore for the government’s 51.11% stake in HPCL by January-end. The deal would make state-run ONGC the third largest refiner in India, after Indian Oil and Reliance Industries, and give it control over nearly a fourth of filling stations. 

“We have cash reserve of about Rs 12,000-13,000 crore, a blanket approval for loans from banks, and the government approval to sell our stakes in IndianOil and GAIL. We still have 4-5 days and we will figure out the best combination,” Shashi Shan ker told ET. 

For funding the deal, the company’s order of priority is cash reserve, sale of stakes in IndianOil and GAIL, followed by debt, Shanker said. 

ONGC may or may not sell stakes in IndianOil and GAIL immediately, he said. “We are not in a hurry. We would look for a fair price,” he said. 

Others

ONGC’s 13.77% stake in IndianOil and 4.86% in GAIL can fetch about Rs 30,000 crore at current market prices. ONGC has about Rs 50,000 crore of sanctioned loans at favourable terms, but how much it would draw and from which banks will depend on its own need and the final commercial terms, Shanker said. 

It could be a mix of domestic and foreign currency borrowings for short term, which would eventually get repaid by proceeds from sale of ONGC’s stake in IOC and GAIL, he said. ONGC will buy HPCL’s shares at Rs 473.97 apiece, a nearly 14% premium to the Friday close of Rs 416.55. 

“The worst fears of ONGC shareholders is over,” said Ritesh Gupta, an analyst at Ambit Capital. There was wide speculation that ONGC might be forced to pay a hefty premium or make an open offer to minority shareholders. Minority investors, if they stay invested for long, will also gain greatly since there is immense synergy between the two firms and scope for long-term growth, Shanker said. ONGC has been exempt from making an open offer. 

“After integration, ONGC’s top line and bottom line will be less affected by crude price volatility as we would have increased refining and marketing operations,” he said."

86,2018-01-22,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: India could see more integration among state oil companies, its oil minister said on Monday, following top producer ONGC's $5.8 billion deal last week to buy a majority stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd.

India wants to build bigger oil companies to better compete with global energy giants and withstand oil price volatility through integration of state-run oil firms.

""There is scope for more vertical integration in the sector,"" oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told a news conference.

He was speaking after Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) announced on Saturday that it was buying the government's 51.1 percent stake in HPCL to create India's first integrated oil and gas company.

Analysts have said that an integrated oil company would give Indian state-owned firms a bigger balance sheet to compete globally for assets.

Last year state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd separately expressed interest in buying the government's stakes in explorer Oil India Ltd and gas utility GAIL India Ltd.

ONGC's purchase of a majority stake in HPCL is expected to close by the end of this month and Pradhan said there was a possibility to combine HPCL with ONGC's petrochemical projects and its refining arm Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd .

MRPL operates a 300,000 bpd refinery in the southern state of Karnataka.

After the deal, ONGC will control around 17 percent of India's 5 million bpd or so refining capacity.

HPCL Chairman M. K. Surana said on Monday that there could be a merger between his firm and MRPL to achieve synergy benefits in the refining and petrochemicals sectors, although he noted no discussions had yet taken place."

n an interview with ET Now, Shashi Shanker, CMD, ONGC, points out that ONGC is an upstream company whose top line and bottom line moves in tandem with crude oil price while reverse is the case for downstream companies like MRPL and HPCL. Together, this is going to provide a stable income and also higher risk appetite.Edited excerpts: 



Congratulations on finally closing the deal with HPCL. What are the synergies and benefits of the deal?We have a lot of synergies. When you talk about our Group company MRPL, HPCL has a very well established marketing network. Last fiscal, they marketed more than 35 million tonnes of refined products and their total refining capacity is way below this number whereas in case of MRPL we do not have any marketing set up. Now, this existing marketing network of HPCL can also be used to market refined products from MRPL. So, this number one. Number two, both MRPL and HPCL procure crude oil from overseas. Together they can get a better price for the crude oil. Number three, ONGC is a primarily upstream company and our top line and bottom line moves in tandem with the crude oil price and reverse is the case in case of downstream companies like MRPL and HPCL. 

At the group level, this is going to provide a stable income. This is another aspect and major advantage of consolidation. If you look at the balance sheet, this will give you a higher risk appetite and probably at a group level, we should be able to leverage it for any acquisition or future growth of any of these companies.


How is it that you are looking to fund the deal? How much will be via internal accruals, the asset selling and the short term borrowing?As of now we have different options and we have not yet decided. We have some cash balance with us then we hold good chunk of IOCL shares and GAIL shares both these put together at today’s price could be anything in excess of Rs 25,000 crore. Thereafter, we have tie up with a number of banks for foreign currency and Indian rupee loan at a very competitive rate. This is in excess of 50,000 crore. 

As of now we have all the options available with us. Whatever we can fund through our internal accrual we will do first and then look at the remaining two options.


Will the payment be made in tranches? Have you identified the assets that would be sold off and the timelines there?No, we will be making in one shot only.


How is it going to impact cash flows as well as your debt equity on the ONGC balance sheet?As of now, ONGC standalone is a debt-free company. Whatever debt we will have, is only after we take a call on how much we are going to fund through….


When will it start showing on your financials?After we take it from the very next day.


If you could also give us the outlook on realisations, crude is beginning to spiral up. How much each dollar of rise in crude is going to impact your profits?As of now, the realisation we are getting is much better than what we realised in the previous years. Going forward, as far as ONGC’s outlook is concerned, it is going to be favourable.


What is the outlook on increasing volumes of gas and oil going forward?We have made some very good discoveries in gas and in next five years or so, our volumes are going to increase substantially. Our two new discoveries are going to add close to 25 million cubic metre of gas per day.


Now that this merger is a done deal, will HPCL-MRPL merger be next on the cards?That is definitely a possibility but we will evaluate it via due diligence like we did it in this particular case and there is a difference between acquisition and merger. Merger is not as simple a process as acquisition. We will evaluate that and find that it is going to be beneficial for the group company.


There have been talks of GAIL showing interest in a merger. Are you also considering that after HPCL, the next way forward for you to is to align with GAIL and then create a complete behemoth because an ONGC will have exploration capacity, refining capacity and also gas transmission facility?This I have only learnt from media. There is no formal proposal as of today. If the proposal comes, we will look at it objectively and see if we are going to see accrue benefit to the group."
80,2018-01-22,GAIL,"Stock of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) soared over 5 per cent in early trade on Monday after the company agreed to acquire the government’s entire 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum for about Rs 36,915 crore in an all-cash deal that is expected to close by January-end. 

The company will use a mix of debt, cash reserves and proceeds from a planned sale of stakes in Indian Oil and GAIL to fund its acquisition.

ONGC was trading 5.29 per cent up at Rs 203.85 at around 9.45 am (IST). It opened at Rs 199 and touched high and low of Rs 206 and Rs 198, respectively, in trade so far. Benchmark BSE Sensex was up 100 points, or 0.28 per cent, at 35,611 at around the same time.

According to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management data, the government had earned total receipts worth of Rs 54,337.60 crore before this deal out of the total budgeted receipts of Rs 72,500 crore.

ONGC's 13.77% stake in IndianOil and 4.86% in GAIL can fetch about Rs 30,000 crore at current market prices.

""ONGC board on January 19, 2018, considered the proposal and approved acquisition of the entire 51.11 per cent shareholding (778,845,375 equity shares) of the President of India, at a cash purchase consideration of Rs 473.97 per share with a total acquisition cost of Rs 36,915 crore,"" the company said.

ONGC is the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in India, contributing around 70 per cent of domestic production."
87,2018-01-23,GAIL,"If GAIL has its way, about 57,000 households in Bengaluru will get piped natural gas (PNG) connections by the end of this year.

The new eco-friendly and inexpensive facility, which does away with the hassles associated with conventional LPG cylinders, has already reached as many as 4,730 houses in the city. In 2015, GAIL launched its city gas distribution project for Bengaluru urban and rural districts with authorisation from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board. It has set a target of 1.32 lakh houses by 2020.

“We have already laid 1,000 km of pipeline to supply natural gas. To cater to 1.32-lakh households, we will have to create an additional 2,500-km of network,” GAIL’s general manager (projects) Partha Jana told ET. The residential layouts where the PNG facility has come up are BEL Layout, HSR Layout, Bellandur, Singasandra, Sarjapura Road, Hebbal and Dollars Colony. Infrastructure is being created in parts of South, North and East Bengaluru. “PNG is also being provided to 17 industries and 34 commercial establishments including Phoenix Mall and Marriott Hotel,” Partha Jana revealed.

The city fetches natural gas from the 1,000-km Dabhol-Bengaluru pipeline that was completed in 2013. In Bengaluru, the 18-inch pipeline passes from Outer Ring Road, Hebbal, HRBR, Hennur, Mahadevapura, Domlur, HSR Layout and Singasandra on Hosur Road. Smaller pipelines, mostly of six inches and eight inches, branch out to different areas from the main pipeline.


How much does it cost?
“PNG is much cheaper than LPG. While a 14.2-kg subsidised domestic LPG cylinder costs ₹538, the same quantity of PNG, which is calculated based on standard cubic metres (SCM), comes at a price of Rs 375,” GAIL officials said.

One kg is equivalent to 1.164 SCM. The retail selling price of one SCM (natural gas) is ₹22.10.

A domestic PNG connection requires a household to pay a refundable deposit of ₹5,000 and a registration fee of ₹354 (including GST). “Customers are not charged for laying of the pipeline network up to the appliance along with necessary fittings, pressure regulator, meter and conversion of LPG appliance to PNG,” the officials added.

Kishan Nuthanki, a businessman and resident of Brigade Gateway at Yeshwanthpur, who switched over from LPG to PNG last year, observes that PNG has reduced inconvenience. “Getting LPG cylinder used to be a headache — from ordering it to ensuring the cylinder is delivered on-time. We have uninterrupted flow of PNG. Even our bimonthly bill is around ₹800,” he said."

89,2018-01-23,GAIL,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has got approval from the government for selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to help fund the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of HPCL.

ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in nation's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC), which at today's trading price is worth over Rs 26,200 crore. It also holds 4.86 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth over Rs 3,847 crore.

Top sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the government gave ONGC nod to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL earlier this month but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.

For the moment ONGC is funding the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of government's 51.11 per cent stake in oil refining and marketing firm Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) from the about Rs 12,000 crore cash it has and short- term borrowing.

Sources said ONGC is a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status. The short-term loan it is availing have provision to pre-pay without any penalty.

It plans to pre-pay the one-year tenure loan it is taking for HPCL buy by selling IOC and GAIL shares in due course, they said.

Sources said ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state- owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price.

So, ONGC has decided to offload the shares in open market.

ONGC acquiring HPCL would create India's first integrated oil company. This would be ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 per cent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker had on Sunday stated that the company's board has approved raising of the borrowing limit from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore.

This will be the company's first ever debt.

""We will use our (Rs 12,000-13,000 crore) cash first and then the liquid assets and debt will be last,"" Shanker had said. ""This order can change, because we won't sell the liquid assets in distress. Also, we have offers for over Rs 50,000 crore debt at very competitive rates, both foreign currency and local.""

Shanker had said the company paid less than the acquisition price recommended by the company's valuation adviser, EY.

He, however, refused to share details.

The Rs 473.97 per share ONGC is paying to the government is 14 per cent higher than Friday's closing price of HPCL and over 10 per cent of the 60-day weighted average of the HPCL scrip.

Sources said while the government was seeking as much as Rs 69,000 crore for selling controlling stake in HPCL, EY had put HPCL's valuation at Rs 475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling stake. The outside advice the company took from Citi put the price at Rs 500 per share.

The stake sale will help the government cross its sell- off target for the first time and would help stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent of GDP.

The government had set a target of Rs 72,500 crore from disinvestment proceeds this fiscal. Before the ONGC-HPCL deal, it had collected Rs 54,337.60 crore.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.

ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15- million tonne refinery."

""We will use our (Rs 12,000-13,000 crore) cash first and then the liquid assets and debt will be last,"" he had said. ""This order can change, because we won't sell the liquid assets in distress. Also, we have offers for over Rs 50,000 crore debt at very competitive rates, both foreign currency and local.""

ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC), which is worth over Rs 26,000 crore. It also holds 4.86 per cent stake in GAIL India Ltd, which is worth over Rs 3,800 crore.

The company had on January 20 announced buying of government's 51.11 per cent stake in India's third largest state-owned oil refiner and marketing company for Rs 473.97 per share in an all-cash deal that is to be closed before the month-end."

107,2018-01-24,GAIL,"MUMBAI: The government today urged the manufacturing sector to implement more number of Behavioural Safety Codes as recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to avoid industrial accidents.

""The government is taking more positive approach towards the industrialisation and urges the industry to implement more number of Behavioural Safety Codes recommended by the ILO to avoid industrial accidents,"" Ministry of Labour, Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (FASLI) Director General Avneesh Singh said here.

Inaugurating the 2nd National Conference of the Forum of Behavioural Safety (BESAFE) here, Singh said as of now only 43 Codes have been recognised out of the total 188 codes stipulated by the ILO.

The Behaviour Based Safety (BBS) is in very initial stage and will require more time for its implementation in various sectors of the Indian economy, Singh added.

In his welcome speech, BESAFE Director H L Kaila said around 12 lakh people die in India alone every year due to behavioural causes.

""As per figures given by the ILO, around 23 lakh people die every year in the world due to such industrial accidents of which 12 lakh die in India only due to behavioural causes (due to which) the global economy is not only losing the valuable manpower but also a big chunk of revenues,"" Kaila said.

Within the last few years, the implementation of BBS has gone up considerably and as of now around 10,000 units belong to various sectors of industries in the country have adopted the BBS, he said, adding that the government should include the BBS into skill development programme.

BESAFE director S K Singh said the government should teach BBS regulations through various educational institutes including colleges and other training institutes.

""It will provide basic information about behavioural safety to everybody. The Indian corporates should adopt BBS and aim for zero unsafe behaviour,"" he said.

The BESAFE has also given 12 BBS corporate recognition awards and 29 certificates to its BBS ambassadors.

The awardees from the Indian corporates include GAIL, Adani Ports, Afcons Infrastructure Ltd, Bajaj Auto, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Jindal Steel Ltd, L& T, Tata Projects, Sterlite Power, Volkswagen India, Vedanta Ltd, and HPCL."

111,2018-01-25,GAIL,"TimesJobs powered 'Artificial Intelligence' community - Times AI Hub - conducted its maiden event at IIT Delhi to discuss the industrial uses of AI. The event brought together AI industry stalwarts and students and highlighted real-life use cases from farming to telecom.
New Delhi, January 25, 2018: When Saudi Arabia granted citizenship to humanoid robot Sophia, most people didn't know how to react to the fact that a life-size bot was 'living' among them, dressing up meticulously and talking about her aspirations of having a family. Bots have long been used to facilitate basic, repetitive jobs in many industries. In India, we may not have a bot as celebrated as Sophia, but bots are already serving food in a Chennai restaurant and helping customers in a Mumbai bank. 

 If you thought that AI is only helping the organised, urban sectors then take a look at conventional sectors like agriculture. All thanks to drones, many farmers now '
keep an eye' on their yield - and literally so - from afar. 

 All these facts came into light at an event held in Delhi recently. Organised by 
Times AI Hub in association with IIT Delhi on January 12, 2018, the event titled
 'Artificial Intelligence Conclave 2018' brought together AI experts, enthusiast companies and interested students to discuss the uses of AI and the way forward. Times AI Hub is a web-based community, connecting professionals and students, and is powered by India's leading recruitment portal TimesJobs. 

 The event was graced by industry leaders Ajay Shrivastava, CTO at Knowlarity and Prof Mayank Vatsa, IIIT Delhi ( Head - Infosys Center for AI) as keynote speakers. It also featured a panel discussion where Anurag Verma, CEO at Math Logic, Ramathreya Krishnamurthi, Business Head at Times Business Soluions, Utpal Chakraborty, Lead Architect, AI & Cognitive at L&T Infotech, RamaKrishnan M, Co-founder at Intello Labs, Krupal Modi, Lead Machine Learning Scientist at Haptik shared their views on AI leading the change in every industry. 

 ""This event was a much needed start,"" said Mayank Vatsa lauding the discussions held at the event. ""We are already late in starting such activity but it's better to be later than never. India has immense opportunities where AI algorithms can be utilised to make life better. We should tap on such opportunities,"" he added. 

 The event was attended by more than 100 AI professionals, students, and researchers from IBM, Samsung, GAIL, NIC, Infosys, Deloitte, Wipro and AI start up co-founders. The discussions ranged from AI's impact on jobs, new spheres where AI is making gradual inroads and precise pointers on which industries are using AI, and which others are new adopters. 


Ramathreya Krishnamurthi, Business Head - TimesJobs & TechGig expressed his happiness at the turnout of the maiden event from the Times AI Hub stable. ""TimesJobs recently launched 'Times AI Hub' with an aim to connect all - professionals, researchers, companies, start-ups - who are enthusiastic about Artificial Intelligence, on one platform. The initial idea was to facilitate knowledge sharing, building social connect and harnessing a collaborative. The success of this event has proven that the industry and academia fully support our belief and faith in AI and Times AI Hub is just here at the right time,"" he said. 

 The response from the industry was phenomenal with many citing that panel discussion was insightful, precise and gave them food for thought. RamaKrishnan M from Intello Labs - who was one of the panellists - said, ""This event is a great step to bring together AI enthusiasts; one thing I really liked was a mix of participants - start-ups, large firms, academicians et al."" 

 The students too were jubilant with the phenomenal industry turn out at the event. ""We keep hearing news about new inventions in AI but it's a different high when you hear so many experts talk about AI right in front of you,"" said Deepak P, a student who attended the event. 

 ""This is just the beginning and we will come up with more such successive events,"" added

112,2018-01-25,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: As the crude oil prices rise, the government may ask upstream firms like ONGC to bear a part of the kerosene and LPG subsidies, India Ratings and Research said today.

Producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd as well as gas utility GAIL were in past asked to bear between one-third to half of the under-recovery fuel retailers incurred on selling LPG and kerosene below market rate.

This subsidy sharing scheme ended last fiscal.

In a statement on its view on ONGC buying out HPCL, India Ratings said given the sharp increase in international crude price, oil marketing companies may be required to bear a part of the under-recoveries.

This would be on the lines of past when the government capped the subsidy burden it was willing to share per kilogram and per litre on LPG and kerosene, respectively.

Any under-recovery over and above the level up to which the government can bear is to be borne by upstream and oil marketing companies, it said.

""Although there is no mathematical basis for deciding the share of the subsidy to be borne by upstream or oil marketing companies, upstream companies have historically shared the bulk of the remaining subsidy burden post the government share,"" it said.

India Ratings said ONGC's acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will be credit neutral for ratings of HPCL.

ONGC, which is 68.94 per cent owned by the government, will acquire the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.

""Thus, the government of India will indirectly own 35.23 per cent in HPCL,"" it said in a statement.

Despite the change in ownership, HPCL will continue to operate as a separate entity with a strong brand. Its strategic importance to the government is likely to remain intact, given the company's role as the State's extended arm for fuel policy implementation.

""The acquisition of HPCL is likely to result in additional borrowings for ONGC,"" India Ratings said, adding that the state-owned oil producer is likely to fund the acquisition by end-January 2018.

It could use one or more of the three sources for funding -- fresh debt, cash and cash equivalents, and monetisation of its stake in entities such as GAIL, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Petronet LNG Ltd.

The combined value of its stake in the three entities is about Rs 34,400 crore.

For HPCL, the acquisition may result in some synergies in crude oil procurement with Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which is 71.63 per cent owned by ONGC.

HPCL, along with HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd and MRPL, represented 15.3 per cent of India's total crude import volume of 249 million tonne.

Also, HPCL may be able to capitalise on ONGC's petrochemical expertise while expanding its footprint in the segment.

""The acquisition may result in the merger of MPRL with HPCL. This would be beneficial as it would allow the combined entity to leverage its purchasing power,"" India Ratings said.

The combined entity would be the third-largest refiner in India, with a refining capacity of 43.1 million tones, behind IOC's 80.8 million tonnes and Reliance Industries Ltd's 62 million tonnes.

India Ratings said HPCL may have to resort to additional borrowings in case it was to acquire ONGC's stake in MRPL for cash. ONGC's stake in MRPL is worth Rs 16,400 crore.

""Moreover, HPCL may consider a combination of share swap and cash payout, where ONGC would get additional stake in HPCL against its shareholding in MRPL,"" the rating agency said.

ONGC-HPCL deal is unlikely to alter government subsidies for kerosene and LPG."
113,2018-01-25,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The downstream regulator is reworking city gas licensing rules, readying to launch 100 new city gas distribution licences, and cut myriad litigations it’s been caught in with gas companies, to rebuild itself into a more effective and credible watchdog that can help country achieve its target of raising the share of natural gas in the energy mix from 6% to 15% by 2030.

“At an annual growth rate of 5.5%, energy consumption in India would double by 2030. So the gas consumption will have to rise five times by 2030 to meet the 15% target,” Dinesh Sarraf, who has recently taken over as the chairman of Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) after retiring as chairman of Oil and Natural Gas Corp last year, told ET in an interview.

PNGRB has often been criticised in the past for less than optimal rules needed to support the development of the gas sector in the country. PNGRB was dysfunctional for more than a year for want of enough members on the board. With the appointment of Sarraf and other members to the board, the regulator seems to be back in action.

In the next two weeks, PNGRB will announce the names of 100 more districts for which it intends to award licences, Sarraf said. The choice of districts will be such that more highways have gas coverage, making inter-city commute for CNG vehicles possible, he added. So far only 91city gas licences have been awarded in the country, including 14 delivered in the last one month.

Before the auction for 100 new licences are launched by March, PNGRB plans to rework bidding norms, hoping to plug the loopholes in the existing rules often blamed for poor growth of city gas.

As per the draft guidelines, open to stakeholder consultation, winner will be chosen on the basis of the number of consumers connection and CNG stations, and the length of gas pipeline bidders promise to achieve in a given time frame, Sarraf said.

Missing targets would invite penalty, forcing companies to meet their commitment, he added. The draft rules also require bidder to offer a fixed performance guarantee, ending the previous practice where the provider of higher guarantee always won, Sarraf said.

Another problem area being tackled is the pipeline tariff after the exclusivity period, which was almost always quoted as one paisa by all bidders previously. Now there will be a minimum tariff, above which bidders can quote. 

“We are open to new suggestions and will try and include anything that can make the process better,” Sarraf said. Sarraf is attacking another key problem area for PNGRB: multiple litigations. “We are talking to gas companies, asking them to settle things outside court,” Sarraf said.

“Once litigations reduce, our people will be free to do more productive work, instead of disproportionately spending time on court cases as they do today.”

In the last one month, PNGRB has awarded city gas distribution licenses for eight districts for which an auction was held last year. Indraprastha Gas and Essel Gas won one district each while the joint venture of Indian Oil and Adani won two areas, and HPCL-Oil India has won three districts.

PNGRB, at the direction of the government, has also given GAIL licences for six more districts that will receive gas from the Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline, currently under construction."

130,2018-01-30,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Letting companies operate both as transporter and trader could lead to restrictive trade practices in the natural gas sector, and Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) plans to soon address this, its chairman has said.

“Restrictive trade practices could arise because some of the entities are present in both transportation and marketing. It may lead to certain practices that’s not fair,” DK Sarraf, chairman of PNGRB, the downstream regulator, told ET. He cited global practice of keeping trade and transport separate to support his argument.

“We are examining this and there are options available. We will see which option can resolve this perceived problem,” Sarraf said. “You have to find the balance between the development of infrastructure and protection of customers.”

Sarraf didn’t name any company but GAIL and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) are two state-owned companies that straddle both gas transportation and marketing and could be affected by any decision on the issue by the downstream regulator. Separating the two businesses at these two firms can radically alter their character.

Whether the regulator will also consider splitting the twin roles of gas trader and import terminal operator at Petronet LNG, Sarraf said, “That’s not a high priority although I am aware of that.”

Many gas consumers have in the past alleged that GAIL had abused its dominance in the gas market, a charge denied by the company. The Competition Commission is investigating about seven cases of alleged abuse of dominance by GAIL in dealing with some of its small customers.

Splitting of transportation and trading activities by companies, increased transportations facilities across the country, and optimal regulations are necessary for an efficient gas market
.
The government is working on a plan to set up a natural gas trading platform to help discover market prices for gas produced and consumed in the country. The oil ministry has hired KPMG as consultant for this effort.

“Our role would be to make regulations for the gas exchange so that it functions transparently,” said Sarraf. “We are studying our own (PNGRB) Act to see if it is good enough or requires legislative changes (to facilitate setting up of the exchange).”

The government expects the proposed gas price platform to bring transparency in the market discovery of price and certainty of return on investment to companies."

0,2018-02-03,GAIL,"GUWAHATI: Five major oil and natural gas PSUs would set up a joint company for a 1500 km gas pipeline at an estimated cost of Rs 6000 crore stretching from Guwahati to Tinsukia via Numaligarh to supply gas to the NE states, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.

The five PSUs that would form the company are ONGC, Oil India Limited, Indian Oil Corporation, Numaligarh Refinery Limited and GAIL.

""The pipeline would connect Guwahati, Numaligarh and Tinsukia in Assam to supply gas to Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. This pipeline would truly make Assam advantageous,"" Pradhan told reporters on the sidelines of the Global Investors Summit 'Advantage Assam' here.

The minister said that earlier the people of Assam would complain that oil and and gas was found in the state but its benefit did not reach it. Now the Centre has decided to change the scenario with the cooperation of the state government, he said.

""Assam has the top priority in oil and gas and projects are on to ensure that they reap the benefits under the Vision Document plan of the Central government'', he said.

GAIL signed an MoU with Assam government today and many more agreements are expected to be signed during the two-day summit.

The MoU pledged to complete the Rs 3000 crore pipeline from Bongaigaon to Guwahati which would change the scenario of supply of gas in lower Assam and bring in large scale industrialisation, the union minister said.

He thanked Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for organising the summit and added ""It is, indeed, heartening to note that these navaratna, maharatna companies along with other private and government undertakings plan to increase their investments in Assam""."
1,2018-02-04,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State oil companies have planned a capital spending of Rs 89,000 crore, or $14 billion, in 2018-19, half of which will go into exploration and production.

In the current fiscal, these companies had targeted an expenditure of Rs 87,400 crore, 70% of which has been spent in the first three quarters.

The allocation of Rs 48,000 crore towards exploration and production in Budget 2018-19 is lower than Rs 53,960 crore planned for this year. Spending on refining and marketing would rise to Rs 35,800 crore from Rs 31,200 crore in 2017-18. Investment in petrochemicals would nearly double to Rs 3,952 crore next fiscal year from Rs 2,156 crore in the current year.

Oil & Natural Gas Corp has planned the highest investment among all state oil firms, with a capex target of a little over Rs 32,000 crore in 2018-19. This would go into developing new oil and gas fields and enhancing production from existing fields.

For the current year, its planned capex is about Rs37,200 crore, including a $1.2 billion payment for GSPC’s stake in the KG Basin asset. ONGC’s capex figure will get revised upward sharply after factoring in the Rs 37,000 crore purchase of government stake in HPCL.

Overseas arm ONGC Videsh plans to spend Rs5,900 crore, about 8% lower than the current year’s target.

The second-highest investment among state oil firms is slated to come from Indian Oil, the country’s largest refiner and fuel retailer. Its planned spending of Rs 22,860 crore is a fifth higher than the current year’s target.

HPCL’s target of Rs 8,400 crore is also 18% higher than the current year’s. BPCL’s capex is planned to decline 5% to Rs7,400 crore next year.

Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL are investing heavily in expanding and upgrading refineries to produce more highgrade fuels. All petrol and diesel sold must meet BS-VI emission standards from April 2020.

 Gas transporter GAIL’s spending is set to rise 40% to Rs4,700 crore in 2018-19 as it enhances investment to complete ongoing pipeline projects."

Tahiliani has joined India Gas from BP India where he was most recently the Vice President, Strategy and Commercial. 

India Gas Solution administers the existing gas sales contracts to customers for production from the RIL-BP’s KGD6 block and is actively pursuing opportunities for marketing the proposed output from R-Series field in the KG Basin. R-Series is expected to begin producing 12 million standard cubic meters a day of natural gas from 2020. 

“The natural gas demand is rising rapidly in the country and will continue to do so in the future. Nearly half the country’s demand is being met by LNG,” said Tahiliani, explaining the business case for importing LNG and taking to Indian customers. 

He said his firm was in talks with all the players in the value chain, including customers, suppliers, pipeline owners and the regasification terminal operators, and everything would come together soon. 

BP has a huge presence globally in the LNG trading business, and Tahiliani is hoping to lean on that experience and network to bring Indian gas consumers a competitive deal. By entering LNG supply business in India, India Gas will directly compete with state-run suppliers such as GAIL, Indian Oil and Petronet LNG. 

Tahiliani said his firm is also set to begin discussions with potential customers in the country for sale of natural gas from R Series fields. “We would soon start meeting customers, gaze their interest and understand their requirements,” he said. 

Tahiliani has spent over 25 years in the oil and gas sector. He has developed gas value chain businesses and worked on oil, gas and power developments in India, Angola and Vietnam, said a company statement announcing his appointment."

In a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the 2017-18 Budget unveiled government's plan to create integrated public sector oil majors ""through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions"" so as that the merged company has ""capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions"" and is ""able to match the performance of international and domestic private companies"".

""Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) had written to the Ministry for integration with GAIL (India) Limited. However, government has not taken any decision in this regard,"" Pradhan said.

To a separate question on splitting GAIL, he said a decade-old policy provides for a natural gas transporter not having any interest in marketing of the fuel.

Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country.

Pradhan said in 2006, the government issued the Policy for Development of Natural Gas Pipelines and City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks.

""In the long run and with the maturing of gas markets, it is envisaged in the policy that the authorised entities will have transportation of natural gas as their sole business activity and will not have any business interest in the gas marketing or city or local gas distribution networks,"" he said.

Also, the policy and the provisions of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) Act, 2006 provide for all entities authorised to lay pipelines including GAIL to provide mandatory open access to their gas pipeline infrastructure on common carrier principle at non-discriminatory basis.

This open access to third parties should be given at transportation rates determined by PNGRB, he said.

The minister however did not say either way if the government was considering splitting GAIL.

Last month, Pradhan had stated that the state-run firm should focus on building natural gas pipelines as marketing can be done by ""anyone"".

He had stated that creating infrastructure to take environment friendly natural gas to uncovered parts, particularly eastern India, is a priority for the government.

Several meetings have been held in the ministry on splitting GAIL by spinning off its marketing business into a separate company and selling it to a state-owned firm.

GAIL also owns a petrochemical plant at Pata in Uttar Pradesh which too could be sold along with the marketing business to either IOC or BPCL.

The company had in the past resisted the split on grounds that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm's length, and hence do not need to be separated.

GAIL's marketing business formed 71 per cent of its 2016 -17 total sales, and 25 per cent pre-tax profit.

The government has a 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL India."
9,2018-02-07,GAIL,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on the issue of splitting gas utility GAIL today said a decade-old policy provides for a natural gas transporter not having any interest in marketing of the fuel.

Pradhan gave the response in Rajya Sabha on a written reply to a question on splitting state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd b by separating its gas marketing business from its primary role as a transporter of gas.

Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country.

This open access to third parties should be given at transportation rates determined by PNGRB, he said.

The minister, however, did not say either ways if the government was considering splitting GAIL.

GAIL, he said, was established for transportation, processing and marketing of natural gas and for establishing and managing gas pipelines and related installations.

At present, GAIL has about 11,000 km long gas pipeline network and is also developing about 3,500 km long pipelines projects in the country.

Last month, Pradhan had stated that the state-run firm should focus on building natural gas pipelines as marketing can be done by ""anyone"".

He had stated that creating infrastructure to take environment friendly natural gas to uncovered parts, particularly eastern India, is a priority for the government.

Several meetings have been held in the ministry on splitting GAIL by spinning off its marketing business into a separate company and selling it to a state-owned firm.

Pradhan had stated that the government has been taking steps to make India a gas-based economy. As part of this plan, it has even provided budgetary support of Rs 5,176 crore, or 40 per cent of the project cost, for laying of a gas pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha.

""This is the first instance of government funding a project from its budget,"" he had said.

GAIL, he said, should focus on creating infrastructure that would help take natural gas to all parts of the country, especially eastern India which has so far been unconnected.

""Marketing can be done by anyone,"" he said, responding to a question on whether government proposes to split the state- run company's pipeline and marketing businesses.

Sources said refiners Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have evinced in acquiring GAIL to expand their gas marketing business. One of the two companies could be sold the marketing business while GAIL asked to concentrate on just laying pipelines.

GAIL also owns a petrochemical plant at Pata in Uttar Pradesh which too could be sold along with the marketing business to either IOC or BPCL.

The company had in the past resisted the split on grounds that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm's length, and hence do not need to be separated.

20,2018-02-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Domestic market indices looked good on Monday with a positive start, mirroring leads from Asian markets. This came even as an index heavyweight SBI slumped over 3 per cent after a dismal December quarter earnings.

""In case of a bounceback, 10,540-10,650 would be seen as immediate resistances whereas a move below 10,398 would reinforce the selling pressure towards 10,300-10,200 levels.

State Bank of India fell 3 per cent after the state-owned lender reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years in the three months to December on the back of a surge in provisions due to bad loan divergences and a marked reversal in treasury incomes paced up by hardening bond yields. SBI, which reported a loss of Rs 2,416 crore, was tipped to post a net income of Rs 2,059.4 crore in a Bloomberg analysts' poll.

27,2018-02-15,GAIL,"Essar Oil has sold its entire production of coal-seam gas or CBM from a West Bengal block to state-owned GAIL India Ltd using the same formula that Reliance Industries used for pricing of its CBM.

GAIL will buy 2.3 million standard cubic metres per day of coal-bed methane (CBM) that Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (EOGEPL) will produce from its Raniganj block in West Bengal for USD 7.1 per million British thermal unit.

According to an evaluation of bid posted by Essar on its website, GAIL outbid Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, Graphite India Ltd and Positron Energy Pvt Ltd to bag the supplies.

The price is more than double of the USD 2.89 per mmBtu price set by the government for most of the domestically produced conventional natural gas.

Essar used the same formula which Reliance Industries had first used in 2012 to seek bids for its CBM gas from its Sohgpur block in Madhya Pradesh, and then again last year for selling the CBM. In the first instance, the oil ministry had not approved the price.

Like RIL, Essar had sought bids for potential users in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document.

GAIL bid a deductible of 1.89, which translated into a gas price of USD 7.12 per mmBtu (on gross calorific value) at today's Brent oil price of USD 64.80. At three-month Brent crude average of USD 65.8, the gas price comes to USD 7.23 on gross calorific value (GCV) basis.

Interestingly, GAIL had in the similar bid process run by RIL last year for 3 million standard cubic metres per day of Sohagpur CBM gas quoted a deductible of 3.495. RIL had bid a deductible of 1.836 to win all the supplies.

RIL's Sohagpur gas at today's oil price comes to USD 7.15 per mmBtu on GCV basis.

The formula used by RIL and Essar is the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to import long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.

EOGEPL had invited bids from prospective buyers of gas based on a government notification dated April 11, 2017, which lays out a policy framework for the early monetisation of CBM gas.

The policy provided marketing and pricing freedom at arm's length price in the domestic market to contractors of CBM blocks.

EOGEPL has invested about Rs 4,000 crore in the Raniganj East CBM block in drilling wells, setting up supply infrastructure, and laying customer pipelines to Durgapur and nearby industrial areas, according to the company.

The block has 348 completed CBM wells, alongside robust gas and water handling capacity.

The Raniganj East block is India's most prolific CBM block, which has achieved gas production of more than 1 mmscmd (million standard cubic metres per day), which will be gradually scaled up a saleable volume to 2.3 mmscmd."
24,2018-02-15,GAIL,"GAIL India will buy the entire produce for the next 15 years from Essar Oil’s coal bed methane (CBM) block of Raniganj East in West Bengal.

The state-run gas firm outbid three rivals to win the rights to buy up to 2.3 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of CBM from Essar at a crudelinked price which works out to $6.492 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) on gross calorific value basis at an oil price of $60 per barrel, according to the auction details available on Essar’s website.

GAIL confirmed it had won the auction.

The prices are to be revised every month and are linked to trailing three-month average price of crude oil. The price discovered in Essar’s auction is similar to what Reliance Industries received in its CBM auction last year.

At $60 a barrel of crude, other bids translated into a price of $6.382 per unit from Matrix Fertilizers and Chemicals, $8.582 from Graphite India and $5.215 from Positron Energy.

Despite a higher bid of $8.582 per unit, Graphite India lost out to GAIL as Essar decided a winner based on ‘total revenue maximisation’ formula, people aware of the matter said.

Graphite India had bid for a minimum of.025 mmscmd and maximum of .05 mmscmd of gas, which could have resulted in a revenue of $5.53 million for Essar.

But GAIL had sought a minimum of .050 mmscmd and a maximum of 2.3 mmscmd, the entire peak volume on offer, which could translate into a revenue of $192.59 million. Supply of gas to GAIL will begin soon, the people said.

Essar’s Raniganj block currently produces 1 mmscmd of gas and is expected to raise output to 2.3 mmscmd by 2020-21.

Last year, the government had given CBM producers the freedom to sell gas at arm’s length price in the domestic market through a transparent and competitive bidding process. This prompted Reliance Industries, another CBM producer, to hold auctions last year.

Natural gas produced from conventional fields in India is governed by a pricing formula set by the government. The price is revised every six months and is $2.89 per mmBtu at present.

Essar has spent .`4,000 crore in developing the Raniganj East CBM block so far. The company has nearly 350 completed CBM wells and put in place large gas and water handling infrastructure in its block."

30,2018-02-18,GAIL,"The proposed petrochemical complex at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, a joint project of GAIL and HPCL, seems to have hit a roadblock with the Centre asking the state government to pay Rs 5,000 crore upfront in the form of viability gap funding (VGF).

Establishing a greenfield crude oil refinery and petrochemical complex has been mandated under Schedule XIII of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, which paved the way for the creation of Telangana state.

The complex at Kakinada, East Godavari district, is proposed to be jointly set up by GAIL and HPCL, both central PSUs.

After a feasibility study by Engineers India Ltd, GAIL and HPCL signed a memorandum of understanding with the AP government during the Partnership Summit in January 2017 for setting up the 1.5 MMTPA petrochemical complex on a 2,000-acre site in the Kakinada Special Economic Zone.

But the Rs 30,000-crore project did not take off with the Centre and the state squabbling over the VGF, said a top official.

The proposed complex, with a cracker unit, was supposed to produce ethylene and its derivatives.

""SBI Caps did a preliminary financial appraisal and concluded that with a debt-equity ratio of 2:1, the project will yield internal rate of return of 9.8 per cent as against the hurdle rate (the minimum rate of return on a project) of 15 per cent.

""To bridge this gap, viability gap funding in the form of an interest-free loan of Rs 1,438 crore per year has been suggested for a 15 year period beginning from the Project Zero date,"" the official told PTI.

Following a meeting between Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and GAIL authorities, it was decided that SBI Caps would ""revise"" the financial model pegging down the power and water supply rates, he said.

Besides, an upfront VGF payment as soft loan was also agreed to be examined taking different IRRs (internal rates of return). The detailed techno-commercial report for this project was still being prepared, he added.

""The AP government has requested the Centre to reduce the IRR to 10-12 per cent on the lines of HPCL's Barmer refinery in Rajasthan.

""For the Barmer refinery, the VGF has been reduced from Rs 3,736 crore to Rs 1,123 crore per annum, adjusting the IRR to 12 per cent.

""But the Centre has been insisting that we chip in with a VGF of Rs 5,000 crore,"" the senior official involved in the project pointed out.

Naidu, during his visit to New Delhi in January, took up the issue with Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and expressed the state government's inability to foot the VGF bill. He wanted the petroleum ministry to take up the burden.

""We are awaiting a response from the Centre to our plea,"" the official added.

Meanwhile, the state government also suggested an alternative location for the proposed project.

""Instead of Kakinada, we proposed that the cracker unit be set up at the upcoming Machilipatnam Port, which is closer to the state capital Amaravati.

""This will help in economic development of the region. The Centre is yet to respond even to this plea,"" said the official."

34,2018-02-20,GAIL,"A large number of big-sized companies clocked double-digit revenue growth in the December 2017 quarter. This could be a good starting point for savvy investors to enhance their exposure to large companies through a schemes that not only focus on large-sized companies, but also believe in value investing. Franklin India High Growth Companies is one such scheme which is value conscious and selects companies that are likely to deliver earnings growth higher than the market.

Fund managers Anand Radhakrishnan, Roshi Jain and Srikesh Nair follow key valuation parameters, such as enterprise value, price-toearnings growth ratio, forward price-to-sales ratio and discounted earnings per share in selecting companies for investments. Taking into account these valuation parameters, the fund managers invest in companies which are poised for high growth in their sectors. The scheme has more than 60% of its portfolio dedicated to large-sized companies, and 30% to mid- and small-sized companies.

In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given returns of 9.4% and 22.4%, respectively, while its benchmark index, Nifty500, has given 8.7 and 14.7% during the same periods. In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers have bought in value themes represented by Infosys, Mahindra & Mahindra and GAIL.

35,2018-02-20,GAIL,"Infrastructure and industrial development commissioner Anup Chandra Pandey is busy giving finishing touches to the mega show a day away. He tells TNN how the government changed the perception of UP in the eyes of investors and how it is planning to tap UP’s potential. Excerpts…


Potential investors have an apprehension that UP’s policies and processes are too complicated and not investor friendly. How will you address this?We are simplifying processes, bringing in technology, professionals and introducing new areas for investments. For instance, we planned to introduce electric vehicles and we will introduce policy on these and have them start operating in NCR soon. The cabinet also cleared a biofuel policy, making UP the first state to do so. We have so much biomass and complain about agricultural fires. Now, we already have MoUs worth Rs 8,000 crore in this sector. While Haryana and Punjab keep burning their agri waste and Delhi has to deal with high pollution, UP will take the lead in processing this waste. UP is also the first state to come out with a logistics policy. We are going to make a mega logistics hub at Dadri which will be as big as Noida. It will be like a dry port with container depot, facility for documentation. We are linked to the Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar-Kolkata industrial corridors and have a dedicated freight corridor which will make transportation much easier.


What advantages does UP enjoy?We have competitive advantage over China, where wages have risen and the country is getting less competitive in production. UP is not just offering a 220 million strong manpower but also ease of doing business, infrastructure, governance reforms and law and order. In a short while, people will forget about China and UP will become a factory. There are lots of people from UP who have invested in other states and we are trying to bring them back. Our outreach has been national so far and the next stage is global.


What sort of response has the summit got?A few months ago, even general managers of top industries would not respond to us. Now all the top guns of India Inc are attending the summit. When we went for roadshows, many did not show interest. We tried reaching out to people through our contacts, writing letters. We even got the CM to speak to some.

Now, ITC is investing in UP. When we went to Kolkata, they said nobody would attend. Then I called ITC CEO Sanjiv Puri’s office and said my minister and I wanted to meet. We asked him for his plans and told him about our policies. He was planning to invest in Jhajjar in Haryana but now he is investing in Unnao. He came to Lucknow and met the CM. Now he is planning to set up a mega food park.


You have received a number of proposals for sectors like food processing, dairy, renewable energy. Which are the other sectors where investors are showing interest?There are several MoUs we have signed which have no material value but which will be highly beneficial in the long run. For instance, we have signed an MoU with IL&FS for the Metro. Why should we go running around to find people for investment in this field when a company like IL&FS has experience in this field. Someone has pledged Rs 27,000 crore for investment in smart cities. Then there is additional investment in startups. IIT Kanpur is our startup partner and we are expecting huge funds to come in. We have also targeted PSUs in a large way. Indian Oil, GAIL will be expanding in the state.


There is a big push for pharma sector. What are the government’s plans?UP is the largest market for pharmaceuticals but its potential is largely unexplored. We have the Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow, the biggest such institute of its kind. We also have the National Botanical Research Institute and Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants. With such great institutes, why do we need to import from elsewhere.UP can become a huge hub for pharma and we intend setting up a big pharma park in the state.


The government recently announced its ‘one district-one product’ policy. Could you elaborate on that?The market for locally produced goods is unorganised. Brass production is down while Chinhat potters have had to shut shop. We have a great stock of local handicraft and thought we should promote it. Under ODOP, we will design and promote their products, help them get funds under the Mudra Yojna, create a portal for them to advertise on, help them display at Shilpgram in Lucknow, send them for exhibitions in India and abroad and promote dignity of labour."

56,2018-02-23,GAIL,"World's largest oil company Saudi Aramco is interested in acquiring a stake in India's proposed Rs 1.8 lakh crore refinery in Maharashtra and a Rs 33,000-crore petrochemical complex in Andhra Pradesh, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.

After talks with Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid A Al-Falih, he said the oil kingpin is also interested in partnering in the second phase of strategic oil reserves India plans to build shortly.

""We have moved beyond mere envisaging of interest and now modalities are being discussed,"" he said without elaborating.

Besides Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) has also showed interest in the world's biggest refinery-cum-petrochemical complex that India plans to build in Maharashtra. State-run Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are partners in the 60 million tonnes and adjacent petrochem complex.

In Kakinada, state-owned HPCL and GAIL India are looking at building a 1.5 million tonnes capacity petrochemical complex at the cost of Rs 33,000 crore.

""They are more than interested,"" he said.

Pradhan said Saudi Arabia is India's most reliable partner, supplying close to a fifth of country's oil needs.

Saudi Aramco, the Gulf nation's flagship oil firm, sells 36.5 million tonnes of oil annually to India.

It had previously been interested in new greenfield refineries set up in India but none of the interests materialised in investments. The world's biggest oil producer was interested in the 9 mt Bhatinda refinery but exited the project in 1998. Thereafter, the refinery was set up by HPCL in joint venture with steel baron Lakshmi N Mittal.

Saudi Aramco had also initially shown interest in IOC's 15 mt Paradip refinery in Odisha but walked out of the project in 2006. The Indian Oil Corp (IOC) set up the refinery on its own thereafter.

The refinery-cum-petrochemical complex on the west coast is expected to be commissioned by 2022.

Pradhan said also discussed during talks was the 6 million tonnes capacity strategic oil storage planned in second phase.

ADNOC has filled half of the 1.5 million tonnes capacity underground oil storage at Mangalore that was built as part of Phase-1 of Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) programme, he said.

In phase-I, 5.33 million tonnes of storage capacity, enough to meet country's oil requirement of 10 days, has been built.

He said the plan for phase-II will shortly go to the cabinet for approval."

67,2018-02-27,GAIL,"Talking with ET Now, DK Sarraf, Chairperson, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), highlights the importance of cleaner fuel and how the government's decision to start the ninth round of bidding process for City Gas Distribution Network will help the nation to achieve its target by 2030.Edited excerpts: 

Tell us more in detail about the ninth bidding round of the City Gas Distribution Network. What does the government have in store for you?Till now, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) awarded various companies to do the city gas distribution (CGD) operations in 91 districts. Out of this, 13 were awarded during the last three months. 

At this stage, we do not want to increase the operations but want to multiply it and that is why we are coming out with a mega round, where we plan to authorise as many as 174 districts either in full or in parts. We are dividing all these districts into 86 geographical areas to make them viable and have already made the draft regulations for the purpose. 

We have even hosted public consultation and are in the process of finalising the bidding parameters and regulations. In addition to it, we have already web-hosted the list of districts and their clubbing into different geographical areas on our website. We think that the bidding process would start sometime in March. 


What are these new 80 plus districts that you plan to cover and the geographies as until now the CGD Network was only concentrated in Delhi, CR, Mumbai as well as some parts of Gujarat.You are absolutely right. The NCR, Gujarat and Mumbai covers almost 85% to 90% of the City Gas Distribution work in the country. So, now our plan is to take the Gas Distribution Network across India starting from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Assam and Tripura. 

Our target is to cover almost every corner of the country for rational reasons. First, natural gas is a much cleaner fuel, it is much more comfortable to be used in the domestic kitchens as well as for the vehicles. Also, it is pocket friendly and costs lower than the conventional fuels.


Any idea about the number of connections or households that could benefit of the cross-country network plan?Keeping in mind that the proportion of natural gas resources in India is at 6.2% compared to 24% globally, our main aim is to maximise the number of connections to reach the target of 25% energy consumption through natural gas by 2030. 


Do you think that the investment in City Gas sector will increase, considering that we are now aiming for a cross-country expansion and also because this round of bidding will be huge in comparison to the previous one?Yes, the total investment in the geographical areas which we are thinking, would be around Rs 50,000 crore.


It is a sizable sum. Are you also planning to go with the expansion in a phased manner or would all of it be done in one round?No, we would ideally want this to be done in one around and hence are in the process of consulting industry. But if in any case, the investment would not come in one single year or single quarter, we are expecting that eventually it will flow over a couple of years.


Where do you see maximum participation or interest coming in from apart from the regulars that is IGL, MGL or for that matter Gujarat Gas? Could we even see oil marketing companies pitching up for a share in the City Gas Distribution Network?Other than the regulars such as Gujarat Gas, IGL and MGL, there are several smaller companies which have shown interest to enter this sector. The oil marketing companies also have started focussing on City Gas area, knowing that gas is the fuel of future and ultimately they have to maintain their total market share in terms of liquids and gas. Apart from it, GAIL is one company which is also quite focussed in this area through its subsidiaries and joint ventures."

The company would also enter into an agreement with state-owned GAIL in the middle of March this year for selling its entire production of CBM to the PSU. 

""We will submit a proposal detailing on the potential of share gas exploration to the steering committee set up by the ministry for the Raniganj CBM block in March,"" MD and CEO of EOGPL Vilas Tawde told reporters here today. 

He said that the potential reserves of shale gas at the Raniganj block was approximately 1.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf), adding that it would be done under the simultaneous exploitation policy under single licensing system for conventional and unconventional energy of the government. 

""Both shale gas and CBM are complimentary in nature. So it makes perfect synergy to go for exploitation of shale gas along with the present production of CBM at Raniganj,"" he said. 

The company had obtained licenses for exploration of CBM at Raniganj, in addition to four other blocks in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Raniganj was the only producing block. 

Tawde said that currently, the company was producing nearly one million standard cubic metres of gas per day (mscmd) at Raniganj, out of which 0.5 mscmd was supplied to local customers, and the balance was being flared up owing to non-supply to Mattix fertiliser plant at Panagarh in East Burdwan, due to its closure. 

He said the company had lost Rs 400 crore due to flaring of gas. ""It is criminal to flare up a single molecule of gas,"" Tawde added. 

""The company will enter into an agreement with GAIL for supplying the entire production of CBM to the PSU from March this year. The price arrived at is USD 8.08 per mmbtu based on the Rasgas formula. It will supply at this price to GAIL for a period of 15 years,"" he said. 

GAIL would find customers for selling the gas, he said. 

So far, EOGPL had invested Rs 4,000 crore for drilling 350 wells at Raniganj block out a total of 500. 

""Our target is to ramp up production to 2.3 mscmd in the next two to three years,"" he said. 

Till the GAIL pipeline to Durgapur was complete under Urja Ganga Gas Grid, the PSU would utilise the infrastructure already set up by the company for distribution of gas. 

By the end of fiscal 2019, the company was expecting a revenue of Rs 600 crore from Raniganj operations."

9,2018-03-06,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: After crude oil, India today began importing natural gas from the US, with the first shipment of LNG under a 20-year deal being flagged off from Louisiana.

State-owned gas utility GAIL India has contracted 3.5 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass liquefaction facility in Louisiana.

""The cargo has been loaded on-board GAIL's first chartered LNG ship 'Meridian Spirit'. This LNG cargo originated from Cheniere Energy's LNG export facility at Sabine Pass LNG project,"" GAIL said in a statement. ""The cargo will discharge LNG at Dabhol terminal of GAIL (in Maharashtra) on or around 28th of this month.""

Last October, India imported its first shipment of crude oil from the US. The US had stopped oil exports in 1975, a ban lifted by former US President Barack Obama in 2015.

GAIL had signed a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with the US LNG exporter Cheniere Energy in December 2011. The SPA went into effect March 1. Under terms of the agreement, Cheniere will sell and make available for delivery to GAIL about 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG.

Cheniere's LNG is based on natural gas sourced from the US market, which provides access to abundant and low-cost gas resources.

The ship set sail after a ceremony to mark the occasion at Sabine Pass in the presence of Cheniere CEO Jack Fusco and GAIL Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi.

""The commencement of this agreement marks the start of a long and productive relationship between Cheniere and GAIL,"" said Fusco.

GAIL is one of the foundation customers of Cheniere having signed the contract in 2011 and India remains an important market for LNG, the statement said.

""With supplies commencing from the US, GAIL will have a diversified portfolio both on price indexation and geographical locations,"" Tripathi said. ""This long-term agreement would go in a long way in strengthening relationship between GAIL and Cheniere and reinforcing India-US trade ties.""

Cheniere Energy, Inc is the leading exporter of US LNG. It is currently operating and constructing its Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana and is constructing a second liquefaction facility near Corpus Christi, Texas. When both projects are complete, it is expected to be a top-5 global supplier of LNG.

GAIL is India's biggest natural gas transportation and marketing company. It is expanding pipeline network by 4,000 km at an investment of over USD 3 billion to operate over 15,000 km by 2020.

15,2018-03-09,GAIL,"By Eltaf Najafizada

After decades of talks, Afghanistan finally broke ground last month on a $7.5 billion gas pipeline that will run through areas controlled by the Taliban. Even more surprising: The militant group is backing the project.

The Taliban “deems it its responsibility to revive foundational economic and reconstruction work in the country and asks international construction companies to help the Afghans in this regard,” Zabihullah Mujahed, a spokesman, said in a statement last month, noting that talks on the pipeline dated back to when the Taliban governed the nation.

The endorsement from a group that has fought the U.S.-backed government in Kabul for the past 17 years raises a slight hope for a political settlement even as violence continues to rage. President Ashraf Ghani last week presented his most comprehensive peace offering yet to the Taliban, which controls or contests nearly half the country. He’s open to recognizing the group as a political movement and would help remove international sanctions.

“After the project’s completion, it will have some sort of positive impact on peace talks between the Taliban and the government,” said Harun Mir, a political analyst in Kabul. “The Taliban who live there can benefit too and that may open the gate for talks.”

The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline will eventually carry an annual 33 billion cubic meters of gas, creating thousands of jobs and generating more than $400 million in annual revenue for the cash-strapped government in Kabul. State-owned Turkmengaz, Afghan Gas Enterprise and GAIL India Ltd. are among companies working on the project.

The Afghan section of the pipeline -- about 500 miles passing through some Taliban-controlled areas -- is scheduled to be finished in two years. It will then reach Pakistan before crossing its heavily fortified border with India.

Ensuring security will be crucial as its runs along a highway in southern Afghanistan that has been beset by frequent attacks. Its success also hinges on regional cooperation among countries that have less than rosy relations.

“We will have no any enmity relations with any country in the future,” Ghani told a hundreds-strong audience in Herat at a ceremony attended by Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and M. J. Akbar, India’s junior external affairs minister. “We just want to secure our national interest.”

Ghani didn’t detail security arrangements and only briefly suggested that local authorities would be responsible for the pipeline’s safety.


Cash Incentives
Ghani’s government has expressed skepticism of the Taliban’s intentions. The administration won’t make payments to the Taliban and it’s “premature” to trust their assurances, according to Dawa Khan Menapal, a presidential spokesman.

“Families, friends and relatives of Taliban can use it as well -- so it’s their responsibility to protect and defend any national projects,” Menapal said.

Ghani has a lot riding on the project’s success. His administration has struggled to implement any meaningful economic gains in the midst of worsening violence across the country.

John R. Bass, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, tweeted last month that the project will “energize regional cooperation” and “become an important source of revenue.”

That optimism is being pared with realities on the ground. The conflict killed or wounded more than 10,000 civilians last year, according to the United Nations. In January, the Taliban claimed attacks in the capital that killed and wounded hundreds. Islamic State has also slowly extended its reach in Afghanistan.


Mutual Allegations
“Even if the Taliban has said they won’t cause problems, there are many other militant groups that could,” said Michael Kugelman, a senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. Also “the Taliban could well change its mind.”

Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan are also at a nadir amid mutual allegations that both nations support terror groups striking each other. It’s also questionable whether India will rely on a pipeline that passes through its northern arch-rival.

“The present circumstances of heightened India-Pakistan tension and worsening conditions in Afghanistan make the project even less viable than it was a few years ago,” said Shashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London."
16,2018-03-09,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp may sell stake in its mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to fund acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), a senior official said.

ONGC had borrowed money from banks to buy government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.

""We traditionally have been a debt-free company and would like to return to that status as soon as possible. We have assets which can be monetised to payoff the debt,"" he said.

ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in nation's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC), which at today's trading price is worth close to Rs 26,000 crore. It also holds 4.86 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth over Rs 3,600 crore.

""We will sell sales in IOC and GAIL only when the price is right. And it is not possible to sell all the shares in one go,"" he said, adding that an alternative to it is selling stake in ONGC-Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL).

OPaL's 1.1 million tonnes capacity petrochem plant at Dahej in Gujarat was commissioned last year and has reached 100 per cent capacity in February.

""We have invested Rs 30,000 crore in the project and always had plans to sell a minimum of 26 per cent stake in the project to a strategic investor,"" the official said. ""Now that the plant has come up well and stabilised, this is the time to monetise it.""

The official said several companies including some global giants have evinced interest in taking equity in the project. He however refused to name the firms due to commercial reasons.

Saudi and Kuwaiti firms are said to be interested in taking a stake in the project.

The project was originally conceived in 2006 and has witnessed cost and time overruns. It was initially planned to be built at a cost of Rs 12,440 crore but ended up with actual investment of Rs 30,000 crore.

ONGC was originally supposed to keep just 26 per cent stake while gas utility GAIL was to take 19 per cent. 5 per cent was to be taken by Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) and the remaining was to be sold to a strategic investor.

But GAIL ended up paying for only 9 per cent and GSPC for only 0.2 per cent. The remaining cost was borne by ONGC.

The official said ONGC already has government approval to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.

ONGC, which completed HPCL acquisition at the end of January, has been a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status. The short-term loan it availed of has provision to pre-pay without any penalty.

It will pre-pay the one-year tenure loan fro sale of one or more of its assets, he said."

Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor General appearing for the companies, submitted that NCLAT's refusal to sanction the scheme was not only legally but also factually unsustainable.

The appellate tribunal did not consented with NCLT that the one of the ground for rejection was that life of the scheme was March 31, 2017 and there is no record to suggest that the same has been extended.

NCLAT observed that extract of 101st meeting of the board Ratnagiri Gas and Power held on March 23, 2017 and extract of minutes of Konkan LNG on March 30, 2017 show that the demerger scheme was extended to March 31, 2018.

""From the record placed before the Tribunal, we find that the Long Stop Date of March 31, 2017 was extended to March 31 2018,"" said NCLAT in its judgement pronounced on February 28.

The tribunal had also observed that one of ground of rejection was that Power Finance Corporation (PFC), which was one of the secured creditors had dissented to the scheme.

""However, we find that such finding is contrary to the records. IDBI Bank, which is the lead creditor, filed an application before the tribunal, wherein it is specifically and categorically stated that initially PFC had objected to the scheme, however, the said objection was withdrawn subsequently,"" it said.

The scheme was first filed by Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private Ltd, which is a petitioner company and Konkan LNG Private Ltd, a petitioner/resulting company before the Delhi High Court, which had later transferred the case to NCLT.

Incorporated in July 2005 Ratnagiri Gas and Power is promoted by NTPC and GAIL. The company was set up to takeover and revive the assets of Dabhol Power Company Project."

19,2018-03-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: After picking up the best from top engineering colleges, public sector companies are now descending on B-school campuses where the placement season is in progress. PSUs from Indian Oil, Gail and Oil & Natural Gas Corp to financial institutions such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and National Housing Bank (NHB) are lining up at Indian Institutes of Management and other leading business schools to tap into the top talent for roles in marketing, finance, operations and sales. 

On offer are paycheques as competitive as those from any financial services company in the private sector, said placement officials. “This year, we have noticed that the average salary offered by PSUs is better than the overall average salaries at IIMs,” said a student at IIM-Kozhikode.

A few public sector units have made offers upwards of Rs 21 lakh a year, IIM sources said. With the lure of more secured jobs than in the private sector, student response is strong, too.



PSUs made at least 15 offers to final year students at IIMs Kozhikode and Bangalore, two B-schools they had given a miss last year. At Delhi’s Faculty of Management Studies (FMS), the average salary offered by PSUs swelled by about 50%. At XLRI-Jamshedpur, the number of offers jumped by 50% from last year and average pay by 30%. PSUs were in attendance on the first few days of placement at IIM-Indore, giving tough competition to the private sector. At IIM-Calcutta, IOC made a couple of offers this year.

PSUs started visiting IIT and IIM campuses in 2011, but then stayed away for a few years after a petition filed in the Madras High Court challenged such preferential hiring by government-owned companies. While they returned to campuses in 2016 after the petition was dismissed, this is the first year when state-run companies made their presence felt in a big way across B-schools.

PSU executives said they were keeping a low profile on campus recruitment as public sentiment remained conservative when it came to them hiring from top institutes by paying high salaries. But with some of the companies planning big investments and the government’s push to improve efficiency and speed up decision-making, they are quietly, but steadily, increasing hiring from such institutes. 

“Since the ban was lifted, PSUs have only this year warmed up to campus hiring. As compared to last year, where we had no PSU visiting us, this year has been quite productive,” said a person at career development services at IIMBangalore, who did not wish to be quoted. Besides fat paycheques, PSUs also offer job security, same person said, adding: “A few students prefer a mix of both and are keen to take up offers from PSUs.” According to FMS placement convener A Venkatraman, “the primary reason for the rise in student interest to join PSUs is that the salaries at PSUs along with benefits have become quite attractive.”

Last year, the average salary offered by three government-run companies — IOC, SBI and SBI Capital Market — at FMS was Rs 11 lakh per annum. This time, the average from GAIL, IOCL, Bank of Baroda and SBI Life increased to .`16 lakh. This year, GAIL, HPCL and IOC participated in the placement process at XLRI, along with first time recruiters like NHB.

PSUs have been competing with marquee recruiters in the first week of placements at IIM-Indore, unlike previous years when they used to come at the fag end of the season. “The number of offers rolled out by PSUs has also increased by 60% as compared to last year, showing a positive sign for further placement seasons,” said Bhavya Kapoor, officer-placements at IIM-Indore.

Indore is expecting two more PSUs to visit the campus in the coming days. Major PSU recruiters from the oil and gas, finance and other sectors have visited IIM-Indore so far. “These PSUs have offered permanent positions and comparable roles spanning across all key domains of management,” Kapoor said. At IIM-Kozhikode, BPCL and IOC together made 11 offers.

IOC, which visited the campus for the first time, made six offers."

26,2018-03-14,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has cancelled GAIL’s license to build Surat-Paradip natural gas pipeline and ordered encashment of its performance bank guarantee after the state firm failed to make progress on the project six years after obtaining license. 

PNGRB, the downstream regulator, had authorised GAIL to lay Surat-Paradip pipeline in April 2012. After GAIL failed to submit its project funding plans for years, the regulator penalised the state firm by ordering encashing of a quarter of its Rs 20 crore performance bank guarantee in September 2015. 

GAIL’s challenge of the regulator’s order was dismissed by Delhi High Court in April 2017, following which Rs 5 crore of bank guarantee was encashed. The regulator also directed GAIL to replenish this amount as bank guarantee and quickly submit financial closure plan for the project. 

GAIL then submitted a financial closure report, which was accepted by PNGRB. On 18 January this year, PNGRB wrote to GAIL intimating that its financial closure plan has been accepted and the state firm must replenish within 15 days the Rs 5 crore guarantee already encashed, failing which the balance amount of Rs 15 crore would also be encashed and license to lay the Surat-Paradip pipeline terminated. 

In response, GAIL argued that since its financial closure plan has now been accepted by PNGRB, the latter should consider restoring the Rs 5 crore guarantee amount. On 20 February, PNGRB again wrote to GAIL asking it to explain in a week why its license not be cancelled for not meeting the previous directive. 

“Considering that enough time and chances have already been provided to GAIL for making good the encashed performance bank guarantee amount of Rs 5 crore, and also the ground progress made in implementing Surat-Paradip pipeline project is NIL after about six years from the date of authorisation,” the PNGRB wrote in its Tuesday order, concluding that GAIL had failed to perform its obligations. 

“Thus, action under the provision of Regulation 16(1)(c) be taken for encashment of the balance performance bank guarantee amount of Rs 15 crore and authorisation of GAIL (India) Ltd for Surat-Paradip Natural Gas Pipeline project be terminated,” the PNGRB wrote in the order. 

Lower domestic gas production and consumption has kept gas pipelines largely underutilised across the country for the last many years, a key reason why gas companies haven’t been too excited about building new gas pipelines for which they had obtained licenses years ago. Companies must build pipelines within a reasonable period or must give up their claim, else they are likely to be seen as squatters and get their licenses terminated."

31,2018-03-16,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-run oil firms will pay 16% less dividend to the government in 2017-18 than they did last year, following easing of pressure after the Centre gained Rs 37,000 crore from sale of its stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), said officials.

In all, state oil firms will pay Rs 14,600 crore to the government in this financial year, according to officials, who said these firms have already paid about Rs 12,500 crore and that the balance is on its way. This amount includes the final dividend declared for FY17 and the interim dividend for FY18, they said. 

Indian Oil Corporation has paid the maximum Rs 5,500 crore, and ONGC Rs 5,200 crore. Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, Oil India, Gail and other smaller firms have paid the balance amount.

In 2016-17, state-run oil firms paid Rs 17,500 crore in dividend to the central government, as per the petroleum and natural gas ministry’s published data. Dividend in 2015-16 was Rs 10,200 crore. Oil firms are among the most profitable state firms, and the biggest contributors of dividend income to the government.

Last year, the state firms were under tremendous pressure from the government to raise dividend payment so that the state could provide more to development programmes without fear of breaching the fiscal deficit targets. The government’s advice to state firms has been to borrow more to meet capital spending needs, instead of cutting down on dividends. Some oil companies were also pressured into declaring special dividend just a few days before the financial year 2016-17 closed.

In 2017-18, the pressure to extract dividend from oil companies has been slightly less. State oil firms have reported a similar profit in the first three quarters of the current fiscal as they did in the year-ago period. Long negotiations between finance ministry officials and state firms’ executives often precede companies’ decision on dividend payouts. 

This time ONGC pleaded it would pay less dividend than last year since it had already spent about $7 billion (about Rs 45,500 crore) on the purchase of the government stake in HPCL and a gas field from Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation. Meanwhile, the stake sale in HPCL has made it a subsidiary of ONGC and, therefore, any future dividend payout would no more go to the government. 

Every state-run firm must pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of its net profit or 5% of its net worth, whichever is higher, subject to the maximum dividend permitted under the law, according to an official guideline. A state company is expected to pay the maximum dividend possible until it can justify that the funds retained are being optimally leveraged to ensure higher investment."
33,2018-03-18,GAIL,"NEW DELHi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) may buy 26 per cent stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs 20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms.

Following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's February 2017 Budget announcement of creating integrated oil majors, IOC and BPCL had submitted separate proposals to buy the government's 54.89 per cent stake in India's biggest gas marketing and transportation firm, GAIL.

A top source said since the government is not looking at actual merger of oil companies but only transfer of its ownership to a cash rich PSU, the best option would be to split the 54.89 per cent holding in GAIL equally between IOC and BPCL.

At Friday's closing price of Rs 440.85 a share for GAIL on BSE, the stake is worth close to Rs 41,000 crore.

In January this year, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bought out government's 51.11 per cent stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore. But HPCL hasn't been merged with ONGC and continues to remain a separate listed company with the same board. After the buyout, HPCL has become a subsidiary of ONGC, which gets up to two seats on the company board.

The source said IOC and BPCL too can follow the same model and split the government's stake equally among themselves. GAIL will become their subsidiary and will continue to operate as a listed company with an independent board. IOC and BPCL would get to appoint one director each on GAIL board.

Like in case of ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, the government would get to encash its holding in GAIL yet retain control over the company through IOC and BPCL.

The source said the government has so far not taken any view on the proposals made by IOC and BPCL. How and to whom the stake would be sold will be decided after inter-ministerial consultations, he said adding that the option of splitting the stake equally among the two firms is one of the options that would be considered during such deliberations.

Jaitley in the 2017-18 Budget had unveiled government's plan to create integrated public sector oil majors ""through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions"" so as that the merged company has ""capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions"" and is ""able to match the performance of international and domestic private companies?.

Following this, ONGC expressed interest in taking over HPCL while IOC and BPCL said they keen on taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty.

The government took up ONGC's proposal first and the transaction was completed at January-end this year.IOC, the largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company in the country, wanted to either acquire another refiner to add to its capacity or a gas company like GAIL.

The firm feels it already has a fledging gas business in under-construction liquefied natural gas terminals, city gas distribution projects and gas marketing. And GAIL, the nation's biggest gas transporter and marketing company, would complement that.

BPCL, on the other hand, too has natural gas ambitions and wrote to the oil ministry saying GAIL was its number one choice for acquisition. It listed Oil India Ltd, the nation's second largest exploration firm, as its number two choice.

The government holds 66.13 per cent stake in OIL, which at current market price is worth about Rs 18,000 crore.

Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country. The source said the government has not taken any decision on the proposals sent by other PSUs."

""Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has accorded the Provisional Acceptance to GAIL on February 2 for the proposal for laying, building, operating or expanding Barauni-Guwahati natural gas pipeline as an integral part of Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra natural gas pipeline,"" he said.

In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, he said the pipeline from Barauni in Bihar to Guwahati in Assam would be 672-km long and would be 24-inch in diameter.

""The tentative route of the main trunk pipeline in Barauni to Siliguri in West Bengal, Bongaigaon in Assam and then to Guwahati,"" he said.

The pipeline would be executed in 36 months from the first notification of Right of User (RoU) acquisition. ""The project is likely to be completed by 2021-22,"" he said.

""In this regard an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed on February 3, 2018 between GAIL and Government of Assam,"" he said.

As per the MoU, ""Government of Assam would facilitate GAIL (India) Ltd to obtain necessary permissions/ registrations/ approvals/ clearances etc from the concerned departments/ agencies/ authorities of the state as per the existing policies/rules and regulations of the state government,"" he added.

Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra pipeline is being targeted to be completed by 2019-20."
42,2018-03-19,GAIL,"Indian equity market had a disappointing session on Monday, as Nifty slipped below its crucial 200-DMA. The benchmark was on a downward slope for the entire session and it ended the day losing 100.90 points or 0.99 per cent.

 The advance decline ratio remained heavily in favour of the former.

 As we approach Tuesday’s trade, we stare at a probable break of key support levels. We are presently dealing with two most important support levels of the recent past.



 The first level is 10,163, which is the 200-DMA on the daily chart; and second is the 28-month long upward raising trend support of 10,040. The zones of 10,040-10,163 are expected to provide support to the market, failing which, we will stare at a possible initiation of an intermediate bear trend. Tuesday will see the levels of 10,160 and 10,230 as a potential resistance area. Supports come in at 10,040 and 9,980 zones. There are still chances that the Nifty might hold on to these supports at the close.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 34.0379. A bullish divergence is observed. Nifty formed a fresh 14-period low, while RSI did not. The daily MACD has reported a negative crossover. It is now bearish while trading below its signal line. If we look strictly at the pattern analysis, though the Nifty has ended below its 200-DMA, it still stays within its filter. 

 Further, it also eyes another important pattern support of 10,040, which remain in very close vicinity. On a theoretical note, Nifty still has chance to avert more weakness if it manages to crawl above 200-DMA again.

 Overall, it would be extremely crucial to see how the markets behaves vis-à-vis the levels of 10,040-10,160 on a closing basis. The Nifty will be able to avert the weakness if it manages to crawl back above these levels.

 However, at the same time, we now have to take into account the fact that if the levels of 10,040 is significantly breached, we are staring at some prolonged weakness and the levels of 200-DMA will become a resistance for the market in the immediate short term.

 We advise refraining from taking any major directional view until a validation of the current trend comes.

 A highly cautious view is advised for tomorrow.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Amid chaos, fresh longs were also seen being added in stocks like Nalco, SRF, Tata Communications, Divi’s Labs, GAIL, Reliance, Power Grid, Star, Marico, Grasim, Petronet, Larsen & Toubro and Titan.

WTO Ministerial Starts Today
Representatives from 50 countries will be gathering in New Delhi on 19-20 March for an informal World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting. The 50 nations will engage in free and frank discussions on global trade to explore the options for resolving various issues and re-invigorating the WTO. The meeting would be more of an ""ice-breaker"" as it is being held after the collapse of talks at the Buenos Aires WTO Ministerial in December. 


IOC, BPCL May Buy 26% Each in GAIL 
State-owned Indian Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs 20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms. Following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's February 2017 Budget announcement of creating integrated oil majors, IOC and BPCL had submitted separate proposals to buy the government's 54.89% stake in India's biggest gas marketing and transportation firm, GAIL. The government is looking at transfer of its ownership to a cash rich PSU and the best option would be to split the 54.89% holding in GAIL equally between IOC and BPCL. 


HC Bars TRAI from Penal Action Against Vodafone 
The Madras High Court has ordered the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India not to take any coercive or penal action against Vodafone India, while staying the regulator’s demand that the carrier put all tariff plans on its website, including those offered to retain individual customers. The court will now hear the matter on April 13. It gave Trai time till March 28 to file counter-affidavits and till April 6 to file rejoinders. The order effectively allows Vodafone — and possibly Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular to give segmented offers to specific subscribers whom it wants to retain, without offering that plan to other users, till the case is settled. 


SC Ruling: Cos, Investors Face Higher Tax 
Holding companies of many Indian business houses, corporates investing in subsidiaries and associates, as well as several large individual investors will have to cough up more tax after a Supreme Court ruling last week. The verdict will prevent many companies and investors from treating their entire outgo of interest on borrowings as ‘expenditure’. This will be applicable to almost all holding entities and several corporates earning dividend from subsidiaries and group companies. Even when shares held are treated as ‘stock in trade’ and not ‘investment’, the assessee, should be disallowed from treating a slice of the loan interest as expenditure. 


GST Returns Mismatch
With only 16% of the summary sales returns under GST matching with the final returns, the revenue department has started to analyse major gaps with a view to check any possible tax evasion. According to the GST returns data, 34% of businesses paid Rs 34,400 crore less tax between July-December while filing initial summary return (GSTR-3B). These 34% of the businesses have paid Rs 8.16 lakh crore to the exchequer by filing GSTR-3B, whereas analysis of their GSTR-1 data show that their tax liability should have been Rs 8.50 lakh crore. 


PNB Case Not a Systemuc Problem: World Bank
The World Bank does not feel that nearly Rs 13,000-crore PNB scam is indicative of a systemic problem with the nation's financial sector, in sharp contrast to its Bretton Woods peer IMF that had called for more changes on the governance front to prevent recurrence of such frauds. ""One scam doesn't make a systemic story,"" he added, speaking at a logistics industry event. 


ZEE Call Off 9X Media Acquisition
Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has terminated the acquisition of the music broadcaster 9X Media announced in October last year. Replying to an ET query, a ZEE spokesperson said that the deal has been “terminated/called-off” by ZEE due to “non-completion of certain material conditions precedent”. Subhash Chandra-promoted ZEE had agreed to pick up 100% stake in 9X Media and its subsidiary INX Music for a total cash consideration of Rs 160 crore. 


Passport Details of Directors
Ministry of Corporate Affairs is considering a proposal to seek passport details of all individuals who serve as directors on the board of companies in a bid to prevent loan defaulters like Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi leaving the country. In case a person with Director Identification Number (DIN) does not have a passport, the ministry plans to obtain a certificate in the form of declaration that the person does not have the passport, sources said. It is also proposed that the prospective DIN seekers will have to submit passport details for obtaining the 8-digit unique id provided by the ministry.

54,2018-03-25,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant. 

GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19 per cent stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat. 

But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs 996.28 crore. This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility's stake dropped first to 17 per cent, then to 15.5 per cent and now about 9 per cent, sources privy to the development said. 

""It doesn't make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,"" they said. 

The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs 12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs 30,000 crore. 

After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19 per cent stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs 19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs 21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date. 

Sources said when project cost was revised to Rs 19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17 per cent. This was done because the company's board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs 1,000 crore. 

Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs 996.28 crore towards the 17 per cent stake, they said. 

But when the project cost went up further to Rs 21,396 crore, the promoter's equity contribution increased from Rs 5,860.5 crore to Rs 6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio. 

GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5 per cent stake. 

Now that the project cost almost touched Rs 30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9 per cent stake. 

Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38 per cent of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake. 

ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5 per cent stake, did not make more equity contributions. 

ONGC had attributed the increase in project cost primarily to additional cost of Phase-II captive power plant and increase in cost of building the Phase-I electricity generating unit."

Rs 1000-cr LoUs Due by March 31
The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may have to step in to avoid an unprecedented event in Indian banking. Close to ?1,000 crore of Union Bank of India’s exposure on account of letters of undertakings (LoUs) issued by Punjab National Bank is due in the next few days. If the state-owned PNB does not pay back the amount by March 31, Union Bank, a government-owned lender, will have to treat PNB as a defaulter in its books, provide for the loan, and even classify the amount as non-performing asset (NPA) if auditors insist.

IRFC Likely to Get Sovereign Guarantee for Bonds
The government is likely to extend sovereign guarantee to the bonds issued by the Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC), making it easier for the financial arm of Indian Railways to borrow desired funds from the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Indian Railways had signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2015 with the state-run insurer to seek Rs 1.5 lakh crore over a period of five years through bonds issued by the IRFC. 


Collateral Damage ?
The escalation of global trade protectionist measures into a ""full-scale global trade war"" will damage the Indian economy as well, industry body Assocham has said. According to Assocham, a ""full-scale"" global trade war will impact the country's exports and enlarge its current account deficit (CAD). A further erosion in ""market confidence"" can also lead to an outflow of portfolio investment thereby ""taking a toll on the dollar rates"". 


ONGC may Buy Out GAIL in OPaL State-owned Oil and Natural Gas may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant. GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19% stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat. But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to Rs 996.28 crore. 


NCLT Advances Essar Steel Hearing to Tuesday The National Company Law Tribunal has advanced the hearing on Essar Steel dispute to Tuesday, March 27, from April 4 as the ruling needs to be pronounced before the second round of binding bids takes place. SSG Capital, Numetal, Arcelor-Mittal, Vedanta Resources, Tata Steel and Nippon are among the six entities that initially showed interest in acquiring the steel company owned by the Ruia family. The resolution professional, Satish Gupta, has set April 2 as the last date for giving binding bids for Essar Steel that owes over Rs 49,000 crore to banks. 


OMCs Pushed to Defer Loan Recovery under Free LPG Connection SchemeState-run fuel retailers have decided to defer recovery of installments on loan given to poor households for buying stove and the first cooking gas cylinder, or both, at the time of getting free LPG connection under the Centre’s ‘Ujjwala’ scheme. According to the decision, taken after a nudge from the oil ministry, public sector oil marketing companies will not recover their loan for the next six refills booked by Ujjwala households. All existing Ujjwala beneficiaries with loan will also not have to pay their outstanding installments for the next six refills.


NSIC Accuses UBI of Giving 'Incorrect' Info to BoursesThe National Small Industries Corporation has accused the United Bank of India of providing ""factually incorrect"" information to stock exchanges and not releasing over Rs 173 crore in lieu of bank guarantees, days after the Enforcement Directorate launched a probe into the bank guarantees case. The allegation and counter-claims started days after the Enforcement Directorate registered a money laundering case in connection with an alleged fraud of over Rs 173 crore in the UBI in 2016, involving the NSIC in West Bengal. 


Policy on MSP 50% Higher than Production Cost Soon
The government will soon come out with a policy to ensure that farmers get the support price 1.5 times higher than the production cost, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said today. Government think tank Niti Aayog has come out with a draft policy after discussion with states and it will be finalised soon after further deliberations, he added. MSPs of some crops are already 50% higher than the cost of production.

74,2018-03-27,GAIL,"Oil marketing companies are in a sticky situation -- HPCL, IOC and BPCL have all failed to keep their charm for investors in 2017-18. Reason? Rising crude prices are seen as the culprit.

On Tuesday, crude pushed higher on worries of supply disruptions, driven by tension in the Middle-East. It went above $70 per barrel for the first time since January on Monday. Since August last year, the prices have gone up over 30 per cent in international markets. 

Stocks of OMCs have trailed the benchmark Sensex in FY18. The selling pressure has been severe since August 2017.

How does it work? Any jump in crude oil prices means higher under-recoveries of oil marketing players on domestic sale of LPG and kerosene at controlled rates. The government has already freed pricing of petrol and diesel.

A pricey crude also translates into higher cost for such oil retailers, which in turn squeezes their margins affecting profitability.

Share price of HPCL, BPCL, and IOC have plunged up to 32 per cent since August 31, 2017. The Sensex added 4.21 per cent during the same period. 

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities remains negative on the downstream PSUs despite the correction, given rising downside risks to earnings from elevated global crude prices and more populist measures by the government.

Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, in a chat with ETNow said, “The rise in the oil prices appears to be temporary. Assuming that oil remains in the steady range of around $60-65 per barrel, the upstream companies possibly will have relatively better time than the downstream companies, factoring in volatility.”

Investors continued to give OMCs a wide berth despite recent reports on likely creation of integrated oil majors. It has been reported that IOC and BPCL may buy 26 per cent stake each in GAIL India as a step towards that. 

Kotak remained cautious on OMCs’ capital allocation policies, given the impending divestment of GAIL to BPCL and/or IOC. This may act as an overhang on these stocks in a way similar to ONGC’s de-rating post the buyout of stake in HPCL.

The brokerage house has cut EPS estimates for PSU OMCs by 4-7 per cent for FY19-20, considering higher Brent crude price, stable marketing margins on auto fuels versus earlier expectations of a modest increase. 

It has also cut target price to Rs 410 from Rs 455 earlier with ‘Sell’ rating of BPCL, Rs 350 from Rs 410 of HPCL and Rs 175 from Rs 200 with ‘Reduce’ rating in the case of IOC.

Stocks of IOC, BPCL, and HPCL closed at Rs 167.05, Rs 419.30 and Rs 332, respectively, on March 26."
75,2018-03-27,GAIL,"In an interview to ET Now,  RS Sharma, Former CMD, ONGC says that the worry whether the government will be able to maintain status quo or not, is what will disturb the sentiment about OMCs. Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Oil prices in India at retail level are completely decontrolled. If crude prices go higher you will have to pay more and if oil prices go lower, you will have to pay less. The government has really followed this in the true spirit of deregulation as there has been no government intervention whatsoever. So, do you think nervousness that the deregulation process will be stalled because of nearing state-elections and general elections in 2019 is a false belief?


RS Sharma: Well, your apprehension has taken words from me. Markets move by sentiments as you know and as crude prices rise, the apprehension goes up in course of time about whether the government is able to maintain this deregulated scenario or if there would be some sort of a subsidy regime. That is the worry and you know that stress spooks the sentiment about OMCs. There's just one thing I would like to correct in your briefing; benchmark are not crude prices, benchmark are the product prices and international parity with the product prices which move in tandem with the crude prices. So, if the crude prices are rising, in that case you rightly said that product prices will also rise and GRMs should also proportionately improve. So it is not that because the crude prices are rising, GRMs come under pressure. On the contrary, OMCs in free market scenarios should have more comfort in terms of GRMs. Going forward, with the upcoming elections and the worry whether the government will be able to maintain status quo or not, is what disturbs the sentiments about OMCs.


ET Now: The other issue which is bothering markets is that what the government is trying to do with their cross ownership. HPCL is now a part of ONGC, GAIL will be a part of IOC. Theoretically, if you are a shareholder of ONGC, you would say ""Look, I am getting HPCL at a premium to market price"" and if you are a shareholder of HPCL, you would say ""why should I be merge with ONGC""?


RS Sharma: Personally, I feel this is a win-win deal for ONGC as well as HPCL. As far as ONGC is concerned, in one stroke through this inorganic growth, ONGC becomes a fully integrated company. This is the aspiration ONGC has had since I was the CFO. I did go back 15 years when we acquired MRPl, at that time we had conveyed that we would like to acquire HPCL but it was not agreed to. But I feel this is a good opportunity. 

You would have seen that even Rs 37,500 crore paid by ONGC has not impacted its liquidity. ONGC has a very strong balance sheet with more than 200 lakh crore net worth of the company, virtually nil borrowing. So that is the advantage of ONGC for HPCL to take. Earlier it was owned by the government so they were never able to leverage the guarantee to the owners when needed, because the government, as a matter of policy does not give sovereign guarantee. But they will be able to leverage ONGC balance-sheet in case of borrowings and in case of expansion, ONGC would be willing to give that corporate guarantee to HPCL and HPCL’s credit rating would go up. 

So, I feel it is win win for both of them and the kind of structure that has been done, it is not a merger, it is just getting a controlling stake by ONGC. If you look at the management of HPCL, it has not been disturbed. The CMD remains the CMD and the entire management remains the same. Only ONGC has two nominee directors on boards. Perhaps, this is the structure I can recall. ET Now had done a webinar after the last budget, where I had categorically said that this should be the structure and the modality. I am very happy that it has been done the same way. 

Coming to GAIL, though both IOC as well as BPCL have conveyed and intended that they would acquire controlling stake and there were some media reports that said the government may decide to give 50-50, I have gone on record to say that 50-50 does not help either IOC or BPCL. For them it will remain a portfolio investment. It will make sense to IOC or to BPCL only if they are getting a controlling stake and they get GAIL as a subsidiary. So if IOC is getting the entire GAIL as a subsidiary, that makes a lot of sense to IOC or to BPCL. 50-50 is not the structure that will be agreed by any of the entities."

78,2018-03-30,GAIL,"New Delhi: India today received its first LNG cargo from the US under a long-term supply deal when a ship carrying super-cooled natural gas arrived at Dabhol in Maharashtra. 

A charter ship, MV Meridian Spirit arrived at Dabhol after 25 days voyage from Louisiana, state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd said in a press statement. 

GAIL India has contracted 3.5 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from US energy firm Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass liquefaction facility in Louisiana. The first cargo from the project arrived at Dabhol, the cite of India's biggest gas-fired power plant. 

It has also contracted long-term volumes for another 2.3 million tonnes at Dominion Energy's Cove Point liquefaction plant. 

""GAIL is one of the early movers to contract US LNG and has 5.8 million tonnes per annum of US LNG in its portfolio. GAIL shall be receiving around 90 cargoes per annum from Sabine Pass and Cove Point LNG terminals,"" the statement said. 

The LNG, he said, is indexed to US Henry Hub gas index as well as crude oil. ""GAIL will have an optimum portfolio mix of LNG indexed to Henry Hub (HH) and crude oil and the customers will benefit from such a unique price blend,"" it said. 

The arrival of 'Meridian Spirit' at Dabhol marks beginning of LNG supplies under the Henry Hub-indexed contracts, it said. 

The vessel arrived close on the heels of Dabhol power plant and the adjoining LNG receipt terminal being split into two separate companies. While state-owned electricity generator NTPC is the lead for the power block, GAIL is the majority owner of Konkan LNG Pvt Ltd, the firm which will run the 5 million tonnes a year LNG receipt facility. 

Last October, India imported its first shipment of crude oil from the US. The US had stopped oil exports in 1975, but this ban was lifted by former US President Barack Obama in 2015. 

GAIL had signed a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with the US LNG exporter Cheniere Energy in December 2011. The SPA went into effect March 1. Under terms of the agreement, Cheniere will sell and make available for delivery to GAIL about 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG. 

Cheniere's LNG is based on natural gas sourced from the US market, which provides access to abundant and low-cost gas resources. 

GAIL said India's trade with the USA, which stood at USD 126.1 billion in 2017, is expected to increase owing to large-scale imports of LNG and crude oil in coming years. ""GAIL alone would be procuring approximately USD 2 billion worth of LNG per annum from USA from FY 2018-19,"" the statement said. 

Cheniere Energy, Inc is the leading exporter of US LNG. It is currently operating and constructing its Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana and is constructing a second liquefaction facility near Corpus Christi, Texas. When both projects are complete, it is expected to be a top-5 global supplier of LNG. 

GAIL is India's biggest natural gas transportation and marketing company. It is expanding pipeline network by 4,000 km at an investment of over USD 3 billion to operate over 15,000 km by 2020. GAIL commands 75 per cent market share in gas transmission and has a gas trading share of over 50 per cent in India."

Once that is done we will be handling 80-90 ships a year.Gail signed two, 20-year LNG supply agreements potentially worth USD 32 billion for LNG exports from the Dominion Cove Point project in Maryland and the Sabine Pass project in Louisiana in 2011 and 2013 respectively, US Consulate, Mumbai said in a statement.The minister claimed that the country could negotiate ""a very competitive price from the US which offers one of the best prices LNG,"" without disclosing the average price of the maiden shipment.""Pricing is a commercial matter that cannot be publicly discussed. All I can assure you is that we have managed one of the best prices which should help the end-consumers,"" the minister said, adding Dabhol terminal will serve industrial and residential customers in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat.He also said the beginning of the oil and gas shipments from the US will boost Indo-US trade and has the potential to raise it by USD 2-3 billion annually, considering massive spike in energy demand, making the country third largest in the world.""Once this pipeline delivery begins, this will connect the state-run gas major's Kochi-Kuttanad- Mangalore-Bengaluru pipeline,"" the Gail official said.Describing the arrival of the first shipment and the conclusion of the long-term contract with the US-based Cheniere Inc as ""a new beginning in the Indo-US energy partnership and trade,"" Pradhan said LNG supplies is linked to the Henry Hub index contract and also ""will help achieve the vision of moving towards a gas-based economy.""Gail's first charter-hired vessel MV Meridian Spirit arrived after sailing 24 days.Gail chairman BC Tripathi said in the first year of the 20-year contract that was inked in 2011, Gail hopes to take in 5.8 million tonne.The US vessel that called on today is the 78th berthing at the Dabhol terminal since it was commissioned in 2013.""We will have an optimum portfolio mix of LNG indexed to the Henry Hub index and crude oil and customers will benefit from such a good price blend,"" Tripathi said.""Gail is one of the early movers to contract US LNG and has 5.8 million tonne per annum in its portfolio over the life of the long-term contract. We will be receiving around 90 cargoes per annum from the Sabine Pass and Cove Point LNG terminals,"" Tripathi said, adding the terminal will now be handled by the just-formed subsidiary Konkan LNG after demerging it from Ratnagiri Gas & Power, which is a three-way joint venture between Gail, NTPC and Maharashtra SEB.Indo-US trade has been rising 11.4 per cent on average since 2000 when it was USD 20 billion to over USD 126.1 billion in 2017.""The United States continues to partner with India across the broad range of energy collaboration, whether through traditional energy sources like oil--the first crude oil shipment from the US to India arrived in October 2017 in Odisha--or LNG, or through other sources like coal and renewable energy,"" US Minister Counselor for Commercial Affairs Patrick Santillo was quoted as saying in a statement.""This shipment really sets the stage for the upcoming visit of US energy secretary Rick Perry for attending the US-India Strategic Partnership,"" Santillo said."
0,2018-04-01,GAIL,"WASHINGTON: A day after India received its first LNG cargo from the US under a long-term supply deal, the Trump administration has said that New Delhi is a key partner in promoting its strategic energy security goals. 

GAIL India has contracted 3.5 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from US energy firm Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass liquefaction facility in Louisiana. The first cargo from the project arrived at Dabhol in Maharashtra on Friday. 

""The US views India as a key partner in promoting our shared strategic energy security goals regionally and globally, and we are working closely with India to find policy and regulatory solutions to scale up investment for a diversified energy economy,""said Tom Vajda, the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia. 

""Our partnership with India on energy is a great example of the US' 'all of the above' approach to energy, which includes traditional sources like coal, oil, and gas, as well as renewables and nuclear,"" Vajda wrote in a State department blogpost. 

""This LNG delivery is the first of many that will ship from Cove Point in Maryland and Sabine Pass in Louisiana as part of two 20-year contracts with India's Gail Limited,"" he said. 

As Energy Secretary Rick Perry highlighted in a recent op-ed, once six additional facilities currently under construction come online, the US will be able to export more than 10 billion cubic feet of LNG per day to its friends and allies around the world. 

Vajda said American energy is central to its National Security Strategy, which notes that ""exports of our energy resources, technologies, and services help our allies and partners diversify their energy sources and brings economic gains back home."" 

""In other words, by leveraging the US' abundant energy resources, we stimulate our own economy while also helping key countries become more stable, prosperous, and energy secure,"" Vajda added."
1,2018-04-01,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The oil ministry has asked sector regulator PNGRB to look at unbundling of companies like GAIL India Ltd to resolve the conflict of interest in being both the transporter and marketer of natural gas. 

The reference to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) follows a revival of a plan to split GAIL by hiving off gas marketing business into a separate firm, leaving just pipeline transportation with GAIL. 

""GAIL was created in 1984 by hiving off gas business out of ONGC. ONGC was producing oil and gas, and also transporting it. GAIL was hived out of ONGC for transportation of natural gas, and then slowly it also acquired the activities relating to marketing of gas,"" an official privy to the development said. 

He said it is a well-accepted fact that there is some conflict of interest between the same entity that carries out transportation of natural gas and also markets it. 

Over a period of time more players have come into gas marketing. Gujarat government entity GSPC is a major player in gas marketing and also in gas transportation. 

""So, we have asked the PNGRB to look into this issue of how to resolve this conflict and come up with some suggestion,"" he said. 

The Government had in 2006 issued the Policy for Development of Natural Gas Pipelines and City for Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks which envisaged that in the long run and with the maturing of gas markets, the authorised entities will have transportation of natural gas as their sole business activity and will not have any business interest in the gas marketing or city or local gas distribution networks. 

""So, as we move towards a more gas-based economy, there is a conflict of interest between the activities of transportation of gas and marketing of gas,"" the official said. 

GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country. 

In the past GAIL resisted the split on grounds that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arms length, and hence do not need to be separated. 

GAIL's marketing business formed 71 per cent of its 2016 -17 total sales, and 25 per cent pre-tax profit. 

The government has 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL India."
2,2018-04-01,GAIL,"The newly-created arm of state-run gas major Gail India, Konkan LNG, will pump in around Rs 3,000 crore to double the capacity at its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Dabhol in the Konkan region of Maharashtra to 10 million tonne over the next three years.Konkan LNG, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Gail, had on March 30 received the first 1.2 lakh tonne shipment of the 5.8-mt LNG contracted from the first-ever long-term agreement with the US signed way back in 2011 and 2013.""We will be investing around Rs 3,000 crore in Dabhol terminal to increase its capacity to 10 million tonne from the present 5 mt, which is also underutilised now due to the terminal not being an all-weather facility.""So, to make the Dabhol terminal an all-season facility, first we will invest around Rs 700 crore to complete the abandoned and semi-finished breakwater. Rest of the investment will go into capacity expansion,"" Gail chairman and managing director BC Tripathi said.Gail created Konkan LNG recently after demerging it from Ratnagiri Gas & Power, which is a three-way joint venture it has with NTPC and Maharashtra SEB. The JV was created to run Dabhol Power which was abandoned by Enron Corporation early 2000 following its global bankruptcy.The entire project will take around three years to complete, and will be executed by Konkan LNG, Tripathi said, adding that work on the breakwater should be begin shortly. Currently the terminal can operate only about eight months in a year due to not having a breakwater.""We've finalised the tender for the breakwater which will be floated very soon and hope to begin work before the monsoons at the earliest or soon after the monsoons,"" petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan said here on Friday receiving the first shipment of 1.2 lakh tonne LNG from the US.Gail commissioned the Dabhol terminal in 2013 and the US vessel was the 78th berthing, Tripathi said.The company will get 22-24 shipments per annum till the breakwater is built. Once that is done the annual intake will be 80-90 ships.It had in 2011 and 2013 entered into two contracts of 20 years each, to lift 5.8 mt of LNG from the US, which is valued at around USD 32 billion. The gas will come the Dominion Cove Point project in Maryland (signed in 2011) and the Sabine Pass project in Louisiana (agreement signed 2013) from the US.The under-construction breakwater at the Dabhol terminal, was created in FY07 by the original Dabhol power plant promoter Enron Corporation which went bankrupt following which it abandoned the 1,200-mw power plant.The minister had claimed that the country could negotiate ""a very competitive price from the US which offers one of the best prices of LNG,"" without disclosing the average price of the maiden shipment.""Pricing is a commercial matter that cannot be publicly discussed.

Crude and LNG prices are linked.Pradhan also said the beginning of the oil and gas shipments from the US will boost Indo-US trade and has the potential to raise it by USD 2-3 billion annually, considering massive spike in energy demand, making the country third largest in the world.Indo-US trade has been rising 11.4 per cent on average annually since 2000 when it had stood at a USD 20 billion and crossed USD 126 billion in 2017.It can be noted that Asia is the largest consumer of LNG in the world with around 70 per cent of consumption led by Japan, China and India.""Once this pipeline delivery begins, this will connect the state-run gas major's Kochi-Kuttanad- Mangalore-Bengaluru pipeline,"" Gail said.Describing the arrival of the first shipment and the conclusion of the long-term contract with the US-based Cheniere Inc as ""a new beginning in the Indo-US energy partnership and trade,"" Pradhan said LNG supplies is linked to the Henry Hub index contract and also ""will help achieve the vision of moving towards a gas-based economy"".The charter-hired vessel MV Meridian Spirit arrived at the Dabhol facility on March 30 after sailing for 24 days."

7,2018-04-05,GAIL,"Kochi: Cochin Port Trust (CPT) is in the black after a gap of ten years with significant increase in the cargo throughput.

It clocked a provisional net profit of Rs 4.44 crore for 2017-18 compared with a loss of Rs 27 crore a year earlier. The operating income went up by around 3% to Rs 509 crore. The total cargo handled rose 16.5 % to 29.14 million tonnes.

""The main reason for the turnaround is the increase in the cargo. The petroleum oil and lubricants (POL) cargo grew 18% from a year ago to 18.66 million tonnes. The container traffic increased by 13 % to 5.55 lakh TEUs,’’ CPT chairman P Raveendran said.

Though the number of cargo vessels calling at the port declined slightly, the bigger cargo size helped increase the throughput. `` Among the incremental growth in the cargo traffic, CPT is top among the public sector ports,’’ he said. The average output per ship berth day has increased by 19% from last year to 20880 tonnes.

Encouraged by the performance, CPT has targeted a total cargo throughput of 32 million tonnes for the current fiscal. The port is hoping that with the completion of GAIL pipeline, the handling of LNG will go up in the port. LNG traffic had increased last year.

It is also banking on new cargo like iron and steel. Last year the port handled coastal steel cargo of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. ``Coastal cargo traffic has seen an increase. We are looking to push it up further. We are in talks with SAIL for getting steel cargo,’’ he said. Wheat shipments from Khandla port is another possible cargo the port is considering.

CPT is also planning to boost its revenue by auctioning more land at its disposal in Willingdon island for lease."

Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities
Motherson Sumi | BUY | Target Price: Rs 400 | Stop loss: Rs 313
This stock has rallied from its support level at Rs 301 in the last two weeks and broken above the intermediate high of Rs 336. This indicates a reversal of the recent intermediate downtrend. It also trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily momentum readings are in rising mode and not extremely overbought.


GVK Power & Infrastructure | BUY | Target Price: Rs 21 | Stop loss: Rs 14.5GVKPIL has reversed the recent intermediate downtrend as it has moved above the previous intermediate highs of Rs 16.35 after finding support around Rs 12.95 level. In the process, the stock has broken above its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes.

Power Finance Corporation | BUY | Target Price: Rs 103 | Stop loss: Rs 84
After a massive value deterioration of around 50 per cent from the 2017 high of Rs 168, this counter appears to have hit a durable bottom around Rs 80 levels. It seems to be in a consolidation mode before unleashing a decent pull back rally.


Can Fin Homes | BUY | Target Price: Rs 495 | Stop loss: Rs 430
After a swift correction from the high of Rs 537 to Rs 421 in just three days due to adverse news flows on deal front, this counter appears to be stabilising after hitting a bottom around Rs 421 level. As momentum is slowly strengthening on the positive side with a pullback attempt, this counter can be expected to test its 200-day moving average over a period of time.

Tata Global Beverages | BUY | Target Price: Rs 313 | Stop loss: Rs 257
This counter appears to be on the verge of a breakout after registering almost a double bottom around Rs 250 level, in a multi-week consolidation phase, as volumes are picking up in the last leg of the upward move. Momentum on this counter shall get strengthened once it manages a close above Rs 280 level, thereby facilitating a bigger and perhaps a swift upward move.

20,2018-04-11,GAIL,"The government is working on 'unbundling' of marketing and transportation of gas in the country, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said, in a move that would end up splitting Gail, the owner of most of nation's natural gas transportation network.

India is aiming to build a gas-based economy, and beefing up policy frameworks and gas infrastructure for that.

The government is hoping to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix to 15 percent by 2030 from current 6 percent.

It is also planning to double its gas pipeline network and gas import terminal capacity over the next few years.

State-run Gail is the biggest gas marketer and transporter in the country and has a few anti-trust cases pending against it.

'The ownership of both transportation and marketing network by an entity leads to conflict of interest. This is not in the interest of consumers or suppliers. Which is why unbundling is needed,"" said DK Sarraf, the chairman of Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), which is preparing a plan to tweak regulations that can help enhance open access to gas pipelines.

""Setting up of a gas trading hub would be the trigger for open access as well as unbundling,"" said Sarraf.

The government is hoping to set up natural gas trading hub by year-end, which will help with market discovery of prices in the domestic market for locally produced gas as well as the imports.

Gas hub can be effective only if all players have equal access to import terminals as well as pipelines. A well-functioning gas hub can ultimately end price control in the country where domestic gas prices are decided every six month on a government-set formula."
21,2018-04-11,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Energy major Shell’s subsidiary BG Asia Pacific Holdings has sold part of its shareholding in Mahanagar Gas as part of its strategy to simplify its business, but remains optimistic about its ventures in India, the company said in a statement. BG Asia reduced its stake in Mahanagar Gas to 24% from 32.50% through deals on the bourses.

 ET had reported that BG Asia will pare its holding in Mahanagar Gas through secondary market transactions on Wednesday. Shares of Mahanagar Gas fell 3% to close at Rs 917 at the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

“This is part of Shell’s ongoing portfolio optimization to transform Shell into a simpler company, delivering stronger returns.

We believe in the key role that gas will play in India and continue to seek opportunities in that arena,” Shell said in a statement.

Shell said that the transaction would not have any impact on its other businesses in India. “Our investment in the Hazira LNG receiving terminal in Gujarat and the recent creation of Shell Energy India, our gas marketing and trading business, prove our commitment to grow in India and to increase gas penetration in the country,” the company said.

State-run GAIL (India) holds 32.50% in Mahanagar Gas while the government of Maharashtra holds 10% in the company. “Shell believes that India offers a vast opportunity for growth of Shell’s businesses and we will continue to pursue opportunities which can enhance Shell’s footprint in the country, including in the retail network, and our custombuilt Technology and IT Centre in Bengaluru,” Shell said."

32,2018-04-17,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Energy giant Shell has told the government that separating gas marketing and transportation business in the country will provide a level playing field to other gas suppliers and boost gas demand in India. 

“The experiences of developed gas markets globally have demonstrated that for gas markets to be competitive, gas transmission and marketing businesses need to be unbundled,” Shell India Chairman Nitin Prasad wrote to the Oil Ministry two weeks ago. “This will ensure non-discriminatory access to the network and deter vertically integrated companies from taking undue advantage of their monopolistic position, thus preventing conflicts of interest.”

Shell India, in a joint venture with Total, owns a natural gas import terminal in Gujarat and markets gas besides being active in other segments of the oil and gas industry. 

Shell’s Prasad didn’t clarify if his firm has faced any discrimination in accessing natural gas pipelines in the country in the past, but said, in an emailed response to ET's query: “Shell strongly believes that open and transparent markets with a level playing field for all players are the best ways to make domestic gas markets grow.” 

The government is working on a plan to unbundle marketing and transportation of gas in the country, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at an international energy meet last week. Dinesh Sarraf, the chief of downstream regulator, has also underlined the scope for 'conflict of interest’ if both trading and transport are handled by a single owner. 

GAIL and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) are the two state-owned companies that straddle both gas transportation and marketing and may have to be split if the government were to bar single ownership of the two businesses. No immediate comment was available from GAIL on the government plan. 

GAIL is the biggest natural gas marketer and also owns most of natural gas pipelines in the country. A few anti-trust cases are pending against GAIL. 

The Oil Ministry is working on a plan to get ready a natural gas trading platform by the end of 2018. The platform, aimed at helping discover market price for domestic as well as imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), could be key to growing India’s gas market. 

“A gas hub requires market liberalisation with a series of steps to open up access for gas transmission and distribution networks, and we believe that Indian gas markets would also need to go through a similar journey,” Prasad told ET. “This will provide Indian customers more choices for securing competitive supplies and provide opportunities to all the players in the market, eventually leading to newer investments and demand creation.”

The government is aiming to build a gas-based economy, and hoping to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix to 15 percent by 2030 from 6 percent now. It is also planning to double its gas pipeline network and gas import terminal capacity over the next few years."
33,2018-04-17,GAIL,"The Finance Ministry may come out with a Rs 10,000-crore follow-on fund offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF) as it looks to dilute stake in Coal India to meet the minimum public holding norm.

Besides, the ministry is keen to take the ETF route to sell off government shares held through SUUTI in private companies -- ITC, Axis Bank and L&T, an official told PTI.

The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T.

The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs 32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs 14,500 crore.

An official said the ETF route is a safer mode of disinvestment as it shields investors against stock market volatility.

""Based on the current composition of the Bharat-22 ETF, the leg room for a follow-on fund offer would be around Rs 10,000 crore,"" the official added.

The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

The official said by using the ETF route, the government may dilute about 3.55 per cent stake held in Coal India to comply with the minimum 25 per cent public float requirement as mandated by market regulator Sebi.

The government plans to raise Rs 80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs 1 lakh crore raised last year.

Prior to the launch of Bharat-22 ETF which has a diversified portfolio, the government had floated the CPSE ETF comprising stocks of 10 bluechip PSUs -- ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.

Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised Rs 11,500 crore in three tranches, with Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017."

49,2018-04-26,GAIL,"New Delhi: Ruia family-owned Essar Oil and Gas will invest Rs 900 crore in drilling 150 more wells on its Raniganj CBM block in West Bengal to more than double gas output to 2.3 million standard cubic metres per day by 2021, its Managing Director and CEO Vilas Tawde said. 

 Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Ltd (EOGEPL) has so far drilled 348 wells on the blocks and is producing 1 mmscmd of gas from coal seams. 

 ""We have already invested about Rs 4,000 crore in the Raniganj East coal-bed methane (CBM) block in drilling wells, setting up supply infrastructure, and laying customer pipelines to Durgapur and nearby industrial areas. Another Rs 900 crore would be invested in drilling the additional 150 wells over the next two years,"" he said. 

 The company is selling entire production of coal-seam gas or CBM from the block to state-owned GAIL India Ltd. ""The April price is USD 8.164 per million British thermal unit on net calorific value (NCV) basis,"" he said. 

 GAIL in February outbid Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, Graphite India Ltd and Positron Energy Pvt Ltd to buy entire output from Raniganj. 

 CBM is a natural gas stored or absorbed in coal seams and contains 90-95 per cent methane. According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, India has the fifth largest proven coal reserves in the world and, therefore, holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. 

 Raniganj East block is India's most prolific CBM block, holding 1 Trillion cubic feet of recoverable reserves. 

 The firm is eyeing a turnover of Rs 600 crore from the CBM business in 2018-19 and expects it to double in next two years. 

 Its CBM assets include five blocks, holding an estimated 10 Tcf of gas reserves spread over 2,700 square kilometres across West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Raniganj East in West Bengal is the only block operational till now. 

 Other four blocks are Rajmahal in Jharkhand, Talcher and Ib valley in Odisha and Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. 

 Tawde said the company will begin drilling on its Sohagpur CBM block in Madhya Pradesh post monsoon. In all 25 crore holes and three test wells would be drilled. 

 Rajmahal will begin production in five years, he said. 

 Land acquisition approval for the Sohagpur minefield is pending from the Chhattisgarh government and the Petroleum Exploration Licence for the Talcher and Ib Valley coalfields is pending from the Odisha government. 

 It is also on the lookout for CBM mining projects globally but will keep off ""matured markets"" like the US and Australia."

The Nifty50 index remained rangebound for most part of the day on Thursday and then witnessed buying in the last half-an-hour of the session to extend its move towards 10,630 level.

The index erased previous day’s losses and formed a bullish candle on the daily scale, which indicated that the decline got bought into. The index has been finding multiple supports in the 10,500-10,550 zone since last eight sessions. Now, it has to continue to hold above 10,550 to extend its move towards the 10,707-10,736 zone. On any decline, the next major support exists at the 10,500 level.

On the options front, May series options data remained scattered at various strike prices, since it was the start of a new series. Maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,400 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,800. There was Put writing at 10,500 and 10,600, while significant Call writing was seen at 11,000 and 10,700.

A significant surge in OI congestion in the next series on the expiry day suggests participants have done calendar spread or initiated their strategy for a volatile May F&O series.

Options data suggests an immediate trading range between 10,500 and 10,700 levels. A decisive breakout on either side would give further movement to the market.

India VIX fell 2.92 per cent to 12.03.

Nifty closed April series with a gain of around 5 per cent and moved from 10,100 to 10,600 level. Nifty futures saw 68% rollover as per the provisional data, which was in line and suggested that long positions got carried over to the next series, expecting the market momentum to continue.

Bank Nifty opened flat but managed to respect its support at 24,750 level and then headed towards the 25,000-25,100 zone. The index formed a Bullish Engulfing Candle on daily chart, which means the bulls are back after the underperformance of last couple of sessions. Now, it has to hold above 25,100 to extend its move towards 25,250 and then 25,400 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 24,750 and then 24,500 levels.

Bank Nifty closed April series with a gain of 3.08 per cent and remained an underperformer compared with the Nifty index. Rollovers were mixed as shorts also got carried over to the next series with a rise in rollover and roll cost.

8,2018-05-06,GAIL,"The session on Friday saw the corrective action getting extended, as the market continued with its modest slide. The benchmark index Nifty50 continued to fall and ended the day with a loss of 61.40 points or 0.57 per cent.

The session remained relatively less volatile and therefore did not see VIX rising too much. The session remained confined to a narrow range all throughout the day.

As we approach a fresh week, stable global environment may see Indian market opening on a modestly positive mode. We may also see some technical pullback. But speaking on broad terms, we will continue to see consolidation persisting in the market with the previous week’s high acting as a major resistance.

Monday’s trade is likely to see the levels of 10,650 and 10,695 acting as resistance. Supports are likely to come in at 10,575 and 10,540.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 57.8654, and it has marked a fresh 14-period low, which is bearish. RSI has marked a fresh 14-period low while Nifty has not done so. This also marks a bearish divergence against the price.



Daily MACD still continues to trade above its signal line. No significant formations were seen on the candles.

Pattern analysis shows that after breaking out from the rectangle formation and testing immediate highs of 10,785, the Nifty has been giving a throwback. It continues to remain in this formation until it forms a higher bottom and attempts to move higher again.

Overall, though a positive and stable start is expected on Monday, we will continue to see consolidation persisting at higher levels. The markets still continue to remain vulnerable to profit taking bouts at higher levels unless the levels of 10,785 are breached on the upside.

The VIX continues to remain low, and this keeps room for volatility to increase in the near-term. Though there are no signs as yet that point towards any major downsides.

While continuing to avoid shorts, any corrective moves from higher levels should be used to make fresh purchases. Highly stock-specific approach with cautious view on the market is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Relatively better technical setup was observed in stocks such as Tata Sponge, Future Lifestyle, GAIL, Bosch, TV18 Broadcast, Indigo, LT Foods, SRS, JMT Auto and IVRCL.

9,2018-05-07,GAIL,"Stocks from across sectors, including dozens of popular names, have seen wild swings in their fortunes in 2018.

While more than 85 stocks have rallied over 50 per cent in the first four months of the calendar, some names like PC Jeweller, Vakrangee and Gitanjali Gems have encountered major headwinds and fallen like a pack of cards.

PC Jeweller alone has eroded over Rs 13,000 crore of investor wealth so far this year, whereas Vakrangee wiped out over Rs 35,000 crore between December 29 and May 3.

On Monday, PC Jeweller stock rallied 34 per cent to Rs 234 in morning trade after the company advanced a board meeting to consider share buyback.

Among other big names that have witnessed major wealth erosion are State Bank of India, Bharti Airtel, IndianOil, BPCL, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, PNB, ICICI Bank, Wipro and ONGC, which have together wiped out some Rs 3.91 lakh crore of market capitalisation (m-cap) during this period.

Besides business headwinds, some of these companies have suffered due to rising bad loans, concerns over corporate governance issues and policy changes at the government level.

The total market-cap of all BSE-listed companies is down by nearly Rs 22,000 crore in these four months; falling to Rs 151.52 lakh crore as of May 2, 2018 from Rs 151.74 lakh crore on December 29, 2017. 

SBI share price plunged nearly 22 per cent between December 29 and May 2, which shrank its m-cap by Rs 51,366 crore to Rs 2,15,796 crore on May 3 from Rs 2,67,162 crore on December 29.

Bharti Airtel, which reported lowest quarterly profit in nearly 15 years for Q4FY18, has seen its shares slip 24 per cent to Rs 404.40 from Rs 529.40. This resulted in a Rs 49,968 crore erosion in market capitalisation to Rs 1,61,654 as of May 3 from Rs 2,11,622 on December 29.

Global ratings agency Standard & Poor's on May 3 revised down its outlook on Airtel to ‘negative’ from stable, following weak financial performance in FY18 and concerns over elevated capex for this financial year.

Vakrangee shares have lost 78 per cent market value this calendar after a stellar run that saw the stock rise 208 per cent in 2017, 57 per cent in 2016, 40 per cent in 2015, 49 per cent in 2014 and 40 per cent in 2013.

Vakrangee came under pressure after market regulator Sebi launched a probe into alleged price and volume manipulation in its own scrip on BSE and NSE. Market capitalisation of the company has fallen by Rs 35,020 crore to Rs 9,555.70 crore from Rs 44,575.60 crore in last four months.

Rising crude oil prices have hit oil market companies (OMCs) hard. IOC, BPCL and HPCL have lost Rs 31,175 crore, Rs 30,445 and Rs 18,545 crore in terms of market cap this year as their shares slipped between 15-30 per cent.

OMCs are getting punished for ‘probable’ margin compression due to higher crude oil prices. However, ONGC and Oil India are not getting rewarded for the same. Recent correction and the resultant valuation provide an attractive opportunity to initiate long positions in OMCs, Antique Stock Broking said in a research report.

Country’s biggest auto makers Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors have wiped off Rs 29,459 crore and Rs 28,224 crore from investor wealth in 2018 so far. Maruti shares are down 10 per cent so far in 2018, whereas those of Tata Motors 23 per cent.

Maruti Suzuki last month posted 10 per cent jump in net profit for fourth quarter of 2017-18. The automobile major’s Q4 net profit increased to Rs 1,882 crore from Rs 1,710 crore in the year-ago period. The company said an increase in effective tax rate impacted profit. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti with a target price of Rs 10,468.

ICICI Bank, which has been in the eye of a storm following allegations of nepotism at the CEO level in advancing large loans to the Videocon Group, has seen its market-cap shrink by Rs 20,495 crore this calendar. The stock has plunged over 10 per cent between December 29, 2017 and May 2, 2018.

Wipro has lost Rs 19,547 crore in m-cap as the stock fell 13 per cent to Rs 270.20 from 313.40 amid investor worries surrounding its business.

Among others, ONGC, Vedanta, Bharat Electronics and GAIL have also seen their individual market-cap decline by over Rs 13,000 crore so far this calendar.

Mining conglomerate Vedanta on May 3 reported a 34 per cent jump in consolidated profit-after-tax (PAT) at Rs 5,675 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2018. The company had posted a consolidated PAT of Rs 4,226 crore for the year-ago period.

Among the wealth creators, Mastek, HIL, Sudarshan Chemicals, Shakti Pumps, Mindtree, Indiabulls Ventures, Pioneer Distilleries and SORIL Holdings have seen their shares rally up to 108 per cent in the first four months of the calendar year."

The NSE benchmark Nifty on Friday opened gap-up and witnessed sustain buying interest till the end of the session. It formed a bullish candle on daily and weekly scale by surpassing immediate hurdle of 10,785 zone.

The index has given a decisive close above the 10,800 zone after consolidating between 10,600 and 10,785 levels in the last 10 trading sessions.

It continued to form higher highs–higher lows on a weekly scale for the seventh consecutive week, which indicates that bulls are holding the tight grip, and supports are gradually shifting higher.

Now, the index has to hold above 10,785 zone to extend its move towards 10,888, and then 10,950 zones, while on the downside supports are seen at 10,725-10,680 levels.

On the option front, maximum Put open interest is at 10,500 followed by 10,600 strike, while maximum Call OI is at 11,000 followed by 10,800 strike. We have seen meaningful Put writing at 10,700 followed by 10,600, which is shifting its support to higher zones, while marginal Call writing is seen at 11,050 then 10,800 strikes. Option data suggests an immediate trading range between 10,700 and 10,900 zones.

23,2018-05-14,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The bulls had an upperhand last week, mainly driven by upbeat corporate earnings. 

On Friday, the BSE Sensex rallied 290 points to settle at 35,535. NSE’s 50-share Nifty pack reclaimed the crucial 10,800 level to end at 10,806, up 90 points or 0.84 per cent. 

On a weekly basis, both gained 1.77 per cent each.

The cloud of Karnataka poll results is still hanging. It may add some volatility to the market although technical charts signal further upside potential. 

The Nifty is likely to inch higher towards Rs 10,910. On the way down, 10,690 will provide support in the near term. Overall, we have a bullish outlook on the index for the short term with a target Rs 10,910 and reversal placed at Rs 10,500, says Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver gains over the next three weeks.


Jay Purohit - Technical & Derivatives Analyst, Centrum Broking

Tech Mahindra | BUY | Target Price: Rs 700–715 | Stop loss: Rs 646
TechM has given a breakout in second week of April and rallied sharply. However, it started moving in a corrective phase from last three weeks. The correction seems to be over as the stock is rebounding after retesting the ‘Breakout Trendline’, which also coincides with the ‘SuperTrend’ indicator on daily chart. Since the momentum oscillator ‘RSI’ is placed positively along with the set of moving averages on daily timeframe, we are expecting a rally towards Rs 700–715 in coming days. Thus, any decline towards Rs 655 should be used as a buying opportunity with a stop-loss of Rs 646.


GAIL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 375–385 | Stop loss: Rs 325
The ‘200 EMA’ on daily chart and ‘55 EMA’ on weekly chart acted as a strong support for the stock in the last couple of years. Recently, the stock has again taken the support around the mentioned moving averages and started rebounding. The consolidation of last ten weeks has resulted in formation of an ‘Inverse Head & Shoulder’ pattern on daily chart. 

On Monday, we witnessed a breakout from the mentioned pattern with decent volumes. Looking at these technical evidences, we are expecting a rally towards 375–385 levels in coming 2-3 weeks. Thus, long positions can be taken at the current juncture as well as on declines to Rs 335 with a stop-loss of Rs 325.


Subash Gangadharan, Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

ICICI Bank | BUY | Target Price: Rs 355 | Stop loss: Rs 290
ICICI Bank is one of the strongest stocks in the market currently. This week, the stock broke out of the Rs 274-295 trading range on the back of above average volumes. The stock also trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily and weekly momentum readings are in rising mode and not extremely overbought. 


Hindustan Oil Exploration | BUY | Target Price: Rs 155 | Stop loss: Rs 121
Hind Oil Exploration has rallied smartly and broken above its recent highs of Rs 129.2 in the process. The stock also trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily momentum readings are in rising mode and not extremely overbought.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher

BPCL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 450 | Stop loss: Rs 375
The stock has witnessed a decent erosion from the peak of around Rs 545 and has bottomed out at around Rs 375 levels, consolidating for some time to see a positive bias developing and producing a bullish candle pattern in daily chart. The chart looks attractive for a decent rise from here on, with the RSI indicating a trend reversal recently and also the MACD showing a positive trigger for an upmove. With rising volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock. 


Bajaj Finance | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,975 | Stop loss : Rs 1,800
The stock has gradually corrected from its peak of Rs 1,960 to give a bottoming out indication at around Rs 1,820 levels and currently a positive bullish candle pattern indicates an uptrend with a positive bias. RSI is showing a trend reversal to signal a buy. The stock has maintained above the significant 50DMA and we anticipate a rise from here on to scale till Rs 1,970 levels.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Nestle | BUY | Target Price: Rs 10,600 | Stop loss: Rs 8,900
With new life time highs, this counter appears to be on the verge of a fresh breakout above its 3-month old ascending channel, which can throw up a target placed around Rs 10,600 levels. Hence, positional traders shall make use of this opportunity to go long at current prices and accumulate further between Rs 9,200–9,100 levels if available for a target of Rs 10,600 with a stop loss of Rs 8,900.


Firstsource Solutions | BUY | Target Price: Rs 78 | Stop loss: Rs 63
With a fresh breakout on price and volume front after recent results, this counter looks poised to head much higher levels. Hence, traders should make use of current consolidation phase to buy now and accumulate at lower levels on declines up to Rs 65 for a target of Rs 78.


NIIT | BUY | Target Price: Rs 121 | Stop loss: Rs 103
After the recent surge from the lows of Rs 84, this counter is in a multi-week corrective and consolidation phase and appears to have hit a bottom after testing its 50-day EMA in last session. Hence, positional traders can create longs with a stop below Rs 103 on closing basis for a target of Rs 121.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA 

Emami | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,125 | Stop loss: Rs 1,018
In the recent past, the stock has grossly underperformed not only the general markets but also the FMCG pack. After resisting near the confluence of 100-DMA and 200-DMA, the stock has attempted to find a temporary bottom near the Rs 1,030-1,050 zones. Though this may not signal the reversal of trend, a technical pullback is likely. 

RSI has just moved above 30 from an oversold situation and this is bullish. On Weekly Charts, RSI forms a higher bottom and is seen reversing. A candle with a long lower shadow resembling a not-so-classical hammer has emerged on weekly charts. It has emerged near the support area of 200-period Moving Average and therefore, holds significance. It is also confirmed by higher than average volumes. Some upward revision of price can be expected in this stock.


Coal India | BUY | Target Price: Rs 285 | Stop loss: Rs 262
For the last couple of months, the stock has not made any major headway and is trading in a broad range of Rs 262- 299 zones. The stock has tested the lower support level of this trading range and looks for a technical pullback. A buy signal over stochastic has emerged with a bullish divergence against the price. RSI has just moved above the oversold area and this is bullish. We might see stock staging a technical pullback even if it continues to remain in the present broad trading range.

Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here's a look at the key events that are likely to influence market in the coming week:

Next batch of Q4 earnings
Among notable names, Colgate-Palmolive (India), Just Dial and Mahanagar Gas are scheduled to announce their March quarter results on May 21, 2018. Andhra Bank, Bata India, Cipla, Dr Reddy's Labs, IOC and State Bank of India are expected to unveil their score cards on May 22, 2018.

Bank of Baroda, BEML, Cadila Healthcare, Engineers India, Hindustan Copper, NBCC, Sun Pharma and Tech Mahindra are slated to announce results on Friday.


BJP’s Karnataka debacle
Analysts say market may see a knee-jerk reaction to BJP’s Karnataka debacle when trading resumes on Monday. In a dramatic turn of events, BS Yeddyurappa, who took oath as the Chief Minister on Thursday, resigned on Saturday, after he failed to secure the magic number of 112 required to form the government. 

 G Chokkalingam, founder and CEO, Equinomics Research & Advisory said it was just a political setback and it may not have any major implication for the market.

 ""What matters to the market is whether the ruling government will come back to power in 2019. To that extent, BJP has already doubled its seats in Karnataka. The outcome will have only a knee-jerk reaction,"" Chokkalingam added.


Indostar Capital listing
NBFC Indostar Capital Finance, which recently concluded its initial public offer, will make stock market debut on Monday.

The Rs 1,844-crore IPO was subscribed 6.80 times during May 9-11. The price band of the offer was fixed at Rs 570–572 with a face value of Rs 10 per share. Indostar is mainly into offering structured term financing solutions to companies and loans to SME borrowers.


Crude prices
Oil prices posted their sixth straight weekly gain after touching $80 a barrel earlier this week. However, both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude slipped in Friday’s trade, paring weekly gains. 

 Global prices have been supported this week by concerns over US sanctions against Iran, shrinking stockpiles and production shortfalls in Venezuela, Bloomberg reported.

 “Oil prices are in overbought territory, which has prompted some profit taking,” Reuters reported quoting Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

 Spike in oil prices raises India's import bill as the country imports majority of its crude requirements. A weak rupee raises the cost of importing crude oil.

What do the tech charts say
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a robust bearish candle on the daily chart and made lower highs and lower lows for a third straight session. The index made a bearish engulfing formation on the weekly chart, suggesting the possibility of further downside. Analysts say the 50-day moving average around the 10,550 level should act as a major support for the index for now. 

“The market is expected to head lower and traders should not short but wait for lower levels to enter long positions,” said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO at SAMCO Securities.

""As long as it holds below 10,680, weakness could take Nifty towards its next support at 10,550, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,680 and 10,725 levels,"" said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.


Global cues
The minutes to the Federal Reserve’s May monetary policy meeting will be released on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve left its target range for the federal funds rate steady at 1.5-1.75 per cent during its May 2018 meeting, in line with market expectations.

 This apart, the next round of Brexit talks will take place in Brussels on Tuesday. The UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that Britain would leave the EU customs union after Brexit, but a source said London was considering a backstop plan that would apply the bloc’s external tariffs beyond December 2020, Reuters reported."

56,2018-05-22,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Monday described Russian President Vladimir Putin as his personal friend and a person who has played a role in his political career since the early days of his Chief Ministership as the two leaders sought to strengthen their personal chemistry to widen strategic partnership to combat terrorism, stabilise Afghanistan and create multipolar world.

“Russia is India’s old-time friend. We share long-standing historical ties, and Mr President is my personal friend, and a friend of India… Russia and you specifically always played a very important role in my political career. In 2001, when I served as Chief Minister of Gujarat, I made my first visit to Russia with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. And you were the first international leader I met as Chief Minister. Moscow and you yourself marked the beginning of my career,” Modi said in his opening remarks at the landmark informal Summit with Putin at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.

The body language between the two leaders reflected their strong personal chemistry as they remain engaged for one-on-one meet. 
“Being a real friend, you never forget about me. Last year you invited me to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. It was a great privilege to be invited by you as a guest of honour. I am grateful to you for this.” 

Both leaders expressed their concern over terrorism and radicalization, and their determination to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In this context, they endorsed the importance of restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan in an atmosphere free from the threat of terrorism, and agreed to work together towards achieving this objective. 

The two leaders held in depth discussions on major international issues and agreed that the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia is an important factor for global peace and stability. They shared the view that India and Russia have an important role to play in contributing to an open and equitable world order. In this regard, they recognized each other’s respective roles as major powers with common responsibilities for maintaining global peace and stability. 

They agreed on the importance of building a multipolar world order. They decided to intensify consultation and coordination with each other, including on the Indo-Pacific Region. 

Both leaders agreed to institute a Strategic Economic Dialogue between NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, to identify greater synergy in trade and investment. The two leaders welcomed the arrival of the first consignment of LNG under a long-term agreement between Gazprom and GAIL, next month. 

The two leaders also reiterated the significance of longstanding partnership in the military, security and nuclear energy fields and welcomed the ongoing cooperation in these areas. Ahead of the Summit the Modi government had emphasised that it will not allow India’s defence requirements to be dictated by any other country. 



""Our defence ministries maintain very close contacts and cooperation. It speaks about a very high strategic level of our partnership,"" Putin was quoted as saying by TASS news agency indicating one of key items on agenda of discussion.

While Delhi is lobbying both with the Trump administration as well as US Congress on seeking exemption for defence purchases from Russia to safeguard its requirements, Delhi is of opinion that Moscow is an old, tested and deep-rooted partner that safeguarded India’s national security and defence interests for decades, persons familiar with the developments indicated to ET. ""The underlying point is the fact that Russia is a reliable and trusted defence partner,"" asserted one of the persons quoted above.
 The two leaders were on a boat ride on the Black Sea from the Bocharev Creek to Olympic Park. It is understood that during one-on-one meet the two leaders gave special emphasis on sanctions as tool of global politics in context of sanctions against Iran and Russia which will impact oil & defence sales to India; as well as importance of Free Trade. Besides, situations in North Korean peninsula and future of Iran nuclear deal and fight against ISIS are believed to be on the agenda of Modi-Putin one-on-one meet. Two leaders is understood to have deliberated upon roadmap for insulating Russian defence sales to India from US sanctions and third-country partnership. Expediting connectivity projects -- INSTC & Chabahar Port -- were also among talking points.

The two leaders welcomed the idea of holding informal Summits as an additional engagement at leadership level, besides the Annual Summits between the two leaders. 
Modi also invoked former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee -- who laid seeds of strategic partnership and formal of annual summit along with Putin – several times in his opening remarks. ""In 2000, you made your first visit to India when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister. You said very eloquently back then that India and Russia were ancient civilisations and vibrant democracies. People remember your words very well and highly appreciate what you said.""

“Over the past 18 years I had a chance to sit down with you and discuss important bilateral matters with a view of further developing our relations… For the past four years, you and I stood side by side in the bilateral format and on the international stage. We openly talked about all aspects of our relations and chose the path for our onward movement. I am very glad that it was so,” the PM noted as he was warmly hosted by the Russian President for a day long visit.

Earlier expressing similar sentiments Putin said, “There is no need to explain Russian-Indian relations, since we all know that they have deep roots…We are delighted to see you, Mr Prime Minister, and consider you personally as a big friend of our country. We are very glad to be able to have this meeting.”
Congratulating Putin on his re-election, the PM said, “Mr Putin, you have been elected President of the Russian Federation for your fourth term. I want to congratulate you on that…We have already discussed it by telephone, but I wanted to congratulate you in person, and we were able to arrange this meeting at very short notice. Let me congratulate you on my own behalf, as well as on behalf of 1.3 billion people of India.”

The Russian President in his opening remarks also referred to increasing bilateral trade between the two nations. “Last year, our trade saw a significant increase, adding another 17 percent since the beginning of this year.” 

Modi also hailed Putin’s role in granting India full membership in the SCO and BRICS, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), as well as in such mechanisms as the North-South International Transport Corridor. Putin on his part said that Russia and India are proactive in their foreign policy cooperation, including within international organisations such as the UN, BRICS, and now the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

59,2018-05-24,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: India’s oil ministry has ordered Reliance Industries, Royal Dutch Shell and Oil & Natural Gas Corp to pay $3.8 billion as the increased share of the government’s earnings from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields after a UK court rejected challenges to the arbitration award that went against the companies, people familiar with the matter said.

The liability is to be shared by the companies in proportion to their interests in the oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea – ONGC (40%), RIL (30%) and Shell (30%). The demand was made a few days ago.

Reliance and Shell separately said a demand for payment at this stage was premature because the arbitral tribunal is yet to determine the final outcome of the proceedings. Reliance and BG (taken over by Shell) had invoked arbitration against the government in December 2010 after a dispute over the state’s share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast. 

The government said profit should be calculated after adding the marketing margins of the companies and that only the actual taxes paid could be counted as costs, not the notional rate mentioned in the contract

The government barred stateowned ONGC from the arbitration, although the outcome of the proceedings would apply to the exploration company as well.

The arbitration tribunal had pronounced a ‘final partial award’ in October 2016, which went largely in favour of the government.




The ministry of petroleum & natural gas then computed the liability of the three companies and directed them in May last year to pay the differential share of profit and royalty of $3.9 billion. The companies refused to pay, saying the award had been challenged in a UK court and the liability not yet been quantified by the tribunal.

Reliance and Shell registered nine challenges to the award in court, which rejected all but one in its judgement last month. The government recomputed the liability and, citing the court’s verdict, sent a fresh demand notice of $3.8 billion this month, warning that interest will pile up if they don’t pay in time, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

“The English court delivered its judgment on April 16, 2018 and by its order dated May 2, 2018 decided to remit one of the challenged issues back to the arbitration tribunal for reconsideration.

The arbitration tribunal has scheduled a hearing on the remitted issue and shall, thereafter, deliver the award,” a spokesperson for Reliance said in response to ET’s query. 

“The tribunal has to first decide the remitted issue and thereafter consider claimants’ applications for increase in cost recovery limit under the production sharing contracts. After these two issues are decided, the tribunal shall be scheduling the quantification phase of the arbitration to ascertain monetary liabilities, if any, of the parties.”

“The arbitral process is still ongoing and is subject to confidentiality restrictions and any view on the outcome of this process including any potential payments by either of the parties are premature at this stage since further proceedings, including quantification, are yet to be concluded,” a spokesperson for Shell companies in India said.

The oil ministry didn’t respond to ET’s query. ONGC said it is not party to the arbitration and the proceedings in the UK court and has no information on them or any awards or orders passed.

The UK court upheld the tribunal’s view that profit from the fields should be calculated after deducting tax at 33%, not the notional 50% rate. It also agreed with the tribunal in saying that companies must include marketing margins in the sales price for computing the profit share and royalty due to the government. Other challenges that the court dismissed included those related to the limit on cost recovery and the withholding of payments by GAIL India and Indian Oil Corp for output from the fields.

The challenge of the companies that succeeded related to their contention that the government had agreed to certain development costs that could be recovered fully, without restriction. The court noted that the tribunal had failed to address this, giving rise to ‘substantial injustice.’

The production sharing contracts for the PMT fields were signed between the government and the contractor in December 1994 for 25 years."

Here are the 5 reasons that triggered the rally in market

Softening crude prices: Falling crude oil prices supported domestic equity markets on Friday. Price of brent crude oil declined over 3 per cent in the past two trading sessions, whereas Nymex crude oil slipped below $70 per barrel for the first time since May 9, 2018.


Rupee: The local currency continued to recover for the second day, advancing nearly 60 paise to 67.77 against the dollar on increased selling of the greenback by exporters and banks amid rising domestic equity market. Any appreciation in rupee strengthens earnings of firms that have high revenue exposure to the US without a natural hedge of raw material imports. 


All-round buying: Robust buying in financials, oil and gas as well as select auto counters lifted benchmark equity indices higher on Friday. Sustained inflows by domestic institutional investors further supported Indian equity markets.


GDP forecast: Care Ratings in its latest report titled ‘Indian Economy Prognosis: 2018-19’ has forecasted that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth will accelerate to 7.5 per cent in 2018-19, from 6.6 per cent in the last fiscal.


Global cues: Positive global cues also buoyed market sentiment on Friday. European markets were trading in the green, after North Korea made good on its promise to demolish the country’s nuclear test site and said it's still willing to talk with Washington, in response to Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to cancel a summit with the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un. Asian peers closed mixed on Friday. Nikkei and KLSE Composite closed 13.78 points and 21.40 points up at 22,450.79 and 1,797.40, respectively, whereas Hang Seng and Shanghai dipped 0.56 per cent and 0.42 per cent, respectively.

Meanwhile, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and ONGC remained the key drivers of the rally in Sensex.

On the contrary, ITC, Tata Consultancy Services, State Bank of India, Coal India and ICICI Bank remained the top drags on the index.

Shares of Pidilite Industries surged over 6 per cent on Friday to hit 52-week high of 1,146.50 after the company on Thursday reported a 55 per cent jump in the consolidated profit for March quarter.

GAIL (India) surged 4.17 per cent on Friday as its March quarter net profit registered a near four-fold jump.

92,2018-05-28,GAIL,"If crude price continues to be high, then GAIL is a better bet than OMCs and in case it falls, then aviation stocks like SpiceJet have great potential, says 
Harendra Kumar, MD, Institutional Equities, 
Elara Capital. Wherever consumption is a variable, companies are reporting phenomenal top line growth, Kumar tells ET Now.

Edited excerpts:


Over the weekend a lot of important numbers came out, we had numbers from Sun Pharma, BoB, Tech Mahindra, Cadila, which one to your mind stands out?
Let us start with the pharma space. In Sun Pharma, the numbers were nothing to write about as the US business concerns remain and the valuations are too rich. It is still not time to bottom-fish in Sun Pharma at this level. A better bet out there is Cadila Healthcare. The US business story continues to be very strong. We have a 20% upside for Cadila and we have a sell rating for Sun Pharma. Given the paucity of choices on the pharma space, we can have only Cadila as a buy at this point of time.


A lot has been said on what could go wrong in United Spirits and the liquor space. Now, we are discussing what could go right in the liquor space. All liquor companies have come out with a good set of numbers, the management outlook is not that bad and double-digit growth could soon be a reality. What is your view?
This applies to all FMCG companies. Wherever consumption is a variable, most are reporting phenomenal top line growth. Usually, a strong top line growth is accompanied by a great PE expansion. Everything flows into cash and the return ratios go through the roof. From here onwards, there should be more than 15% upside for consumption driven stocks. Liquor space will also fall in that category. If there is a minor correction in consumption stocks, that will need to be bought into. We are in a secular bull market, inflation means buy consumption.


Where have you revised your calls post this earnings season? Has there been any stock which has surprised you on the positive?
We are extremely positive on TCS. Between Reliance and TCS, your index could go and retest the new highs. Among the large-caps, TCS is currently so under-owned by the local mutual fund industry that any price action would mean chasing into the stock and it is same for Reliance. 

Given the capex that Reliance has done over the last five years, its ROAs and ROEs are suppressed and as the people start to see traction, the stock could rerate significantly and take the pole position on the market cap as well. I think these are the two stocks that need to be really watched and they would remain the leaders out there. We are watching TCS and Reliance very, very closely.


What is your view on oil marketing companies? The big fall in crude has taken it back to $75 to a barrel. Is it a very difficult call?
It is a very big variable that you are talking about because he previous rally was driven by OMC stocks. They have had a fantastic run up. With crude at $80, obviously, doubt emerged among investors on what is going to be the government’s stance, whether they are going to sacrifice the marketing margins or if they are going to sacrifice the budget or for that matter their revenue assumptions. 

If it was only revenue assumptions, then NBFCs and other stocks would have corrected because of pressure on the 10-year yield or interest rates. And if they had to sacrifice their marketing margins, then OMCs would have corrected by another 20-25%. 
Our sensitivity analysis shows that if the government had taken steps, OMCs would have cracked phenomenally. One trade out here is that GAIL has a lot of built-in negativity because of the US gas contracts. With crude at high levels, GAIL is a relatively better bet than OMCs. 

If the price correction in crude materialises, you will have a fantastic trade in aviation stocks like SpiceJet which has corrected despite very good results. If crude moves back to $72, you should see SpiceJet moving back to 150 levels. I think this is the framework that we are operating in terms of the crude prices.


Give me your top two ideas with 10-15% upside, where you think money is going to be made in the next one year?
Like I said, SpiceJet is one. If the crude corrects, you have more than 15% on the upside here, potentially Rs 175. Also, one should look at metal stocks. They are a large beta trade. The relative outperformance of metals to emerging market equities has resumed. Hindalco, Nalco and potentially Vedanta could give you that kind of returns very quickly in the next three to four months."

The Nifty50 index opened flat on Tuesday, but failed to hold above the 10,700 mark and wiped out its entire gains of the previous session.

It formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern on daily scale as it covered the entire movement of the last candle and closed below the opening price of previous session. The overall price setup suggests rangebound move with limited upside as well as downside. So it will have support at the 10,550 level to consolidate between 10,550 and 10,735 levels over the next few sessions.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was intact at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,600, while maximum Call OI was at 10,800 followed by 10,700.

Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices, while significant Call writing was seen at 10,700 and then 10,650 levels, which restricted the upside. Options data suggested a trading range between 10,550 and 10,750 levels.

India VIX remained flattish to close at 13.12 level. A lower VIX level even after a fall in the market suggests that the decline would get bought into again.

Bank Nifty failed to hold above 26,500 and remained under pressure for most part of the session. It formed a Bearish Belt Hold Candle on daily scale and negated the formation of higher highs and lows after three sessions. As long as it holds above 26,250, it could witness an upward move towards 26,500 and then 26,750 levels, while on declines major support is seen near 26,100 and 26,000 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a 0.57 per cent loss at 10,618. Long buildup was seen in M&M, Tata Power, GAIL, HCL Tech, Dabur, Idea, JSW Steel and BHEL while shorts were seen in Havells, M&M Financials, Coal India, Glenmark, Bharti Infratel and ZEE.

96,2018-05-29,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State oil companies spent a record Rs 129,000 crore in 2017-18 on acquisitions as well as expanding oil production, refining and distribution facilities. Capex was 22% more than the previous year.

In the last few years, state oil firms have been spending at a rapid pace on drilling wells, laying pipelines, upgrading refineries, expanding cooking gas bottling facilities and marketing infrastructure to meet the growing domestic oil demand. They plan to spend Rs 88,000 crore in the current fiscal year.

India’s oil demand expanded 5.3% in 2017-18, after rising 5.4% in 2016-17 and 11.6% in 2015-16. Growth in production of refined products lagged demand expansion in all three years.

This has meant lower surplus available for export, and increased need to invest in expanding production and distribution infrastructure.


The government’s focus on pushing up natural gas consumption has also prompted bigger investments in pipelines and liquefied natural gas import terminals.

The capex has expanded sharply in the last two financial years due to major acquisitions by state oil firms. ONGC spent about Rs 45,000 crore in acquiring the government stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp and a gas field from Gujarat State Petroleum Corp in 2017-18.

Similarly, in 2016-17, ONGC Videsh, Indian Oil, Oil India and Bharat Petroleum spent about $2.2 billion to acquire stake in Russia’s Vankor field. In 2017-18, ONGC’s capex more than doubled to Rs 72,000 crore fromRs 28,000 crore in the previous year.

Capex by ONGC Videsh, Oil India and Bharat Petroleum dropped sharply in 2017-18 since they made no acquisition as they did in the previous year. Indian Oil’s spending dropped 7% to Rs 21,300 crore.

Spending by GAIL rose two-thirds to Rs 3,600 crore as its gas pipeline project in the eastern India gathered pace. HPCL’s capex too expanded by a fifth to Rs 7,000 crore.

India’s oil production has, however, crawled for several years, necessitating big investments by ONGC and Oil India in exploration and production. ONGC drilled 503 wells at a cost of about Rs 14,000 crore in 2017-18. It has now set a target of spending Rs 17,600 crore on drilling a record 535 wells in 2018-19."

116,2018-05-31,GAIL,"Performance itself is always a good steady trigger for HDFC Bank. It remains firmly a good fundamental story, Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher, tells ETNow. 

Edited excerpts:

ET Now: HDFC Bank is our top story. With the ADR also opening window of opportunity for FIIs to buy through the foreign route into the banks, there is enough and more excitement building up in HDFC Bank. This one does not ever disappoint investors and I think that is what investors are riding on in terms of an interest wave?
Dilip Bhat: You are absolutely right. I think actually HDFC Bank does not require any trigger at all for it to go up because its performance itself is always a good steady trigger at any given point of time. Of course, there is window of opportunity, something which is really providing a good tailwind. 

But having said that, I think maybe in the short run, it would have gone up but I think still it remains a very good core story which you can always own as a part of your core portfolio without any doubt. Because they have consistently delivered. I think there cannot be any argument otherwise except for the fact that it's expensive and it is going to remain expensive because of the performance.


ET Now: Today’s price action in HDFC Bank some would argue is more technical in nature. This is not a reaction which was triggered because of a fundamental factor or change in business environment. So, technical reaction past, they do not last long. That is my limited point.
Dilip Bhat: Sure, I fully agree with that. I think the point is that even if it has gone up, even if it were to correct somewhat, yes. But that is if you really want to play on a very short term basis. 

Most certainly I think one can certainly take a chance, but what our experience always has shown is that a trajectory always has been one of upwards by and large and within that channel there could be some kind of corrections but by and large the channel is upwards. Now, if there is a very short term trade on hand, maybe I cannot comment on that because I think there are so many other factors to be at play. 

This time it is the momentum and this window of opportunity that are providing the tailwind. But all what I am trying to say is this stock still remain firmly as a good fundamental story always.


ET Now: Like a Manpasand Beverages or when you see a intraday drop of 15-17% in a well managed decently tracked company like Shankara Buildcon or Dilip Buildcon, you just wonder that what the underlying sentiment is. I mean right now the market once again has started reacting to rumours and whatsapp messages that yeh kharab ho raha hai, woh kharab ho raha hai and typically this happens when markets are very nervous.
Dilip Bhat: Sure, I think we had seen that happening with two stocks -- PC Jewellers and Vakrangee. When some of these factors apart from the auditors part really played out, then there has been some stock and the other which have always been in the news. Certainly, I think you have used the word very rightly because market levels are at 10,600-odd and we are seeing the kind of build-up that has happened even in the midcaps and especially some of the midcaps which had come out with the issues in the last two years or so.

There was a runaway rise in the price of some of these. There is always such a gap between the fundamentals and actual performance. DMart also is a case, but DMart always has been one of those very good and reliable managements. There is a really a good gap, but that is another story where you can depend on, in the sense that the promoter is so very well reliable person and they have been showing a good compounding growth. 

In case of others, it has always left people chasing the stock and always wondering why the stock prices are so high and I think some of these reasons when they suddenly come out, it is just bound to be a little more contagious in terms of the fears and apprehension. We are in that particular phase and market being at 10,600, some kind of nervousness or apprehension is bound to be there.


ET Now: How are you looking at the oil story and would you take any conviction calls at all even a contrarian one perhaps on OMCs?
Dilip Bhat: First and foremost, the spike in the oil prices I think is really getting everybody worried and I am going to come to the OMCs and the stock. But just one headline statement which I would just like to share is that the rising oil prices are going to put pressure on inflation, the fiscal deficit and what not on the subsidies everything. 

Over the last 15-17 years or 20 years that we have seen, oil prices remaining between $65-70 to $85-90 actually are a very sweet spot for the world economy where the rising tide really takes everything up unless and until the oil spikes above $100. That becomes really worrisome, but $60 to $90 is something which will provide a good tailwind, will provide a good momentum to the world economy and its growth. 

On that basis, I still feel that the oil prices even if they are rising somewhat, I would be much more comfortable. But within these oil stocks, I would still play something like ONGC much better at the moment and may be something like BPCL in the OMC space. But otherwise, I would still be very selective because this is one sector where especially the OMCs have a leverage of increasing the prices. 

But unfortunately we are running into an election season. Despite all the flexibility that these OMCs have, I am sure they will not be in a position to raise their prices to the desired levels. That is the one which is making all of us cautious. HPCL certainly looks pretty interesting from the current levels and I would still bet something like ONGC and to some extent even GAIL at the moment. I think that also looks pretty interesting on an overall basis.


ET Now: ICICI Bank and Axis Bank do not seem to have found favour with the market just as yet. Axis Bank is going through a transition. I think we have clarity on that front by the end of this year. In ICICI Bank, there is too much back and forth happening in this perception challenge. The stock is down pretty much nothing and cannot do anything till investors get some more clarity on what Chanda Kochhar’s position would be at the top in the near future.
Dilip Bhat: Well, you have very rightly put it. This is perception problem and is the one which is still going to remain chronic for some time unless and until there is clarity. I am just giving you an analogy that whenever such kinds of things have happened in the past, we have seen that some of the FIIs taking the lead in terms of trying to exit. 

Fear of apprehension will still remain in a lot of stocks, especially like these. Axis and ICICI Bank in particular possibly will remain muted for some more time till the clarity emerges on some of the issues which the media has been discussing about. They have been discussing very aggressively about all these issues. Till the time there is no clarity, I do not think Axis Bank or ICICI Bank can really make a move. 

But I must say that ICICI Bank after a long time has given a very strong statement, I think Chanda Kochhar has really come forward and said she is guiding for 15% ROE because all along we have seen that the ROEs of ICICI have always been very poor for last 8-10 years. But now, 14-15% is something which can really give a good confidence to the investors. That is how they are going to manage their business and since they are reasonably very well capitalised, I think they should be able to capture that opportunity. 

The caveat of course is the one which you just said right now. The perception problem is something which is going to be hindrance for the stock price, but within the two I would still say that ICICI still looks better provided this doubt is slightly cleared. Because 15% ROEs indeed are a very strong guidance."

11,2018-06-03,GAIL,"India will tomorrow import its first ever cargo of LNG from Russia under a long-term deal as the world's fourth-largest buyer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) diversifies its import basket to meet its vast energy needs. 

 State-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd will bring the shipload of LNG from Gazprom at Petronet LNG Ltd's import terminal here, official sources said. Beginning of supplies from Russia comes within weeks of India importing its first ever LNG cargo from US under a long-term import deal. 

 Like when the US LNG touched at Dabhol port in Maharashtra, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan will be at the Petronet terminal when the Russian gas arrives. 

 GAIL has renegotiated with Russian supplier Gazprom the terms of the 20-year deal to import 2.5 million tonnes a year of LNG. Both price and volume ramp up have been renegotiated. 

 Company Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi had last month stated in New Delhi that the contracted volume has been lowered from 2.5 million tonnes to 0.5 MT in the first year 2018-19, 0.75 MT in 2019-20, 1.5 MT in the third year 2020-21. 

 GAIL has committed to importing the full 2.5 MT a year by the fourth year and make up for the initial volume reduction over the remaining length of the contract. 

 Also, the price indexation has been changed from the Japan Customs-cleared Crude to Brent, and the oil-linked slope of the contract formula lowered, and therefore the final price. 

 Sources said the renegotiated contract provides for diverting a part of the volume, originally contracted on a delivered ex-ship basis, to other markets. 

 Under the re-worked deal with Gazprom, the duration of the contract has been extended by three years and the Indian company has agreed to buy an additional six million tonnes of LNG volumes. 

 The pricing of the super-cooled fuel has been changed from 9-month linkage to Japanese Customs cleared crude to three months average of Brent, sources said. 

 The deferral will allow GAIL more time to find customers for the imported gas. 

 GAIL had signed the original deal on August 29, 2012 with Gazprom Marketing and Trading Singapore Pte Ltd (GMTS), Singapore. The deal was renegotiated in January this year. Gazprom will supply LNG from Yamal LNG project in the Arctic peninsula. 

 India has been making the most of its position as one of the world's biggest energy consumers to strike better bargains for its companies. 

 Last year, India got US energy major Exxon Mobil Corp to lower price of 1.5 MT a year of LNG from Gorgon project in Australia, saving Rs 4,000 crore in import bill. At the time of signing, in 2009, the Gorgon LNG price with US-based ExxonMobil was agreed upon was at 14.5 per cent. 

 In late 2015, it had renegotiated price of the long-term deal to import 7.5 MT per year of LNG from Qatar, helping save Rs 8,000 crore. The contract was renegotiated outside the contractually specified renegotiation period, with the eventual removal of the 60-day moving average ceiling and floor price and waiver of USD 1.5 billion in penalties under the take-or-pay clause for volumes that Petronet had not imported. 

 As a concession, Petronet agreed to buy an additional 1 MT a year and import all the volumes not taken during that time over the remainder of the contract, which runs until 2028. Most recently, GAIL has been trying to renegotiate the price and terms of 3.5 MT a year US Sabine Pass contract with Cheniere Energy. 

 The contract was signed on an FOB basis in 2011, with the price formula set at 115 per cent of the Henry Hub gas price plus a fixed USD 3 per million British thermal unit terminal usage charge. 

 Sources said when the Russian deal was first signed, Gazprom envisaged supplying India with LNG from its planned Schtokman project in the Barents Sea, which was subsequently scrapped as the shale gas revolution in the United States removed a key customer base. 

 The resulting contractual inconsistency gave GAIL a foothold to re-open the Gazprom deal, sources said."

16,2018-06-04,GAIL,"DAHEJ: India has begun importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia as part of its strategy to diversify its supply sources and cater to the rapidly rising local energy needs. 

""Today will be seen as the golden day for India's energy roadmap,"" Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said after receiving the first LNG ship from Russia at Dahej import terminal on Monday. The government is committed towards transforming India into a gas-based economy, he said, adding that supply by Russia will help in achieving that.

Russia is the latest country to begin supplying long-term LNG to India after US, Australia and Qatar. Till two years ago, the country depended solely on Qatar for long-term supplies. 

India is heavily investing in building LNG import terminals and pipelines to import and supply gas across the country. Local production is rising at a pace not enough to meet the rising domestic demand, India will continue to need import, he said. 

India imports 45% of the total amount of natural gas it consumes. With the government's plan to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from about 6.5% now, import of LNG is expected to rise. Natural gas consumption in the country rose 5% to 58 billion cubic meters in 2017-18. The government expects half of India to have access to piped gas for cooking and transport after the new city gas licensing round, which is currently underway. 




The gas supplied by Russia will become important in this context, as will be supplies from the Middle-East, the US and other regions to India, the 3rd largest energy consumer and 4th largest LNG importer in the world. Russia is the largest crude oil and second-largest gas producer in the world. 

In 2012, state-run gas marketer GAIL had signed a 20-year agreement with Russia's energy giant Gazprom for purchase of 2.5 million tonnes of natural gas a year. It also has long-term contracts with US suppliers for 5.8 million tonnes per year of LNG. Supplies from US began earlier this year. 

A sharp drop in the price of LNG, following a crude collapse four years ago, made imported natural gas more affordable in India and also pushed up local demand for the commodity. As spot LNG rates dropped, it made the long-term deals struck before the price collapse by importers like GAIL and Petronet LNG look expensive. Over the last three years, GAIL and Petronet reworked their contracts with suppliers from the Middle-East, Russia and Australia, bringing in more price and delivery flexibility. 

Under the deal renegotiated with Gazprom, the duration of the contract has been extended by three years and GAIL has agreed to buy an additional two million tonnes of LNG over the life of the contract, according to sources. GAIL has the flexibility to import the full contracted volume of 2.5 million tonne (MT) a year from the fourth year of the contract while keeping the purchase lower at 0.5 MT in the first year 2018-19, 0.75 MT in 2019-20 and 1.5 MT in 2020-21.

India and Russia have strengthened their energy partnership in the last few years. A consortium led by Russia's Rosneft invested $13 billion last year to purchase a 20 million tonne refinery and a network of petrol pumps in the country. Indian state firms have so far pumped in about $10 billion for stakes in Russian upstream projects in search of energy supply security."

The Nifty50 index opened in the negative, but managed to hold its immediate support in the 10,700-10,720 zone and recovered towards its crucial hurdle in the 10,770-10,780 zone.

It closed flattish, by forming a Small Bullish Candle on the daily scale and a high wave long-legged Doji Candle on the weekly chart. The index started the week near the 10,765 level and then slipped to 10,550 and again recovered to 10,818 to close near the 10,765 level.

Price setup suggests that every decline is being bought into, while followup is missing at higher levels, which has helped Nifty hold below 10,770 on a closing basis.

Now, the index needs to hold above 10,770 to extend its positive movement towards 10,888 and then 10,929 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,720 and then 10,660 levels.

However, for the momentum to pick up, the Nifty has to cross the 10,820 level and if it happens, the current rally would continue towards 10,950-11,000 levels, they said.


Where are we?
The Nifty after making 11,171 In January made a lower high of 10,929 in May 2018 and these two levels are important to be crossed for bull markets to resume. Only Nifty with just 12-15 stocks is keeping Index higher, while the overall market is weak with almost 18-20% of listed stocks regularly making 52 weeks low and most of the stocks on an average has seen the erosion of more than 25% from January 2018 highs. Nifty below 10,480 and 10,380 then correction starts towards 9,700 or below levels. Nifty 200-DMA of 10,374 and 50-DMA 10,576 are also important levels to watch.


What is in store?
Election in less than 10 months is making big players nervous and with FIIs withdrawing money from emerging markets and flows to MF scheme is also slowing to 24-month low, as in the last 5 months, returns are turning negative. This is a difficult market to make money in next 8-10 months. But it the best market to build a long-term portfolio as many stocks would come to very good attractive levels. Retail is the story which is having good demand and selective pharma stocks are showing bottoming out process.


What could investors do?
An investor having cash level of 40-50% would be ideal, Buy frontline quality stocks like M&M, Reliance, Zee, Sun TV, TCS, Lupin, Titan, Gail, HCL Tech, Yes Bank and ITC. In mid-cap, we like Mahindra Holidays, Trent, Bata India, Petronet, PVR, Eveready, BEL and Coromandel all for 30 months perspective. Next 6-8 months can be uncertain period due to elections but by 2020 end, Nifty is may target 14,500-15,000 so it’s short-term pain with long-term gains.

36,2018-06-11,GAIL,"Fitch Ratings today assigned 'BBB-' rating with stable outlook to state-owned gas utility GAIL India saying its dominant market position is complemented by its diversification into other business segments.
""GAIL's ratings are capped at 'BBB-', which is the rating of its parent, the state of India,"" it said in a statement.

Fitch said it rates GAIL as an integrated utility considering its presence in both gas transportation and marketing along with petrochemical and liquid-hydrocarbon businesses.

""We continue to assess the company in its current form even though there have been reports about a potential separation of GAIL's gas-transmission and marketing businesses as there is no official communication yet regarding this. Fitch treats this as an event risk and will review GAIL's credit profile if there is any change,"" the statement said.

Assumptions that went into the rating include gas consumption growing by 5 per cent over the medium term, GAIL maintaining its current share in gas transmission as well as gas marketing.

""GAIL's dominant market position in the regulated utility gas-transmission business, complemented by its diversification into other business segments, and its healthy credit metrics support a 'BBB' standalone profile,"" Fitch said.

Listing key drivers for the rating, Fitch said government ownership gives the company comfort of support of the sovereign if required.

Assessing the socio-political implications of a default by GAIL as 'moderate', it said a default would be unlikely to severely disrupt GAIL's gas-transmission service as long as the pipeline infrastructure remains intact, while there are other entities that could step in to partially fill the natural-gas marketing and supply gap.

""However, a default would derail investments in new pipeline projects. Fitch sees the financial implications of a GAIL default as 'strong' as it is one of the key state-owned borrowers in India and a financial default may have a strong impact on the availability and cost of financing options for the state and other government-related entities,"" the statement said.

The firm's rating benefits from its dominant position in the Indian gas industry with a nearly three-quarter share of the gas transmission network and more than half of natural-gas sales.

With ongoing pipeline projects of more than 4,000 km likely to enhance GAIL's market position over the medium term, Fitch expected the stable, non-cyclical, regulated gas-transmission business together with gas marketing to continue to account for the majority of its profits over the medium term, driving stable cash flow generation.

On regulatory environment, Fitch said there has been ongoing discussion to move away from multiple tariffs towards a unified/pooled tariff applicable uniformly to all customers to ensure competitiveness of end-products or services of customers located further away along the pipelines.

""The impact of the unified/pooled tariff on GAIL would depend on the final structure and implementation of the tariff. This proposal has also led to a delay in final tariff orders on some of GAIL's pipelines, which are due for a tariff review,"" it said.

GAIL's expanded petrochemical business and its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquid-hydrocarbon segment add diversity to its business profile although these businesses are inherently more volatile than the regulated gas-transmission business.

Its credit profile has improved over the last two years with sound cash flow generation (and lower capex) used for reducing debt, leading to a drop in net leverage, Fitch said adding GAIL's increasing focus on gas-pipeline expansion will raise its capex to Rs 6,600 crore in FY19 and Rs 8,500 crore in FY20.

Fitch said a downgrade of India's rating and a significant shift in GAIL's business profile would lead to negative rating action.

GAIL's cash and cash equivalent balance rose to Rs 1,380 crore as of end-FY18 against current debt maturities of around Rs 11,300 crore.

""However, considering the increasing capex, we expect negative free cash flow generation for next two to three years. We expect GAIL to benefit from its sound access to domestic capital and bank loan markets,"" it added."

41,2018-06-14,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: An initial public offering that’s been in the works for more than four years, may actually take place next month, after Silicon Valley-based Bloom Energy filed its prospectus to go public with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.

Long considered one of the Valley’s “It companies”, having raised an estimated $2.5 billion in equity and debt financing from some of Menlo Park’s biggest residents, Bloom Energy’s decision to go to Wall Street will also once again shine a spotlight on its founder —Indian-born KR Sridhar.

Sridhar had emerged as a darling of risk capital in the last decade as marquee investors, such as Kleiner Perkins Caulfied and Byers and New Enterprise Associates, among others, rushed to back clean energy ventures. Prior to starting Bloom Energy, Sridhar, 58, shot to fame during his time at the University of Arizona, where he was the director of the Space Technology Laboratory and played a key role in NASA’s Mars programme. In fact, the idea of Bloom Energy is believed to have germinated while working at America’s space agency on converting Martian atmospheric gases to oxygen for propulsion and life support.


ET Online
In 2016, Bloom Energy signed an MoU with GAIL, the state-owned natural gas processing and distribution company, to deploy natural gas-based fuel cell technology to generate electricity. However, the latest filing isn’t the first time the California-based company has filed to go public. In fact, in its latest S-1 statement filed with the US SEC, the company has not disclosed how much it expects to raise from the IPO, or the number of shares it plans to sell.

Bloom Energy was reported to have filed for a confidential IPO in 2016 but put those plans on hold. It is understood that the decision to go public by the 15-year-old company, which was last valued at $2.9 billion in 2009, was also driven by the Trump administration’s announcement to restore tax credits that will allow the company to sell its units at a far greater mark-up. Bloom boxes, Bloom Energy’s solid oxide fuel cell power generator, provides 100 kilowatts of electricity —enough to power 100 average US homes, with the average life of its fuel cells was now expected to be over five years, compared to 12-18 months in the early days."

A football team is composed of 11 players; attackers or commonly known as forwards, midfielders, defenders and a goalkeeper who work in sync to score goals and defend the territory.

In the same way, an investor’s portfolio should be made up of high-risk, high-return stocks – the forwards in the football terminology, growth stocks – the midfielders, stocks performing in line with the markets - the defenders, and high dividend yield stocks who perform in good or bad times by giving out dividends – the goalkeeper.

When the above combination of stocks is made, then the portfolio can provide protection against loss and at the same time deliver big gains.

48,2018-06-17,GAIL,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has sold natural gas from three coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks in Jharkhand for a price ranging between USD 5.77 per million British thermal unit to USD 6.12 per MMBtu.

ONGC sold gas from its Bokaro CBM block to a private industry, H N Roy, for USD 5.77 per MMBtu on a gross calorific value basis, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.

State gas utility GAIL India Ltd will buy gas found below coal-seams in the North Karanpura block at USD 5.56 per MMBtu while private sector Positron Energy Pvt Ltd would offtake gas from Jharia CBM block at USD 6.12 per MMBtu.

ONGC is to start production from the three blocks by next month with the peak volumes touching 3 million standard cubic meters per day.

Sources said the company has already drilled six wells on Bokaro block and the 7th well was in progress. A total of 30 wells are planned to be drilled during 2018-19.

Drilling in North Karanpur started this month and 30 wells are planned on the block before March 31, 2019, they said.

The price realised by ONGC is less than the rate at which Essar Oil has sold its entire production of coal-seam gas or CBM from a West Bengal block to state-owned GAIL India Ltd.

GAIL in February bought 2.3 million standard cubic metres per day of CBM that Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (EOGEPL) will produce from its Raniganj block in West Bengal for USD 7.1 per MMBtu.

The rate is more than double of the USD 3.06 per MMBtu price set by the government for most of the domestically produced conventional natural gas.

Essar had used the same formula which Reliance Industries had first used in 2012 to seek bids for its CBM gas from its Sohgpur block in Madhya Pradesh, and then again last year for selling the CBM. In the first instance, the oil ministry had not approved the price.

RIL's Sohagpur gas at today's oil price comes to USD 7.15 per MMBtu on GCV basis.

The formula used by RIL and Essar is the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to import long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.

Sources said gas from North Karanpura is due to flow from July but GAIL has sought an extension of gas offtake up to December to complete pipelines for evacuation.

ONGC is, however, insisting that GAIL honour its commitment to lift gas from July by using truck-mounted cascades."

The government today launched the follow-on fund offer (FFO) of Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), comprising shares of 22 companies, to raise up to Rs 8,400 crore from the market.

The issue opened for anchor investors today, and received subscriptions from investors including mutual funds houses, foreign portfolio investors (FPI), insurance and retirement funds.

The FFO will open for subscription for retail and other institutional investors tomorrow and will remain open till June 22.

Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Atanu Chakraborty said, ""The Bharat-22 FFO is another opportunity for the investors to participate in the India growth story as represented by the industry leading stocks of the ETF.""

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund managed Bharat-22 ETF's fund offer, through which the government aims to mop up Rs 6,000 crore with a green shoe option of raising another Rs 2,400 crore.

As much as 25 per cent of total issue size, or Rs 1,500 crore, was reserved for anchor investors who put in bids worth about Rs 5,163 crore, ICICI Prudential AMC said.

""We are happy to see the continued support received from anchor investors towards the FFO... Now, we look forward to active participation from non-anchor investor category, over the next three days, whereby one has the opportunity to own some of the jewels of Corporate India at a discounted price,"" ICICI Prudential AMC MD and CEO Nimesh Shah said.

The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T.

The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs 32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs 14,500 crore.

The state-owned companies that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- feature in the Bharat-22 index.

The government plans to raise Rs 80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs 1 lakh crore raised last year.

Besides, the government will launch the initial public offering of railway consultancy firm RITES tomorrow through which it will divest 12 per cent stake. The IPO is expected to fetch over Rs 460 crore to the exchequer.

Prior to the launch of Bharat-22 ETF, which has a diversified portfolio, the government had floated the CPSE ETF comprising stocks of 10 bluechip PSUs -- ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.

Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised Rs 11,500 crore in three tranches -- Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017."

75,2018-06-21,GAIL,"Nifty will try to retest the new highs in the next 90 to 100 days. It will be driven by Reliance and the tech pack, Harendra Kumar, MD–Institutional Equities, Elara Capital, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


India has upped import duty on some chemicals but what is the whole impact on the imposition of tariffs on imports of steel and iron ore?
India’s major surplus from the US is not from steel and iron, it is more from software services. It is not impacting India domestic steel manufacturers so much. In fact, rupee depreciation is a positive and the overall global rise in steel prices are a big variable, given that our local prices are reset on import parity.

The overall move towards increasing tariffs worldwide means that the average selling price worldwide is increasing with real demand. India is the only place where actual demand and steel prices are nudging upwards. Overall, in this game, India stands to benefit at least on the metal side.


Is it too early to assess the net impact of these tariffs being slapped across the world? What about its effect on global growth, on growth in the US and China as also the net impact on India as well?
The net impact is being felt today in the markets. The way China is falling off the radar and India outperforming emerging markets means that the market is recognising that we are a domestic-oriented economy and quite resilient from the pyrotechnics of global trade wars. The effect could be very positive for the Indian markets and this reflect in how the Nifty has been holding up.


How should one approach oil PSUs? Nomura in its latest note believes that they are attractive after the recent correction. Do you find merit in looking at OMCs right now?
For that we have to track the crude actually. The selloff happened when the government went into a silent mode while crude was going up. They did not clarify their position on marketing margins or for that matter on how petrol prices will move up. What the OMCs can do in this situation, what the government intends to do and whether they would want the OMCs to keep the profits etc.

Because of this uncertainty, the stock prices have come off. Till the crude price uncertainty continues on where it is going to settle, one should stay away from OMCs. They always look attractive and cheap at certain price levels but we have to understand the global dynamic of a deflationary trade over a falling crude price, falling interest rate is over. In the next two to three years, you might see interest rates going up and crude or commodities remaining firm.

In that context, we are not so comfortable with OMCs holding up. Gas is a much better place than OMCs.


Within gas names, would you be stock specific?
That space is pretty much categorised. CGD companies with steady volume growth like Indraprastha Gas or a Mahanagar Gas. An interesting story is emerging in Gujarat Gas and Gujarat State Petronet, given the differential in fuel oil where the migration from fuel oil to gas is happening. The stocks are cheap as well. Plus, there is an industry revival which is reflecting in volume growth. Frankly, Indraprastha Gas or a GAIL are structural buys. You have two extremely cheap stocks that could generate more alpha than some of the other gas names.


Where are you building conviction in the market right now? Are you advising clients to stay off because the markets are largely going to be range bound? Where do you see an alpha opportunity?
Between Reliance and TCS, the market will go to new highs. The context remains the same. The broader Nifty could struggle but Nifty will try to retest the new highs in the next 90 to 100 days. That will be driven by Reliance and the tech pack. This is where a lot of value plus a rerating momentum continues. In the rest of the index space, private banking looks very strong, This is where potential trading action is going to be over next 3-4 months.


What is your take from a common investor perspective?
The market landscape is changing. There are select opportunities for some midcaps but you have to be selective out there because as we have seen in other midcaps the scalability of midcaps beyond a point of time becomes questionable. One will have to cherry pick and be very, very selective. There is still some value in some of the IT midcaps which are trading at very low teens PE multiples but so also some of the large cap names. While the midcap rerates the large caps continues to look very attractive. While we stay selective in midcaps, a larger trade is available on some of the large cap names.


Is there merit in relooking at ICICI Bank or Axis Bank as there is clarity on which way the top leadership is going to head?
I would still be cagey about ICICI Bank. I had mentioned before the results as well that the stock is over owned. All the triggers have played out in terms of listing of all the subsidiaries but the stock has actually not delivered. The placement of a new COO would mean that you are wishing away the complexities of the resolution of this problem. I am not too sure. Frankly for me, alpha is coming from IndusInd, Kotak or an HDFC Bank. There is more alpha generation there than potentially some of the names that you have mentioned. We would like to be overweight on the other three that I have mentioned rather than ICICI Bank or Axis Bank over the medium term.


What would be your top avoid in the market right now or best bet for profit taking in some pockets?
People are trying to bottom fish in pharma. It was a trading pop that you just witnessed over some days. There there are no structural changes that could drive return ratios or top line profits. I would say that companies that are over owned and still potentially stuck. in these names one can look for liquidation."

78,2018-06-21,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Bank of Baroda (BoB) has complained to the country's premier federal probe agency that bankrupt pipes maker PSL Ltd. siphoned off about of Rs 700 crore from a dedicated account linked to GAIL projects, the payments from which were due to the lender and not the insolvent company.

In its complaint with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the bank has alleged that PSL resorted to financial irregularities and withdrew the amounts without the knowledge of the lender, three people familiar with the matter told ET. Two other accounting firms were also allegedly involved.

The bank brought a charge of “serious economic offences” as the borrowing company failed to repay loans with “fraudulent intention”. 

The CBI complaint may follow with an FIR, banking sources said.

Bank of Baroda and ICICI Bank, the lender where PSL maintained the account and withdrew the cash that was supposedly meant for the state-run bank, did not reply to ET’s email queries. Cash from a GAIL project coming into PSL’s account in ICICI Bank was meant for BoB, and not PSL, the state-run bank has said in its complaint.

ICICI Bank is said to have refuted these charges. 

The matter goes back to 2011 when PSL obtained a loan from a foreign bank to finance a Rs 743-crore order from state-owned GAIL. A condition in that credit facility was that the company was to provide an undertaking that inflows through ICICI Bank would be deposited with that foreign bank account, the BoB complaint said. Later, the foreign bank sold the loan to BoB, with all other conditions remaining unchanged.

BoB alleged that some staff at ICICI Bank, PSL and Ashok Punj, PSL managing director, were involved in the financial irregularities that caused the loss. ET has viewed the contents of the complaint.

On September 9, 2011, BoB sent a letter to other lenders including ICICI Bank citing the specific GAIL projects, informing the BoB’s exclusive charge over the stocks and receivables pertaining to particular GAIL projects, the complaint claimed.

PSL defaulted on BoB loans in July, 2012. The company cited a receivable of Rs 414 crore from GAIL, duly certified by M/s R Devarajan & Co and M/s Anand Shenoy & Associates, both mentioned in the CBI complaint, to secure a relaxed repayment option. BoB has alleged that the two accounting firms had misled the lender on the receivables.

BoB had initially loaned PSL about Rs 300 crore; along with interest on the amount, the total dues are about Rs 400 crore, according to a banking source with the knowledge of the matter. 

The loan was restructured twice only to face defaults with BoB, which marked it as a bad loan.

Later, an accounting audit revealed that outstanding receivables from GAIL were only Rs 24.3 crore against Rs 414 crore. PSL already had received Rs 389 crore but did not leave the funds in the designated account with Bank of Baroda, violating the terms mutually agreed upon earlier, sources said. 

Last year in July, PSL filed for bankruptcy proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. It owed Rs 4,000 crore to about two dozen banks and other institutions collectively."

85,2018-06-26,GAIL,"When crude oil prices head north globally, investors typically exit Indian state-run energy producers that run the risk of sharing the subsidy burden on motor fuels. Not this time, it seems.

India’s largest gas transmission company GAIL is set to benefit from higher prices of LPG and petrochemicals while expanding its positive marketing margins on long-term gas contracts. Such benefits could result in a 6-18% earnings upgrade in the next three years for GAIL, which has fallen about 9 per cent since the beginning of the year. The stock performance could now reverse.

The profitability of the LPG and petrochemical segments is expected to improve due to higher prices of crude oil. These two segments account for a third of GAIL’s operating profit. Prices of LPG and petrochemicals are directionally linked to the trajectory of crude oil rates, although the quantum of price change depends upon the demand and supply of LPG and different petrochemical products.

According to analysts’ estimates, every five-dollar increase in crude oil rates could boost earnings by 1.5-2 per cent. Prices of LPG and polymers increased 20 per cent to Rs 40 per kg and Rs 102 per kg in the past six months. Volumes of both segments are expected to improve. LPG volumes are likely to grow due to increasing gas volumes from ONGC. LPG production rose 18 per cent in FY18.

Similarly, utilisation at the petrochemical plant is expected to rise. Higher utilisation and lower feed-cost after the renegotiation of gas prices could lower the cost of production of the petrochemical segment.


According to Nomura, the petrochemical segment’s operating profit could beRs270 crore andRs980 crore in FY19 and FY20, respectively.

Long-term US and Russian gas contracts also may become favourable. The probable loss on long-term gas contracts has weighed on the stock in the past two years when crude oil remained below $50 per barrel. Typically, theoretical prices of gas, depending on the energy intensity, are 12-16 per cent of the prices of crude oil.

The Street was factoring in loss from these contracts due to a sharp mismatch between contract prices and spot prices when crude oil dropped significantly, and landed prices of gas were at a 75 per cent premium to spot gas in 2016. Consequently, analysts were expecting an annual loss of Rs 2,000 crore.

GAIL had signed two long-term contracts to procure a total 5.8 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) of gas from the US, and 2.8 MTPA from Russia.

If crude oil price remains at current levels, GAIL could record positive marketing margins compared with an earlier expectation of loss. This could further support an earnings upgrade. According to CLSA estimates, the gas marketing business earns $1 per MMBtu as trading margins: On unallocated long-term US and Russian gas, it could earn a trading profit ofRs288-1,369 crore between FY19 and FY21."

Corporates like IOC, GAIL, Idea Cellular, NALCO, NHPC and SBI have picked a place each or two, to pitch in as part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). 

Officials involved in the project said a major component has been installation of drinking water facility, ATMs, bio-toilets and underground waste collection bins at most locations, like at Jagannath Temple in Puri and Golden Temple in Amritsar and starting battery operated vehicles at Tirupati or advanced mechanised cleaning and sweeping facilities at places like Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain.

103,2018-06-28,GAIL,"India is working on plans to enable gas utility GAIL to keep its marketing and pipeline operations separate without breaking up the company, India's oil minister said on Thursday.

 The government had said in January that it wanted to split the company into two - one for laying pipelines and the other for marketing and petrochemicals - to encourage more transparency between the two operations. ""My job is not to create more companies, my job is to create more accessibility through policy,"" Dharmendra Pradhan, India's oil minister said on Thursday.

 GAIL (India) Ltd is the country's biggest gas marketing and trading firm and owns most of the nation's pipelines, giving it a dominant position in the country's energy market. Investors, private companies and consultants have said that GAIL's dominance in pipeline infrastructure across the country conflicts with its business of marketing and trading of natural gas.

 Pradhan said: ""Gail must be seen to be transparent,"" adding that Gail was working on a model to keep its pipeline and marketing businesses independent of each other.

 ""My job is to create more transparency and a neutral platform so that other companies can also utilise that infrastructure,"" Pradhan said.

 He did not give a reason for the government's change of position on splitting up the company, which was seen earlier as a move to raise money by selling its marketing arm to a state-owned oil refining and marketing company.

 The country's top two refiners Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd had shown interest in integrating GAIL's marketing arm with their business.

 'Unbundling' of GAIL was one of the three key steps towards creating a natural gas marketplace in India, the other two being forming a trading hub and open access to gas pipelines, the head of India's gas regulator D K Sarraf had told Reuters in April. ""The unbundling will happen but not in a physical form,"" Sarraf said on Thursday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to increase the use of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 percent by 2030 from 6.5 percent now."

4,2018-07-04,GAIL,"The Indian equity market saw a relatively stable session on Tuesday. The market opened with modest losses but soon recovered to trade in the positive trajectory. The benchmark Nifty50 ended the day with net gains of 42.60 points or 0.40%.

The upward move was also on ground of short covering, which was very much evident as the Nifty futures gained more than the index.

In Wednesday’s trade, we need to note that despite the bounce seen in Nifty, the index is tracking the pattern resistance and has not yet pulled back enough to move past it. Under the circumstances, the 10,750-10,800 zone continues to pose important resistance to Nifty.

It is still evident the Nifty is not yet completely out of the woods until the above-mentioned levels are breached on the upside.

The 10,750 and 10,800 levels will act as major resistance for the Nifty, while support should come in at 10,660 and 10,610 levels.



The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 49.3899. It continued to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD continued to remain bearish, even as it traded below the signal line.

Pattern analysis showed after a downward breakdown of the Nifty from the large symmetrical triangle formation, the index has pulled back. However, it continues to face resistance at the support that it breached on the downside.

Overall, despite pullbacks, Nifty is still facing resistance in the support line it breached. The pullbacks are merely tracking the upward rising resistance and therefore the pullbacks are not enough to take the 50-pack completely out of the woods.

For the current breakdown to fail, it would be imperative for the Nifty to move past the 10,800 mark. Until this happens, it will remain vulnerable to slide from higher levels. We expect the Wednesday’s session to remain rangebound and recommend a highly cautious and stock specific approach to the trade.


STOCKS TO WATCH:
Fresh long positions were seen being added in stocks like RIL, NCC, SAIL, Nalco, Sun Pharma, Adani Enterprises, Ashok Leyland, Dabur and Gail.

6,2018-07-05,GAIL,"In a technically significant session on Wednesday, the Nifty50 continued its pullback as the benchmark index ended yet another day gaining 70 points, or 0.65 per cent. The session can be termed as technically important because the Nifty moved past and ended above the 50-DMA and also the short-term 20-DMA.

The previous session was a step in the direction of failing the downward breakdown that the market suffered in the previous session. If we get a positive start on Thursday and if the Nifty moves past the critical 10,775-10,800 zone, it will, for the time being, fail the breakout that it suffered from the large symmetrical triangle on the daily charts.

Thursday’s session will be important for the Nifty in more ways than one. The 10,800 and 10,835 levels will act as important resistance, while supports will come in at 10,710 and 10,660 levels.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 53.6912. It continues to remain neutral and shows no divergence against the price. The daily MACD still remains bearish as it trades below its signal line. However, it is narrowing its trajectory and moving towards a positive crossover. Apart from a white body, no significant formations were observed on the candles.



Pattern analysis shows the likelihood of a failure of the downward breakdown that the Nifty suffered a couple of days back. If the index manages to successfully move past the 10,775-10,800 zone, the breakdown seen previously can be termed as a false one.

Overall, there are higher chances of the Nifty continuing the pullback. Its closing above the 50-DMA and above the short-term 20-DMA is positive for the markets. Subject to the Nifty moving past the 10,775-10,800 range, Nifty is likely to scale higher if the ongoing momentum continues. We recommend staying away from creating short positions. Value purchases may be made, and profits should be protected until the 10,800 level is surpassed. A positive outlook is advised for the day.

10,2018-07-08,GAIL,"Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) will commission a 5 million tonnes a year liquid gas (LNG) import terminal at Mundra in Gujarat in next two to three months, its Managing Director Jagdip Narayan Singh said. 

Mundra will be the third import terminal in Gujarat to import super-cooled natural gas (liquefied natural gas or LNG) in cryogenic ships and then re-converting the liquid fuel into its gaseous state before transporting it by pipelines to customers. 

GSPL LNG Ltd, a GSPC group firm which is implementing the project in partnership with Adani Group, will look at inducting a strategic partner like Indian Oil Corp (IOC) once the terminal is fully operational, he told here. 

""We will commission Mundra terminal by August-end or mid-September. It will operate at 1.5 million tonnes a year capacity for first one and a half years before scaling up to full capacity,"" Singh, who is also the Chief Secretary of the state, said. 

The Mundra terminal, whose capacity will be expandable to 10 million tonnes per annum in future, is designed to have a berth for receiving LNG tankers of sizes 75,000 cubic metres to 2,60,000 cubic metres, two LNG storage tanks of capacity 1,60,000 cubic metres each, facilities for regasification and gas evacuation. 

Gujarat already has a 15 million tonnes a year import facility operated by Petronet LNG Ltd at Dahej and another 5 million tonnes terminal at Hazira that is run by Shell. 

Besides, Dahej and Hazira, India currently has two more LNG terminals - Dabhol in Maharashtra and Kochi in Kerala, both with 5 million tonnes a year capacity. More import terminals are planned on the east coast as well as on the west to meet the fast growing energy needs of the country. 

Singh said the Gujarat state government owned company has decided to commission the import terminal first and then look at a strategic partner. 

""We have been in talks with IOC but as partnership was delayed we have now decided to first commission the terminal and then see who can we get as a partner,"" he said. 

IOC had in August last year stated that it will acquire up to a 50 per cent stake in the Adani Group-backed Mundra LNG import terminal in Gujarat for an estimated Rs 750 crore. 

The board of India's largest oil firm gave ""in-principle approval for acquiring up to 50 per cent equity in GSPL LNG Ltd, which is setting up a 5 million tons per annum LNG terminal at Mundra Port in Gujarat, the company had said in a statement. 

GSPL LNG is a joint venture of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp and Adani Enterprises. GSPL LNG will hold the remaining 50 per cent stake in the LNG terminal. Adani and GSPC are equal partners in GSPL LNG. 

While the company had not given the acquisition cost, an official said roughly 30% of the Rs 5,040 crore project cost is equity and IOC would pay half of it. 

""Once the project is complete, we can command a premium,"" Singh said. 

He said Mundra will be connected to Gujarat State Petronet Ltd's (GSPL) existing pipelines network at Anjaar, Gujarat. 

When GSPL LNG put up on offer stake in the Mundra LNG project four years back, eight firms including GAIL had expressed interest in buying the stake but only three were shortlisted. Besides IOC, India Gas Solutions, the equal joint venture between the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries and Europe's second-largest oil firm BP, and state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) were shortlisted. 

Singh indicated that the company may run a new process to select a strategic partner. ""Once the terminal is complete we can start looking at who can come in... lets see its too early to say,"" he said."

13,2018-07-10,GAIL,"South Korea has sought the intervention of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office (PMO) to instil confidence among Korean investors, while airing serious concerns over the fate of existing Korean investments in the Indian power sector. South Korean president Moon Jae-in is touring India since Sunday. 

Ahead of a summit with PM Modi to discuss economic cooperation, South Korea raised concerns over abrupt, arbitrary and unfair policy changes by India that adversely affected South Korea’s first foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Indian power sector.

South Korean authorities have also expressed unease over the fate of their joint venture investment in Indian power sector turning into non-performing assets and facing threat of Indian banks moving the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to initiate insolvency process.

The South Korean Ambassadors to India, former and present, Cho Hyun and Shin Bong-kil, wrote to several top Indian government bureaucrats, including officials at the PMO and power secretary, seeking their intervention to make the Indo-South Korean power joint venture -- Pioneer Gas Power Ltd (PGPL) -- economically viable.

South Korean government-owned company Korean Western Power Company Ltd (KOWEPO) holds 40% stake in PGPL, which had set up a 388MW gas-based power plant at Raigad in Maharashtra. The Indian partners, Pioneer group, holds the balance 60% in the JV. The project has been lying idle since July 2016 for want of fuel supplies. According to the South Korean government representatives, the project has “consistently been facing regulatory and policy hurdles”.

The Korean Ambassador Shin Bong-kil in a recent appeal to the PMO said, “Your kind intervention will help instil trust and confidence in Korean investors, in this case KOWEPO, and reassure them of the Indian government’s commitment to create and maintain a business-friendly environment.”

While emphasising the interest of Korean investors given the significant potential the Indian market offered, the KOWEPO representatives have expressed concerns over the fate of their existing India investments.

“Our experience with regard to the fate of our investments, however, is making us wary and reluctant in making further investments in India,” said Song Jae Sub, vice president of Korea Western Power Company Ltd (KOWEPO), in a letter addressed to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in April.

The KOWEPO representative said their decision to invest in India was based on “all the comfort/assurance letters for gas allocation received from Central Electricity Authority, a government organisation of India, and undertaking received from the state of Maharashtra for procurement of 50% of the power generated from the said project, the various statements and data by the Government of India on the availability of domestic gas for power generation, the stated policy objectives of the Government of India to seek and promote investments in gas-based generation capacity and other supportive policies of the Government of India and government of Maharashtra for such investment”.

Though PGPL had signed a memorandum of understanding with the South Korean steel giant POSCO to sell 130MW of power to its steel plant located in Maharashtra, it could not commence supplies as they turned economically unviable with change in government’s policy.

Despite the comfort letter from the CEA on gas allocation, the project suffered adversely owing to “arbitrary changes in gas allocation policies by the Government of India,” said the KOWEPO vice president, adding that the “abrupt refusal by the state of Maharashtra to procure 50% of the power generated despite assurances” had also added to their woes.

The hopes of South Korea were temporarily raised when the Indian government announced the gas policy for utilising of stranded gas-based power generation capacity through e-bid RLNG scheme in March 2015. However, the South Korean representatives said, “Our project faced restrictive trade practices from GAIL and by the time we resolved such issues and started participating, the Government of India let the policy lapse in March 2017.”

Despite the South Korean Ambassador meeting the PMO officials in May 2017 seeking their intervention to resolve the issue at PGPL, “there has been no response pursuant to this meeting”, said the KOWEPO official.

Bringing to the notice of the CEA that the Indian banks that lent money to PGPL’s project were “threatening to take the project to NCLT”, the South Korean representative said, “It would be a tragedy to see the eco-friendly and efficient plant sold at scrapped value only.”

Urging the Indian authorities to resolve the issue at PGPL’s Maharashtra plant and protect KOWEPO’s investments, the South Korean representative said, “We firmly believe that this will not only further boost the friendly cooperation between the two countries, but also restore confidence among the Korean investors in the Indian market.”

Neither the PMO officials nor the South Korean embassy representatives responded to ET seeking comments on the apprehensions raised over the fate of overseas investments."

19,2018-07-10,GAIL,"The Reliance-BP joint venture today bid for licence to retail gas in 15 cities while Indraprastha Gas Ltd put in bids for 13 cities.

Bidding for the biggest city gas distribution licensing round, offering 86 permits for selling CNG and piped cooking gas in 174 districts in 22 states and union territories, closes this evening.

India Gas Solutions Pvt Ltd -- the 50:50 JV of UK's BP plc and Reliance Industries, is making its maiden foray in city gas distribution as it put in bid for 15 cities, sources said.

IGL, which retails CNG in the national capital region, is putting in bids for 13 cities, they said.

Essel Infraprojects Ltd has put in a total of seven bids.

As many as 86 geographical areas (GAs), made by clubbing adjacent districts, are on offer in the 9th city gas distribution (CGD) bidding round.

The GAs cover 24 per cent of the country's area and 29 per cent of its population.

The round is likely to attract investments of Rs 70,000 crore, according to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB).

The government is targeting to raise the share of natural gas in primary energy basket to 15 per cent from 6 per cent at present, within a few years.

The bid round is also aimed at meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of giving piped cooking gas connection to 1 crore households, roughly triple the current size, by 2020.

The CGD licences on offer are for Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh; Ahmednagar in Maharashtra; Ludhiana and Jalandhar in Punjab; Barmer, Alwar and Kota in Rajasthan; Coimbatore and Salem in Tamil Nadu; Allahabad, Faizabad, Amethi and Rai Bareli in Uttar Pradesh; Dehradun in Uttarakhand and Burdwan in West Bengal.

Prior to the 9th round, 91 GAs were awarded to firms like Indraprastha Gas Ltd and GAIL Gas Ltd, which are serving 240 million population, 42 lakh domestic consumers and 31 lakh CNG vehicles.

Of these, 56 GAs were awarded through bidding rounds and the rest on government nomination.

The bid round is being held on changed parameters after one paisa bids spoilt the initial auction rounds.

Bidders have been asked to quote the number of CNG stations to be set up and number of domestic cooking gas connections to be given in the first eight years of operation.

In the previous eight rounds, bidders were asked to quote only the tariff for the pipeline that carries gas within the city limits. These bidding criteria did not include the rate at which an entity would sell CNG to automobiles or piped natural gas to households using the same pipeline network, leading to companies offering one paisa as the tariff to win licences.

In the new guidelines, maximum weightage of 50 per cent has been given to the number of piped gas connections proposed in eight years from the date of authorisation, as compared to 30 per cent earlier.

The number of CNG dispensing stations proposed to be set up has been assigned 20 per cent weightage. Length of the pipeline to be laid in the GA and the tariff proposed for city gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) have been assigned 10 per cent weightage each.

Also, a floor tariff of Rs 30 for city gas and Rs 2 per kg for CNG has been put in order to deter bidders from quoting unviable tariff of 1 paisa per unit.

Companies having a net worth of not less than Rs 150 crore can bid for cities with a population of 50 lakh and more while the same for cities with population of 20 lakh to 50 lakh has been proposed at Rs 100 crore.

The net worth eligibility goes down with population, with a Rs 5 crore net worth firm being eligible to bid for cities that have less than 10 lakh population.

Last few rounds of CGD have evoked a lukewarm response. The fourth round was altogether cancelled, while the fifth saw a sparse response.

The sixth round of bidding for 34 cities in 2015 got bids for only 20. The seventh round of bidding done to set up CGD infrastructure in 11 smart cities under smart city mission received only 1 bid.

Seven cities were offered in the 8th round last year but not all cities have been awarded so far."

Equity markets were treading higher amid positive Asian cues, while a fresh fall in global crude oil prices and an improvement in Indian rupee against the US dollar also influenced the sentiment.

Steel pipeline has already been laid for 28 km and medium density polyethylene (MDPE) pipe laying for 102 km has been completed. About 800 km of steel and MDPE pipelines will be laid in the city as part of the project, the release added.

The CGD network will also cover four industrial areas and can cater to 150 industries and 500 commercial enterprises. It is expected to give direct employment to 1,000 people and indirect employment to many more.

The Varanasi CGD project was developed simultaneously with the Jagdishpur Haldia and Bokaro Dhamra/ Barauni- Guwahati Pipeline Project (JHBDPL/BGPL), popularly known as the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga.

The pipeline project of total length 3,291 km is being executed at the cost of about Rs 13,000 crore.

It will cater to the energy requirements of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam covering 70 districts and 3,150 villages.

25,2018-07-16,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Spooked by fresh Sino-US trade war tensions and China’s soft GDP growth data for second quarter, investors turned cautious on Dalal Street on Monday.

Last week, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty gained over 2 per cent on the back of a fall in crude prices, earnings boost and a recovery in the rupee. Experts believe the general market setup continues to be bullish, but the Nifty50 may consolidate for some more time.

With June quarter earnings season in full swing, the market will continue to see stock-specific actions. The focus has shifted to management commentaries and guidance for the coming months, making fund managers to review and reshuffle their portfolios, says Rahul Sharma, Senior Research Analyst, Equity99.

""In the near future, the market may see some profit booking. We expect the short-term trend to reverse only after the Nifty slips below its crucial support at 10,999 while a key resistance is seen around the 11,100 mark,” Sharma said.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver gains over the next three weeks.

The stock moved past its multiple resistance area that fall in the Rs 340-351 zone. The weekly MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The weekly RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is a bullish indication. The stock has ended above its upper Bollinger band and this signals a likely breakout. The Bollinger band remains 42 per cent narrower-than-normal and this increases the possibility of a sharp move in prices. Any move below Rs 339 will be a negative for the stock.

Mahindra Life Sciences | BUY | Target Price: Rs 690 | Stop loss: Rs 585

This counter appears to have resumed its uptrend as it consolidated after around 20 per cent drop from the recent high of Rs 668. Recent price behaviour is pointing towards a possible change in the larger trend of this counter. In that case on resumption of rally, it should ideally head towards its logical targets placed around Rs 690 level. In between, the Rs 620 level can be a hurdle and momentum shall pick up if it manages a sustainable close above this level. Positional traders shall buy into this counter with a stop below Rs 585 on a closing basis.


Sonata Software | BUY | Target Price: Rs 380 | Stop loss: Rs 307
For the past couple of weeks, this counter appeared to be in a 100-point trading range between Rs 380 and Rs 280. Last two sessions of fast-paced recovery is suggesting that this counter has hit a durable bottom at recent low of Rs 272 after breaching the lower boundary of its consolidation zone. Hence, it can easily target towards upper end of the trading range. Considering the fact that this counter has rallied around 20 per cent in two sessions, traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying at current prices and adding on declines around Rs 320 for a target of Rs 380. Stop loss suggested for the trade is at Rs 307.


Bharat Petroleum | BUY | Target Price: Rs 412 | Stop loss: Rs 370
After a recent crash from the highs of Rs 430, this counter appears to have formed a strong base around Rs 360 and appears to have broken out of its narrow rangebound move between Rs 380 and Rs 360 kind of levels. Hence, sustaining above Rs 375, this counter can be expected to head towards its logical target of Rs 412. Stop suggested for the trade is Rs 370.

Key indices Sensex and Nifty were down, tracking weak Asian cues. Investors were cautious after an official data showed that China's economy slowed a little in the second quarter. 

Weak domestic macroeconomic indicators too hit the sentiment. India's trade deficit widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee. 

Moreover, both retail and wholesale price inflation have shown an uptick amid wobbly rupee and crude oil prices.

38,2018-07-18,GAIL,"India's renegotiated gas import deal with Russia's Gazprom will save between Rs 8,500 crore and Rs 9,500 crore over the contract period ending 2040, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.

State-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd had in January taken advantage of the Russian company's inability to deliver liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the previously agreed Schtokman project in the Barents Sea, to renegotiate price agreed in 2012.

In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said the first cargo of Russian natural gas under the long-term contract between GAIL India Ltd and Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore (GMTS) was received on June 4.

He said: ""GAIL and Gazprom successfully re-negotiated the long-term LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement reflecting the current global gas market dynamics.

The renegotiated price, compared to earlier contract price, will result in saving of approximately Rs 8,500 crore (crude oil at USD 50 per barrel) or Rs 9,000 crore (crude oil at USD 60 per barrel) or Rs 9,500 crore (crude oil at USD 70 per barrel) for the years 2018 to 2040.""

Without giving specific details, Pradhan said the gas price was negotiated depending on many factors like project location, duration of contract and pricing formula.

GAIL renegotiated the terms of the 20-year deal to import 2.5 million tonnes a year of LNG, including price and volume ramp up.

The contracted volume has been lowered from 2.5 million tonnes to 0.5 million tonnes in the first year, 2018-19; 0.75 million tonnes in 2019-20 and 1.5 million tonnes in the third year 2020-21.

The contract period has been extended by three years to accommodate the supplies not taken in initial years as well as getting an additional 2 million tonnes over-and-above the 50 million tonnes it had agreed to take in 2012 over the 20 year contract period.

India has been making the most of its position as one of the world's biggest energy consumers to strike better bargains for its companies.

Last year, India got US energy major Exxon Mobil Corp to lower the price of 1.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from Gorgon project in Australia, saving Rs 4,000 crore in import bill.

Pradhan said India currently has four operational LNG import terminals at Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat, Dabhol in Maharashtra and Kochi in Kerala with a total LNG import capacity 27.5 million tonnes per annum.

After regasification, the imported LNG is distributed to industries and domestic consumers through existing pipeline networks, he said."

34,2018-07-18,GAIL,"Following Monday’s loss, the Nifty50 recovered nearly all of its losses in Tuesday’s trade as the broader market recovered. The benchmark index gained in Tuesday’s breadth and ended the day gaining 71.20 points or 0.65 per cent. Market breadth, too, improved as advances outnumbered the declines.

In Tuesday’s trade, the market chose to remain in consolidation mode rather than drifting further down. As we approach Wednesday’s trade, we expect such consolidation to continue and expect the market to trade within a broad range. However, chances of a ranged consolidation are higher, and we do not expect any major corrective decline to happen.

On Wednesday, Nifty is likely to see immediate resistance at 11,050 and 11,080 levels, while supports should come in at 10,965 and 10,910. In the current context, the intraday strength of Nifty has got wider in terms of finding resistance and support areas.



The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 63.0381. It remains neutral and shows no divergence against the price. The daily MACD is bullish, as it trades above the signal line. Apart from of a white body, no significant formations were observed on the candles.

Pattern analysis shows Nifty has temporarily stalled its rally and is now consolidating after a sharp move following an upward breakout. The index has successfully broken above the falling trend line pattern resistance.

Overall, we still feel it may be a while before the Nifty resumes its upward move and tests its previous high at 11,170. However, it continues to maintain a buoyant structure and shows no sign of any serious downsides. In the event of the broader market witnessing some correction again, Nifty may continue to trade in a range while remaining somewhat volatile.

Investors should abstain from creating short positions and continue to make select purchases on any downside as the market remains intact structurally.

Of the 86 cities offered for retailing of CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households in the 9th CGD bid round, IOC bid for 34 cities on its own and another 20 in partnership with Adani Gas Ltd, according to final bid information provided by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB).

Adani Gas on its own bid for 32 cities.

Bharat Gas Resources Ltd, a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), bid for as many as 53 cities while state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd's retailing arm, GAIL Gas Ltd, put in offers for 34 cities.

Gujarat-based Torrent Gas Pvt Ltd bid for 31 cities while Gujarat Gas Ltd put in offers for 21 areas.

Petronet LNG Ltd, India's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, sought to foray into CGD business by bidding for the licence in seven cities. Indraprastha Gas Ltd, which retails CNG in the national capital region, put in bids for 11 cities.

According to PNGRB, a total of 400 bids were received for the 86 permits on offer.

As many as eight cities received single bids. Only Indian Oil Corp bid for Aurangabad in Bihar and Rewa in Madhya Pradesh.

Similarly, only Adani Gas offered for Balasore in Odisha; GAIL Gas for Gangan in Odisha; Bharat Gas Resources Ltd's for Bidar in Karnataka and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh; IOC-Adani combine's for Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat Gas' bid for Narmada in Gujarat.

The highest number of 15 bids were received for Srikakulam-Visakhapatnam-Vizianagarm districts.

Bidding for the biggest CGD licensing round closed on July 10. 174 districts in 22 states and union territories were clubbed into 86 permits in the bid round.

Essel Infraprojects Ltd has put in a total of seven bids.

Other bidders included Mahanagar Gas Ltd, H-Energy, Unison ENviro Pvt Ltd, IMC Ltd Assam Gas, Think Gas Investments Pte Ltd, AG&P LNG Marketing Pte Ltd, IRM Energy Pvt Ltd and Enertech Fuel Solutions Pvt Ltd.

PNGRB had on July 10 stated that while it had earlier said that bids would be finalised by October, it would try to expedite the process.

""Once awarded, it is envisaged that this initiative would help in creating a robust infrastructure by bringing investment of about Rs 70,000 crore, generate employment and play a significant role in achieving the shift towards a gas-based economy, with natural gas as the next-generation, cheaper and environment friendly fossil fuel,"" it had said.

The GAs cover 24 per cent of the country's area and 29 per cent of its population.

The government is targeting to raise the share of natural gas in primary energy basket to 15 per cent, from 6.2 per cent at present, within a few years.

The bid round is also aimed at meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of giving piped cooking gas connection to 1 crore households, roughly triple the current size, by 2020.

Prior to the 9th round, 91 GAs were awarded to firms like Indraprastha Gas Ltd and GAIL Gas Ltd, which are serving 240 million population, 42 lakh domestic consumers and 31 lakh CNG vehicles.

Of these, 56 GAs were awarded through bidding rounds and the rest on government nomination.

The 9th bid round was being held on changed parameters after one paisa bids spoilt the initial auction rounds.

Bidders have been asked to quote the number of CNG stations to be set up and the number of domestic cooking gas connections to be given in the first eight years of operation.

In the previous eight rounds, bidders were asked to quote only the tariff for the pipeline that carries gas within the city limits. The bidding criteria did not include the rate at which an entity would sell CNG to automobiles or piped natural gas to households using the same pipeline network, leading to companies offering one paisa as the tariff to win licenses.

In the new guidelines, maximum weightage of 50 per cent has been given to the number of piped gas connections proposed in eight years from the date of authorisation, as compared to 30 per cent earlier.

The number of CNG dispensing stations proposed to be set up has been assigned 20 per cent weightage. Length of the pipeline to be laid in the GA and the tariff proposed for city gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has been assigned 10 per cent weightage each.

Also, a floor tariff of Rs 30 for city gas and Rs 2 per kg for CNG has been put in order to deter bidders from quoting unviable tariff of 1 paisa per unit."

43,2018-07-22,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State oil firms have spent about Rs 18,000 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal, nearly a fifth of their planned annual capex, on exploration and production and expanding their refining, transport and marketing infrastructure.

Indian Oil Corp, the nation’s largest refiner and fossil fuel retailer, spent Rs 5,852 crore in the April-June quarter, the maximum among state oil firms. This is about a quarter of the company’s planned annual capex. Bharat petroleum finished about 28% of its annual capital outlay of Rs 7,400 crore in three months.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp, the country’s largest oil and gas producer, invested Rs 5,821 crore in its upstream activities, about 18% of its 2018-19 spending target. Overseas arm ONGC Videsh used up Rs 1,073 crore during the quarter against an annual target of Rs 5,886 crore.

Hindustan Petroleum spent less than 14% of its annual target of Rs 8,425 crore. GAIL, which is currently building the country’s largest natural gas pipeline, spent about 18% of its annual capex target while Oil India exhausted 16% of its annual capital outlay.


Indian oil firms are investing heavily in exploration and production, and expanding refining, marketing and distribution facilities to cater to the rapidly rising oil consumption in the country.

Consumption of petroleum products grew 5.1% in the April-June period, with petrol, diesel and cooking gas driving sales. The country, a net exporter of refined products, has been speedily adding refining capacity to cater to the expanding domestic demand as well as to retain its share in the export market. India’s refining capacity is planned to rise to 439 million tonnes per annum by 2030 from the current 248 million tonnes with state and private firms planning massive expansion.

Similarly, the need to cater to the fast expanding domestic consumer base has prompted oil companies to plan new pipelines, storage, and dispensing facilities. An increasing government focus on turning India into a natural gas-based economy has also pushed up the local consumption of the fuel. To facilitate greater import of natural gas, several terminals for the import of liquefied natural gas are being set up and pipelines being laid.

The process of awarding 86 city gas distribution licenses is also underway, which is expected to almost double the piped gas access to urban homes."
45,2018-07-24,GAIL,"In its continued bid to boost industrialisation in Uttar Pradesh, the Adityanath government will be holding a mega ground-breaking ceremony for launch of several projects worth Rs 60,000 crore here on July 29 in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and 80 prominent industrialists.

Close on the heels of 'Investors Summit' in February this year, the ground breaking ceremony for the mega projects with the potentials of creating over two lakh new jobs would be held at the Indira Gandhi Prathisthan in the state capital, UP Minister for Industries Satish Mahana said.

Around 80 leading industrialists, including those of large groups like Reliance, Mahindra and Adanis, are expected to attend the event, Mahana said.

Ramdev, whose Patanjali group will establish a food park in the state, might also attend the event besides the representatives of Paytm, Gail, HPCL, TCS, ACC cement, Metro Cash and Carry, PTC Industries, Goldie Masala, DCM and Sriram groups, a senior official said.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who led the state in holding the successful investors summit earlier this year, held a meeting to review preparations and issued instructions to all those concerned to make preparations for the function.

The Prime Minister, who will be in the state for the fifth time this month, is also scheduled to attend the concluding day session of another Smart City conference being organised here on July 27 and 28.

The projects to be inaugurated by the Prime Minister during the Smart City conference include 57 projects under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, 26 projects under Smart City scheme and 11 projects under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban).

The state capital, meanwhile, is being spruced up for the mega event with the city being given a new and clean look.

The arrangements are also being made to telecast the event live across the state and all the districts magistrates have been asked to review the preparations in their respective districts.

The opposition parties, however, have chosen the opportunity to mock at the Prime Minister's frequent visits to Uttar Pradesh dubbing it as an indication of ""the BJP's nervousness"" before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said that PM has come to realise the anger among the people and it is evident by the frequency of his visits to the state and his speeches.

RLD spokesman Anil Dubey said the BJP knew how it has befooled people through its ""jhoote vade"" (false promises) and feared that Uttar Pradesh, which played an important role in its victory last time, might go against it.

Accordingly, the BJP has has resorted to more lies through such events, he added."

46,2018-07-24,GAIL,"State-run GAIL will not be split but will have to hive off its transportation business into a subsidiary to reduce the conflict of interest that arises with the same entity housing both the functions of marketing and transport of natural gas, according to people familiar with the plans of the oil ministry.

The ministry and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board have considered the idea of splitting GAIL for some time now, hoping to ‘unbundle’ marketing and transportation of natural gas in the country, a necessary condition for the development of a competitive gas market.

But strong resistance from GAIL, which owns most of the gas pipelines in the country, appears to have dissuaded the ministry from breaking up the company, the persons cited earlier told ET.

The government appears to have bought GAIL’s argument of local gas market not being mature enough to prompt breaking of the firm, they said. Besides, the government isn’t willing to divert the company’s top management’s attention from laying a critical gas pipeline connecting the electorally-important eastern states and taking piped gas to several politically important cities on the pipeline’s route, they said.

Now, the understanding between the government and GAIL is that the company will set up a subsidiary to house pipelines, and make its dealings with rival gas marketers more transparent by setting up a web portal to provide them with real-time data on availability of pipeline capacity, they said.

It has been alleged that GAIL’s dominance in the pipeline business puts other gas suppliers as well as customers at a disadvantage. Planning to enhance their presence in the expanding local gas market, private and foreign companies have been pushing for the unbundling of marketing and transportation functions in the country.

Unbundling and the government’s plan to set up a gas trading platform by the end of this year are seen as key steps towards developing India’s gas market. But without open access to pipelines and liquefied natural gas import terminals, the trading platform may not be fully effective in a country that imports about half of the natural gas it consumes.

Last month, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had hinted at dropping the plan to split GAIL when he said his job was not to create more companies but to create more accessibility through policy.

GAIL has also often reasoned that all its pipelines were self-funded and, therefore, other gas marketers should have only limited access to these assets."
48,2018-07-25,GAIL,"BENGALURU: Unhappy over the shoddy road restoration done by government and private agencies, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has now decided to repair the roads on its own.

A decision to this effect was taken at a recently-held coordination committee meeting of various Bengaluru-related departments chaired by the chief secretary. The BBMP, which has often batted for taking up restoration on its own instead of passing the responsibility to private and government agencies that dig the roads, has this time remained firm on its decision. The agencies will have to pay a specified restoration fee to the BBMP while seeking permission to cut the road for laying cables and pipelines.

Agencies such as the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), Bescom and GAIL and telecom service providers have been digging roads and restoring them after completing their work. Blame for any delay in restoration or shoddy work falls squarely on the BBMP, its officials said.

“Though other government and private agencies lack technology and resources to restore the roads, the agencies were keen on the work as it saved them from paying the restoration fee to the BBMP. Attempts to wrest the responsibility were futile as the agencies would bring pressure from various quarters,” an engineer told ET. BBMP officials said restoration in most cases is not according to specifications. “To cut the cost, they end up doing a shoddy job. But ultimately the BBMP is held responsible.”

The BBMP has even planned to launch a separate fund for restoration.

“Since the BBMP is the custodian of Bengaluru’s roads, it makes absolute sense for us to do restoration. We have observed that the enthusiasm that these agencies show while taking up the work is lost by the time they finish the repair,” BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said.

BWSSB Engineer-in-Chief Kemaparamaiah welcomed the decision and said that his agency too prefers to deposit money with the BBMP than restore the roads by itself. “The BBMP has better technology and skill for roadrestoration,” he said.

However, the challenge before the BBMP, which has a reputation for laying poor quality roads, is to do a quality job. “So far, the civic body could blame other agencies for bad restoration. That cannot happen in future,” a BBMP engineer admitted."

54,2018-07-27,GAIL,"Tagging Uttar Pradesh as a priority growth state, Walmart India said it expects to create at least 30,000 local jobs by setting up 15 stores in the state. Walmart India, which already runs four Cash and Carry stores in UP, recently launched a fulfilment centre (FC) in Lucknow, which created 1,500 new skilled jobs. 

 In the UP Investment Summit held earlier this year, Walmart India had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state government to open 15 wholesale Cash and Carry stores. 

 ""Each store is likely to create 2,000 direct and indirect jobs, thereby generating at least 30,000 local jobs in the state,"" Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Rajneesh Kumar who represented Walmart India in the Investment Summit, told from Mumbai. 

 Walmart India will attend the ground breaking ceremony in Lucknow on Sunday where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will take stock of the progress in implementation of the MoUs signed during the UP Investment Summit. 

 The mega ground breaking event is billed to see launch of various projects worth Rs 60,000 crore by large companies like Walmart, Reliance, Adani, Mahindra, PayTm, TCS and GAIL. 

 When PM Modi will lay one brick here in Lucknow, ground-breaking for the projects would be done digitally in the districts concerned, said UP Minister for Industries Satish Mahana. 

 Kumar, who will be present at the ground breaking ceremony on Sunday, said, ""UP is a priority growth state for us. Walmart is making deep investment in agriculture supply chain, enhancing small farmers capabilities and sourcing from them for its stores in UP and other states."" 

 Through our Cash and Carry stores and FC in Lucknow, we are not only creating new jobs, but supporting and enabling small kiranas, farmers and local SME suppliers to succeed, he said. 

 ""We are delighted to bring best practices in retail to our kiranas, best practices in farming and food safety to our farmers and SME suppliers,"" he added. 

 We are confident of making a difference to the lives of lakhs of farmers, kiranas and local suppliers as we grow our business in line with government vision of bringing inclusive prosperity, Kumar said. 

 In addition to existing stores and FCs at Lucknow, Agra and Meerut, the company is bringing its wholesale Cash and Carry stores to Varanasi, Kanpur, Allahabad, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Gorakhpur and other cities. 

 Kumar said these stores can also become a great platform for saree weavers in Varanasi and many such artisans who struggle for market access. 

 ""The company can help create an ecosystem for these artisans just like it has been able to do with small farmers and other small suppliers in UP and other states,"" he pointed out. 

 Walmart recently acquired 77 per cent stake in Flipkart. In future, it is highly likely that it will leverage Flipkart to give wider visibility of such artisan/weaver clusters. 

 This will not only improve lives if these neglected groups, but also provide visibility to their products to millions of consumers directly, Kumar said.

50,2018-07-27,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-run refiner Indian Oil Corp has opposed natural gas firm GAIL’s pitch for a unified tariff for its pipelines, saying such a move would raise input cost for its three refineries by Rs 1,000 crore and only help operators of old liquefied natural gas terminals and pipelines.

Indian Oil, BP and Shell have also demanded separation of GAIL’s natural gas transportation and marketing business before shifting to a unified tariff.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) is debating moving to a unified method for computing gas transmission tariffs that would end the current distance-based tariff.

The proposed unified tariff, aimed at increasing the penetration of gas to far flung areas, would raise tariff for customers closer to the source of gas and lower the cost for far-off customers. The downstream regulator had called an open house on the matter on July 17 in which several gas suppliers and consumers submitted their views.

GAIL has argued that unified tariff will help develop local gas market as it will encourage those located in distant locations to consume gas, according to the minutes of the open house made available by PNGRB. This would also help in raising utilisation of GAIL’s pipelines and expanding infrastructure.

Indian Oil Corp has opposed the move, saying this would raise input costs, resulting in extra outgo of about Rs 1,000 crore for its three refineries at Koyali, Mathura and Panipat. Shell and BP, two international oil majors with operations in India, supported the idea of unified tariff, saying it will help develop the market and raise share of gas in India’s energy basket. They, however, prescribed a few preconditions for this.

“BP supported unified tariff for all cross country interconnected pipelines of all entities and not of a single entity otherwise it would create distortion in transition from entity wise unified tariff,” according to the minutes.

BP said it should be done “after unbundling of transmission and marketing functions of an entity”. Among prerequisites Shell demanded for unified tariff implementation are “independent system operator, uniform code of conduct, and online booking of capacity to ensure transparent allocation of capacity”."
52,2018-07-27,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Bulls held the upper hand at the July expiry, evidenced by traders rolling over their bullish bets to the August derivatives series. Rollovers of Nifty stood at 74 per cent, higher than the three-month average of 66.3per cent and Bank Nifty rolls were 78 per cent against the three-month average of 76.5. Market-wide rollovers stood at 90per cent (highest in FY19) versus 84per cent in the previous month.

“Rollovers for Nifty and Bank Nifty were higher in terms of percentage and total open interest (number of open positions) vis-à-vis last month as well as the average of the last three months, indicating a buildup of long positions in both indices,”according to brokerage IIFL.

Further proof of higher bullish bets being transferred was the trader’s cost to switch to August from July futures in both Nifty and Bank Nifty.

The cost to roll Nifty futures to August was 30 basis points (0.3 per cent), way above the three month average of negative 12 bps.


At 90 per cent, Rollovers Highest So Far in FY19
Similarly, cost to roll over Bank Nifty futures stood at 11 bps against the three month average of minus 38 bps.

“The rolls themselves and the roll cost clearly show long aggression,” said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

In Nifty 50 higher rolls were seen in Bharti Airtel, HDFC, Maruti, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank, Dr Reddy’s Lab while low rolls were witnessed in BPCL, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Bank, Cipla, Coal, GAIL, ONGC and Grasim. Market wide, higher rolls were witnessed in UBL, Syndicate Bank, Orient Bank, Wockhardt, MGL, IDBI, KPIT and Hexaware According to IIFL, Nifty ended the July series on record highs backed by across the board buying in the large-cap stocks. 

NSE’s benchmark index outperformed the Nifty Bank index by nearly 1.5 per cent on an expiry to expiry basis for the second series in a row, with both indices posting 5.5 per cent/4.1 per cent gains. Long delta positions in the index options were the flavour of the series.

“The trend of placing contra bets continued in the July series with FIIs pulling out around Rs 3,850 crore and DIIs pumping in around Rs 3,700 crore into Indian equities. This is the lowest figure since March 2018. FIIs changed their stance on the index as their speculative index future long/short ratio remained above 1x levels throughout the series, favouring the bulls,” said IIFL in its note."

Nifty has closed at a record high. We are almost in an uncharted territory. Is there more room for bulls to move?
Absolutely and this is coming at a time when there has been a lot of confusion and misses by a lot of traders because most of the focus was on midcaps. All of a sudden there was capitulation and carnage in the midcaps while the largecaps kept standing tall. Over the last one week and especially this week, a lot of midcaps bounced back. When you see rise of 15%-20% in individual stocks and even sectors, that means a trend reversal is in process. 

This implies that the bull trend is continuing and that comes at a time when the world market and especially the emerging markets are still in a wobbly zone. This trend for our market should continue on the back of some strength in individual sectors, especially Bank Nifty.


What is your view on Hindalco? There was a steady decline in Hindalco stock and prices came down to a one-year level under Rs 200. Subsequently, there was a very smart bounce back?
Last week played out pretty well for the stock price. There was a good bounce back and more intriguing was the volume patterns in the last six -seven days. When the fall got into the final stages in terms of short-term trading, there was a sudden pick up in terms of volumes. Then there was a sharp, almost a V-shape reversal in prices. 

Whenever you see such patterns in a short-term time-frame, you can probably bring in a case of a short-term bottom in place. The stock could gradually get into a mean reversion process. What is worrying for the prices of many metal stocks is the weekly breakdown because many of these stocks have shown clear signs of weekly chart patterns breakdown.

In order to reverse those kind of weekly breakdowns, you need to have a more powerful move. This is a very short-term signal for Hindalco. You might see the stocks coming back to Rs 230-225 range but on weekly charts, there is a lot of resistance that the stock has to clear to come back in the full swing it had at the end of 2017.


Give a few technical recommendations which could be profitable?
A couple of them look very attractive. One is Gas Authority of India (GAIL). Price patterns in the last three-four weeks show that it is going to a steady sort of an uptrend. Last week, it closed almost at its weekly highs and the price patterns are now suggesting that the stock should continue to ride higher. From a positional play, in may be one or two weeks, you could look at even Rs 400 as a possible target on GAIL. I am suggesting a buy with a stop loss at Rs 365. 

The second would be PFC. Both PFC and REC have managed to come back quite strongly last week but if you look at the price patterns, there seems to be a bigger reversal happening in these names. They are coming back after multi-weeks of downtrend. Any sort of reversals last for a longer duration and that is what I am anticipating could happen for PFC. I suggest a buy with Rs 92 as a target and stop loss at Rs 80."

The Nifty is expected to trade in the range of 11,100 to 11,500 for August series with a positive bias. It implies that the market will retain a positive trend, according to technical analysts. UBL, Petronet LNG, LIC Housing Finance, IGL & PTC can be bought for an upside potential of 15-20% in next few months, they said.


Where are we?
The Nifty is broadly driven by large-cap stocks wherein major participants have been IT, financial services, energy and FMCG stocks. In recent up-move, the leading mid-cap stocks are also performing well and joining the party.


What is in store?
Nifty is going from strength to strength and now having broad based participation from largecap and mid-cap stocks. As long as Nifty sustains above 10,920 level, it can be considered to be in the positive zone and an upside potential can be up to 10,500 to 10,600 level in the coming days. Majority of the sectors like private banks, energy, FMCG are having positive breakout; whereas auto and metal sectors stand at support levels. Mild sense of reversal has been observed on PSU banks and pharma sectors.


What could investors do?
Investors can continue to retain positive bias towards market and new entrants can take baby steps with small exposure and expand their portfolio in intermediate decline. Some sweet spots in the market seem to be GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and Marico and contra view can be adopted in Glenmark."
61,2018-07-31,GAIL,"The finance ministry is likely to rework the constituents of the CPSE Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) by either including new state-run companies or trimming the government holding threshold for existing ones to 52 per cent.

The CPSE ETF comprises 10 state-owned bluechips and shares in these companies can be sold only till the government stake in them reaches 55 per cent.

""Since most of the CPSEs in the basket have reached or are about to reach the threshold limit of 55 per cent, there is a need to rebalance the constituents of CPSE ETF,"" an official told PTI.

The ministry is in the process of appointing advisors for coming out with the 4th tranche of the CPSE ETF. ICICI Securities and SMC Capitals have bid for becoming the adviser for the Exchange Traded Fund.

The official said the adviser will draw up plan on whether new Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) should be included in the ETF basket or threshold limit for existing CPSEs be brought down to 52 per cent.

On lowering the threshold, the official said however that if this option is exercised, it would leave little headroom for these CPSEs to go in for further stake sales or buy back offers.

A final call would be taken by the inter-ministerial panel, chaired by the Union Finance Minister.

CPSE ETF, which functions like a mutual fund scheme, comprises scrips of 10 PSUs ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.

14,2018-08-05,GAIL,"MUMBAI: The steep 70 per cent spike in global liquefied natural gas (LNG) price is unlikely to curb domestic demand, but may crimp the margin of city gas distribution (CGD) companies to some extent as volume growth will support marketing margins, according to a report.

Over the past five to six months, LNG prices in Asia have increased by over 70 per cent, driven by rising Chinese imports. The spurt was also due to plant shutdowns and healthy demand from Japan, Korea, India and Pakistan, Crisil said in a weekend note.

""But with crude prices breaching USD 75 a barrel, traders see an opportunity to price LNG in lockstep with crude. Earlier, there wasn't much correlation between crude and spot LNG prices,"" the report said.

It also noted that over the rest of this fiscal year, too, prices are expected to hold at USD 8-8.5/mmBtu for non- peak months and reach USD 10-10.5/mmBtu during the peak season even as supply is restored from plant turnarounds and incremental liquefaction capacity of 25 million tonne coming on stream.

Last fiscal, after stabilising at USD 8-8.5/mmBtu during the lean months (between May-June and September- October), Asian spot LNG prices peaked at USD 10-10.50/mmBtu, said Crisil.

""The Supreme Court banning polluting fuels like fuel oil and petcoke for industrial use in some northern states has been favourable for LNG demand.

""The Gujarat High Court has also tightened norms on use of coal gassifiers by ceramic companies in Morbi and Wankaner. These moves resulted in a 20 per cent growth in imports in the first half of FY18,"" it said.

What enhances the attractiveness of LNG as an industrial fuel is its improved competitiveness compared with alternatives like fuel oil and LPG. The regulatory push to expand CGD networks is also stoking demand.

Though in the past, higher prices dented LNG demand in the country, things are different now with consumption rising 6-7 per cent to 20 million tonne in FY18.

At an average crude price of USD 75 a barrel, the landed cost of the fuel oil and LPG is expected to be USD 14.3/mmBtu and USD 19.2/mmBtu, respectively. In comparison, with LNG ruling at USD 9.5/mmBtu, industrial piped natural gas is expected to rule at USD 14.8/mmBtu, the report said.

Crisil expects LNG demand in the medium term to be supported by development of gas infrastructure in eastern region which is largely untapped.

Government focus on increasing the share of gas in the overall energy mix and the development of LNG terminals and pipelines, bode well for demand over the medium to long-term, it added.

""But this will have a bearing on the margins of CGD companies,"" warns the report, as ""higher LNG prices, coupled with upward revision in domestic gas prices, are expected to impact the operating margins.""

""Their cost is expected to increase 25-30 per cent this fiscal, impacting their operating margins by 400 bps. But absolute marketing margins are expected to be supported on healthy volume growth,"" it said.

It can be noted that despite the price spiral, the recently concluded CGD auctions have seen good demand from domestic companies, wherein the Adani group has emerged the biggest winner bagging 11 city licences, followed by Bharat Gas Resources, a unit of Bharat Petroleum, winning licences for six cities; IOC four and Gail Gas three cities."
13,2018-08-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Renewed trade tensions between the US and China and a 25 bps rate hike by the RBI failed to dampen the bulls' spirits, who showed who was in-charge in the week gone by. 

On a weekly basis, BSE benchmark Sensex gained 0.58 per cent to end at 37,556 while NSE's Nifty added 0.73 per cent at 11,361.

""The gradual tightening by the RBI with a focus on maintaining balance between inflation and growth is a welcome sign. Moderation in crude price on the expectation of oversupply and better quarterly results is expected to extend the current positive momentum,"" said Vinod Nair, Head Of Research at Geojit Financial Services. ""Largecaps and consumption-related sectors which offer safety net for investors are likely to do well."" 

So, what's in store next week? Here's a look at major events that will shape the market in the week ahead. 


Next set of Q1 results: The coming week will see some of the leading names of D-Street unveiling their June quarterly numbers. Among big names, Adani Ports is lined up on August 6 while Mahindra & Mahindra will come out with its report card on August 7. Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Cipla, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Lupin and Siemens are all due to report their earnings on August 8. Aurobindo Pharma and Eicher Motors will keep their date with earnings on August 9. For GAIL (India), Hindalco Industries and State Bank of India, it's August 10.


India to impose import tariffs on US goods: According to a Reuters report, India will impose delayed tariffs on some US goods in September. Trade differences between India and the United States have been on the rise since US President Donald Trump took office. Bilateral trade rose to $115 billion in 2016, but the Trump administration is keen to bring down its $31 billion deficit with India and is pressing New Delhi to ease trade barriers, the report said. 


Sino-US trade war: Tit-for-tat tariff sanctions between the two largest economies -- the US and China -- on the trade front is likely to keep investors on edge. The Trump administration tightened pressure for trade concessions from Beijing this week by proposing a higher 25 per cent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Striking back, China on Friday unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft. 


US jobs data: US job growth slowed more than expected in July as employment in the transportation and utilities sectors fell, but a drop in the unemployment rate suggested that labour market conditions continued to tighten, Reuters reported. Non-farm payrolls increased by 1,57,000 jobs last month, still more than the roughly 1,20,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population, the report added. 


Monsoon progress: Monsoon rains will be normal in August and September, the India Meteorological Department said on Friday. ""The rainfall during August-2018 is likely to be 96 per cent plus/minus 9 per cent of LPA (Long Period Average) and expected to be higher than predicted in June,"" it said. However, Skymet has downgraded its forecast for this year's monsoon, stating that the country might receive below normal rainfall, citing the continuing warming of the sea surface in the Pacific Ocean.


HDFC AMC IPO listing: Shares of HDFC AMC will list on the bourses on Monday. The IPO, which ran on July 25-27, was a big hit with 83 times subscription. Experts believe that the stock will see strong listing gains. HDFC AMC is India’s most profitable fund house and made a profit of Rs 722 crore for the year ended March 2018 and ranks No. 2 by assets under management (AUM) in the local mutual fund industry.


What does the tech chart say?
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a large bullish candle, just a day after it made a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the daily chart, suggesting that the bulls were not ready to give up easily. “The uptrend shall remain intact as long as the Nifty50 stays above the 11,230 level, which can be regarded as a stop loss for all long positions. It looks prudent for traders to book some profits as we head towards the said resistance zone,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

This apart, trend in global markets, investment by foreign and domestic investors, the movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price movement are other factors that may have a bearing on investors' thinking in the coming week."

The Nifty50 index opened in the negative and corrected towards the 11,340 level in Monday’s session. However, it failed to fill its opening gap during the session and witnessed selling pressure on a bounceback move near the 11,400 level.

The index formed a bearish candle, but traded near its rising support trend line by connecting all the recent swing lows of 10,557, 10,630, 10,946 and 11,340 levels.

48,2018-08-13,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the nation's largest oil company, plans to invest Rs 20,000 crore in city gas distribution projects in next 5-8 years as it bets big on gas business to complement its traditional oil refining and marketing business, its chairman Sanjiv Singh said today.

The firm, which owns a third of India's oil refining capacity and has 44 per cent market share of fuel business, sees compressed natural gas (CNG) replacing a some of the petrol and diesel consumed in vehicles today and LPG getting replaced by piped cooking gas in households. It wants to be in these businesses to maintain its market leadership position.

IOC, which among all PSUs bid most aggressively in the latest city gas distribution (CGD) licences, is hoping to net licences to retail CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to households and industries in about 20 cities, he told reporters here.

These will be in addition to nearly 10 licences it already has.

""We put in bids for 57 out of the 86 Geographical Areas (or cities) put on offer in the 9th CGD bid round. Out of this, we expect to net 20 GAs, plus or minus one or two,"" he said.

Singh said the investment in these 20 GAs would be at least Rs 20,000 crore spread over five to eight years.

These numbers include investments in setting up of CNG dispensing stations as well as laying pipelines in cities to transport gas to households for cooking purposes and industries for commercial use.

IOC, which has 80.7 million tonnes per annum of refining capacity (33 per cent of the total in India), is looking to commission a 5 million tonnes a year liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Ennore in Tamil Nadu before the year-end and has booked capacity on similar planned terminals on both east and west coast.

""We see piped natural gas (PNG) replacing LPG and CNG finding a way into vehicles on a bigger scale in near future and we want to be there,"" he said adding the LPG can be an excellent feedstock for manufacturing petrochemicals.

The shift towards natural gas is also driven by environmental consideration as it is much cleaner than petrol and diesel.

IOC currently operates city gas distribution (CGD) networks in Agra and Lucknow through Green Gas Ltd, its joint venture with GAIL (India) Ltd. It is also implementing CGD projects in Chandigarh, Allahabad, Panipat, Ernakulam, Daman, Udhamsingh Nagar and Dharwad through a joint venture with Adani Gas Ltd (IndianOil-Adani Gas Pvt Ltd).

In the 9th CGD bid round, IOC has out of the 78 GAs, results for which have been declared, won IOC has won rights to seven, including Coimbatore and Salem in Tamil Nadu and Guna in Madhya Pradesh, on its own and another nine, including Allahabad, in joint venture with Adani Gas Ltd.

54,2018-08-14,GAIL,"CLSA has a buy call on GAIL (India) with a target price of Rs 435.

The current market price of GAIL (India) is Rs 378.25.

Time period given by the asset management firm is one year when GAIL (India) price can reach the defined target. 


CLSA's view on the company:US LNG drives sharply higher gas trading profits and lower opex; BUY Gail’s 1QFY19 net profit was 23 per cent higher at Rs12.6bn. This beat was primarily driven by benefits from rising volume of attractively-priced US LNG cargoes in the form of notably higher gas trading profit and lower petchem opex. Mgmt guides to these benefits continuing. Gail also expects volumes to improve in petchem as well as LPG transmission after one-off factors impacted 1Q. We raise EPS by 4 per cent and TP to Rs435 (Rs405); BUY. Inclusion of gas in GST, tariff hike for DUPL, curb on petcoke use and more city gas wins are triggers in 2H.


A 23 per cent beat on net profit; Ebitda/Ebit stood 19/23 per cent higher as well: At Rs12.6bn (+23 per cent YoY/QoQ), Gail’s standalone 1QFY19 net profit was a notable 23 per cent ahead of our estimate. Ebitda (Rs25.3bn, +27 per cent YoY/+22 per cent QoQ) stood 19 per cent ahead and Ebit was 23 per cent more than our estimate. Higher other income was offset by higher depreciation and larger-than-anticipated tax rate.


All segments outperform other than gas transmission: Nearly two-third of Ebit surprise was driven by a massive 95 per cent beat on gas trading Ebit due to 9 per cent higher volumes and a 216 per cent YoY jump in unit trading margin to a 10-quarter high of Rs624/scm mainly due to rising share of US and Russian LNG volumes. One-fourth of Ebit surprise came from 112 per cent beat in petchem Ebit, which rose 5.7x QoQ. This beat was completely due to a surprise US$53/tonne QoQ decline in petchem opex even as price for RasGas LNG rose QoQ. Management explained that this was due to high share of cheaper Russian and US LNG volumes in the input mix. Petchem realisation was slightly lower, while volume was 10 per cent lesser as one-off factors impacted 1Q production. LPG production Ebit was 5 per cent higher, as lower volumes were more than offset by slightly better realisation and notably lower opex. Gas transmission Ebitda missed by 1 per cent but Ebit was 4 per cent below as some recent capitalisation drove up segment depreciation. Gas transmission volume was in-line at 107mmscmd. Lower LPG transmission volumes (-8 per cent QoQ) due to shutdown of a customer facility was more than offset by higher blended tariffs and segment Ebit was 3 per cent ahead.


Raise EPS by 4 per cent and target to Rs435/share; reiterate BUY: In its post-results conference call, Gail’s management highlighted that gains due to US LNG volumes in the form of higher gas trading profits and lower input costs for petchem are sustainable. This arbitrage of ~US$1.5/mmbtu for US LNG over spot Asian LNG could clearly be a tailwind for Gail (link). Management also highlighted that petchem capacity utilisation is now at 90 per cent and this should bring further opex efficiency. Building these benefits, we raise EPS by 4 per cent and target to Rs435. Reiterate BUY. We expect gas in GST within six months, which could add c.Rs35 to fair value/Rs3.5 to EPS. A tariff hike for DUPL pipeline, more wins in ongoing city gas bidding round by Gail or its subsidiaries/JVs and potential actions to curb use of petcoke are other possible 2H18 triggers."

India will test a plan to operate its underutilized natural gas-fired power generators as “peaker” plants that can switch on quickly when there’s high demand, according to the country’s power planning body.

The project will start with four NTPC Ltd. plants with a combined capacity of 2.3 gigawatts that will run only in the evenings, Central Electricity Authority Chairman Pankaj Batra said in New Delhi. The agency envisions 20 gigawatts of gas-fired capacity being used as peaking stations to even out supply fluctuations from the large amount of renewable energy that’s set be built by 2022, he said.

“The government will start testing the plan this month by operating one of NTPC’s gas-based power plants as a peaking station” for nearly four hours in the evening, Batra said in an interview last week, adding that the three other plants will be online by the end of the year. State-owned GAIL India Ltd. has agreed to supply gas to the four plants, he said.

India has an ambitious goal of installing 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022, or a little more than the country’s current peak demand, as part of its Paris climate pledge to cut carbon emissions. Gas-fired power plants can play a role balancing the grid by maintaining uninterrupted electricity supply, especially when solar-fired generation peters out in the evenings and coal plants take time to ramp up.

The gas facilities will be run on fuel produced in India, which is in short supply, and running them as peakers will optimize use of the fuel, Batra said. A shortage of domestic gas has kept the utilization of India’s 25 gigawatts of gas-fired plants at about a fifth of total capacity, according to CEA data. The cost of gas imports for India makes the fuel uncompetitive with other sources of baseload power."

The nation's biggest natural gas transporting and marketing company wants to insert six new sections in the main objects clause of the memorandum of association of the company, according to shareholder notice.

It wants to invest in ""start-ups in core business areas (of natural gas, petrochemicals, and energy) and non-core areas (like health, social and environment, safety, and security) either directly or indirectly.""

""The investment can be made through special purpose vehicle (SPV), alternative investment fund (AIF), fund of funds (FoF) and trust,"" it said.

GAIL said that there is a necessity to adopt new and different pathways to provide clean, cost-effective and efficient mobility services that are safe, reduce dependence on oil imports and achieve more efficient land-use in cities with the least environmental footprints and impacts on human health.

With the objective in mind, the firm wants to set up ""battery charging stations and providing charging services"" to electric vehicles.

With the government planning to make a major shift to electric vehicles by 2030, GAIL felt that charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in India has not been fully developed yet.

GAIL with its ""pan-India presence through the natural gas network is deep-pocketed and has the capability of setting up charging infrastructure at a faster pace,"" the notice said.

The 34th annual general meeting of the company is scheduled for September 11.

The company also wants to ""explore the business opportunity in waste-water treatment plants, water distribution, large water pipeline laying as an early mover.""

With groundwater depleting and monsoons becoming less predictable and unreliable, availability and utilisation of water are becoming key issues in modern India. Many cities are sourcing the fresh water through long-distance transport ranging from 50-200 km.

Stating that with growing population and industrialisation the effluent water discharged has increased significantly, GAIL said the treatment of the effluent water and maintaining of the freshwater table is a big challenge and a business opportunity.

It is also looking to ""harness solar power potential available at its various sites and installations which can be connected to grid for sale or for own use at other installations through wheeling of power.""

In line with its strategy to promote the use of green fuel, it is contemplating to promote gas appliances in households to increase gas usage and minimise electric usage in housing equipment and appliances such as gas boiler, gas-based air conditioner and bathroom heater.

Operating nearly 14,000-km of natural gas and LPG pipeline and executing more than 4,500 km of new lines, GAIL feels it can provide services such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), engineering, procurement, construction management (EPCM) and project management consultancy (PMC) in the field of hydrocarbon pipelines.

""GAIL also has adequate experienced manpower and infrastructure for providing these services,"" the notice said.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices ended slightly better than Sensex on Friday, closing 0.88 per cent and 0.94 per cent up, respectively.

ITC, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, Hindustan Unilever and YES Bank emerged as the top five contributors to the rally in the Sensex. 

On the other hand, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, HDFC, ONGC and Coal India stood as the top five drag on the equity benchmark.

88,2018-08-19,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Friday witnessed a relatively stable session and the market remained buoyant despite being slightly over-extended on higher time frame charts. The Nifty opened higher and spent the entire session trading in a narrow 25-odd points range. Finally, the benchmark index ended the day gaining 85.70 points or 0.75 per cent.

As we approach the coming week, which again remains a truncated one, we expect a quiet start to the trade. Global environment is stable, and we expect the calm to remain in our domestic markets as well. We may also see a modestly positive start but at the same time, we need to exercise even more caution as we are dealing with over-extended and overbought market on the higher time frame charts at current time.

Monday is likely to see the levels of 11,495 and 11,550 posing resistance to the upmove. The supports will come in lower at 11,420 and 11,375 zones. The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Chart is 66.1925 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The Daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. On Candles, a small white body occurred. The smaller size of body usually indicates little intraday price action and depicts an indecisive intent of the market participants.


Agencies
Pattern analysis shows the market remains firmly in uptrend after confirming a breakout from its previous lifetime high of 11,170-11,175 zones. Presently, it is seen consolidating in a defined range while it gathers strength of another phase of an upmove.

Despite strong undercurrent, the Nifty is lightly overbought and over-extended on the higher time frame charts. This may lead us to either consolidate at current levels or may lead to sporadic and volatile profit taking bouts at higher levels in the immediate short term. Keeping this in mind, the analysis for Monday’s trade remain on similar lines. We continue to expect the market to remain vulnerable at higher levels with minor profit taking bouts. We, therefore, continue to recommend not to chase momentum blindly and remain stock specific in approach. While guarding profits at higher levels, cautious view on the market is advised for the day.


Stocks to watch:
Resilient behavior is expected from the stocks like GAIL, PNB, YES Bank, Reliance, Ashok Leyland, Axis Bank, Indian Hotels, IDBI Bank, NBCC, Tata Steel, NCC, Cadila and Granules India.

87,2018-08-19,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will not sell its stake in IOC and GAIL in the near future as it has used internal resources to repay close to a third of the Rs 24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

ONGC had in January received government approval to sell its 13.77 per cent stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and 4.86 per cent state in gas utility GAIL India Ltd to help fund the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of HPCL.

""IOC shares were trading at around Rs 195 in January and it is now at Rs 159 (Friday's closing). It doesn't make sense to sell the shares at such a big loss,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.

At Friday's closing price of Rs 159.60, ONGC's shareholding in IOC would get it Rs 21,343 crore as against Rs 26,200 crore worth in January. At Friday's closing price of Rs 387.25, ONGC's shareholding in GAIL is worth Rs 4,244 crore.

""We are generating enough resources internally thanks to a rebound in oil prices. We used these to bring down the borrowing for HPCL acquisition to Rs 20,000-21,000 crore in the first quarter and are repaying another Rs 3,000-4,000 crore in current quarter. Effectively, we have repaid Rs 7,800 crore,"" he said.

ONGC had borrowed Rs 24,881 crores on a short-term loan to fund buying the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL. The remaining came from its cash reserves.

The person said the pace of repayment may slow down in the third and fourth quarters owing to outgo on taxes and dividend as also the fact that capital spending would peak by then.

Initially, ONGC considered selling IOC and GAIL stake to fund the acquisition but it has never found the right price to offload the shares, he said.

The short-term loan it availed had a provision to pre-pay without any penalty.

Sources said ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price. So, ONGC has decided against the share sale.

ONGC's purchase of HPCL created India's first integrated oil company. This was ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout of 2017-18 after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 per cent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.

HPCL added 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries Ltd. ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15-million tonne refinery."

96,2018-08-20,GAIL,"It took seven months for NSE’s Nifty index to move from 11,000 to 11,500 level. This period remained highly volatile for the domestic equity market amid trade war tensions, sustained outflow of foreign portfolio money, rising crude oil prices and a depreciating local currency. 

After scaling the 11,000 mark for the first time on January 23, the index hit a low of 9,951 on March 23. However, buying in 22 index stocks took it above 11,500 on August 20.

Shares of Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have rallied 67 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, since January 23. Twenty other blue chips – HUL, TCS, M&M, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank and ITC – have rallied between 10 per cent and 30 per cent during this period. 

In terms of valuation, the index is looking expensive compared with its long-term moving average. The 50-share index traded at a P/E of over 28 times on Monday compared with its 10-year average of 20.90. 

Basant Maheshwari, Co-Founder & Partner Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers LLP in a tweet said, “Comparing the average Nifty P/E across stocks is like comparing the average salaries of a scientist, doctor, engineer and part-time gardeners & drivers – high quality secular growth and low quality cyclicals. Nifty has more scientists, doctors, engineers now, than it did 20 years back.”

Among other Nifty stocks, GAIL, YES Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, Eicher Motors, Titan, Cipla, Axis Bank, HCL Technologies and HDFC have gained up to 10 per cent since January 23. 

On the other hand, Tata Motors, Vedanta, HPCL, Bharti Airtel and UPL slipped up to 38 per cent between January 23 and August 17.

The BSE Sensex also hit a fresh record high of 38,266 in early trade on Monday. Gains in capital goods, metals, realty and banking stocks amid firm Asian cues aided the market. 

From a valuation perspective, analysts are not too comfortable with the current level of the market.

Even though the Sensex typically trades at a premium to its peers, it is currently trading at a higher-than-normal premium relative to its emerging market (EM) peers. For instance, from a five-year average perspective, India typically traded at a premium of 18 per cent to the median P/E of nine emerging markets. However, today India trades at a whopping 37 per cent premium to median P/E of EMS, Ambit Capital said in its recent report.

The 30-share index currently trades at a 21 per cent premium to its 10-year average P/E ratio, Ambit said.

The recent rally in the stock market has more support from domestic flows than FIIs. On a year-to-date basis, foreign portfolio investors have taken out some Rs 1300 crore, while domestic institutional investors have poured in more than Rs 68,300 crore.

“Many emerging markets, maybe not so much in India, are under severe distress. I’m talking about some very high-growth economies, like those in Eastern Europe. And we have economies like Poland, which are doing well. Yet, these stock markets relative to the US are at multi-decade lows. Liquidity in markets like the Philippines and Indonesia has completely dried up. India has been fortunate that it has had a domestic investor base, which has kept the market humming,” New York-based investor and author Ruchir Sharma told ET in an interview."

101,2018-08-22,GAIL,"India has sought re-negotiation of the natural gas price it is to source through a proposed USD 10 billion Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline in view of the slump in global energy markets, a top source said.

The four nations to the pipeline projects had in 2013 signed a gas sale purchase agreement (GSPA) that benchmarked the price of natural gas that Turkmenistan is to export at 55 per cent of the prevailing crude oil price. This translates into a price of about USD 7.5 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at current oil prices at the Turkmen border.

Added to this would be transit fee and transportation charges which would jack up the rates to over USD 10.5 per mmBtu at the Indian border, the source said.

For a consumer, the price would be around USD 13 per mmBtu after adding local taxes and transportation charges.

""This rate in the present global energy scenario is unacceptable. And so taking into cognizance of the current gas market, India has proposed for re-negotiation of GSPA,"" the source said.

The price of Turkmen gas is more than double of the USD 3.6 per mmBtu rate paid for post natural gas producers in India.

Leaders of the four countries performed the ground-breaking of the project in December 2015 but the project hasn't moved significantly since then.

The source said the project has not moved forward because of unresolved issues like the economic viability of the project, security of supply and tie-up of debt and equity.

The four nations have incorporated TAPI Pipeline Company Limited (TPCL) in Isle of Man to build, own, and operate the TAPI Pipeline. Turkmenistan's Turkmengas has been appointed as the consortium leader. State gas utility GAIL India Ltd represents India on the consortium.

TAPI pipeline is nearly 1,680-kilometers long, with 735-km in Afghanistan and nearly 800-km in Pakistan. The 56-inch diameter pipeline will run from Turkmenistan's Yoloten-Osman gas field to Herat and Kandahar province of Afghanistan, before entering Pakistan. In Pakistan, it will reach Multan via Quetta before ending at Fazilka (Punjab) in India.

Turkmenistan would export 90 million standard cubic meters per day of gas through TAPI, with Afghanistan getting 14 mmscmd and India and Pakistan 38 mmscmd each.

The gas will be sourced from the Yoloten Usman field, which ranks amongst the five biggest fields in the world. The field is being developed by Turkmenistan national oil firm TurkmenGas.

India had previously used its position as world's fastest-growing energy consumer to renegotiate gas import deals with Australia, Russia and Qatar.

Renegotiating terms of the 20-year deal to import 2.5 million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Gazprom saved the country between Rs 8,500 crore and Rs 9,500 crore over the contract period ending 2040.

108,2018-08-24,GAIL,"Guwahati: Assam-based Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) recorded highest-ever revenue from operations at Rs 15,923 crore in 2017-18, registering a growth of 14.17 per cent over the previous year.

In the 25th annual general meeting on Friday, the company announced a dividend of Rs 18.50 per share for the full fiscal. Profit after tax for the 2017-18 was marginally lower at Rs 2,042 crore.

According to the company the gross refining margin (GRM) at $11.43 per barrel continued to be one of the best in the industry. Earnings per share (EPS) for the year stood at Rs 27.79, while net worth of the company stood at Rs 4,968 crore as of March 2018.

NRL’s contribution to the central and state exchequers in the form of taxes, duties and dividends during the year 2017-18 was highest-ever at Rs 4,672 crore. The refinery processed 2,809 TMT (thousand metric tonnes) crude during 2017-18, achieving a capacity utilisation of 93 per cent.

“NRL recorded highest-ever sales volume of 2,912 TMT during the year, surpassing the previous high of 2,728 TMT in 2011-12. Motor spirit sales reached an all-time high of 638 TMT. Sale of high speed diesel was recorded at 1,841 TMT, while wax sales was at 46 TMT, including exports of 7 TMT to 24 countries. 

NRL’s share of the domestic wax market reached 45 per cent during FY18. On the exports front, gas oil (Diesel) totalling 25 TMT was exported to Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation at Parbatipur from the company’s Terminal at Siliguri.”

“Accelerated by the continued efforts and commitment of its employees and unwavering support of all stakeholders, I assure you that NRL will continue to perform par excellence and deliver results beyond expectation,” said Chairman D Rajkumar.

The company announced that plans for refinery expansion from 3 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) to 9 mtpa, a part of the ambitious 'Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for the North East’ is under active consideration by the central government.

NRL said that plans for implementing the first of its kind bio refinery with bamboo as feedstock have taken a definite shape with a Joint Venture (JV) company Assam Bio-Refinery with equity participation from NRL, Fortum 3BV, Netherland and Chempolis, Finland.

In another important development, Indradhanush Gas Grid was incorporated in the month of August with equal participation of NRL, IOC, ONGC, OIL, and GAIL for implementation of the Northeast Natural Gas Grid Pipeline. 

This project will connect all Northeastern states to the national gas grid through Barauni-Guwahati Gas pipeline being laid by GAIL."
109,2018-08-26,GAIL,"State gas utility GAIL India Ltd will tomorrow launch a new portal to allow anyone to hire its vast pipeline network for transporting natural gas as it makes last-ditch attempt to ward off breaking of the company, people in the know of the development said. 

 The oil ministry has been for last few months considering separating GAIL's gas transportation and marketing business to resolve the conflict of the same entity doing both the jobs. 

One of the reasons for this was some industry players alleging that GAIL was not giving them access to its 11,000-kilometer pipeline network to transport their gas. 

 Sources said while GAIL has maintained that it allows third-party access based on firm commitment, the company will tomorrow launch an online portal for common carrier capacity booking by marketing entities and consumers for transportation of natural gas through its pipelines. 

 The ministry had in January stated that it is considering to split GAIL into two - one for laying pipelines and the other for marketing and petrochemicals - to encourage more transparency between the two operations and resolve the conflict of interest in it being both the transporter and marketer of natural gas. 

 This is because it believed that all entities authorised to lay natural gas pipelines including GAIL have to ""provide mandatory open access of its gas pipeline infrastructure on common carrier principle at the non-discriminatory basis, at transportation rates determined by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB)"". 

 Citing a 2006 policy, it stated that in the long run with the maturity of gas markets, the authorised entities should have transportation of natural gas as their sole business activity and not have interest in gas marketing or city gas distribution network. 

 GAIL is the country's biggest gas marketing and trading firm and owns most of the country's pipeline network. 

 The ministry, however, seemed to have softened its stand on splitting GAIL since then. 

 In its comments on the issue to a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas, the ministry said that for unbundling ""market maturity is critical"". 

 It did not expand on market maturity. It is widely considered that the Indian gas market is far from mature. 

 At an Open House called by the sector regulator, PNGRB on July 17 to discuss unified traffic for pipelines, global energy majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP plc sought separation of natural gas marketing and transportation business. 

 While Shell sought ""legal unbundling"" of gas trading and transmission business, so that benefit goes to all shippers, BP felt unified tariff ""should be done after unbundling of transmission and marketing functions of an entity"". 

 GAIL Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi had on May 24 stated that unbundling of gas marketing and transportation business globally has been done only after the gas market has matured. 

 In mature markets, monopoly gas transporting and marketing companies have been unbundled or split after the share of natural gas in energy mix has reached at least 15 per cent and a well-connected pipeline network built. Also, domestically produced natural gas forms bulk of consumption. 

 In India, the share of natural gas in the energy mix is 6.2 per cent, its eastern and southern parts are not connected to any pipeline and domestically produced gas makes up for just 40 per cent of the consumption. 

 GAIL also insists that it operates the two business at arm's length principle and hasn't ever tried to use its monopolistic situation for undue commercial gains. 

 ""Going forward, we will come up with a portal where capacity on our pipelines can be booked transparently,"" he had said. 

 The portal being launched tomorrow is a step in that direction. 

 The company website already shows third-party access being given to all its pipelines on the common carrier principle basis. ANZ MKJ"

112,2018-08-27,GAIL,"GAIL should exit its non-core petrochemicals business and concentrate on laying and managing pipelines, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said while denying any government plan to break the state firm to separately house gas transportation and marketing functions.

“GAIL should gradually exit from petrochemicals. Laying pipeline is GAIL’s core business. It has also built a marketing network. It is a trustworthy gas marketing group,” Pradhan said.

Petrochemicals contribute nearly a tenth of the GAIL’s revenue and profit and is considered by energy companies as the revenue booster of the future as the application of petrochemicals rapidly expand across industries. 

GAIL is the country’s biggest pipeline operator and gas marketer, which gives it enormous power over suppliers and consumers. Global giant such as BP and Shell, who are GAIL’s rival in gas marketing in India, have raised the issue of conflict of interest in the past and demanded GAIL be broken up into two units housing transportation and trading business separately.

Pradhan had told a gathering of international oil industry executives in April that the government was working on “unbundling” of marketing and transportation of gas in the country. 

On Monday, he said GAIL had assured the government that it would operate the two businesses of gas transportation and marketing independently and have separate balance sheets for the two. He didn’t give a timeline for that. 

GAIL has also launched a portal that would allow customers to book gas transport capacity online, which Pradhan said is a step in the direction of bringing in transparent open access. 

GAIL Chairman B C Tripathi said vested interests were behind the demand for breaking up GAIL and most of its pipelines have a lot of unused capacity, and therefore, there was no question of not allotting capacity to other gas marketers.

Pradhan also accused the previous governments of forcing GAIL to build many pipelines that were unviable due to lack of customer demand."

The Nifty50 index opened in the positive and hit a new record lifetime high of 11,760 on Tuesday. It formed a Doji candle on the daily scale, but managed to hold the gains for the entire session. It has been respecting its rising channel and a support trend line, which confirms its bullish momentum.

Now, it has to hold above 11,666 to extend its move towards the 11,777-11,800 zone, while medium-term support is shifting higher to 11,620 level.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,500 followed by 11,700, while maximum Call OI shifted higher to 11,800 from 11,700. There was significant Put writing at 11,700, followed by 11,750, while Call unwinding was seen at all strike prices with fresh Call writing at 11,850.

India VIX moved up 1.51 per cent to 12.42, however overall lower volatility suggests the bulls are likely to hold a tight grip on the market.

Bank Nifty hit a new lifetime high of 28,388, but failed to close above the crucial 28,333 mark. It formed a Doji candle on the daily scale, which suggests the bears are putting pressure at higher levels while every decline is getting bought into. Now, a decisive move above 28,333 could trigger a fresh rally towards 28,500 and then 28,700 levels, while support is seen at 28,128 and then 28,000 levels.

Vedanta had bid for all the 55 blocks on offer and won three-fourths of them, a spectacular success ratio. ONGC had placed bid for 37 blocks but won just two. Oil India competed for 23 blocks in the auction in which a total of 110 bids were received. No foreign player participated in the auction that closed in early May. Domestic heavyweight Reliance Industries too kept out.

ONGC, the most experienced oil and gas player in the country, showed extraordinary risk-aversion and placed conservative bids, losing out to an aggressive Vedanta. This also earned ONGC executives a reprimand from the government.

The auction was the first test of the new Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP), which gave companies the liberty to carve their own blocks, introduced revenue-sharing model and gave operators the freedom to market natural gas. 

Under the policy, companies can express interest in specific blocks round the year. The government aggregates these interests over six months and then put these blocks up for auction.

These oilfield auctions are important for India to raise its domestic output of oil and gas, and cut its dependence on imports. India currently imports nearly 84% of crude and nearly half of its natural gas requirement. The government has set a target of cutting oil imports to 67% of the country’s requirement by 2022."

123,2018-08-30,GAIL,"ICICI Direct has a buy call on GAIL (India) with a target price of Rs 430.

The current market price of GAIL (India) is Rs 367.05.

Time period given by the brokerage firm is one year when GAIL (India) price can reach the defined target. 


View of ICICI Direct on the company:
Gail has two phases of petrochemical capacity (Pata I & new-Pata II) with a combined capacity of 800,000 metric tonnes per annum (TMTPA). The petrochemical segment witnessed a gradual ramp up post Pata-II with volumes at 673 TMT (nearly 84 per cent capacity utilisation) in FY18. The EBIT of the petchem segment in FY18 remained weak at Rs 261.2 crore. It witnessed quarterly fluctuations in profitability of petchem due to changes in gas mix (low cost domestic gas/high cost LNG). However, higher realisations due to increase in crude oil prices and lower raw material costs (US natural gas) will lead to improved performance in coming years. Going forward, we assume nearly 80 per cent and 100 per cent capacity utilisation for FY19E and FY20E, respectively, with EBIT at Rs 678 crore and Rs 860.3 crore during the respective periods. Subsequently, its petchem segment RoCE is expected to improve from 2.8 per cent in FY18 to nearly 9 per cent in FY20E.


Split plans in primary stage; valuations, prices to remain key: The petchem split plans are at a very nascent stage and may require Cabinet and the company's approval post which the government will wait for right valuations and plans. In case the petchem business is sold, it will lead to an improvement in Gail’s return ratios and benefit shareholders. On the core business front, PNGRB’s implementation of unified tariff plan will provide a significant movement in Gail’s performance. Incorporating the latest annual report numbers, we arrive at a target price of Rs 430. We have a BUY recommendation on Gail as a consolidated entity."

The aim is to replace industrial gases like dissolved acetylene, LPG and furnace oil/high-speed diesel (HSD) with environment-friendly natural gas.

In the first phase, around 23 workshops will use natural gas by December 31. It will be expanded to all 54 workshops and production units, and railway establishments -- including base-kitchens, guest houses, hostels -- by June 30 next year, Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani told reporters.

A pilot project at Matunga and Kota, Rajasthan, has been commissioned, which can result in annual savings of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 21 lakh respectively.

0,2018-09-01,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Market kept its slate clean on Friday by rallying for the sixth straight week on the back of select heavyweights. But the rupee's rapid descent towards 71-mark against the dollar came as a rude jolt. 

The Sensex advanced 1.03 per cent to 38,645.10 for the week to August 31, from 38,251.80 in the previous one. The NSE Nifty added 1.06 per cent at 11,680.50, from 11,557.10 during the same period.

Rupee's diminished clout remains a big worryline. The slide is mainly a fallout of elevated crude prices, worsening current account deficit (CAD), spike in inflation and fears of foreign portfolio outflow.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes, according to Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management, show that the benchmark finished the week below the 11,700 level. However, the index bulls failing to take out 11,760 might be a point of concern on a short-term basis. Hence staying cautious on rise is advised.

1,2018-09-02,GAIL,"A diversified supply base, the lure of fat margin, and the confidence earned with some recent overseas deals have boosted ambition at state-run GAIL, which is now preparing to up its game in the international trade.

“We are transforming from a domestic to an international player,” said Gajendra Singh, director (marketing) at GAIL, citing the company’s 15 million tonne of liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio, its eight rank globally in handling gas volume, and a supply base ranging from Qatar to Russia, Australia and the US.

GAIL’s gas marketing portfolio, including the locally-produced gas, is set to expand to 97 million metric standard cubic meter a day (mmscmd) in 2018-19 from 86 mmscmd in 2017-18, aided by overseas LNG supply. Of the 97 mmscmd, locally-produced gas comprises about 51mmscmd. Nearly a quarter of the balance 46 mmscmd of LNG supply has been tied up for sale to international customers with the remainder planned to be shipped to India.

“Our focus is now to reach new geographies. A diverse supply base enables us today to serve customers in diverse regions,” said Singh, adding that the shift would help mitigate risk that comes with total dependence on the domestic market.

GAIL is also contemplating setting up an office in Europe to be close to customers—it already has offices in Singapore and Houston. It is planning to beef up its LNG trading desk, sharpen its hedging tools, and build a team of analysts to develop better insight into the international LNG market.

“There is a scope for much better margins in the international market. There are risks too,” he said, adding that once the company makes a name for itself in the international market, more business opportunity and better terms may come its way. After doing some free on board deals for its US gas, GAIL recently did its maiden ex ship (DES) deal with a customer in Europe, which means delivering gas to the customer’s port and is more profitable, Singh said. It aims to similarly tap the Latin American market.

Just two years ago, GAIL faced big uncertainties as oil rates had collapsed and its long-term LNG contracts in which gas prices are linked to crude had begun looking unviable. Customers were refusing supplies and GAIL didn’t know what to do. Its US LNG contract, linked to Henry Hub price index, too felt like a liability as spot rates had crashed, and there were no back-to back contracts with customers. As the delivery schedule approached, GAIL hurriedly undertook some time and destination swaps, not all of which were very profitable."
3,2018-09-03,GAIL,"GAIL India, the country's largest gas transportation and marketing company, plans to set up battery charging stations for electric vehicles as well as build solar plants as it looks to be ""future ready"" for emerging businesses, a senior company official said.

It also wants to explore the business opportunity in waste-water treatment plants, water distribution, large water pipeline laying as an early mover.

""We have the country's biggest network of pipelines? and gas marketing infrastructure. We want to leverage for emerging business opportunities,"" he said. ""We want to be future ready.""

It is looking at possibilities of setting up battery charging stations for e-vehicles at CNG dispensing stations in a bid to diversify its portfolio beyond gas and petrochemicals.

""It is all at drawing board stage. A lot will depend on norms. For example, we don't know if rules permit a battery charging facility at a petrol pump or a CNG station. We don't know at what price we can sell that battery charge,"" he said. ?

GAIL wants to insert six new sections in the main objects clause of the memorandum of association of the company to foray into new business.

According to a shareholder notice, it wants to invest in ""start-ups in core business areas (of natural gas, petrochemicals, and energy) and non-core areas (like health, social and environment, safety, and security) either directly or indirectly.""

""The investment can be made through special purpose vehicle (SPV), alternative investment fund (AIF), fund of funds (FoF) and trust,"" it said.

The official said there is a necessity to adopt new and different pathways to provide clean, cost-effective and efficient mobility services that are safe, reduce dependence on oil imports and achieve more efficient land-use in cities with the least environmental footprints and impacts on human health.

With the objective in mind, the firm wants to set up ""battery charging stations and provide charging services"" to electric vehicles.

With the government planning to make a major shift to electric vehicles by 2030, GAIL feels that charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in India has not been fully developed yet.

GAIL with its ""pan-India presence through the natural gas network is deep-pocketed and has the capability of setting up charging infrastructure at a faster pace,"" he said.

The 34th annual general meeting of the company is scheduled for September 11.

With depletion of groundwater and monsoons becoming less predictable and unreliable, availability and utilisation of water are becoming key issues in modern India. Many cities are sourcing the fresh water through long-distance transport ranging from 50-200 km. ?

Stating that with growing population and industrialisation, the effluent water discharged has increased significantly, GAIL in the notice said the treatment of the effluent water and maintaining of the freshwater table is a big challenge and a business opportunity.

It is also looking to ""harness solar power potential available at its various sites and installations which can be connected to grid for sale or for own use at other installations through wheeling of power.""

In line with its strategy to promote the use of green fuel, it is contemplating to promote gas appliances in households to increase gas usage and minimise electric usage in housing equipment and appliances such as gas boiler, gas-based air conditioner and bathroom heater.

Operating nearly 14,000-km of natural gas and LPG pipeline and executing more than 4,500 km of new lines, GAIL feels it can provide services such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), engineering, procurement, construction management (EPCM) and project management consultancy (PMC) in the field of hydrocarbon pipelines.

""GAIL also has adequate experienced manpower and infrastructure for providing these services,"" the notice said.

It also wants to ""carry on the business of manufacture, import, distribution, and marketing of appliances relating to gas marketing and distribution, such as gas meter and CNG kits""."

6,2018-09-04,GAIL,"Thousands of Indian graduates are lining up to purge Facebook of abusive, gruesome, vulgar and terror-related content as the social media company begins to deliver on its promise to employ as many as 20,000 moderators globally to keep it clean.

Business process management company Genpact, which this year won a contract to provide content management services to Facebook, is hiring content moderators across a slew of Indian languages — including Tamil, Kannada, Oriya, Chattisgarhi, Nepali, Marathi, Mizo and Punjabi.

Genpact has placed advertisements on online employment platforms and held walk-in interviews for these roles in August. ET called the recruiters in the advertisements and confirmed the job description, which reads: “Monitor and moderate user-generated content/video on one of the reputed Social Website to ensure that the online community is maintained as a safe and fun environment. Should be +comfortable for any content Sexual Assault, Terrorism, Child Abuse, may be live suicidal videos and bloodshed.”

The salary for policing such bile: Rs 2.25-4 lakh a year, plus monthly incentives. Although Genpact’s listings did not specify that the jobs are for the Facebook contract, the company is hiring for these roles in Hyderabad, where the social media company has a large presence. Genpact declined to comment on specific questions related to the jobs. “Genpact takes very seriously the services that we provide to our clients. However, due to the confidential nature of our work, we cannot confirm or comment on specific relationships,” Genpact spokesperson Gail Marold told ET.




Facebook directly employs content moderators but also outsources the task of screening posts in more than 50 languages across the globe to companies like Genpact. “The teams working on safety and security at Facebook are doubling in size this year to 20,000 (globally). This includes our growing team of 7,500 content reviewers — a mix of full-time employees, contractors and companies we partner with,” a spokesperson for Facebook said. “This lets us scale globally, covering every time zone and over 50 languages… we do not disclose the locations for security reasons.”

The spokesperson did not answer questions regarding the partnership with Genpact.

Large IT services and BPO companies including Accenture and Cognizant are also increasingly entering the content moderation business, as are boutique companies such as Infosearch and Foiwe Info Global Solutions, as ET has previously reported.

Despite the gruesome nature of the content to be screened, there is no dearth of candidates. On jobs platform Naukri.com, there are over 3,000 applicants for 30 job openings at Genpact for screening Kannada language content.

The attrition, though, is high because of the toll on employees from having to constantly deal with disturbing content.

Such employees “could face emotional stress and have issues such as anxiety, stress and secondary trauma.

Studies show that people in occupations such as customer service who deal with emotions face a higher rate of burnout. That risk would be higher in tasks like content screening, especially for disturbing content,” said Dr Shyam Bhat, psychiatrist and mental wellness expert at Curefit.

A Facebook executive said the company was implementing measures to protect its reviewers. “There is an ongoing training for reviewers and a wellness programme as well (to look into the side effects of the exposure to violent content),” the executive told ET. Facebook’s users have long contested that the company’s enforcement policies were inconsistent and opaque when it came to moderating content on its platform.

In April, Facebook released the internal guidelines it uses to moderate content.

The guidelines have sections focussed on how moderators police misinformation, nudity, violence, etc., with exceptions and examples of each prohibition in detail. Facebook also introduced an option for users to appeal a decision by moderators to remove any piece of content, Monika Bickert, head of global policy management at Facebook, told ET in April."

10,2018-09-06,GAIL,"By Saket Sundria, Siddhartha Singh and Debjit Chakraborty
India’s efforts to sell a $1.6 billion stake in Oil & Natural Gas Corp. has run into concerns that government policies on fuel pricing would weigh on the state-run explorer’s share price, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

Investors and fund managers that met with Indian government officials during a U.S. roadshow last month voiced concern that the government may reimpose fuel subsidies and that the nation’s state-set natural gas prices are too low, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions were private.

The tepid response may further set back Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to raise 800 billion rupees ($11 billion) by selling holdings in state-run companies during the fiscal year ending in March. His government has only been able to pull in about 92 billion rupees as of July 5. The 5 percent ONGC stake being marketed would be worth about 111.5 billion rupees as of Wednesday’s closing price.


Bloomberg
Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone, while an ONGC spokesman declined to comment.

Shares in the company have declined about 10 percent so far this year, while cash reserves have shrunk after it paid a record dividend and bought the administration’s stake in a refiner. In contrast, the benchmark index has rallied about 12 percent, making it Asia’s best performer, while Brent, the benchmark for half the world’s crude, has climbed about 16 percent. ONGC’s price-earnings ratio lag that of global peers such as BP Plc.

ONGC shares fell as much as 1.2 percent to 171.60 rupees in Mumbai, while the benchmark index gained about 0.3 percent as of 10:39 a.m. local time.

Rising crude prices coupled with the depreciation of the rupee is straining the government’s subsidy budget, ICICI Direct Research analysts said in an Aug. 3 note. The government’s lower provisions for subsidies could lead to the possibility of ONGC sharing that burden, limiting the benefits of higher crude prices.


Bloomberg
When fuel prices were set by the government, the explorer would share a portion of the subsidy burden by selling crude to refiners at a discount to compensate them partially for the loss in revenue. ONGC along with Oil India Ltd. has paid for over 40 percent of the country’s annual subsidy bill, Moody’s Investors Service analyst Vikas Halan said in a note in May. That ended when the government freed up retail prices of gasoline in 2010, followed by diesel in 2014.

The government still continues to control prices of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas. The 208 billion rupees provision for kerosene and LPG subsidies in the year ending March is “clearly inadequate,” Jefferies India analysts led by Somshankar Sinha said in a note last month.

The pattern of price changes by state-run refiners have also led to speculations that they may be influenced by political issues. Earlier this year, refiners didn’t change retail fuel prices for three weeks, despite higher international crude costs, and increased them only after elections in a southern state key to Modi’s coalition ended.

The government holds about 67.7 percent in the explorer followed by state-owned Life Insurance Corp.’s 9.2 percent stake. Two other government-owned companies Indian Oil Corp. and GAIL India Ltd. own about a combined 10 percent stake in ONGC. The government last sold a 5 percent stake in the company in 2012, most of which was bought by Life Insurance Corp. after interest from other buyers failed to materialize."

CPSE ETF, which functions like a mutual fund scheme, comprises scrips of 10 bluechip PSUs namely ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, GAIL, EIL and Container Corporation of India. 

Officials said three PSUs or more would be included in the CPSE ETF basket to replace GAIL, EIL and Container Corp and the number would depend upon the value of the scrip and the corresponding weightage in the ETF basket. 

GAIL India, Container Corp and EIL have weightage of 11.25 per cent, 5.08 per cent and 2.28 per cent, respectively in CPSE ETF. 

CPSE ETF was set up in 2014 and the government has so far sold stake in the 10 companies in the basket in three tranches, thereby raising Rs 11,500 crore. 

Currently, the government holds 53.34 per cent, 54.80 per cent and 52.02 per cent stakes in GAIL, Container Corp and EIL, respectively. 

When CPSE ETF was set up, a limit was fixed such that the stake sales could take place till the government holding in the 10 constituent companies reaches 55 per cent. 

""Since the government holding in three CPSEs have fallen below 55 per cent, we need to replace them with new scrips. The number of companies to be included in the basket would depend on the weightage these new scrips would carry in the CPSE ETF basket,"" an official told . 

ICICI Securities has been appointed as an adviser for the fourth tranche of the ETF, which will be launched once the Fund is reconstituted, the official said. 

A final call on this would be taken by the inter-ministerial panel, chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. 

Through the three tranches of CPSE ETF, the government has already raised Rs 11,500 crore - Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014; Rs 6,000 crore from the second in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third in March 2017. 

The government has budgeted to raise Rs 80,000 crore through disinvestment in the current fiscal. It has already mopped up Rs 9,220 crore so far."
15,2018-09-10,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is likely to sign on September 24 contracts for 55 oil and gas exploration areas awarded under India's maiden open acreage auction OALP-1, people with direct knowledge of the development said.

The signing of contracts with the winners of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round-1 was initially scheduled for September 6 but it was postponed. The event is now scheduled for September 24, sources said.

The signing had to be postponed pending Vedanta getting shareholders' nod to sign the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the government.

Mining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd had walked away with 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in OALP-1 when the bid evaluation was completed last month. State-owned Oil India Ltd had won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two.

State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) received one block each, according to the list of winners put out by upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).

Vedanta, which had put in bids for all the 55 blocks, won right to explore and produce oil and gas in 41 of them, sources said, adding the company has called a shareholder meeting next week to approve of the signing of contract for the blocks where it will be investing USD 551 million.

At the close of the bidding on May 2, ONGC had bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. OIL bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion.

Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor in the remaining.

Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders.

Neither local giant Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999.

India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration.

Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in an area that is presently not under any production or exploration license.

The EoIs can be put in any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.

As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, ONGC and OIL, and private sector Vedanta by the end of the first EoI cycle on November 15, 2017, sources said.

The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.

The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration currently, they said.

Blocks are awarded to the company which offers highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.

Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10 per cent to 67 per cent by 2022 and to half by 2030.

Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 81 per cent of its oil needs.

The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

The government till now has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.

So far, 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospect."

19,2018-09-11,GAIL,"GAIL India Tuesday said it will expand its pipeline network capacity by about 50 per cent by constructing 5,500-kilometers of new lines in the next three years. The state-owned company is also looking at setting up 400 CNG stations and giving out a record 10 lakh piped natural gas (PNG) connections to household kitchens, its Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi said. 

 GAIL operates 11,000-km of pipeline network and markets two-thirds of all natural gas sold in the country. 

 It is rapidly building infrastructure to support the government push towards a gas-based economy by raising the share of natural gas in the energy basket to 15 per cent from current 6.2 per cent, in next few years. 

 GAIL plans to ""add 5,500-km gas pipelines to the existing network and leapfrog to capacity augmentation by about 50 per cent on the current base in the next three years in phases,"" he told shareholders at the company's 34th Annual General Meeting (AGM). 

The company is building a 2,655-km gas pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal and Odisha, the first phase of which would be completed before the scheduled target of December 2018. 

 Jagdishpur-Haldia & Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) project, also known as the 'Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga' project, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2015. 

 Tripathi said the pipeline section from Phulpur to Varanasi has been commissioned, the leg to Patna would be started in next couple of months. 

 The pipeline would be extended to Guwahati by laying an additional 750-km line, he said. ""The proposed pipeline up to Guwahati would interconnect with the upcoming 1,500-km 'Indradhanush' pipeline network conceived to operate in North-East by the public sector oil and gas majors."" 

 In addition, gas supplies through city gas distribution (CGD) networks have commenced at Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, he said. 

 CGD operations include the sale of CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas or PNG to household kitchens for cooking purpose. CNG is being pushed as a replacement for polluting liquid fuels like diesel, and PNG as a replacement for LPG to cut imports. 

 GAIL and its CGD subsidiaries gave out a record over 5 lakh PNG connections and set up 120 CNG dispensing stations in 2017-18, he said adding the target for the current year is to give 10 lakh PNG connections and set up 400 CNG stations. 

 ""Even as CGDs at Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Patna are under phased execution, under the 9th round of bidding, CGD affiliates of GAIL have competitively won a total of 15 geographical areas that include Guwahati, Rourkela, Meerut, Dehradun, and Mangalore,"" he said. 

 GAIL, he said, has also formed a subsidiary at Kolkata for establishing city gas distribution project."
20,2018-09-12,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Oil prices remain at elevated levels, continuing to cast a shadow on India which is dependent on imports to meet its oil needs. “…Various demand-supply equations will play an important role in determining the direction of crude oil prices. … Renewed sanctions on Iran exports from November and the gravity of its implementation will keep oil prices volatile with limited downside in the near term,” said ICICIdirect in a note on Tuesday. ET takes a look at stocks which stand to benefit from oil at higher levels and stocks which are likely to be in bearish mode because of it (three beneficiaries, three laggard stocks)


POSITIVE IMPACT

OIL & NATURAL GAS CORPORATION
Analysts are bullish on ONGC following significant rise in crude oil prices. They believe the company will benefit and concerns around subsidy are exaggerated. “Subsidies render earnings uncertain, but the Street and investors may be overestimating the risk on upstream SOEs…Even otherwise, valuations are inexpensive at 9.7x FY18 P/E when Brent averaged US$58 – 20-25 per cent lower than spot,” Jefferies said last month.


INDRAPRASTHA GAS
Indraprastha Gas will be a key beneficiary as the differential between petrol and compressed natural gas has increased, said Abhimanyu Sofat, Head of Research at IIFL. Sofat said this has made CNG more attractive, which will lead higher conversion of vehicles to CNG from alternate auto fuels. CNG accounts for around 75 per cent of total volumes for Indraprastha Gas. IIFL’s target price of Rs 351 implies an upside of 33 per cent in the stock.


ENGINEERS INDIA
Engineers India, a consultancy and EPC company in oil & gas industry, is expected to benefit from high order inflows in the sector. “Upgradation of refineries to BS-VI, efforts to boost oil and gas production and new LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals will incur higher capex in this sector, leading to growth in company’s order book,” said Sofat of IIFL, which has a target price of Rs 145 on Engineers India.


GAIL INDIA
GAIL, which is India’s largest gas transmission company is also seen as a beneficiary of higher crude oil prices. “We expect GAIL to benefit from full utilisation of petrochemicals capacity as also from increased gas utilisation in the overall energy footprint,” said Prabhudas Lilladher, maintaining ‘buy’ recommendation and revised target price to Rs 435 from Rs 414.




NEGATIVE IMPACT


INTERGLOBE AVIATION
Analysts see InterGlobe Aviation among the stocks which will be negatively impacted by the elevated crude oil prices. “Margins will remain under pressure until competitive intensity eases or crude prices reduce…Yield improvement in an environment where fuel costs are high remains a key monitorable,” said HDFC Securities in a note after the airline’s June quarter result. The brokerage has a neutral rating on the stock.


CASTROL INDIA
Leading lubricant player Castrol India is likely to witness pressure on rising crude oil prices and currency fluctuation. “It uses base oil and additives as raw materials which are crude derivatives. This could impact margins due to higher imports (around 53 per cent of raw materials) and limited price hikes,” said Sofat of IIFL.


JET AIRWAYS (INDIA)
The slide in rupee and high crude oil prices is expected to further swell Jet Airways’ operational costs. “The current stress in the Indian aviation sector is cyclical and will reverse. Yet, Jet is poised with significant challenges which pose insolvency risk,” said ICICI Securities in a note earlier this month. “Scrutiny of Jet’s books by the Indian authorities for alleged siphoning of money is an added overhang,” said ICICI Securities.


HPCL
Oil marketing companies such as HPCL are negatively impacted by crude oil prices. Analysts at Nirmal Bang recommended a ‘sell’ on HPCL citing concerns on the likely decline in GRM, increase in capex over the next five years, rise in interest costs and concerns over product pricing freedom. They believe the stock is likely to get de-rated due to likely low earnings growth and decline in return on equity."
21,2018-09-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Losses in shares of BPCL (down 3.25 per cent), HPCL (down 2.99 per cent) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) (down 2.56 per cent) dragged the BSE Oil & Gas index down in Wednesday's session.

Weak Asian cues, wobbly crude oil price and rupee's fresh fall weighed on domestic market sentiment.

Investors await index of industrial production (IIP) for July and inflation data for August, scheduled later today, for further direction.

22,2018-09-13,GAIL,"Petronet LNG, India's biggest liquefied natural gas importer, has paid a 12.5 per cent higher commission-on-profit to its chief executive Prabhat Singh and company directors in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. According to the company's Annual Report for 2017-18, Singh was paid a commission of Rs 22.50 lakh over and above his remuneration. This compared with Rs 20 lakh commission he got in the 2016-17 fiscal year. 

 Petronet Director (Technical) Rajender Singh earned a similar commission in both the years. 

 The commission to Prabhat Singh took his total remuneration to Rs 1.16 crore in 2017-18 as compared to Rs 1.08 crore in the previous fiscal. 

 Petronet, which is registered as a private limited company but is headed by the Oil Secretary, also paid its three independent directors -- A K Misra, Sushil Kumar Gupta and Jyoti Kiran Sukla, a commission ranging from Rs 3.14 lakh to Rs 8.5 lakh over and above their sitting fee. 

 Prabhat Singh took over as the Managing Director and CEO of Petronet LNG on September 14, 2015. That year he was paid a commission of Rs 8.21 lakh. The commission to other full-time directors including Rajender Singh and the then Director (Finance) R K Garg was Rs 15 lakh. 

 According to the 2017-18 annual report, the ratio of the remuneration paid to the chief executive to the median remuneration of the employees of the company was 9.4:1. 

 Petronet earned a net profit of Rs 2,078 crore on a turnover of Rs 30,599 crore in 2017-18 fiscal. This compared with Rs 1,706 crore net profit on a turnover of Rs 24,616 crore in the previous year. 

 In the annual report, Petronet said it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Andaman and Nicobar Administration for the establishment of a small-scale floating LNG receiving, storage and regasification terminal and gas-based power plant at South Andaman. 

 Pre-project studies like environment impact assessment, geotechnical investigations and marine studies including navigational studies have been completed which would be used to prepare a detailed feasibility report. 

 Petronet has also signed an MoU with Petrobangla of Bangladesh for setting up a land-based 7.5 million tonnes a year LNG receiving, storage and regasification terminal at Kutubdia Island. It has also inked a pact with Sri Lankan authorities for developing LNG infrastructure in the island nation. 

 Petronet, which is 50 per cent owned by state-owned oil firms, operates two terminals for import of natural gas in its liquid form (LNG) in India - 15 million tonnes facility at Dahej in Gujarat and a 5 million tonnes a year unit at Kochi in Kerala. 

 Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), GAIL India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) each hold 12.5 per cent stake in Petronet. Its chairman, however, is the Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. 

 Petronet said it is working on the use of LNG as a transportation fuel in place of diesel and CNG. 

 The ""company has prepared a business plan based on traffic study on Indian roads and decided to develop an LNG corridor covering 4000 kms of National highways,"" the annual report said, adding it has shortlisted 20 locations to develop LNG dispensing stations as a pilot project."
23,2018-09-13,GAIL,"Oil PSUs are scouting for discovered oil and gas fields in Russia as India looks to bolster energy ties with the resource-rich nation, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Thursday.

Indian PSUs have already invested USD 15 billion in picking up stakes in Russian oil and gas projects like Sakhalin-1, he said at a conference on 'India-Russia in 21st Century'.

""Our oil and gas PSUs are continuing to explore their participation in more oil and gas projects in Russia. We are working with Russian oil and gas companies for acquisition of quality producing blocks,"" he said.

ONGC Videsh Ltd in 2001 bought a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 project in Far East Russia. It further bought Imperial Energy a few years later and has recently invested in Vankorneft and TasYuryah along with Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL).

In return, Russian firm Rosneft has bought a majority stake in Essar Oil for USD 12.9 billion.

""Today, Russia is our largest investment destination in the oil and gas sector. I believe that our time-tested relationship has no expiry date. Russia will always be a priority in India's foreign and energy policy and both our countries will remain as a role model for global communities,"" he said.

Also, gas utility GAIL has contracted 2.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG from Russia's Gazprom for 20 years, he said. ""India has embarked on the path of becoming a gas-based economy. Russian supplies will help us in meeting the objectives of price stability and energy security,"" he said.

Stating that Soviet oil and gas experts had helped ONGC strike Bombay High in the Arabian Sea in the 1960s, he said Soviet technology had also helped in the refining sector in 1960s and 1970s.

India and Russia have deeply strengthened their hydrocarbon engagement and have built an 'Energy Bridge' between the two nations, he said. ""I see huge opportunities for cooperation in various verticals of oil and gas sector.""

""Our energy relations were never as strong as they have become in the last couple of years. Our engagement in the hydrocarbon sector, including some major investments, has become one of the key pillars of our bilateral relations,"" he said."
24,2018-09-14,GAIL,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty extended their gains for a second straight session on Friday after CPI-based inflation came in at 10-month low of 3.69 per cent for August amid positive global cues.

25,2018-09-14,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty staged a stellar show on Friday on across-the-board buying fuelled by healthy macroeconomic indicators. 

Domestic investors embarked on an all-round buying spree after inflation data showed the economy is in a good shape. 

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Friday showed inflation based on wholesale prices eased to a four-month low of 4.53 per cent in August on softening of food prices. The wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.09 per cent in July and 3.24 per cent in August last year.

Earlier this week, government data showed retail inflation eased to a 10-month low of 3.69 per cent in August. 

The rupee, too, was on a recovery path in anticipation that the Prime Minister may announce some steps to curb its fall at an weekend review. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee was trading 35 paise higher for the day at 71.93.

Positive global cues also influenced the sentiment. Asian shares rose on Friday as the US and China prepared for a new round of trade talks on the tariff row, while a decisive interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank helped support global risk appetite, Reuters reported.

Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley raised the Sensex target for September 2019 to 42,000, citing that the earnings cycle was at the cusp of turning. However, it highlighted the election outcome in 2019 is a key risk for the market.

The Nifty50 index jumped 145 points, or 1.28 per cent, to close at 11,515, with four stocks – HCL Tech, Coal India, Infosys and GAIL – ending in the red. Reliance Industries finished flat.

Brookfield is uniquely sponsoring an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) called India Infrastructure Trust as the acquisition vehicle to take over the 1,400 km common carrier pipeline from Kakinada on the east coast to Bharuch in Gujarat.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the transaction last week. Brookfield has also filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for registering the InvIT, approval for which is expected this month, following which a formal joint announcement will be made, said multiple sources aware of the matter.

The pipeline housed under EWPL is being transferred to an entity called Pipeline Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (PIPL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Holding Pvt. Ltd (RIHPL). That’s a holding arm of Mukesh Ambani and family, the promoters of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).

EWPL has already filed an application with the National Company Law Tribunal for the asset transfer.

The $2 billion will be evenly split between equity and debt and Brookfield is said to be currently in negotiations with Indian lenders such as ICICI Bank for financing.

Brookfield declined to comment. There was no response from Reliance to queries sent on Saturday.

JM Financial is advisor to the transaction. As part of the contract with Brookfield, Ambani is also said to be negotiating a clause that would allow buying back the asset after 20-25 years. But those terms are still getting finalised.

“It’s a great way of monetising an asset. Brookfield and the four other small sponsors of the trust will get cashflows from the pipeline, which will give them their desired yields,” said a Reliance executive on condition of anonymity. “InvITs are tax-efficient vehicles and give an optionality in the future to add more assets.”




DIRECT LINKS TO RIL BUSINESS
The pipeline, Sikka Ports & Terminals Ltd (SPTL) and Reliance Utilities and Power Pvt Ltd (RUPPL) are key companies in Ambani’s privately held RIHPL Group and their operations are critical for RIL as they are closely integrated with those of its facilities in Jamnagar, Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat, and with its Krishna-Godavari (KG) D6 gas fields. The facilities cater exclusively to RIL’s existing facilities as well as its expansion in the petrochemicals and refining business, which is nearing completion.

EWPL has built and operates the critical pipeline to transport natural gas produced by Reliance-BP from the KG basin on the east coast and links to users on the west coast. It also transports gas from other sources including RLNG (regasified liquefied natural gas) terminals along the stretch of the pipeline and is connected to pipelines of other operators such as state-run GAIL (India) Ltd and Gujarat State Petronet Ltd for onward delivery nationwide. However, the sharp drop in production in KG-D6 has had an impact on the company’s financials.

EWPL had operational revenue of Rs 884 crore and posted a net loss of Rs 715 crore in the year ended March. The company was bleeding due to high interest expenses, which were almost equal to its revenue, and depreciation costs. It had a total outstanding debt of Rs 13,715 crore as of March while its plant, property and equipment had an asset value of around Rs 11,000 crore, according to its last annual balance sheet. EWPL had separately disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was hiving off its investment division to immediate holding company Sikka Ports.

“EWPL’s cash flow is sensitive to the volume of gas available for transportation. Low volume reduces capacity utilisation and revenues, thus impacting cash accruals. There has been a significant drop in RIL’s gas production from its KG-D6 block over the last few years, which has constrained its cash flows,” said rating agency Crisil in a note earlier this year.

The average production was about 5 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) in the third quarter of FY18, down from about 8 mmscmd in fiscal 2017 and about 12 mmscmd from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2016, which in turn was significantly lower than 26 mmscmd in fiscal 2013. “Nevertheless, gas volumes are expected to increase after RIL and BP’s joint deepwater gas-field project at the KG-D6 basin commences production (expected in 2020),” the note added.

In five years since April 2012, RIHPL group has extended support to EWPL in the form of subordinated debt and preference shares of about Rs 4,826 crore and Rs 8,000 crore, respectively, as of March 31.


INDIA BETS
Surpassing heavyweights Carlyle, KKR or even Apollo, Brookfield, is the world’s second-biggest manager of alternative assets like real estate and private equity with $285 billion of assets, after Blackstone, which is number one. In India, it has already deployed over $5 billion since 2009-10, but once concluded, this will be its largest deal.

Brookfield’s India bets includes the largest commercial real estate transaction in India in 2014 — acquiring a 15 million square foot portfolio of office properties from Unitech. In the last two years, it has purchased a portfolio of six toll roads, totalling 246 km of roadways, and a majority stake in a cell phone tower network. Globally, it has been an aggressive investor in energy assets and related infrastructure — buying gas pipelines in Brazil, coal terminals in Australia and even gas stations in Canada.

Currently through its active management, the firm manages over 2,200 km of backbone electricity transmission, 6.5 million direct customer electricity and natural gas connections, 980,000 smart meters, 2,000 km of regulated natural gas pipelines and 85 million tonnes per annum of coal handling capacity. Within its energy portfolio, its assets include one of the largest natural gas transmission and pipeline systems in the US, unregulated natural gas and liquid propane gas distribution operations in Australia; natural gas storage centers in Alberta and district heating and cooling systems in Australia, Canada and the US."

37,2018-09-19,GAIL,"State-owned Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (RCF) said it will start work on the coal gasification-based fertilizer plant at Talcher in Odisha by the end of the month. The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposal of the Department of Fertilizers for equity investment of Rs 1033.54 crore for setting up the fertilizer project in Talcher Fertilizer Ltd (TFL) by RCF.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the fertilizer unit on September 22. The unit will have urea production capacity of 12.7 lakh tonne per annum,” said Umesh Dhatrak, MD and chairman of RCF.

Dhatrak said that the revival of the Talcher fertilizer plant, which has been shut since 2002, will create new job opportunities in the region.

“The revival of the Talcher project will ensure huge investment in the fertilizer sector from the government through PSUs. This will create job opportunities and also boost the economy of the state and the eastern region. The revival of the fertilizer unit will also ensure increase in indigenous production of urea leading to greater self-reliance in urea,” said a government release.

The TFL is a joint venture between GAIL, Coal India Ltd (CIL), RCF and Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd (FCIL). It was incorporated in November, 2015, with shareholding of 29.67% of GAIL, RCF and CIL each, and 10.99% of FCIL to revive the fertilizer plant.

The government release said that the share of GAIL, CIL and RCF in the equity of TFL shall be Rs 1033.54 crore (+15%) based on the capex of Rs 11,611.48 crore (+15%) for the coal gasification-based fertilizer plant."
38,2018-09-19,GAIL,"By next week, you should see much more stability, consolidation and broader market outperformance on the back of better than expected results, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, India Infoline, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


The big question in the minds of a lot of retail investors is whether this is the start of a more prolonged fall right now or whether we are going to see mild bouts of consolidation. What is the sense that you are getting?
Three things. First, the global market is about to take off for a very strong rally and the Dow is going to lead it from the front. In first half of October, we see a new high on the Dow. On the local side, we think that the rupee weakness, oil and bond yields all have played out. Now of course the sentiment and fear factor is high because of the FII deluge of selling but these are opportune moments to buy. I do not see 11,171 which was the previous high getting violated and if it does, it is going to be momentarily breach. 

We also do not see 73 getting hurt on the upside on the rupee. In a nutshell, this is a good time to start buying your stocks because fear is the best time to buy and most of the negatives like rupee, oil bond yields, the trade skirmish between tariff wars, are being priced in. By next week, you should see much more stability, consolidation and the broader market outperformance on the back of better than expected results which we see coming after the September quarter ends. 


Since you are talking about this decline being a good opportunity to buy, a lot of people are taking that contra call on OMCs. The stock price movement that we have seen in the last four trading sessions are justified I guess. There has been some tremendous buying in this beaten down pocket. Are you also of the view that OMCs have the worst absorbed in the prices already and now is the good time to buy on them?
Correct. That is a very good point and the value investor or the smart investor is definitely buying the OMCs. I also do not rule out a separate window for dollars being created by the Government of India and that will take away the vagaries of volatility. It will give them much more stability and less loss as far as the currency goes. 

Secondly, I would like to add some of the gas utilities as well. In fact, GAIL and IGL are looking very good and GAIL is actually an outperformer. If you take a sum of the parts (SOTP), the OMCs combined with the gas utilities are actually the perfect basket you should be buying. Rs 1200 on Reliance gives you an opportunity because that will be one stock which in the heavyweights are leading from the front, once the market gets through this consolidation.


If your view is long term, do you believe that right now we are just at the cusp and a very minuscule part of what the mutual fund industry could grow into in next five to ten years? Sheer volumes will help mitigate the near term revenue loss that AMCs may actually feel. Do you believe AMC stocks should be bought in this decline? 
Given the sentiment, you are trying to sell lock, stock and barrel. Whatever was slightly in the money, is being sold and the small pretext of sacrificing margins for volume is creating the perfect storm. On the other hand, if you are looking for a business for next 5, 10, 15, 20 years, then insurance and asset management is just the tip of the iceberg. Going ahead, there will be huge volume upsurge. It will get better distributed and it will be more competitive. It is a win-win for the investors but over a period of time, volumes will definitely make up the loss of margin and that may be a temporary negative in the short run."

So everybody is maintaining the status quo.""The RBI framework provided for a strict timeline for resolution of these bad loans where debt is Rs 2,000 crore or more. It mandates starting insolvency proceedings in case no resolution plan is provided by the lenders within 180 days of default.About the steps to check rupee depreciation, he said, ""There are some more measures which are coming. But current account deficit needs to be contained. The step taken so far would definitely help the sentiment in favour of the rupee.""On steps taken on containing rupee depreciation by bankers like NRI bonds, he said, ""Whatever you do ultimately add to the debt burden of the country. It is not what banks will decide. Ultimately these are the issues or decisions which are to be taken by RBI that how do we manage our external sector. Once those decisions are taken, the banks implement those decisions.""About unveiling of SASHAKT scheme guidelines, he said, ""That is what in progress. earlier target was September 30, you can add 10 to 15 days more to that. Banks can invest up to 10 per cent in AIF (alternative investment fund). But it has to carry in mind that 10 per cent carries 150 per cent risk weight. But in AMC (asset management company) we would be participating to the extent of 10 per cent.""Project Sashakt aims to strengthen the credit capacity, credit culture and credit portfolio of public sector banks. It is an Asset Management Company (AMC) resolution approach, under which an independent AMC would be set up to focus on asset turn around, job creation and protection.Kumar spoke to reporters on the sideline of an event where Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Ltd (HURL) signed the Rupee Term Loan (Rs 5,314.33 crore) agreement for the Gorakhpur fertiliser plant with a consortium of banks led by the SBI as the lead banker and Punjab National Bank, Allahabad Bank, Union Bank of India, Indian Bank, Bank of India and Canara Bank.The HURL is a joint venture company of three Maharatna PSUs -- NTPC, IOCL and CIL -- along with FCIL & HFCL and is currently engaged in implementing three urea projects at Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni in the eastern part of the country.These plants which are being built at an estimated cost of Rs 21,000 crore shall bring a new lease of life in the economic growth of eastern India.

41,2018-09-21,GAIL,"New Delhi: India and Russia are expected to conclude a deal during their October 5 annual summit here to increase Delhi’s investments in Russian oil fields. India is eyeing to develop energy ties as a key pillar of the strategic partnership.

Indian hydrocarbon firms, which over the last two years have invested in Russia's Vankorneft oil field, are expected to further invest in Vankor cluster, indicated people familiar with the issue.

The annual summit between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to reach a new agreement for additional investments in Russian oil fields. Indian public sector firms have already invested $15 billion in picking up stakes in Russian oil and gas projects like Sakhalin-1. Oil PSUs are scouting for discovered oil and gas fields in Russia.

ONGC Videsh Ltd in 2001 bought a 20% stake in the Sakhalin-1project in far east Russia. It bought Imperial Energy a few years later and since 2016 has invested in Vankorneft and Tas-Yuryah along with Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL).

Russian firm Rosneft has bought a majority stake in Essar Oil for $13 billion. Beginning this year, Russia has started supplying LNG to India under a contract for two decades. GAIL has contracted 2.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG from Russia's Gazprom for 20 years.

The two sides are further exploring opportunities for joint development of Russian on shore oil fields and the Arctic shelf of Russia. Besides, Russian energy major Gazprom and ONGC Videsh could sign a pact on the joint development of projects on the shelf of the Pechora and Okhotsk seas in Russia, according to officials.

Addressing an Indo-Russia conference here last week, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan recalled that Soviet oil and gas experts had helped ONGC strike Bombay High in the Arabian Sea in the 1960s and that Soviet technology had also helped in the refining sector in 1960s and 1970s.

India and Russia have deeply strengthened their hydrocarbon engagement and built an “energy bridge” between the two nations, the minister pointed out."

Yes Bank was the biggest Sensex loser, cracking 34 per cent to hit a one-year low after the Reserve Bank Wednesday curtailed the term of its founding CEO Rana Kapoor and asked the private sector lender to look for his replacement by January 2019.

Financial stocks took a big beating. Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Can Fin Homes all plunged up to 55 per cent.

""The cost of borrowing for NBFCs is going to shoot up and they may face challenge in raising money in light of recent news on IL&FS. However, this knee-jerk reaction is baffling,"" said Hitesh Agrawal, EVP & head - retail research at Religare Securities. 

Commenting on financial crisis at IL&FS, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, India Infoline said, “There is pressure on short-term money both in the short-term and longer-term debt flows. The cost of money has escalated and there is tightness in the money market. The lack of clarity about IL&FS exposure is leading to the knee-jerk reaction. There is no clarity on government’s bailout for the company so far. However, the fear will subside after the government steps in. Once there is stability in the money market, things will be as usual.”

India VIX, the fear gauge, spiked over 11 per cent to 15.58.

47,2018-09-22,GAIL,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday laid the foundation stone for a Rs 13,000 crore-project to revive the Talcher fertiliser plant and exuded confidence that it will begin production in the stipulated 36 months.

The fertiliser plant will for the first time see coal being converted into gas for use as feedstock and for producing neem-coated urea.

""They have told me production will start in 36 months. I assure you that I will come again after 36 months here with you. I will inaugurate this project,"" Modi said at a function organised here to mark the commencement of work on the project.

Noting that the project will help cut import of natural gas and fertiliser and make India self-reliant, he said, ""Our aim is to take India to new heights of growth.""

Projects like the fertiliser plant here are central to India's growth story, the prime minister said. ""This plant will use latest technology as well.""

The beginning of work on the plant would fulfil the dreams that should have been fulfilled long ago, Modi said.

The project will produce 1.27 million tonnes of neem-coated urea -- a crop nutrient -- and would use coal-gasification technology to produce feedstock for the plant.

""Coal-gasification is being used for the first time in India to covert this 'black diamond' coal into gas. This would help reduce import of natural gas fertiliser,"" he said, adding the project would also generate employment for about 4,500 people.

The project is being executed by a consortium of PSUs, which Modi said is a shining example of how the country's 'crown jewels' can work together.

Modi was of the view that this technology of coal gasification will give new direction to development and would be replicated in other new projects for fertiliser production and other purposes.

The Talcher fertiliser project of the Fertilizer Corporation of India was shut in 2002 by the then BJP-led NDA government as frequent power restrictions as well as obsolete and mismatch of technology made the plant economically unviable.

The government in August 2011 decided to revive the plant. A new company Talcher Fertilisers Ltd was constituted with four state-run companies -- GAIL, Coal India, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers and FCIL -- as partners.

Speaking on the occasion, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said this will be India's first coal-gasification based fertiliser plant that will produce 1.27 million tonnes per annum of urea leading to greater self-reliance in crop nutrient.

It will produce 2.38 million standard cubic metres per day equivalent natural gas utilising available domestic coal in an environment-friendly manner. This would help reduce LNG import bill by Rs 1,620 crore annually.

""The Talcher fertiliser plant will usher in an uncharted path of progress and prosperity for industrial and economic growth in Odisha by providing a massive boost to fertiliser and other ancillary industries in the state. It will also create new opportunities for employment,"" he said.

Assuring all support for the project, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said 50 per cent of the production of this plant will be used in the state itself, benefitting farmers."

75,2018-09-30,GAIL,"The Friday’s session saw a lot of volatility dominating the session, as NSE benchmark Nifty saw wild swings on either side. Despite trading in a defined range for the major part of the session, the market saw a sharp selloff in the second half of the trade.

Despite the Nifty recovering over 80 points from the day’s low, the index settled the day losing 47.10 points or 0.43 per cent.

As we approach fresh week and a month, we need to tread with caution. If we inspect several important data points of the past couple of days, it was seen that the level of 10,860 has been tested thrice and the Nifty managed to bounce back from there.

Monday is likely to see a stable start again, but we expect the Nifty to remain rangebound and tentative in approach. However, with each passing day, the technical pullback remains imminent.

Monday is likely to see the levels of 10,990 and 11,045 playing out as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in at 10,890 and 10,810 zones.

The RSI on daily charts is 32.8807. A bullish divergence was seen on the charts as the Nifty set a fresh 14-period low, while the RSI did not. The daily MACD stayed bearish while trading below its signal line. No significant formations were seen on the charts.

If we take a broader view of the market, after nearly 800-point decline from the lifetime high, the Nifty is now showing some signs of a potential bottom formation on the short-term charts.

It also remains oversold on the short-term charts and shows high possibility of the technical pullback.

In event of any weakness, the level of 10,860 is likely to send support as the Nifty has pulled back twice after testing those levels again. Very low volumes in cash segment as compared to futures segment also point towards likely exhaustion in selling in the near term.

We strongly recommend staying away from creating shorts continue preserving liquidity for select purchases.

2,2018-10-01,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Jet Airways (down 6.04 per cent), SpiceJet (down 4.62 per cent), TAAL Enterprises (down 3.14 per cent) and IndiGo (down 2.56 per cent) plunged in morning trade on Monday after a hike in fuel prices.

In the steepest hike in recent times, oil companies increased jet fuel prices by 7.3 per cent on Monday. A kilo-litre (kl, 1,000 litres) of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) will cost Rs 74,567 and Rs 74,177 in Delhi and Mumbai this month respectively, up from Rs 69,461 and 69,161 in September, TOI reported. 

A surge in global crude oil prices is the main reason behind the price hike in Jet fuel by oil companies. 

Oil prices opened firmly on Monday, with Brent hovering close its highest in nearly four years ahead of US sanctions against Iran that kick in next month, Reuters reported. 

Shares of Jet Airways, SpiceJet and IndiGo hit 52-week low of 163.70, 64.05 and 768.25, respectively, on BSE today. 

Aviation stocks have been under pressure of late on firming crude oil prices globally. Moreover, cheap flight tickets amid cut-throat competition have hit the prospects of profits of the companies.

Domestic market was in the lower territory. Concerns over rising crude oil prices and uncertainty over the RBI policy meet later this week weighed on investor sentiment.

4,2018-10-01,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: As much as Rs 5,900 crore of investment has been committed in 55 oil and gas exploration areas awarded under India's maiden open acreage auction, OALP-1, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Monday. Mining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd walked away with 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in OALP-1, contracts for which were signed at a function here Monday. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two. 

 State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) received one block each. 

 Oil Secretary M M Kutty said the second round of OALP, featuring 14 blocks, would be launched soon. 

 Of the 14 blocks, four blocks in the Mahanadi basin have been identified by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) and the remaining by explorers, he said. 

 ""We have received firm investment commitment of over Rs 5,900 crore in the 55 OALP-I blocks,"" Pradhan said the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) signing ceremony. 

 The 55 blocks hold an estimated Rs 1.45 lakh crore worth of hydrocarbon resources. 

 India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. 

 Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in an area that is presently not under any production or exploration license. 

 The EoIs can be put in any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually. 

 As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, ONGC and OIL, and private sector Vedanta by the end of the first EoI cycle on November 15, 2017. These blocks were then offered for bidding and winners signed PSC on Monday. 

 ""We got an investment commitment of Rs 700-800 crore in (the separate auction of) Discovered Small Field (DSF)-I round,"" Pradhan said adding investments have been also incentivised in enhanced and improved oil recovery projects that will boost output from existing fields. 

 Vedanta, which had put in bids for all the 55 blocks, will invest USD 551 million in the 41 blocks it won under OALP-1, its CEO Sudhir Mathur said. 

 At the close of the bidding on May 2, ONGC had bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. OIL bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion. 

 Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor in the remaining. 

 Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders. 

 Neither local giant Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999. 

 The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a five-mark advantage. 

 The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration currently, Kutty said. 

 Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells. 

 Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence. 

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10 per cent to 67 per cent by 2022 and to half by 2030. 

 Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 81 per cent of its oil needs. 

 The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block. 

 The government till now has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round. 

 So far, 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. 

 The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospect."

3,2018-10-01,GAIL,"The new index of the CPSE Exchange Trade Fund (ETF) is likely to have shares of 11 state-owned companies, in place of 10 at present, an official said.

The Finance Ministry, along with investment bankers, is currently in the process of rebalancing the ETF and the new index is likely to be ready by end-October, the official added.

Shares of three CPSEs -- GAIL, Engineers India Ltd (EIL) and Container Corporation -- will be removed from the index since the government holding in these companies has fallen below 55 per cent.

These stocks would be replaced by scrips of four new CPSEs, including KIOCL, which will take their total number in the ETF to 11, the official told PTI.

The government currently owns 99 per cent stake in KIOCL (formerly Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd).

The CPSE ETF, which functions like a mutual fund scheme, comprises scrips of 10 bluechip PSUs -- ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, GAIL, EIL and Container Corporation of India.

GAIL India, Container Corp and EIL have weightage of 11.25 per cent, 5.08 per cent and 2.28 per cent, respectively in CPSE ETF.

Since the weightage and scrip value of GAIL, Container Corp and EIL are higher, four new CPSEs have to be included to replace them to keep the CPSE ETF index value at the same level.

""The new index should be ready by end October after which the government will launch the fourth tranche of follow on offer of the ETF,"" the official added.

CPSE ETF was set up in 2014 and the government has so far sold stake in the 10 companies in the basket in three tranches, thereby raising Rs 11,500 crore.

Currently, the government holds 53.34 per cent, 54.80 per cent and 52.02 per cent stakes in GAIL, Container Corp and EIL, respectively.

When CPSE ETF was set up, a limit was fixed such that the stake sales could take place till the government holding in the 10 constituent companies reached 55 per cent.

Since the government holding in these three CPSEs have fallen below 55 per cent, new scrips have to be included to replace them.

ICICI Securities has been appointed as adviser for the fourth tranche of the ETF.

Through the three tranches of CPSE ETF, the government has already raised Rs 11,500 crore -- Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014; Rs 6,000 crore in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third in March 2017.

The government has budgeted to raise Rs 80,000 crore through disinvestment in the current fiscal. It has mopped up over Rs 9,000 crore so far."
5,2018-10-02,GAIL,"The steep increase in pipeline tariffs for GAIL and GSPL, India’s two leading gas transmission companies, could lift their FY19 earnings growth by 5-20 per cent.

Gas regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) sets tariffs once in five years based on parameters such as utilisation, capital expenditure, and operating expenses incurred on pipelines. Thanks to an upward revision in the assumption of average tariff compared with Street estimates for the next five years due to the recent pipeline tariff, the net present value—summation of the current value of earnings of future earnings--of pipelines is expected to increase.

This could result in the higher target prices for GAIL and GSPL. CLSA has raised the target price of GAIL and GSPL to Rs 450 and Rs 270, from an earlier target of Rs 435 and Rs 240, respectively.

PNGRB increased the transportation tariff of some pipelines of GAIL in the range of 54 per cent-691 per cent, while GSPL’s was increased by 28-119 per cent. For instance, the tariff of the Dabhol-Bangalore pipeline, having a transmission capacity of 20mmscmd, was increased to Rs 37.8 per MMBtu, a gain of 54 per cent.

GAIL pipelines, for which tariffs have been raised, transport about 18 per cent of total transmission volumes. Higher tariff is applicable for the entire pipeline network of GSPL which has transmission capacity of 42mmscmd. The new tariff will be applicable from April 2018. This means revision in tariff could add nearly Rs 500 crore and Rs 325 crore, respectively, to the revenue of GAIL and GSPL for the current fiscal.

The revisions are higher than Street estimates. Analysts believe that the gas regulator has been liberal to arrive at tariff and acceded to several of the industry’s demands on the computation to opex, capex and depreciation.

Three main pipelines slated for tariff revision accounts for nearly 58 per cent of the total gas transmission of GAIL. Also, GAIL’s main pipelines, Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagishpur (old and new), are operating at less than normative rate 75 per cent considered by the regulator to fix tariffs. Hence, any benefit from an increase in volumes until 75 per cent utilisation will entirely be retained by GAIL.

The average tariff of GAIL could see a continuous rise in the next three years, while tariff of GSPL will have no upside trigger after the recent revision. The Street is pricing in average tariff for GAIL at Rs 1,428 and Rs 1,578 per mscm for FY19 and FY20, respectively, for the recent hike in tariff compared with Rs 1,294 in FY18. GSPL’s average tariff is expected to remain at Rs 1,357 per mscm for FY19 and FY20 each. GSPL’s average tariff stood at Rs 1,118 per mscm."
6,2018-10-02,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is not in a hurry to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL (India) and will wait for the right price before offloading the shares, a senior company official said.

ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in oil refiner IOC and 4.86 per cent in gas utility GAIL India.

""It is true that we are now a fully integrated company. We are India's largest oil and gas producer and the acquisition of (oil refiner) HPCL has extended our presence in the downstream industries.

""And so naturally, it now does not make sense for ONGC to hold stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC). But, we will wait for the right price,"" said the official.

ONGC, he said, got over Rs 3,000 crore in dividend income from investments in IOC and GAIL in 2017-18 financial year.

""This is a decent return on capital and can help me hold on to shares for long,"" he said. ""I am in no hurry to sell the stake. We will wait for the right price.""

ONGC's 13.77 per cent stake in IOC at Monday's closing price of Rs 153.80 apiece on BSE is worth over Rs 20,500 crore. Its 4.86 per cent stake in GAIL is worth close to Rs 4,200 crore at Monday's closing price of Rs 380.75.

""IOC shares were trading at around Rs 195 in January and are now at Rs 153-154. It doesn't make sense to sell the shares at such a big loss,” the official said.

ONGC, he said, is generating enough surplus mainly because of international oil prices spiking to four-year high and the rupee plummeting to an all-time low.

It is using these to pay off Rs 24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore.

A third of the loan has already been pre-paid, he said.

ONGC had borrowed Rs 24,881 crore on a short-term loan to fund buying of the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL. The remaining came from its cash reserves.

The official said the pace of repayment may slow down in the third and fourth quarters owing to outgo on taxes and dividend as also the fact that capital spending would peak by then.

Initially, ONGC considered selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to fund the acquisition, but it has never found the right price to offload the shares, he said.

The short-term loan ONGC availed had a provision to prepay without any penalty.

ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price. ONGC thus decided against the share sale.

ONGC's purchase of HPCL created India's first integrated oil company. This was ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout of 2017-18 after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 per cent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.

HPCL added 23.8 million tonne of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.

ONGC already is majority owner of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, which has a 15-million tonne refinery."

In a tweet, the group said Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Ltd (EOGEPL) ""commenced supply of CBM gas from its Raniganj East block (in West Bengal) to GAIL.""

EOGEPL had in August signed a 15-year contract to supply the block's entire gas production to GAIL, Essar tweeted.

Peak coal bed methane (CBM) production from Raniganj East block is envisaged at 2.3 million standard cubic metres per day.

Essar had in February this year sold its entire CBM production from the West Bengal block to GAIL using the same formula that Reliance Industries used for pricing of its CBM. The price comes to around USD 8 per million British thermal unit at the current oil price.

At the time of the signing of Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (GPSA) in August, EOGEPL had said it would be focussing on ramping up production from its existing 348 CBM wells and the 150 wells it intends to drill in the future in the block.

EOGEPL has already invested more than Rs 4,000 crore in the Raniganj East CBM block in drilling wells, setting up supply infrastructure, and laying customer pipelines to Durgapur and nearby industrial areas.

Mood was decidedly cautious ahead of the RBI policy meeting decision tomorrow.


What dampened market sentiment? Here are five factors.


Rupee at record low: A falling rupee weighed heavy on investor sentiment. The local currency plunged to its fresh record low of 73.77 against the dollar early Thursday. The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever. The dollar index stood tall against other currencies, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.

“Dollar dominated the last 24 hours as the rupee collapsed to a fresh all-time low on spot. Policymakers tried everything, monetary intervention, and verbal steroids and even tried to circulate rumours about an ""oil window"". Nothing worked. The RBI added fuel to fire by denying any attempts to introduce special dollar window for the oil marketing companies. Oil was on the boil, local equity and bond markets were under the hammer. If that was not enough, rising Italian credit spreads whacked the euro, further pressuring the rupee,” Kotak Securities said in a report.


Boiling oil: Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel in morning deals while WTI crude was above $76 per barrel. Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities, said, “Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.”


Rising bond yields: Hardening bond yields are creating waves of panic in the domestic equity market. India’s 10-year bond yield was hovering above 8.18 per cent on Thursday against previous close of 8.11 per cent. Bond yields have spiked 84 basis points on a year-to-date basis.


Foreign capital outflows: Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far. They sold shares worth Rs 1,488.96 crore in September. However, their net investment stood at Rs 262.72 crore in August, as per data available with depository NSDL. 

According to the data released by the NSE, FIIs were net sellers of Rs 2,056.87 crore in index futures and options segments, according to Wednesday’s data. FIIs were net sellers of index futures to the tune of Rs 699.54 crore and net sellers of index options worth Rs 1357.33 crore.

US Treasury yields reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note's yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs after economic data on Wednesday bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December and beyond.


Weak Asian cues: Subdued Asian markets spoiled market sentiment too. Japan's Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Thursday morning as investors took profit from its recent rally to a 27-year high while automakers and technology heavyweights took limelight on news of technology tie-ups for self-driving cars. Nikkei225 was trading 0.46 per cent down at 23,999 while Hang Seng came down over 1.50 per cent at 26,628.64."
24,2018-10-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market witnessed the biggest weekly decline in two years, as benchmarks Sensex and Nifty lurched sharply lower in Friday’s trade after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained status quo on repo rate in its fourth bimonthly policy review.

A plunging domestic currency and rising crude oil prices remained an overhang while dollar strength against its peers and firming bond yields in the US aggravated FII outflows. 

The 30-share Sensex plunged 792 points, or 2.25 per cent, to 34,377, with 27 stocks ending in the red. The Nifty50 closed 283 points, or 2.67 per cent, down at 10,316. Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, only eight managed to finish in the green.

Midcaps and smallcaps fell in sync with Sensex, declining up to 2.70 per cent. For the week, Sensex lost 1,850 points or 5.11 per cent, while Nifty shed 614 points or 5.62 per cent.

Rupee hits a new lifetime lowThe domestic currency breached the 74-mark for the first time. Sustained capital outflows amid surging US Treasury yields and firm crude oil prices racing mainly impacted forex market sentiment. At the time of writing this report, the rupee was trading 27 paise lower at 73.86.

14,2018-10-05,GAIL,"Brokerage firms downgraded oil marketing companies (OMCs) as the government announced a Rs 2.50 per litre cut in petrol and diesel prices as it reduced excise duty by Rs 1.50 a litre and asked oil companies to absorb another Re 1.

Price cut in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra would be Rs 5 after they matched the announcement with a similar reduction in local sales tax or VAT rates.

Reacting on the announcement, shares of OMCs extended their losses on Friday. Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) was trading 25 per cent down at Rs 247.65 while Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) lost 23 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively at Rs 166.60 and Rs 114.

Global brokerage firm CLSA maintained 'sell' on OMCs. It also slashed target price for IOC to Rs 105, from Rs 155 earlier. CLSA also lowered target price for BPCL and HPCL to Rs 240 and Rs 150, respectively, from Rs 390 and Rs 270 earlier.

“The government's move will bring down the EPS by 23-46 per cent. It also raised fears of return of subsidy regime if crude spikes further in upcoming elections. ONGC and GAIL may also be impacted, but these already build in risk,” CLSA said. 

Shares of ONGC and GAIL were also down 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, in early session.

JPMorgan added that the government’s policy step makes the entire Indian energy space uninvestable in the near term. “Earnings impact is manageable for IOC and BPCL. However, it is much larger for HPCL,” JPMorgan added. 

Motilal Oswal maintained ‘Buy’ on IOC and BPCL. However, it cut the target price for IOC and BPCL to Rs 164 (from Rs 254 earlier) and Rs 393 (from Rs 535). The brokerage firm downgraded HPCL to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy’ with a revised target price of Rs 203 (from Rs 428 previously).

“The announcement marks a U-turn from deregulation and raises possibility of return of the subsidy regime. The cut in marketing margins would result in 24-28 per cent cut in earnings per share (EPS), Motilal Oswal said.

Goldman Sachs too brought down IOC's target price to Rs 125 (from Rs 185 earlier) and downgraded BPCL and HPCL to ‘sell’. The global brokerage firm cut target price to Rs 260 (from Rs 470) for BPCL and Rs 170 (from Rs 345) for HPCL. 

“HPCL has the highest exposure to fuel retailing followed by BPCL and IOC. The move confirms reversal of de-regulation of fuel retail market,” Goldman Sachs stated."

The Nifty50 index opened in the negative and slipped towards the 10,250 mark amid continued selling pressure. It has been making lower highs and lower lows on the weekly scale and tanked around 1,500 points in last five weeks. It has formed a bearish candle on daily and weekly scales, which suggests the bears are holding a tight grip on the market. The index has formed a ‘Three Black Crows’ pattern on the daily scale as the bears are riding the decline. Nifty has seen the lowest weekly close in last 26 weeks.

As long as it holds below 10,500, the Nifty50 may continue to extend weakness towards 10,200 and the psychologically important 10,000 levels, while on the upside, the medium-term hurdle is shifting from 10,850 to 10,650 levels. As long as Nifty doesn’t surpass any immediate hurdle, the overall weak structure could limit the upside for the market.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,500 followed by 10,700 level, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,200 level. Significant Call writing was seen at 10,500, 10,600, 10,700 and 10,800 levels, while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. Put unwinding at 10,500 level could trigger more pressure to shift its band towards 10,200 mark. The options band signified a shift in lower trading range while the immediate hurdle is seen at 10,500 and 10,650 levels.

India VIX moved up 4.29 per cent to 19.73 level. Volatility is not cooling down, which is not giving any relief to the bulls. It suggests a tight bear grip on the market. India VIX surged 16 per cent this week and it has been moving upward from last three consecutive weeks.

Bank Nifty remained in a range in early hour of the session, but fell sharply after RBI’s policy outcome and corrected towards 24,250. It has been making lower top and lower bottom on the weekly scale, and approaching its March 2018 low of 23,600 mark. As long as it remains below 25,000, Bank Nifty could continue its weakness towards 24,000 and then 23,600 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 3.18 per cent at 10,293. Longs were seen in Titan, Infosys and TCS while shorts were seen in HPCL, IOC, BPCL, ONGC, Gail, Ashok Leyland and many more frontline and midcap stocks as the index gradually shifted lower.

25,2018-10-06,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Investors in oil marketing companies have lost Rs 1.39 lakh crore of wealth in the last two days after the government's decision to ask these firms to absorb a portion of the cut in excise duty on fuel prices. The move is perceived as the government backtracking on oil sector reforms, including free pricing of petrol and diesel.

Three oil marketing companies – Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil Corp – extended their losses on Friday, falling between 16 per cent and 25 per cent after several brokerages cut their target prices for shares of these companies by 20-50 per cent. They said OMCs would collectively lose Rs 6,500 crore in FY19 and Rs 13,700 crore in FY20 because of the government's move.

“We expect valuation multiple would go back to pre-de-regulation era as concern of higher subsidy burden would weigh on valuation being an election year,” said Sudeep Anand, an analyst at IDBI Capital. “Further, concern of subsidy sharing mechanism would weigh on upstream companies as well which would impact multiples in the near term”.

JP Morgan said that the government’s policy step makes the entire Indian energy space “uninvestable” in the near term.

CLSA maintained “sell' on OMCs. “The government’s move will bring down the EPS by 23-46 per cent. It also raised fears of return of subsidy regime if crude spikes further before the upcoming elections. ONGC and GAIL may also be impacted, but these already build in risk,” CLSA said in a note.

A Rs 1 per litre reduction in marketing margins on auto fuels, will impact FY20 EPS by 9-15 per cent, said analysts.

“We cut our FY20 EPS estimates for OMCs by 9-15 per cent factoring in lower marketing margins, higher crude prices with a weaker rupee and lower underlying refining margins,” said Tarun Lakhotia, an analyst at Kotak Securities. “In our view, the earnings estimates for OMCs lose significance now given the material sensitivity to modest changes in marketing margins, which becomes tough to predict in the current environment.”"

YES Bank back in the greenShares of YES Bank made a turnaround of sorts on Monday logging a 4 per cent loss on Friday, as the scrip jumped amid reports that the private lender has made some headway in its search for a new CEO. On Friday, the bank gave details of its search and selection committee to find a new chief executive after the RBI trimmed incumbent Rana Kapoor's term. YES Bank has named former IRDA chief TS Vijayan and former SBI chief OP Bhatt as external members in the search committee. The five-member panel will also consist of board members Brahm Dutt, Lt Gen (Retd) Mukesh Sabharwal and SC Kalia, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

29,2018-10-09,GAIL,"It is notable and significant that New Delhi and Moscow have agreed to step up co-operation for Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil field development projects. Russia is India’s largest investment destination in oil and gas, and the upside potential is considerable given the pressing need to boost usage of natural gas in our commercial energy mix.

The way forward is to explore stock market listing here of the Russia-India projects, so as to unlock shareholder value. Note that back in 2001, ONGC Videsh Ltd acquired 20% stake in the Sakhalin-I project in the Russian Far East from oil major Rosneft. OVL has lately upped its stake in the promising Vankor field, which is the largest oil asset to be discovered in Russia in the last twenty-five years, and then brought to production. And ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of OVL. Meanwhile, gas utility Gail has lately begun 2.5 MT of annual LNG imports from Gazprom.

The fact of the matter is that natural gas accounts for a lowly 9% or so in India’s commercial energy mix, and the way ahead is to boost LNG imports to shore up gas supplies. We also need gas hubs and scope for regular price discovery.

Gas is not just the cleanest fossil fuel but also the most efficient for meeting peaking power demand going forward. And as India sustains its growth momentum, the demand for power during the hours of peak-load is bound to increase."

Let’s walk you through the highlights of Thursday's session:

Rupee inched near 74.50The rupee inched closer to the 74.50 mark against dollar amid buying in American currency by banks and exporters. The US Federal Reserve’s apparent determination to increase interest rates over the next 12 months has driven up US Treasury yields, which have been further bolstered by good economic data. However, rupee recovered a little as trade progressed. At the time of writing of this report, the domestic currency traded at 74.10, down by 11 paise. 


Who dragged my SensexAll but three stocks -- ONGC, YES Bank and Hindustan Unilever -- suffered losses in the Sensex pack.

34,2018-10-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) were trading with decent gains in Friday's session amid a slight fall in global crude oil prices. 

Oil prices steadied on Friday after a market rout driven by sharp falls in equity markets and indications that supply concerns have been overblown, but were still on track for a fall or more than 4 per cent for the week, Reuters reported. 

The BSE Oil & Gas index was trading 1.95 per cent up at 13,131 around 09:35 am with all components in the green zone. 

Besides a slight slump in global crude prices, media reports that the government may not push oil companies to share increased subsidy burden set the mood for the OMCs. 

Shares of Indraprastha Gas (up 4.44 per cent) and HPCL (up 4.01 per cent) were the top gainers in the index.

Reliance Industries (RIL) (up 2.69 per cent), Indian Oil Corporation (up 2.60 per cent), Castrol India (up 1.88 per cent) and BPCL (up 1.65 per cent) also rose significantly.

Domestic equity market benchmark Sensex jumped nearly 500 points during early deals while the NSE counterpart Nifty breached 10,350 in the wake of a decent rise in rupee and an ebb in the global crude oil prices. 

The rupee opened 33 paise up at 73.80 against the dollar on account of some selling of the American currency by banks and exporters. 

A fresh spell of buying emerged across sectors, led by finance, metal and oil & gas.

35,2018-10-14,GAIL,"After surviving the recent lows in Thursday’s trade and managing to keep its head above the 10,180-10,250 zone, the Nifty50 continued its pullback in Friday’s session. The market saw a positive opening and during the session, it went on to further strengthen itself.

The surge was secular, as all sectoral indices, barring IT, ended the day with gains. The benchmark index ended the day 237.85 points, or 2.32 per cent, higher.



As we step into a new week, we expect a positive start to Monday’s trade. Nifty has managed to move past its important pattern resistance level at 10,400. With a positive start to trade, we expect the market to continue its pullback. In the event of any consolidation, the 10,400 level is expected to offer good support to Nifty.

The 10,510 and 10,575 levels are likely to act as potential resistance area for Nifty50. Supports are expected to come in at 10,400 and 10,330 levels.

The RSI on the daily chart stood at 36.8266 and it remained neutral showing no divergence against price. The daily MACD remains bearish as it trades below its signal line. It is seen flattening its trajectory. A white-body occurred on the candles. The market has bounced back from its support area and shown signs of a potential bottom formation for the immediate short term.

Friday’s bounce has come on the back of sharp short covering and there are enough signs that the market is in the process of marking and confirming its near-term bottom. In Monday’s trade and in subsequent sessions, it would be important to see that the short covering is accompanied by buying at lower levels.

In any case, Nifty must maintain itself above the 10,400 mark to continue with its upward move. In the event of any consolidation from higher level, the 10,400 mark will be important to watch. Any dip below this mark will again infuse some weakness in the market.

Overall, we continue to recommend making select purchases at lower levels. It is also advised to remain highly selective and rotate sectors effectively.


Stocks to watch:
On Friday, short covering was seen in PNB, ITC, Jindal Steel, Hindalco, HCC, Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, BPCL, IDBI, Dabur, Vedanta, Federal Bank, Gail, HDFC and Tata Motors.

44,2018-10-22,GAIL,"Engineers India, a Navratna central public sector enterprise, has developed unmatched expertise in design, engineering and implementation in the oil and gas segment and is already a market leader in the domestic space. 

Engineers India has been able to maintain decent growth rates in the past, despite weak crude oil prices in the past two years and consequent deferral of capex spending by its key customers. And now the situation has turned in favour of Engineers India due to high crude oil prices. Most oil and gas projects will be revived, boosting Engineers India’s growth prospects.

Continued revenue visibility is another factor that is attracting analysts to this counter. With a strong order book of Rs 7,200 crore, the revenue visibility is clear for the next several quarters. As mentioned earlier, its order inflow is expected to pick up now.

Engineers India got new orders worth Rs 1,700 crore in 2017-18 and is expected to get orders between Rs 7,000 and Rs 8,000 crore during 2018-19 and 2019-20. The company is benefitting from its Navratna status and most of these new orders will be from PSU oil refining and marketing companies such as HPCL (Barmer Greenfield project), GAIL (Kakinada petrochemical project), capacity expansions in BPCL’s Numaligarh refinery and IOC’s Koyali and Mathura refineries.

While Engineers India is expected to report strong revenue growth in the coming years—compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is expected to be around 25%—its margin will come down due to a shift in its order mix from high-margin consultancy (53% of order book) to low-margin turnkey projects (47% of order book).

However, increased turnkey orders and revenue from this segment—revenue rose 4-times in the first quarter of 2018-19, helping the company clock overall revenue growth of 53%, y-o-y is helping Engineers India show decent growth in net profit. The company’s net profit is expected to grow at CAGR of 15% between 2017-18 and 2019-20.

Consistent dividend payout track record—usually above 50% and it was 67% in 2017-18—is another positive factor for this counter. Since Engineers India has a strong balance sheet—no debt and cash balance of Rs 2,500 crore—it will be also in a position to come out with buy backs or special dividends.

45,2018-10-22,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Korea’s state power utility has begun arbitration proceedings against India for not honouring fuel supply commitment to its gas-based power plant in Maharashtra. Korea Western Power Company (Kowepo) owns 40% in Pioneer Gas Power Limited (PGPL) that operates a 388 Mw project in Raigad district.

Kowepo is protected under India-Korea bilateral investment treaty (BIT) and Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and it has sought resolution of issues surrounding its project in six months or $400-million compensation for loss and damages.

If the issues remain unresolved after six months, Kowepo will commence international arbitration proceedings under India-Korea BIT and CEPA, a government official said quoting the notice.

An email sent on Thursday by ET to Pioneer Gas Power Plant remained unanswered.



Kowepo is a subsidiary of Korea Electric Power Corp, the largest electric utility of Korea and a listed company owned by that government. The Korean government has given its consent to invoke arbitration proceedings under bilateral investment treaties and CEPA, the official said.

The notice of dispute and consultations under the promotion and protection agreements and the CEPA between Korea and India has been sent to PMO, Cabinet Secretariat, Ministries of Finance, Commerce, Oil & Gas and Power.

Kowepo, with six power plants totaling 11780-Mw coal and gas power units in Korea — which is 10% of the country’s total installed capacity, invested close to Rs 350 crore in the power plant in 2012. The project has been set up at a total investment of close to Rs 1,900 crore.

Kowepo has said its investment decision on the power plant was based on the then legal and policy framework in India as well as statements and notifications made by the central and Maharashtra governments and entities such as Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), power and petroleum ministries, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Gas Authority of India, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) and standing parliamentary committee reports which painted a rosy picture of Indian natural gas sector and called for investments through their public statements.

An empowered group of ministers (EGoM) on natural gas had identified gas-based power generation as one of the priority core sectors for domestic gas utilisation. This was substantiated by the 12th Five-Year Plan, reports of CEA and disclosures by entities developing KG-D6 and DGH. PGPL signed gas transmission contract with GAIL in 2011 and participated in CEA process seeking 1.75 mmscmd gas allocation.

In the notice, Kowepo said, the government continued to dispel the doubts on KG-D6 production shortfall as temporary issues; the EGOM maintained core status to gas-fired power projects and CEA continued evaluation. In August 2013, EGoM removed gas-based generation from priority list and gave it to fertiliser. The company has also contested government’s decision to make gas available to PSUs such as NTPC and Maharashtra government’s move to cancel power purchase agreement to offtake 50% power, while nearly doubling the cross subsidy charges.

Kowepo has said it could not participate in the government’s scheme for stranded gas based plants as GAIL did not complete its pipeline."

To bring in some perspective, the said quarter was also marked by heightened volatility over the IL&FS default crisis. 

LIC, which holds stake in over 320 companies, was seen reshuffling its portfolio heavily in financials, healthcare, oil & gas, chemical and information technology sectors, shareholding data for the September quarter suggests. 

Close to 30 companies caught LIC's fancy during the quarter gone by. The insurance behemoth raised its stake in auto majors Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki to 6.45 per cent and 6.55 per cent, respectively, from 6.40 per cent and 5.76 per cent in the preceding June quarter. 

LIC also upped exposure in TVS Motor to 1.75 per cent from 1.12 per cent during the same period. However, it offloaded some shares in Bajaj Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra, according to data available with ACE Equity till October 23. 

BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty plunged over 6 per cent in September even though for the quarter both the indices gained around 2 per cent.

50,2018-10-28,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (RNAM) has filed draft papers with capital markets watchdog Sebi for the fourth tranche of CPSE Exchange Traded Fund.

CPSE ETF, which functions like a mutual fund scheme, comprises scrips of 10 PSUs -- ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Gail India, Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.

The fund-raising will help the government inch towards Rs 80,000-crore disinvestment target for the current fiscal. It has mopped up over Rs 9,000 crore so far.

As per draft documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), RNAM has applied for the third FFO (Further Fund offer) of the Central Public Sector Enterprises, Exchange Traded Fund or CPSE ETF.

The government has already appointed ICICI Securities as the advisor for the fourth tranche of CPSE ETF.

The advisor would be required to advise the government in all aspects of launching of the proposed follow on fund offer or tap or tranche of the CPSE ETF scheme/index.

The first tranche of CPSE ETF was managed by Goldman Sachs MF, which was then acquired by RNAM in October 2015. The finance ministry later gave nod for transfer of management of CPSE ETF to RNAM.

It offered relief to investors who were nervous about liquidity crunch in the market after defaults at a major infrastructure financing company.

Improved global cues, easing crude oil prices and hopes of better earnings provided further impetus to the market. Sensex settled 718 points, or 2.15 per cent, higher at 34,067, while Nifty closed at 10,250 with a gain of 221 points, or 2.20 per cent.

In the Sensex kitty, only seven stocks - IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC and NTPC - failed to gain from the rally. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 2.80 per cent and 2.06 per cent, respectively, in sync with benchmark Sensex. 

Let's walk you through the key highlights of the session:


Investors made Rs 3 lakh cr in a dayMonday’s rally added over Rs 3.10 lakh crore to equity investor wealth as the collective market capitalisation of BSE listed firms shot up to Rs 1,36,42,360.50 from Rs 1,33,31,977.38. 


Who moved my SensexICICI Bank contributed the most to the Sensex rally by surging 11 per cent to Rs 349.15. The stock jumped after the private lender beat Street estimates in September quarter earnings, posting a 55.84 per cent year-on-year drop in standalone profit at Rs 908.88 crore. Analysts in an ET Now poll had estimated the profit figure at Rs 815 crore. Among others State Bank of India (up 8.04 per cent), Adani Ports (up 7.33 per cent), Larsen & Toubro (up 5.25 per cent), Axis Bank (up 4.96 per cent) and Reliance Industries (up 4.14 per cent) clocked strong gains. 


Earnings, fund raising plan boost Tata PowerTata Power reported an 85.11 per cent jump in consolidated profit for September quarter at Rs 393.36 crore. The company had reported a Rs 212.5 crore profit for the corresponding quarter last year. The stock closed with a strong gain of 12.40 per cent at Rs 77.50 on BSE. Meanwhile, in a BSE filing, the company said its board has approved the plan to raise up to Rs 5,500 crore through issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on a private placement basis. 


Vijaya Bank rose despite subdued Q2 earningsShares of Vijaya Bank jumped 7.02 per cent to Rs 43.45 despite having reported a 24.54 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 139.94 crore for the second quarter. The bank had registered a net profit of Rs 185.46 crore for the corresponding quarter last year. 


IndusInd Bank at 52-week lowThe stock plunged 4.78 per cent to Rs 1,376, its 52-week low on BSE and stock broke below the support at Rs 1,420, which is the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from February 29, 2016 low.

Sectors that made merryAmong the sectoral indices on BSE, the healthcare index surged 4.21 per cent, leading its peers. Realty, capital goods, bank, industrials and energy indices jumped over 3 per cent on BSE.

Technical outlookNifty50 made a smart rebound to settle above 10,250 mark today, forming a long bullish candle on the daily chart. The index needs to take out 10,290 level to instil confidence in the market. There is a possibility that the index can form an ‘Expanded Flat’ structure, in which case the pullback can stretch higher, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan. 

Alternatively, Nifty can take form of a Wedge pattern. “In that case the market can continue to be volatile with overall downward bias. From short-to-medium term perspective, the weight of evidence is still in favour of the bears with the possibility for Nifty to tumble back to 10,000-9,952,” the expert said. 


Global sentiment improvedAfter recent drubbings, global stocks improved on Monday as reports of positive earnings and Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign rating unchanged boosted sentiment.

51,2018-10-29,GAIL,"Natural gas sales contracts are becoming relatively easier for buyers as state-run GAIL, the key gas supplier in the country, is now offering shorter-tenure contracts and easier terms.

Gas supply contracts are usually long term and contain take-or-pay provision that mandates a buyer to offtake pre-agreed quantity or pay for a minimum quantity even if it lifts less in a year.

GAIL, the biggest gas marketer in the country, sources a significant share of its gas portfolio from overseas. For years, it entered into long-term, take-orpay liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with suppliers overseas and covered itself back-to-back by signing similar contracts with domestic gas users. But the nature of its domestic contracts is now altering.


Agencies
It is now offering contract for less than five years and has eased take-orpay obligations for customers, a GAIL executive said.

In the past, a buyer had to pay for 90% of the contracted volume even if it lifted less in a year but now this is down to 80%, the executive said, adding that the new contracts offered more flexibility. But new terms also mean increased risk for GAIL.

GAIL is offering customers the choice to have their gas prices half-linked to Henry-Hub and half to crude oil. It also offers to hedge prices so that customers escape volatility. “Nobody wants a long-term deal. We are also not insisting. We understand that it’s difficult for smaller customers to take a bet on price or even their own long-term business prospects,” the executive said. “If they default five years later, then it will be a problem for us as well.”

Some of the GAIL’s smaller customers have in the past complained that the take-or-pay provision tilted the scale in favour of supplier. Last year, the Competition Commission of India began an investigation into seven cases where small industrial customers had alleged abuse of dominance by GAIL especially with respect to the way the company imposed take-or-pay liability on them in 2015.

The crude oil collapse of 2014, which brought down gas prices with it, also forced a new thinking at GAIL. “We have learnt our lessons from the 2014 crash,” said the executive. “In 2014, several customers, including big ones, defaulted. We realised we need a way to handle that.”

The rates of natural gas, which are mostly linked to crude oil, had crashed in the spot market in 2014, prompting many customers to refuse expensive gas supplied under term deal by GAIL. Prices under a term deal were linked to trailing five-year average of crude oil and appeared far expensive than in the spot market. Since GAIL’s customers were refusing delivery, GAIL too couldn’t have in turn accepted supplies from the seller, Qatar’s Rasgas. The deal was finally renegotiated."

56,2018-10-30,GAIL,"BENGALURU: An underground gas pipeline was damaged when metro construction workers were drilling the ITPL main road and this led to panic and disruption of traffic early on Monday morning.

The leaking gas made a loud noise and left a bad odour in and around Garudachar Palya and Mahadevapura. As a precautionary measure, the police barred the entry of vehicles between the Hoodi Junction and KR Puram for two hours from 7.30 am. This resulted in heavy traffic congestion.

The GAIL pipeline was attended to by its fire safety team even as the fire brigade rushed to the spot. “The underground natural gas steel pipeline of eight-inch diameter got punctured due to metro work. The natural gas pipeline has been laid as per safety standards and prescribed norms. Necessary civic permission is required for undertaking construction work by any agency but no permission was taken by Bengaluru Metro,” said an official statement from GAIL.

On a complaint from GAIL, the Mahadevapura police booked the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) and its contractor ITD Cementation India under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, Section 49 (Punishment for willful damages to common carrier or contract carrier) and Section 50 (Offences by companies) and IPC section 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible material) and 427 (Mischief causing damage).

BMRCL’s managing director Ajay Seth admitted that no permission was sought from GAIL as the utility was not aware of the existence of a gas pipeline on the stretch. “We conduct a detection test before starting underground work. The test did not show the gas pipeline,” he said. Seth said that BMRCL would be seeking a map of the gas pipeline network from GAIL and would superimpose it on the metro alignment to ensure that such mistakes do not repeat."
57,2018-10-31,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks regsitered positive openings on Wednesday, with Sensex rising over 150 points and Nifty touching 10,240 amid positive Asian cues.

But, market turned flat soon as news of aggravating tussle between the government and RBI soured the mood. 

The NSE Nifty index was trading 49 points down at 10,150, while the BSE Sensex was down 159 points at 33,732 around 10:05 am.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap were 0.66 per cent and 0.52 per cent up, respectively, at that time. 

The ongoing turf war between the government and the central bank seems to have taken a wrong turn now which may deal a severe blow to the market that is already reeling under pressure from myriad factors, including concerns around trade war and propects of weak economic growth.

0,2018-11-17,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL have bought majority of natural gas from Reliance Industries' newer fields in the KG-D6 block at an indicative price of USD 5.04 - 5.16 per unit, industry sources said.

Essar Steel picked up 2.25 million standard cubic meters per day or about half of the available volumes in the day long auction conducted on November 15.

Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and GAIL bought 0.3 mmscmd each, sources said.

Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) bought 0.35 mmscmd and the remaining 0.10 mmscmd went to GSFC/GNFC.

Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK had sought bids from potential users for the 5 mmsmcd of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from mid-2020.

Bidders were asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.

Sources said Reliance had set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.

In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.4 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translates into a price of between USD 5.04 per million British termal unit and USD 5.16 per mmBtu rate at Brent oil price of USD 60 per barrel.

Sources said while bankruptcy-hit Essar bought gas to feed its steel plants, other buyers including Adani Group picked up the volumes for their city gas operations of retailing CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.

The volumes are mostly planned for usage in western India particularly in Gujarat where the gas can be delivered through a single pipeline - East-West pipeline. The delivered price in Gujarat is likely to be around USD 6.50 per mmBtu, they said.

Initially, Reliance had set a floor of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of USD 5.4 per mmBtu at USD 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around USD 4 per mmBtu rate currently.

To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.

The company did not immediately respond to an email sent for comments.

According to the bid document, the gas price will be subject to the ceiling price mandated by the government. The ceiling price for gas from difficult fields such as those in deep-sea currently is USD 8.43 per mmBtu.

The government-mandated rate for other fields currently is $3.23 per mmBtu.

Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022.

R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from mid-2021, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in second half of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.

Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.

While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.68 mmscmd in the July-September.

Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.

Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake in the block."

7,2018-11-18,GAIL,"State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and GAIL India will pay Adani Group 5 per cent more in hiring charges for using the private firm's upcoming LNG import facility at Dhamra in Odisha than their own similar terminal, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.

India's largest oil firm IOC, which recently commissioned a 5 million tonne liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Ennore in Tamil Nadu, as well as gas utility GAIL have ""both technical and financial capability to develop their own LNG terminal,"" he told the Lok Sabha.

The two firms have, however, hired capacity in Adani's under-construction LNG import terminal at Dhamra.

IOC had in 2015 signed to use up to 60 per cent of the terminal's capacity for importing gas for its refineries at Haldia in West Bengal and Paradip in Odisha. GAIL too had signed up for 1.5 million tonne of the terminal's regasification capacity.

""GAIL and IOC have agreed to pay the tolling charge of Rs 60.18 per million British thermal unit for the regasification facility at Dhamra LNG terminal with annual escalations in line with their respective contractual provisions,"" he said in a written reply to a question.

This charge compares to Rs 57.38 per mmBtu regasification charges for Ennore LNG terminal, he said.

GAIL's own Dhabhol LNG terminal in Maharashtra levies Rs 49.28 per mmBtu regasification charge. In addition, there are other charges such as terminal charges, vessel-related charges and port charges for utilization of the Dabhol LNG terminal.

""The regasification charges for Ennore and Dhamra terminals are inclusive of terminal charges, vessel-related charges, port charges, and any other port-related charges,"" Pradhan said.

Originally, IOC and GAIL had on September 21, 2016, signed a 'non-binding' agreement to buy 50 per cent stake in Adani Group's Rs 5,500-crore Dhamra LNG project in Odisha. But that agreement expired on September 20, 2018, without being translated into a firm pact apparently because of differences over valuation.

""It has been informed that the regasification charge for Dhamra terminal is Rs 60.18 per mmBtu for the first contract year (year of commissioning) which is likely to be in FY 2021-22,"" Pradhan said.

""GAIL has executed a Tolling Agreement in line with its procedures to meet the supply commitments of customers located in the eastern parts of the country along JagdishpurHaldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline (JHBDPL) project. IOC has also booked capacity at Dhamra Terminal after considering its captive requirement of Paradip, Haldia and Barauni refineries.""

He said the booking of regas capacity is being done after ""protracted techno-commercial discussions with the promoters of Dhamra LNG Terminal and after considering the location of the terminal, availability of gas evacuation pipelines, affordability of regasification charges and capturable demand in the catchment area.""

The September 21, 2016 ""non-binding MoU"" followed GAIL dropping plans in March 2015 to set up a floating LNG import terminal at Paradip. IOC too had in 2012 signed an MoU with Dhamra LNG Port Corp Ltd (DPCL) to develop an LNG terminal at the port.

Also, Petronet LNG - a firm in which GAIL and IOC are promoters, had shelved plans to set up a 5 million tonne a year LNG import facility at Gangavaram in Andhra Pradesh.

After shelving their respective plans, IOC and GAIL signed a pact with Dhamra LNG Terminal, a firm owned by Adani Group.

""GAIL and IOC have both technical and financial capability to develop their own LNG terminal,"" Pradhan said. ""GAIL has an equity stake in Konkan LNG Pvt Ltd and is the owner's engineer as well as the operator of this terminal at Dabhol. IOC has recently commissioned a 5 million tonne LNG terminal through a joint venture at Ennore in March 2019.""

The two firms also have an equity stake in Petronet LNG which operates two LNG regas terminals, one at Dahej in Gujarat and the other at Kochi in Kerala, he added."
1,2018-11-18,GAIL,"New Delhi: Essar Steel and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) won two-thirds of the natural gas Reliance Industries offered in an auction, where winning bids were $5.3-5.4 a unit, people familiar with the matter said.

Reliance-BP offered 5 million metric standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) it plans to produce from April next year at its R-cluster field in KG-D6 block. About half a dozen companies participated in the e-auction on Friday. Reliance did not respond to ET’s emailed query.

Essar Steel is learnt to have won 2.25 mmscmd, while GSPC got 1.2 mmscmd. State-run Hindustan Petroleum is believed to have won 0.35 mmscmd, while Adani, Mahanagar Gas and GAIL won 0.3 mmscmd each, according to the people. Gujarat State Fertilizer Corp is also said to have won 0.10 mmscmd.

Essar Steel, which has been in news lately for its bankruptcy, will likely use the gas in its plant, while Adani and Mahanagar may feed it into their city gas network.

RIL-BP sold all the gas offered. The duration of supply could not be ascertained. Buyers had the option to bid for a supply period of two to six years.

Bidders were expected to quote a price as a percentage of dated Brent crude. The minimum they could quote was 8.4%. Bidders ended up quoting between 8.4% and 8.6%, the people said.

This translates into a price range of $5.29 to $5.41 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) at the current rate of $63 per barrel for dated Brent. Prices will vary during the period of supply as the dated Brent is defined as the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract months in which the gas supply is made.

After including the pipeline tariff, the delivered cost of gas would be about $6.5 for buyers, most of which are in Gujarat. Reliance-BP have the marketing and pricing freedom for all the gas they produce from the Rcluster field. The prices, however, cannot exceed the government-set ceiling for the gas from difficult fields, which is currently $8.43 per unit.

Prices during the RIL-BP’s gas auction were influenced by a collapse in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market and an expected rise in supply from domestic sources over the next few years.

This meant the auction ended up with rates that were close to the floor price set by the producer. ONGC is also auctioning 0.75 mmscmd on November 19."

8,2018-11-19,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is seeking legal opinion on the wider impact of the Supreme Court’s order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), including whether it is applicable on a larger group of non-telecom companies holding telecom licences, and if so, the process to be adopted to raise demands from them for its dues.

“We are taking a legal opinion on the order’s wider ambit… we will actively work on the matter as legally advised after the telcos’ issue is addressed,” an official said.

Lawyers say that several companies — including GAIL, Power Grid Corporation, Delhi Metro, RailTel, among others — that are non-telcos but hold telecom licences to provide a range of offering such as internet services, national and international long-distance services and VSAT services, could fall under the DoT’s wider licence fee ambit. This, after the Supreme Court, in its order, equated gross revenue — for arriving at AGR — with “total revenue of licensee company”. Further, the court held that revenue arising out of non-telecom activities, with certain exceptions, will have to be included in gross revenue.

The official added that clarity is needed since there is ambiguity on the wider impact of the judgment. “Some companies likely to have been impacted by the judgment might not even know that DoT may raise demands and issue notices,” he said.

A second official said the government is dealing with a peculiar situation where even public sector units with telecom licences could be staring at huge liabilities. “This could be a case of revenue going from one pocket of the government to another,” he said and added that individual companies were assessing the situation and would work with their administrative ministries to resolve this matter. One particular option would be to take cabinet exemptions for such cases.

The DoT last week issued notices to mobile companies and internet service providers (ISPs) to compute and pay the amount that they now owe the government on account of the Supreme Court verdict.



The apex court has mandated that the dues be paid up within three months of the October 24 order. Telcos are staring at licence fee, penalty and interest dues of nearly Rs 93,000 crore, as per DoT’s submissions to the apex court, but are seeking relief. Including spectrum usage charges, the dues go up to over Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

Industry estimates similar dues on non-telecom companies may amount to nearly ?2.28 lakh crore, if calculated since the time of getting their respective licences. These companies till now have been paying miniscule amounts as licence fee, if at all, to the DoT.

Government officials expect the non-telecom companies too to seek a clarification on the SC order’s ambit. The DoT has already ordered its nodal bodies to issue notices to ISPs, along with telcos and virtual network operators.

A senior official of association representing ISPs in India, warned that if the ambit of the judgment were to be widened, the impact could run into a much higher figure. “If it includes everyone, then there’s no end to who may be asked to pay and how much. Many of the licence holders under ISP category were not legally obliged to pay any licence fee before 2014, but now they may have to,” he added."
9,2018-11-19,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is well within its rights to waive penalty and interest on dues that telecom companies owe following the Supreme Court ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), senior advocate Harish Salve said in a legal opinion to Bharti Airtel.

If the government is of the view that burdening the telcos with immediate recovery of arrears will result in impairing their operations and that a larger public interest will be served by revisiting the imposition of penalty and high interest rates, “there is nothing in the judgment of the Supreme Court that would prevent the government from acting appropriately”, Salve said in his legal opinion which has been annexed in an Airtel letter to communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, also marked to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

He said the government could also allow more time for payment of the principal amount of the shortfall.

Salve’s legal opinion on the SC order that backed the government stand on including non-core items of revenue while computing AGR, were cited by Bharti Airtel in the November 18 letter, a copy of which was also marked to principal secretary to the PM, PK Mishra, and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba. Gauba is heading a panel of top officials set up to suggest ways to restore the sector’s health.

Salve added that Bharti Airtel would be “well advised” to approach the government to make out a case to revisit the imposition of penalty in the larger grounds of public interest.

Referring to the inclusion of components such as trade discounts, discounts on prepaid tariffs and forex fluctuations in the computation of AGR, Salve in his legal opinion said that in the past, the telecom tribunal headed by a retired judge had held that the demands of the government were “illegal”. He added that the tribunal examined 13 heads of income and held that most of them could not be included in AGR.

The legal opinion of retired Supreme Court judge, Justice AK Sikri, were also annexed in Airtel’s letter to the government.



Sikri backed Salve’s legal opinion and was cited in the letter as saying, “This would demonstrate that the dispute raised by the TSPs (telecom service providers) was not frivolous. It cannot be said that the view of the Supreme Court in this case is the only possible view or that the view of the tribunal is totally absurd. In my view, no case for penalty was made out.”

Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the telcos worst affected by the order, are expected to file review petitions this week. They have appealed to the government for relief.

Airtel faces licence fee, spectrum usage charge, interest and penalty dues of over Rs 41,000 crore and has sought a waiver of penalty and interest, which together contribute to almost 75% of its estimated liabilities.

Airtel also wants interest to be levied only from the date of the AGR judgment and a 16-year payment period for the dues after a moratorium of two years. It said if interest must be levied, it must be at rates of government securities plus a small spread, say 1%, to compensate the government for notional loss of interest. It has even proposed keeping SUC outside the ambit of the demands because it was not part of the SC order.

It said companies such as Power Grid Corporation of India, GAIL and RailTel, which possess telecom licences to offer internet and national long-distance services, should be treated at par with telcos. According to Airtel’s estimates, these non-telecom companies would be liable to pay the government close to Rs2.27 lakh crore in dues after the SC’s order.

The company said failure to provide relief would allow for a “possible bankruptcy” of licensee companies and the loss of millions of direct and indirect jobs. It also predicted there would be bad loans for Indian banks running into a few lakh crore rupees and a ripple effect on vendors, retailers, kirana shops and related services like advertising and transportation, which could again lead to the collapse of more companies."

11,2018-11-20,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: GAIL and the downstream regulator are headed for a clash after the latter cancelled the state-run firm’s sole bid to lay a Rs 1,500-crore pipeline in Rajasthan citing unviably high tariff, and launched in its place the bidding process for another pipeline with altered route, according to people familiar with the matter.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) said on November 6 that it had cancelled the bid process for Langtala-Jodhpur-Bhilwara pipeline “as the tariff quoted by GAIL (India) Ltd (as a sole bidder) was found to be excessively high, impacting the viability of the gas itself.” That very day, the board also invited bids for laying a new gas pipeline on altered route from Langtala to Pali via Jodhpur.

This has upset GAIL, which feels the ‘excessively high tariff ’ and ‘viability of the gas’ are subjective considerations and can’t become ground for cancellation of bid under the current regulatory framework, according to sources close to the company. GAIL may soon request PNGRB to review the decision that it considers unfair, sources said.

But sources close to PNGRB have rejected the charge, saying the regulator has acted as per the law and GAIL was free to challenge it in court. PNGRB can’t allow GAIL to ‘squeeze the market’ and hurt the development of domestic gas market, sources close to the regulator said.

GAIL defends the high tariff, saying it was due to higher risk perception in the project, sources close to the company said. The pipeline was supposed to evacuate gas only from Focus Energy’s block in Langtala, Rajasthan and if the actual production from this were to fall short of expectation, as has happened in some upstream gas projects in the past, the proposed pipeline would end up with much less business than anticipated, they said, adding that higher tariff could have let company recover cost quickly.



Yet if the PNGRB felt that the proposed tariff was too high, it should have formally approached GAIL and discussed the possibility of cutting it to acceptable levels, they said. However, sources close to PNGRB said the regulator had held discussions with some senior GAIL executives before cancelling the bid.

PNGRB’s suo motu move to seek bids for a pipeline with altered route without holding public consultation as is necessary under the regulations is questionable, sources close to GAIL said.

The new pipeline will connect at Pali with the proposed Mehsana-Bhatinda pipeline, being built by a joint venture led by Gujarat State Petronet Ltd, a subsidiary of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC). Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL are other shareholders in the joint venture. Mehsana-Bhatinda pipeline, authorised by PNGRB in 2011, has been delayed for years.

GAIL and PNGRB didn’t respond to ET’s request for comment. A GSPC official said the first phase of Mehsana-Bhatinda pipeline has been completed and the second phase of 950 km will be completed by October 2020. He further said the pipeline is interconnected with GSPC’s Gujarat pipeline network at Palanpur in Gujarat. Sources close to GAIL say the project would take more time.

By proposing to connect a new pipeline with one that has not been completed many years after the project was awarded, the regulator is introducing uncertainty, which would help neither the producer nor consumers, sources close to GAIL said.

The cancelled-pipeline proposed to connect to GAIL’s operational Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline, connecting the producer with a very wide base of consumers from all sectors, sources close to GAIL said."

14,2018-11-20,GAIL,"Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday said it has assigned a 'Baa1' rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Oil and Natural Gas Corp under its $2 billion medium-term note program. The outlook on the rating is negative, Moody's said in a statement. 

 ""The notes' rating is in line with ONGC's Baa1 issuer rating, which is in turn primarily driven by its standalone credit profile as captured by the company's baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA),"" says Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President. 

 The rating reflects ONGC's position as the largest integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity as also its substantial operating cash flow generation capacity. 

 It also factors the firm's solid credit metrics that have improved but remain constrained by volatile - although range-bound - oil prices and high shareholder returns. 

 At the same time, Moody's expected that ONGC will not be asked to share fuel subsidies, as long as oil prices stay below $70 per barrel. 

 ""ONGC's issuer rating also incorporates the company's high likelihood of extraordinary support from and very high dependence on the Government of India, in times of need. However, this assumption of government support has not resulted in any rating uplift, as the sovereign's rating is below ONGC's BCA,"" it said. 

 Given ONGC's strong credit metrics and status as a government-owned company, it enjoys strong access to debt capital markets and has substantial financial flexibility through equity stakes in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL India, which together were valued at about Rs 21,000 crore as on November 14, 2019. 

 Moody's ratings for ONGC are based on the full consolidation of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) which includes the full consolidation of HPCL's 49 per cent-owned joint venture, HPCL-Mittal Energy. 

 The government owns 62.98 per cent of ONGC's equity and has the ability to appoint all of its board of directors. 

 ""The negative outlook on ONGC is in line with the negative outlook on the Government of India's rating and reflects Moody's view that ONGC's ratings will be downgraded if India's sovereign rating is downgraded to Baa3 from Baa2,"" Moody's said. 

 ""Given the negative outlook, an upgrade is unlikely. The outlook will return to stable if the outlook on the sovereign rating moves to stable."" 

 ONGC's ratings may experience downward pressure if the sovereign rating is downgraded, ONGC increases its pace of acquisitions such that it results in higher business risk and a deterioration in its credit metrics, or oil prices decline on a sustained basis resulting in weak cash flow generation and a deterioration in ONGC's credit metrics, it added."
22,2018-11-21,GAIL,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday hinted that public sector firms such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) may not be allowed to bid for buying government stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), for which a buyer may have to shell out as much as Rs 90,000 crore.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had on Wednesday decided to sell the government's entire stake in the country's second-largest state refiner BPCL and India's largest shipping company Shipping Corporation of India (SCI). It also approved privatisation of Container Corporation of India while also giving nod to paring stake below 51 per cent in select public sector undertakings but without losing control.

""Since 2014, we have a clear vision that the government has no business to be in business,"" Pradhan told reporters here. ""We have examples of 2-3 sectors such as telecom and aviation where ushering in private participation has led to customers benefiting from price cuts, efficiency, and better service. And yesterday (on Wednesday), several reformist decisions were taken.""

BPCL will give buyers ready access to 14 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and about one-fourth of the fuel marketing infrastructure in the world's fastest-growing energy market.

It, however, will be sold after carving out Numaligarh Refinery from its portfolio and given to a pubic sector unit.

""Numaligarh refinery was set up as per Assam Accord and it will remain a public sector unit. Assam Chief Minister had requested Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) to retain public sector character of Numaligarh Refinery and that has been accepted,"" he said.

Pradhan, however, did not say if IOC or Oil India Ltd, which already has a stake in the refinery and also supplies crude oil to it, will take over the unit.

""The details have to be worked out,"" he said. ""Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) has stated that the privatisation of BPCL will happen this fiscal and we hope to adhere to the timeline.""

Asked if public sector units will be allowed to bid for the government's 53.29 per cent stake, he said: ""Nitty gritty and details of the disinvestment process will have to be worked out but when I say the government has no business to be in business, it is indicative of possible future course of action.""

At the current trading price of BPCL, the government's 53.29 per cent stake is valued at a shade less than Rs 62,000 crore. On top of this, the acquirer will have to make an open offer to buy an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders for about Rs 30,000 crore.

Last year, the government had sold its entire stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for Rs 36,915 crore.

Pradhan said the privatisation of BPCL was following the policy of ushering in greater competition in sectors that can sustain on their own.

Greater private participation, like in the telecom and aviation sector, will bring about efficiencies and better service to consumers, he said.

The CCEA had on Wednesday also approved the sale of an entire 63.75 per cent government holding in SCI and 30.8 per cent out of the government's 54.80 per cent stake in Container Corp of India (Concor).

Besides, the government will sell its entire holding in THDC India Ltd (THDCIL) and North Eastern Electric Power Corp Ltd (NEEPCO) to state-owned power generator NTPC Ltd, the finance minister has said.

The government holds 74.23 per cent in THDCIL and 100 per cent NEEPCO.

Parallelly, the Cabinet had also approved reducing government stake in select PSUs such as IOC to below 51 per cent while continuing to retain management control.

The management control will continue to be retained with the government after considering equity held by other state-owned companies in the divested firm.

The government, currently, holds 51.5 per cent in IOC and another 25.9 per cent through state-owned Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC), and explorers ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL), and the government can potentially sell 26.4 per cent for about Rs 33,000 crore.

A similar formula can also apply to ONGC and gas utility GAIL India Ltd.

The stake sales are critical for the government to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore set for the current financial year.

At current prices, the government's 30.8 per cent stake in Concor is worth about Rs 10,800 crore, while stake sale in SCI will fetch just over Rs 2,000 crore.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai, Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes. After removing three million tonnes capacity of the Numaligarh refinery, the new buyer will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.

It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants. The company distributes 21 per cent of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country.

The government is keen to get international energy majors such as Saudi Aramco, Total SA of France and ExxonMobil to operate in the downstream fuel marketing business so as to bring in greater competition.

Currently, 95 per cent of retail petrol and diesel sales and near 100 per cent of cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene sales are controlled by the public sector units.

As on March 31, BPCL reported cash and cash equivalents of around Rs 5,300 crore, against Rs 10,900 crore of debt maturing over the next 15 months."

Shares of NHPC closed at Rs 23.5 apiece on Wednesday, up 0.86 per cent.


• Edelweiss Securities has maintained its Buy rating on 
Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services with a target price of Rs 397. The company’s earnings for September quarter remained mixed with softer growth, lower net interest margins and steady asset quality.

Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services closed at Rs 330, up 0.7 per cent on Wednesday.

• Reliance Securities has maintained a Buy rating on 
Gail (India) with a target price of Rs 154. Gail posted improved volume performance in quarter ending September with natural gas transmission growing 7 per cent year-on-year.

18,2018-11-21,GAIL,"In the broader market slowdown that began in early 2018, a number of ‘multibaggers’ of the past decade faltered and lost more than half their values in just two years. 

In all, there are 45 stocks in the BSE500 index that more than doubled in the first seven years of the decade, but could not continue their pace, and eroded shareholders’ wealth thereafter.

YES Bank, of course, tops the list. Others included Somany Ceramics, La Opala RG, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Graphite India, CEAR, Rain Industries, Blue Dart, eClerx, Wockhardt, Bombay Dyeing and Force Motors, among others., 

Glass manufacturer La Opala RG surged 4,100 per cent in the first seven years of the decade from 2011 to 2017, but crashed 52 per cent from that point in next two years. Similarly, Somany Ceramics gave 1,500 per cent return in that bull run but is now down 80 per cent from its December 2017 level.

Out of the 45 names, nine are trading even below their 2010-end levels. They are Eveready Industries, DHFL, Sadbhav Engineering, eClerx, Bombay Dyeing, Deepak Fertilisers, Wockhardt, Magma Corp, Gateway Distriparks and Gujarat State Fertilizers.



Most of the names belong to midcap and smallcap segments, which have been battered badly in last two years.

But fortunes could be changing for them soon.

Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamentals Research at Kotak Securities, believes the ground for rally in midcaps and smallcaps is getting ready, as these stocks have seen some traction lately. In last three months, BSE Midcap index has risen 9 per cent and BSE Smallcap index 6 per cent, though both remain in the red on a year-to-date basis.

“We need two things to come together: activity on the ground i.e., demand, etc. should pick up and midcap and smallcap companies need to show some earnings visibility. These two factors are not there right now. Maybe, the sentiments have turned positive, but earnings are not visible. Probably, closer to the Budget, midcaps and smallcaps would become the flavour. If the Budget gives some impetus to investors and taxpayers, then it will be an icing on the cake for midcaps and smallcaps,” said Oza.

Some of these stocks are also down because of company-specific issues while some have fallen out of favour due to sector-wide slowdown. For instance, YES Bank gave 404 per cent return in the first seven years but today trades at a fraction of those prices because of very high exposure to stressed assets.

Traders punished Wadhawan Group’s DHFL on corporate governance issues and tightening of liquidity in the system. The company is now facing insolvency. The stock has crashed 96 per cent from the levels it was trading at in 2017-end.

Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking thinks the market is in a better place than it was six months ago, thanks to the optimism over a possible US-China trade deal and improved domestic sentiment. “The up-move will be gradual. Investors would await more data on economic recovery. Nonetheless, those with a 2-3 years’ time horizon should use a buy-on-dips strategy to buy the fundamentally-sound stocks,” he said.

Oza sees themes like rural consumption, gas companies like GAIL, Mahanagar Gas, Petronet LNG and some smallcaps to bloom next year. He said companies playing the financialisation theme in India -- life insurance, AMCs and private banks -- could gain. As many as 16 of these 45 stocks fall in these categories."

Company Financials

Gail posted improved volume performance in quarter ending September with natural gas transmission growing 7% year-on-year. Also, petrochemical facility utilisation touched a new high of 112% in September quarter. However, Gail sold contracted LNG at lower price in spot market, for which its gas marketing margin fell during the quarter."

24,2018-11-25,GAIL,"New Delhi: The Committee of Secretaries (CoS) set up to suggest relief measures for the telecom sector has been ‘disbanded’, a top government official said, indicating that the two-year moratorium on spectrum payments is possibly all that the sector will get for now.

“They (telcos) have been given a two-year moratorium (from spectrum payment), they’ve got relief of Rs 42,000 crore,” the official said, adding that nothing more should be expected. When asked specifically if the CoS had been disbanded, the official said “yes”.

On whether a new inter-ministerial panel could be constituted to provide relief for the Rs 1.47 lakh crore adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues, the official said, “No, it is a SC-defined matter”.

This official also appeared to rule out any relief for non-telecom companies including staterun units such as Power Grid, Gail and RailTel that have been affected by the AGR order.

“...why didn’t they (non-telcos) fight (in court), who asked them not to do it? Elementary accounting procedure is that if there are pending dues, then contingent provision should have been kept in books of accounting. It is their statutory obligation,” he said.




COAI Still Hopeful
The government, on the recommendations of the CoS, last week cleared a two-year moratorium on payments for spectrum bought in auctions, a move aimed at providing cash flow relief to carriers such as Vodafone idea ( Rs23,920 crore) and Bharti Airtel (Rs 11,746 crore).

But the government didn’t reduce the 8% AGR that the telcos pay as licence fees, as was widely expected. Neither did the panel nor the government provide any relief on the AGR-based dues that mobile phone companies face after a recent Supreme Court order. Carriers need to pay the dues in less than three months.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who face combined AGR dues of over Rs 89,000 crore to be paid in less than three months, have filed review petitions seeking a review of penalties and interest on the dues, and questioning some components of the non-core items that the court said should be included while computing AGR of telcos. If forced to pay the whole amounts, the telcos say they have doubts over continuing as going concerns.

“We trust this does not mean the government has ceased to look at the long-term relief and sustainability of the industry. We hope these issues will continue to be looked at and decided upon by DoT through existing channels of decision making,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). COAI represents all private telecom operators.

Analysts last week said the sector needs more measures.

“While deferment of spectrum auction payment is in line with our expectations, no decision on licence fees reduction is clearly negative…We note that if the Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel face challenges in paying the annual spectrum payment of Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 6,000 crore, respectively, then it will be more challenging for them to pay AGR dues of Rs 53,000 crore and Rs 35,600 crore immediately,” Credit Suisse said in a report.

Telecom companies have also asked the government to reduce their total incidence of tax and levies from the present levels of 33%, and reduce spectrum usage charge to 1%, respectively. ET had reported previously that the DoT may ask the finance ministry to refer the pending issue of refunding input tax credits of telecom companies worth Rs 36,000 crore to the GST Council, which the telcos have been asking for as well."

Nifty50 opened positive on back of favourable cues from global bourses and made a new lifetime high of 12,132 in the early hours of the session. However, the index turned highly volatile in the latter part of the session, as it traded in wide range between 12,006 and 12,130 levels.

The index formed a Small Bearish Candle on the daily scale, as it closed below the opening level. But the overall trend remains positive, and thus, we continue our buy-on-dips strategy. Now, Nifty has to sustain above the 11,980 – 12,000 zone to witness an up-move towards the 12,132 and 12,200 levels, while supports remained intact at 11,920 and 11,850 levels on the downside.

India VIX fell 1.08 per cent to 14.83 level. Now VIX needs to hold below 15 mark to surpass the recent high and extend the fresh high territory.

Bank Nifty opened with a gap up and extended its gains to make a new lifetime high at 31,850 level. It relatively outperformed the benchmark index and managed to close above 31,700. However, it formed a Doji candle on the daily scale, as it closed near its opening mark.

The overall trend remains positive and it now needs to hold above 31,500 level to witness an up-move towards 31,850 and then make a fresh rally towards 32,000 level. On the downside, support is placed at 31,500 and then 31,200 levels.

Nifty futures closed flattish at 12,098 level. Long buildup was seen in Just Dial, Motherson Sumi, Biocon, GAIL and Bharat Forge while shorts were seen in Zeel, BHEL, Castrol, RBL Bank and Glenmark.

34,2018-11-28,GAIL,"India has been striving to become a gas-based economy. While the current share of gas in India’s energy mix is 6%, the central government has set an ambitious target of increasing it to 15% by 2030. Since natural gas is also used in households as piped natural gas (PNG), increasing the user base for this cooking fuel is one of the ways to effectively move towards our natural gas targets. Similarly, the rising use of CNG-powered vehicles can also help drive India’s gas transition. (CNG, or compressed natural gas, is a low-emission fuel used to power automobiles.) 
In 2018-19 alone, 11.25 lakh connections for CNG and PNG were made in the two cities of Mumbai and Delhi. 

While the government’s targets and ambitions have motivated energy companies to supply natural gas to a wider base, what are the benefits that motivate people to opt for piped gas lines? We spoke to 5 people from different walks of life, who have one thing in common - they all use PNG. Here’s what they had to say about the switch from gas cylinders to piped gas lines:

I have been living alone for the past 4 years. Cooking was once a chore because I had to keep a tab on the date of the cylinder refill, whether it has been connected properly, and other such things. However, I recently switched to piped gas line and it has made my life very easy. I can curb my midnight hunger pangs with some quick recipes without worrying about running out of gas. The convenience of piped gas lines is what makes it my preferred choice. The bills can easily be kept on auto-pay mode and the constant reminders on messages are also helpful.

 I have been using a piped gas line since we shifted to Gurugram 4 years ago. Having used gas cylinders for a long time, the shift to a piped gas line was comfortable. PNG is better on every front. It is very convenient to use, economical and, most importantly, it is not space-consuming. It is always good to have some extra storage space in the kitchen. In the past, there have been situations when guests had come in unannounced and we ran out of gas midway. The struggle to find a spare cylinder in such situations was real. However, with PNG, this hassle is a thing of the past. All things considered, I would always prefer using a piped gas line, for it’s very beneficial from a practical standpoint.

I had been using PNG for the last 5 years and it is very easy to use. I have a 3-year-old at home, and could never imagine him playing around gas cylinders. But I recently relocated and have had to rely on gas cylinders for the past two months. In this time, we have already run out of gas and survived on food deliveries for 2 days while we waited for the replacement. Having a mischievous toddler who keeps playing with stove knobs is one of the most terrifying things. Now I realize the comfort and safety PNG had given me. With its two-knob security, I am always sure that my kid is safe. I don’t have to deal with the constant fear that accompanies the use of gas cylinders. Also, the added convenience of never falling short of gas, or never having to double-check if the regulator is fitted properly or if it is actually turned off, makes PNG my most preferred option. My new place will be getting a PNG connection by the end of this month, and I cannot wait to return to this trusted source.

 I opted for a PNG connection as soon as it was introduced, and it has really been a boon for working professionals like me. Earlier, there have been times when I’ve had to leave from work early to collect gas cylinders, since it was impossible to find a suitable time to get the spare cylinders delivered home. Thanks to the sheer convenience of using PNG, cooking cylinders have become a thing of the past for me. The safety and comfort that PNG provides has made my life a lot easier.

 I have used gas cylinders for decades but recently shifted to PNG. One big challenge that I no longer have to face is changing the cylinders. I dreaded lifting and transporting heavy gas cylinders. With a piped gas line, there is no heavy-lifting involved, and I don’t need to rely on anything or anyone for continuous and timely gas supply. In the past, there have been times when we had to borrow cylinders from neighbours or order in because we ran out of gas. Now I can easily enjoy cooking without worrying owing to the continuous gas supply. The bills are also easily payable online, making my life easier. 

All these stories emphatically establish that PNG is a widely preferred form of cooking gas. Another big benefit of using PNG is that natural gas has a lower environmental footprint compared to conventional fuels. But the question that needs to be asked is: what will it take for a wider switch to this safe, secure and reliable form of fuel? India is ramping up investment in the city gas sector to massively expand the reach of CNG and PNG. And its need for natural gas seems to be quenchable with energy leaders like ExxonMobil looking for innovative ways to expand India’s natural gas access. 

Earlier this year, ExxonMobil announced collaborations with India’s leading gas provider GAIL and local energy major Indian Oil. ExxonMobil, a leading innovator in the field of cleaner energy solutions, has been helping India expand access to gas-based energy for two decades. Rise in PNG consumption will be a major step, among others, towards increasing the share of natural gas in India’s energy market and lowering the country’s carbon emissions. 

 With energy players like ExxonMobil looking to boost this environment-friendly fuel, the rise of PNG is expected. And considering how satisfied people are with this source, it seems to be a win-win for all. As the user testimonies reveal, choosing PNG over gas cylinders not only increases convenience, reduces costs and strengthens safety, but also provides users with a pro-environment choice that needs to be made on a wider scale. 


Exxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates; for convenience and simplicity in this article, the term “ExxonMobil” is used as an abbreviated reference to one or more of these subsidiaries or affiliates."

38,2018-11-30,GAIL,"Mumbai: The government will likely need sizable privatisation income over the next five years given the fiscal pressures, with BHEL, GAIL India, Hindustan Zinc and NALCO likely to be the possible candidates, according to foreign brokerage CLSA.

PSU stocks with limited scope for privatisation such as ONGC, NTPC, Power Grid, Indian Oil Corporation, and Coal India, may continue to face selling pressures.

“The government has earned $12 billion via PSU stock sales through ETFs in the last three years and fear of more such sales will put supply pressure in the market on non-disinvestment candidates,” said CLSA.

However, the chances of the government concluding the BPCL privatisation before the end of the current financial year is challenging, the brokerage said.

“The experience of three previous successful cases back in 2001-2002 shows that privatisation is a time-consuming process and takes 6-16 months between global tender and deal consummation, thus, concluding the BPCL privatisation before Mar’20 is challenging,” said CLSA.

CLSA said weak tax collection growth and stimulatory measures by the government have created a fiscal shortfall of over ₹2 lakh crore in the current financial year. The government has set a fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of the GDP for the current financial year.

The brokerage believes that the disinvestment target may only grow going forward especially if more tax cuts happen and as other potential non-tax revenue sources are already constrained.

“Even assuming a 50-70 bps (basis points) relaxation, the current year’s record $15bn (billion) disinvestment target may only grow, especially if more tax cuts happen,” said CLSA.

The brokerage said the government’s total holding in listed PSUs is $174 billion of which financials account for $61 billion and those are unlikely to be disinvested in the near future.

Sale of SUUTI holdings is an easier option, but the government only has about $4.8 billion in the two stocks – Axis Bank and ITC – which can be easily sold, said CLSA."

2,2018-12-04,GAIL,"Value investing is all about selecting stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values. Besides, when value investing is coupled with the strategy of selecting stocks based on how cheap or attractive they are with respect to broader indices, it adds a solid edge to such investing as it gives better view of valuations.

Among schemes that follow this strategy, conservative investors can consider investing is Tata Equity PE. The scheme’s fund manager Sonam Udasi selects 70% of the stocks in his portfolio that quote at price-to-earnings multiple (trailing) lower than that of the Sensex. The remaining 30% is invested in companies, which may quote at price-to-earnings multiples higher than that of the Sensex, but have higher earnings visibility and attractive return ratios. This strategy has worked for the scheme’s performance. The scheme has given 14% and 22% returns in the past three- and five-year periods, while its peers have given 10% and 18% returns during the same period.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers Sonam Udasi and Amey Sathe have stuck to their conviction bets, which strictly follow the value investing theme. These companies are Coal India, Bajaj Finserv and ITC.

4,2018-12-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: RBI’s status quo on key policy rates in its fifth bimonthly policy spooked the market on Wednesday, as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extended losses into the second consecutive session. 

The indices traded in the lower terrain through the day in the light of bearish sentiment in global markets amid concerns of a downturn in the US economy. 

A yield-curve inversion in the US, where yield on short-term bonds rises above that of long-term bonds, has stoked investor worries that a recession is near. 

In line with major Asian peers, the BSE Sensex fell 250 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 35,884, with only six stocks - HUL, HDFC, HDFC Bank, Wipro, RIL and Adani Ports – ending in the green. Nifty lost 85 points, or 0.74 per cent, to settle at 10,784. Among the 50 Nifty stocks, 10 ended in the green and 40 in the red.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices cracked more than the benchmark, closing lower by 1.22 per cent and 1.21 per cent, respectively.


We walk you through the highlights of Wednesday's session:

RBI cuts SLRWhile keeping the repo rate and the reverse repo rate unchanged and maintaining 'calibrated tightening' stance, RBI decided to cut the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by 25 basis points to 19.25 per cent from January 1, 2019. The SLR currently stands at 19.50 per cent and the move to lower the same should prod banks to lend more than park cash in safe-haven government securities. 


Rate-sensitive stocks sufferRate-sensitive banking, auto and realty stocks suffered more losses after RBI’s status quo on policy rates. IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank were the top losers in BSE Bankex. BSE Auto index settled with all stocks in the red. M&M, Maruti, Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland were among the top losers. In the realty pack, Sobha, Prestige Estates and Oberoi Realty were the top losers. 


Rs 1.37 lakh crore erasedWednesday’s fall in the market erased over Rs 1.37 lakh crore investor wealth, as the cumulative market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies fell to Rs 1,42,15,154.67 crore from Rs 1,43,52,680.29 crore a day earlier. 


Sun Pharma hits 52-week lowShares of Sun Pharma plunged to 52-week low of Rs 402.10 as the company's attempt to assuage investor concerns failed. Even after assurances from founder Dilip Shanghvi to alter certain business practices, large fund houses and brokerage firms remained unhappy with the prevailing corporate governance culture at India’s biggest drugmaker. The stock closed 6.59 per cent down at Rs 413.60 on BSE. 


Tata Motors falls 4%Shares of Tata Motors finished at Rs 169.20, down 3.70 per cent after S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit rating of the company and its British arm Jaguar Land Rover Automotive. S&P also expects Tata Motors' leverage to deteriorate over the next 12-18 months, given its ongoing cash losses at JLR despite turnaround plans for the unit. 


Bharat Forge cracks over 8%Shares of Bharat Forge plunged 8.45 per cent to Rs 531.95 as the sales of Class 8 trucks declined to their lowest in 14 months in the US. The overall truck orders in North America stood at 27,900 units in November, which is the lowest since September 2017.


Prakash Ind sinks as ED attached assetsShares of Prakash Industries settled with a loss of 8.42 per cent at Rs 84.85 on BSE on reports that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached the company’s assets in connection with the coal scam case. The ED said a provisional order for attachment of properties was issued by it under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Prakash Industries Limited. However, the company disapproved any such order from the ED in a regulatory filing. ""We categorically state that we have not yet received any attachment order from Enforcement Directorate,"" the company said in an NSE filing today.


Lupin down on USFDA observationsDrug major Lupin Wednesday said the US health regulator has made a total of 22 observations after inspection of its facilities located at Mandideep in Madhya Pradesh. Shares of the company settled 3.27 per cent down at Rs 859.05.

On the other hand, GBL Industries, Kalpa Commercial, Maestros Electronics, Santaram Spinner and Jaypee Infratech remained in the group of 35 overbought stocks on BSE.

Among the stocks that showed bearish crossovers were Tata Motors, Adani Enterprises, GMR Infrastructure, Bharti Airtel, PTC India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Castrol India and Fortis Healthcare.

Nifty forms bearish candleNifty formed a bearish candle on daily charts. “The level of 200-DMA, which is presently at 10,749 will be crucially important to watch for. This level of 200-DMA also coincided with important pattern supports and almost acts as a proxy trend line. For any upsides to occur, defending this level of 10,749 will be important. Any breach of this level might induce some weakness, said Milan Vaishnav, technical analyst at Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory."
3,2018-12-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Weak global sentiment, caution ahead of RBI policy decision and rupee's fall weighed on domestic equity market, dragging the benchmark Sensex over 200 points lower in opening trade.

Caution crept in the market ahead of RBI rate decision which morphed into bearish mood owing to weakness in Asian peers. 

Asian stocks came under pressure, tracking a fall in the US equities as a flattening US Treasury yield curve stoked investor worries about global economic growth. 

Besides, doubts over the ability of the US and China to find a substantial solution of trade dispute during the temporary cease-fire period agreed at the G20 summit kept investors on edge.

However, as per media reports, the US President on Tuesday talked about the possibility of an extension of the 90-day trade truce with Beijing but said tariffs may be reverted if the two sides could not resolve their differences.

6,2018-12-07,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks registered a positive opening on Friday, after three consecutive sessions of losses, thanks to a fall in global crude oil prices and rupee's fresh rise against the US dollar.

11,2018-12-07,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority Friday said they are seriously considering banning industrial, construction and demolition activities at major pollution hotspots in Delhi-NCR when air quality levels reach 'severe' category.

The Central Pollution Control Board-led task force on November 22 recommended to the EPCA that industrial, construction and demolition activities should be banned in major hotspot areas when air quality levels reach 'severe' category.

In a meeting on Friday with various oil and gas companies, such as Adani gas, Haryana City Gas, IGL and GAIL, EPCA chairperson Bhure Lal lashed out at them asking the reason for not being able to switch to cleaner sources of energy for their operations.

""We are seriously considering a proposal from the CPCB to shut down industries in the area where the pollution reaches severe,"" EPCA member Sunita Narain said, adding, ""The authority will write to industries asking for a breakup of their pricing of piped natural gas and what are the terms on which they supply it to the consumers.""

The representatives of the firms contended that switching to electricity or gas is proving to be expensive in comparison to coal.

Narain said, ""We will keep pushing for switching to gas as there is no other option. We will also push the government to reduce VAT to make it cheaper by 20 per cent for industries.""

On December 4, the CPCB-led taskforce identified 21 areas vulnerable to high pollution in Delhi-NCR and directed the respective municipal corporations to take ""focussed actions"" to mitigate the affects.

It has also asked the authorities to carry out inspection at Loni Bhopura in Ghaziabad, from where repeated complaints of violations of environmental norms have been received, according to the minutes of a meeting of the taskforce held in Delhi.

The taskforce has identified 15 pollution hotspots in Delhi. They are -- Anand Vihar, Bawana, CRRI Mathura Road, DTU, Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range, Dwarka-Sector 8, Jahangirpuri, Mundaka, NSIT Dwarka, Narela, Okhla Phase-2, R K Puram, Rohini, Shadipur, Wazirpur.

In NCR areas outside Delhi, six hotspots have been identified. They are -- Sector-16A in Faridabad, Vikas Sadan in Gurgaon, Vasundhara in Ghaziabad, Knowledge Park-III in Greater Noida, Sector-125 in Noida and RIICO Industrial Area-III in Bhiwadi.

Lal said last week, the EPCA sealed 140 units that were dealing in tar oil, rubber oil and synthetic engine oil, but another issue is that the sealed units shift to different parts of the city and continue their operations.

The EPCA chairperson also said that he would inspect burning of industrial waste in Mundka and penalise the entities responsible for it.

Delhi has been battling alarming levels of pollution for nearly two months with the air quality hovering between ""very poor"" and ""severe"", and slipping into ""poor"" on better days."

15,2018-12-14,GAIL,"The worst case scenario that has not been priced in by the Indian markets will be some weak coalition 
  
  
  
  government that does not last very long, Jonathan Schiessl, Chief Investment Officer, Ashburton Investments, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What is your broad overview on India? In local currency terms, the Indian market has been the best performing market in the world but even so the spoiler for India has been the currency situation which has been really the party-pooper for emerging markets this year.
There are people who would have predicted the results of the state elections earlier in the week and then what happened with the RBI governor. As you rightly say, India has performed so incredibly well particularly when other emerging markets have come off as well. So it has been an incredibly unusual few days. Clearly the markets are pricing in a much easier monetary policy coming out of the new RBI governor and has obviously moved on from the state elections.


What did you make of the drama that played out between the RBI and the government? What is your own expectation on the monetary policy front?
Most people would agree that the RBI as an institution has enough depth to be able to cope with what has been going on. From our perspective, we do not see turn back in the MPC, inflation targeting that whole process and the RBI itself as an institution is deep enough and strong enough to cope with the changes. 

We do not worry too much about that although obviously we have to keep cognisant of what is going on that is the key thing for us really with regards to that. Clearly from our perspective, there was some frustration with the prior governor particularly on the communication side. 

RBI earlier used to be very communicative with foreign investors. They would meet foreign investors very freely under the last administration. That became a little bit more difficult and we also found frustrations with some of the communications following the MPC meetings. 

Clearly being the head of RBI includes an element of politics and perhaps the new governor will be able to handle that a little bit differently.


 It was remarkable the way the market absorbed the state election result and then the RBI governor hanging up his boots. Do you think in the run up to 2019 elections, the volatility would persist?
I cannot believe that has been priced in that scenario. I would think state elections and national elections exhibit two very different voting habits from the same voters. However, the reality is the result from the state elections will give Congress a boost and therefore it is going to be much more of a two-horse race than perhaps people were predicting. 

If you look at what has happened to markets, then clearly I do not think markets are pricing that in. For anybody who has been following India for some time, it is not that the parties are that far apart on key policies. But what we want to see is a stable government at the centre that can actually drive policy. The worst case scenario that has not been priced in the markets will be some weak coalition government that does not last very long . That would be a concern particularly when you look at India again after the good performance of this week and last month as well.

India’s relative valuation compared to other emerging markets is going up and India is already looking fairly pricey vis-à-vis other emerging markets and there are some reasons for that. But there are also some risks out there that I would argue the markets are not quite thinking about at the moment. 


What then should the Indian investor do? Is it time to start hunting in the volatility that the market is going to see in the next six months or should one sit on a pile of cash and keep your shopping list ready?
It all depends on the investor’s time horizon. We are great believer in India as a phenomenal medium to longer-term story. Trying to time the market and buy all the dips is a very difficult approach. 

If you are in the market for a long period of time, you will make a very good return from the market. Ideally, you can try and buy when periodically it shows some value but it is very difficult to time that. For anybody on a medium to longer term basis, just dribbling the money into the market is still a very good policy. Cost averaging into the market is a good policy. 

But yes, we do believe that looking at the underlying macro, earnings and what is going on with growth, surely we are hitting at a little bit of growth halt at the moment. Things were getting a bit too hot. But inflation is coming off. We do believe India is recovering. We have been in a very long earnings recession and we are coming out of that slowly. We think this market will offer very good returns for investors over the medium and longer term. It does not concern us too much that in a short-term, volatility is just a good buying opportunity.


Where do you think bargains are available?
We have been getting more defensive over the last few months but we still think that there are pockets of real value in the market. We have been perhaps seeing counters like Coal India that offers tremendous good valuation point and very good dividend yield. We are pretty sure about the earnings trajectory of stocks over the next three years. It is not an over-loved stock. It is not overhyped and looks a good place for us. 

We also like GAIL India, which has come off a bit more recently because obviously the oil price did come off. So, stocks like that, where we see good dividend yields and valuation comfort, where risk reward is very favourable. For the longer term investors, they are the usual favourites if you can put out with a slightly higher valuations in the short term.

Most of the counters in the market do look okay to us but the newer stuff we have been putting in is definitely being a bit more defensive with high dividend yields where we can still see some visibility of growth over the next few years.


What is your take on the Indian NBFC space and do you think this euphoria is warranted?
Clearly that has been an area of massive focus over the last few months. Obviously, the liquidity has picked up. We have not seen these NBFCs being able to tap the markets. Ultimately we think the big NBFCs that have access to cheaper capital will continue to take market share. The space had been getting extremely competitive. There were probably too many new entrants and this whole event was a wakeup call for the space. 

Ultimately some of the more dubious business models are going to be put under pressure and therefore the big will just end up getting bigger. When I look at a lot of Indian financials, the big guys have access to cheaper capital and they will continue to win. We see plenty of scope for some of the larger NBFCs and private banks to carry on taking significant market share gains."
16,2018-12-14,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty managed to finish Friday's session with mild gains after a seesaw session as speculations about the RBI board meet outcome kept investors at bay.

Weak global cues also weighed on sentiment. Global stocks suffered losses on concerns of China's slowing economic growth after data showed China’s November retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003. 

However, a fall in the crude oil prices played ball and market managed to eke out gains in pockets of oil and gas, telecom, power and energy.

Telecom stocks ring loud
Shares of Bharti Airtel (up 5.32 per cent) and Vodafone Idea (up 3.58 per cent) logged decent gains, a day after the telecom tribunal TDSAT struck down Trai's new rules on predatory pricing saying they lacked required transparency. The BSE Telecom index jumped 3.08 per cent with Reliance Communications (up 2.01 per cent) and Tata Communications (up 0.86 per cent), too, among the big gainers. 


Alembic Pharma declines
Shares of Alembic Pharmaceuticals declined 1.95 per cent even as the drug firm on Friday said it has raised Rs 350 crore through allotment of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on a private placement basis.


Reliance ADAG Group shines on SC clean chit 
Shares of Reliance Communications (up 2.01 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (up 1.76 per cent) and Reliance Capital (up 1.29 per cent) went home with gains after the Supreme Court rejected petitions seeking an investigation into the Rafale fighter jets deal with France's Dassault Aviation, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing. However, shares of Reliance Power settled flat.


Fortis Healthcare scrip plunges 
Shares of Fortis Healthcare suffered a loss of 6.75 per cent to settle at Rs 141.65 on the BSE after the Supreme Court maintained a status quo on the sale of the company to IHH Healthcare.

Nifty forms a small white-bodied candle
The Nifty50 index closed a session of rangebound trade on a flat note on Friday. After moving in a range of 63 points, the index formed a small white-bodied candle on the daily chart. Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory said, “Nifty formed a small white-bodied candle on Friday, though this is not a significant formation. The day’s high offered resistance to the falling trend line, which joins the high 11,760 to the subsequent lower tops.”"
17,2018-12-16,GAIL,"New Delhi: The government is planning to raise about Rs 10,000 crore through a follow on offer of Bharat-22 ETF in February, an official said.

""Plans are on for launching the third tranche of Bharat-22 ETF around February. The offer is likely to have a base issue size of Rs 5,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain an over-subscription of equal amount, taking the total issue size to Rs 10,000 crore,"" the official told PTI.

The government has so far raised Rs 22,900 crore through the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF). While Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018.

The official said there would be a need to rebalance the ETF after the third tranche as the government holding in certain CPSEs in the basket could fall below 53 per cent.

The Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) that are part of the Bharat-22 ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Other constituents include Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

Also, the government's strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T held through SUUTI (Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India) has been put in the ETF basket.

Last month, the government had raised Rs 17,300 crore through a follow on offer of another exchange traded fund -- CPSE ETF, which comprises shares of 11 public sector enterprises.

As against the budgeted disinvestment target of Rs 80,000 crore, the government has so far raised Rs 34,000 crore by selling minority stake in CPSEs and ETFs."
19,2018-12-17,GAIL,"Our understanding is autos are going to lead from the front. The metals pack is also showing a lot of promise, Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities, told ETNow.

Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Are you advocating buy through the close out of 2018?

Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been bullish on the market and proved correct and we are now closer to 11,000 rather than 10,000. All that pessimism is over. For the Indian market, the lesson of 2018 is buy the fear and sell the greed. There is still a lot of fear around and people are waiting for corrections. They have been caught napping if they have been tracking the other asset classes or the other indices where China is in a bear market and the US is having problem of its own. 

India becomes a sweet spot on the back that oil is in a bear market. We have got bond yields, rupee and most of the uncertainties on governance on the RBI over with. The next 3-4 months can be pleasantly surprising because we think earnings are going to be a catalyst, along with flows because we have again seen foreigners turn to buy. Locally, we have had the backbone of this market being the retail investor and the SIP. Put your money where your mouth is. I still think midcaps can outperform in the next few months and that is what we are advocating to buy, select midcaps in most sectors where outperformance is on the cards. 


ET Now: When it comes to Tata Motors, has the view now changed, with recent news coming in that they are looking at downsizing in order to turn profitable and getting in some serious cost control measures. Do you sense that Street would give this stock perhaps a rechance?


Sanjiv Bhasin: Like you said, most of the pessimism of autos may be in the price and if you are looking for elections and beyond, then relatively Tata Motors can outperform. The other caveat being if the pound in which they have an unhedged position starts to stabilise, you could see some mark to market return. But we still think autos are going to lead from the front. If I could select three names, it would be Bajaj Auto, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland is my dark horse because we think this month onwards before the budget they will see much of their inventory getting cleared and we think that the 15-year norm will change which will help them gain market share in MCV and LCV segments.


ET Now: Suppose from 10,000, there are a few sectors which have really done well and there are a few sectors which have not yet performed. Any churning you would recommend to portfolio holders or mutual fund managers where you feel that this sector has run up substantially, you do not see further upside from current levels which does not mean that you are negative on that space but there is more attractive sector now which has not done so far so good.


Sanjiv Bhasin: IT should be given an avoid unless you want to be in fully priced stocks where we do not think earnings will be a catalyst. But yes, if I could stick my neck out, I am very bullish on the metals pack. We think the pessimism is overdone, protectionism in US will see again 2019 being a very good year for results. Locally we have seen steel prices harden. The basket of JSW, Tata Steel, Vedanta and Hindalco is looking excellent. 

PSU banks are going to report very good numbers starting from State Bank, Can Bank, Indian Bank. Corporate banks are already leading from the front like Axis and ICICI and a Federal Bank if you can put the midcap basket. Autos I just suggested four names. I am very bullish on the gas utilities. MGL, IGL, GAIL all are looking excellent on the charts and so a whole host of stocks. As for power stocks, the CERC new guideline will be very very positive for some of the PSUs. I would be sticking my money on CG Power to be dark horse for 2019.


ET Now: Are you more bullish on the power space?


Sanjiv Bhasin: We have had our top picks and we have made money in that. If you recall, we were very bullish on the power financiers before the merger talk came. PFC and REC gave almost a 30 per cent return. We still think that today’s review petition is very very positive for the likes of NTPC and Power Grid. The only caveat here is that there is a government to manage its own balance sheet is seeing merger of some stocks to raise necessary cash.

In this power space, you can pick up some of the power producers or you can see some of the utilities. So Calcutta Electric looks very good to us. Reliance Infra has sold its arm to Adani Power so that could be another good play to be with, but our outperformer here would be a small company called CG Power which we think is selling some of the over leveraged assets in Europe and where return on equity could sharply improve in 2019."

21,2018-12-19,GAIL,"The year gone by clearly did not belong to equities. And equity mutual funds are heading into the year-end, looking like jilted lovers.

With the benchmark indices looking on course to end the year with below 5 per cent return, this asset class suffered a severe blow during the year, especially over the past three months, as it reeled from a weak rupee, crude price volatility, liquidity woes and political concerns.

Returns from most of the top stocks held by mutual funds do not paint a pretty picture either. Out of the 20 top MF holdings, most of which are largecap stocks, 16 fell over 30 per cent between August 29, the day Sensex hit its all-time high level, and December 11, and 40 per cent on a year-to-date basis.

Sun Pharma topped the list, with a 30 per cent fall during this period. The scrip has declined more over the past three weeks following allegations of insider trading.

SUV and tractor maker M&M, comes next, falling some 21.48 per cent, while Maruti Suzuki and Bharti Airtel trailed with a loss of 17.15 per cent and 15.39 per cent, respectively. 

On a year-to-date basis, Airtel is down 40.09 per cent and Maruti 20.28 per cent. While Airtel continues to nurse the wounds inflicted by Jio’s disruptive entry, Maruti has taken a hard knock due to weak operational outlook in recent months led by rising fuel prices, increase in financing rates, a weakening rupee, and high input costs.

Even among other, last year’s high-flier Bajaj Finserv is down 11.76 per cent, NTPC 10.96 per cent, Tata Steel 11.29 per cent, Reliance Industries 12.21 per cent and Vedanta 8.34 per cent between August 29 and December 18. Bajaj Finserv and Reliance Industries are, however, up 17.40 per cent and 23.39 per cent, respectively, on a year-to-date basis. 

ITC, GAIL, SBI, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have lost 11-3 per cent since Sensex’s August high point.

HDFC gained 0.15 per cent, and its twin HDFC Bank 2.79 per cent.

The only other stocks besides the HDFC twins that managed to gain marginally were L&T and ICICI Bank; the latter mainly due to the steady bounce ever since the private lender named new CEO.

Everyone else’s pain due to a weak rupee resulted in gains for IT stocks.

No wonder then, equity largecap funds have gained just 2.68 per cent for the year. Pharma, multi-cap, ELSS, value-oriented and infrastructure funds have delivered negative returns on an average, dipping 1 per cent to 17 per cent. Schemes focused on overseas stocks gained 1.66 per cent. Technology stood out as the only oasis for mutual fund investors this calendar, as tech funds delivered double-digit returns over last one year.

But among specific IT stocks, Infosys and TCS, which figured among top 20 holdings of top mutual funds, are down 4.40 per cent and 3.30 per cent, respectively, since August end.

Vidya Bala, Head of Mutual Fund Research, FundsIndia, said largecap funds -- except for 2017 -- have underperformed benchmark indices for the second time in a row. Largecaps and multicaps together have struggled while funds in the midcap space have arrested the decline much better. 

""Funds that took a cautious view in 2017 have managed to contain the decline much better in 2018,"" Bala said, adding that the lacklustre show in the largecap space is attributable to sluggishness in a majority of stocks.

Thankfully, SIP investor sentiment appears unperturbed by this depression and continued market volatility. Monthly SIP inflows remained strong at Rs 7,985 crore as of last available dfata and the industry added over 1.5 lakh new investors in November, alone. 

""Retail investors showing remarkable maturity by staying invested in markets, in spite of the volatility
over the last few months,"" said NS Venkatesh, Chief Executive, Amfi. He is confident of more inflows to mutual funds over the next year.

“We are hopeful many more investors will choose mutual funds as their preferred option to grow wealth next year too,"" Venkatesh added.

Outlook for domestic equity for the next calendar is mixed, thanks to worries of a possible growth slowdown, political tension in the runup to the general elections and many global headwinds seen on the horizon.

JM Financial says earnings expectations from India Inc remain elevated for the midcap and smallcap indices, and thus, it continues to prefer largecap stocks."

23,2018-12-20,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: India is considering building emergency stockpiles of natural gas, on the lines of strategic oil reserves, to deal with supply disruption amid the country’s growing dependence on fuel and its import.

The government wants domestic consumption of natural gas, a cleaner fossil fuel, to rise two-and-a-half times by 2030 and is encouraging big public and private investments in gas production, import, transport and distribution infrastructure.

Local demand increased 5.5% between April and October to 35.1 billion cubic meters, increasing dependence on imports to 47% of total consumption from 44% a year earlier. “Today, we consume very little gas but once new import terminals and pipelines are in place and new city gas licensees have rolled out their services across the country, there would be a sharp jump in the consumer base. Any supply disruption can have a huge impact,” said a person, explaining the rationale for building emergency gas storage in the country.



The person is part of a panel formed by the petroleum and natural gas ministry to evaluate the need for strategic gas storage and prepare a plan to go about building and managing these. The panel has representatives from ONGC, GAIL and Oil Industry Development Board.

“We would need to answer two key questions: First, how do we build the storage, and second, what would be the right business model to operate it,” the person said. The panel plans to hire consultants soon and hopes to finalise a report in about six months, he said. 

Most heavy gas consuming countries already have natural gas storage in place, primarily for supply security. About 30% of gas storage capacity is in the US, a major producer and consumer of natural gas. Russia, Ukraine, Canada and Germany together account for another 40%. China, a late entrant to the game, too is fast building gas storage facilities.

About three-fourths of underground gas storage is in depleted gas and oil fields while the balance is distributed between salt caverns and aquifers. “The simplest way to start would be to launch a depleted field storage as it would be cheaper and less time-consuming than a salt cavern or rock cavern,” said the person quoted earlier. Salt cavern storage is expensive but allows high injection and withdrawal rates, as well as the ability to cycle working gas several times a year, he said.

The first storage in India could come up at a site connected to a pipeline, the person said, adding that the reserve would store imported gas, which could be released when needed in the domestic market."

25,2018-12-21,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: A strong all-round selling, triggered by weakness in global stocks, made domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty tank on Friday. 

Analysts called it mean reversion for the market, which had outperformed its global peers for the past one month. Indian equity indices, which usually enjoy a positive correlation with Dow Jones, have been moving in opposite direction since November 12.

30,2018-12-26,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-owned corporations Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, as well as GAIL, are exhausting their capital expenditure budgets much faster than their upstream counterparts ONGC and Oil India in this financial year.

The oil companies together spent about Rs 57,000 crore between April and November, 63% of their capex target of Rs 89,000 crore for 2018-19. State refiners are spending thousands of crores in expanding capacity and upgrading their facilities to produce low-emission fuel and improving their marketing infrastructure across the country to cater to the increasing demand for fuel.

At 85% of capex target, refiner Bharat Petroleum was the fastest spender. Indian Oil, the country’s largest refiner and fuel retailer, spent 74% of its budget while HPCL, another refiner, used up 71% of its capital outlay.



GAIL, the country’s largest gas marketer and pipeline operator, achieved 72% of its annual capex target, with most of its capital being deployed in laying a pipeline that would get natural gas to most of eastern India soon.

ONGC and Oil India lagged peers in capital spending in the first eight months of the fiscal. ONGC, which has a capex outlay of Rs 32,000 crore for the year, spent only 54% till November. Its overseas arm, ONGC Videsh, spent 53% of its Rs 5,900 crore target. ONGC’s capex budget is usually much more than that of refiners such as Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum, which have annual capex target of Rs 22,900 crore and Rs 7,400 crore, respectively.

Oil India used up just 47% of its Rs 4,300-crore capex programme, figuring at the bottom of the spending table among oil firms. Higher investment in refining and marketing network is also needed to meet oil demand that has grown 2.5% this year."

3,2019-01-03,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks opened Thursday's session in the negative zone, tracking weak global sentiment after US stock futures fell and most Asian markets traded lacklustre.

A fall in the rupee even as crude oil prices declined further in global markets too impacted the mood. 

The Indian currency opened 11 paise down at 70.29 against the greenback amid buying in American currency by banks and importers.

The softer manufacturing PMI also played its role in aggravating the selling in sectors. The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index declined to 53.2 in December from 54 in November.

BSE-listed firms have lost over Rs 2.66 lakh crore in the two-day selling spree.

ONGC slips 3% on OVL listing planShares of ONGC fell 2.98 per cent to Rs 143.20 after the company said the government has not yet asked it to reconsider listing its overseas arm ONGC Videsh (OVL) on bourses.

ETNow reported that the company had cut prices of iron ore fines by Rs 300 per tonne and that of lumps by Rs 350 per tonne. NMDC product prices are at a nine-month low now.

9,2019-01-04,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: A Parliamentary panel has asked the oil ministry to explain ""in lucid terms"", zero gas production from KG D6, noting that the estimated 80 mmscmd output from the gas block led to setting up of gas-based power plants which are stranded now due to no fuel supply. 

""The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas should come out with the reasons, in the lucid terms, for zero production of gas from KG D6 as the estimated production of 80 mmscmd that was envisaged earlier and the steps taken by the Government against those who are responsible for this gross miscalculation about the production of gas from KG D6 which has put the reliability of the Ministry at stake,"" said the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy in its 42nd report on /Non-Performing Assets in Gas based Power Plants. 

 The committee also recommend that the banks/lenders (to these stranded gas projects) should own responsibility and work towards finding the appropriate solution in the national interest. 

 It pointed out that the ministry owe the responsibility for superfluous projections regarding production of gas from KG D6 and the banks for unrealistic lending of public money. 

 It said that instead of ensuring how these stranded power plants can be efficiently utilized, there is an air of despondency and increasing clamour to send these plants to NCLT. 

 The Committee said that it is dismayed to note that State Bank of India, the largest lender in the county, does not have any solution regarding these stranded plants and wants to write off the investment made in these gas based plants. In the opinion of the Committee, such an attitude of the lenders reflects that they just want to shrug off the responsibility of this crisis by referring the stressed plants to the NCLT. 

According to the report, out of total gas based power generation capacity of 24,867 MW, as much as 14,305 MW is stranded due to shortage of domestic gas supply and competitive tariff scenario. There are 31 stranded gas based power plants which include one power plant of Central Sector (1967 MW), six power plants of State Sector (2665.30 MW) and 24 power plants of Private Sector (9673 MW). 

 The committee noted that these power plants were planned with the expectation of considerable increase in the volume of domestic gas production, particularly from KG D6 field. But the projections regarding availability of domestic gas have turned out to be terribly wrong as the production from KG D6 field has reduced drastically to zero supply for power sector since March, 2013. 

 The Committee was of the view that since these gas-based power plants were set up on the basis of the government's assurance regarding supply of gas, it becomes incumbent upon the Government to help them come out of stress. 

The peak flow of the gas from KG D6 was expected to be about 80 MMSCMD by the end of the year 2009 and to increase further in subsequent years. But the production from KG D6 started declining from 55.35 MMSCMD in 2010-11 to 5.5 MMSCMD in 2017-18 and today the production is as good as nil, the panel noted.

 As many as 30 number of gas based power plants with a capacity of 14,504 MW were allocated gas from KG D6 on firm basis but without any commitment regarding supply of gas. 

 On the gas policy flip flop, the panel recommend that some consistency and predictability should be maintained in policy making so as to avoid giving sudden shocks to the stakeholders concerned. Also any policy/guidelines with respect to the change in allocation of gas should be prospective and it should not impact the existing users.

 The panel also recommend that the ministry should focus on building LNG re-gasification terminals at the east coast of the country in a time bound manner as it would cost less for the industries/plants at the eastern side to source gas from east coast terminals than piping the fuel across the country from the West coast. 

 The panel said that the government should rethink its plan of introducing free market pricing for natural gas as any attempt to gain at the cost of consumers will be counter-productive and may not be in the public interest. 

 It also said that any proposal for removal of Power Sector from the priority allocation should also be reconsidered. 

The Committee recommend that natural gas should be brought under GST, so that the taxes get rationalized and gas becomes cheaper and affordable. 

It suggests that the government should come up with a scheme like E-Bid RLNG Scheme to support these stranded plants in the intervening period with necessary exemptions, waivers and desired modifications. 

It also pitched for the financial support/subsidies required for the scheme may be sourced from Power System Development Fund/National Clean Energy Fund or Budgetary Grants. 

 It said that the power produced under the scheme may be used for bundling with other low cost power as has been done by the NTPC earlier and the RLNG may be pooled with the domestic gas through an aggregator such as the GAIL, so as to achieve a reasonable price. 

 It also suggested that financial support should be extended to gas based power projects from NCEF (national clean energy fund) for their sustainability as natural gas is also a clean energy source."

10,2019-01-05,GAIL,"Mumbai: The sudden collapse of crude prices and weaker gross refining margins (GRMs) are likely to impact profitability of refiners and marketers negatively in the December quarter, analysts said.

Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) HPCL, BPCL, IndianOil, Reliance Industries and ONGC have lost 2 per cent since January 1 against the Sensex that fell 1 per cent.

“An almost 30 per cent drop in crude oil prices is bound to unfold massive inventory losses for PSU refiners such as Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL and also RIL. However, the quantum for RIL could be relatively moderate as the company follows average method for inventory accounting, compared to OMCs, which use ‘first in-first out’ method,” said Nitin Tiwari, analyst, Antique Stock Broking. “In addition to inventory loss, the weakness in core refining margins would further compound worries for refiners.”

According to analysts’ estimates, BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil EBITDA are likely to fall nearly 80 per cent in the December quarter compared to the 2017 December quarter. Gas companies GAIL, Indraprastha Gas and Petronet LNG are likely to report 15-20 per cent decline in EBITDA, said analysts.

The benchmark Singapore complex weakened to $2.9 per barrel in December 2018 and, therefore, the average for the December quarter stands at $4.2 per bbl compared to $6.1 per bbl in the September quarter.

The margins for 92 RON gasoline plummeted to as low as $1.5-2 per bbl on account of weaker demand and oversupply.

Unless the temperatures fall further, the weakness in GRMs could continue, according to analysts.

“We expect GRM of PSU refiners to be in the range of negative $0.7-3.8 per bbl and decline by $9.3-16.1 per bbl YoY in December quarter,” said said Gagan Dixit, analyst, Elara Capital. “We expect 15 oil & gas firms under our coverage to report a 36 per cent YoY decrease in PAT and 29 per cent decrease in EBITDA, primarily due to weak refining margins.”"
11,2019-01-06,GAIL,"After months of delay, India will Monday launch the second auction of 14 blocks for prospecting of oil and gas in an attempt to raise domestic output to cut imports.

Officials said the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bid round-II, with 14 blocks measuring 29,333 square kilometres in aggregrate area on offer, will be launched by Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday.

India had in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration.

Under this policy, called open acreage licensing policy or OALP, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.

The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.

The two window of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31.

The first OALP round was launched in 2017 and bids came in by May 2018. EoIs for second round closed on May 15, 2018 and the blocks were supposed to be put for auction by June but the round was for reasons unknown delayed.

In the meanwhile, EoIs in the third window also closed on November 15, 2018 with as many as 11 blocks measuring 21,507 sq km and five coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks being sought for.

Officials said after the delay in putting on offer the blocks sought in second window, it was expected that blocks in second and third window would be put on offer together.

But the government appears to have gone with putting on offer only the 14 blocks sought in the second window.

The blocks on offer in OALP-II include one in deep waters of Krishna Godavari basin and five shallow water blocks - two each in Andaman and Kutch basin and one in Mahanadi basin. Eight onland blocks - four in Mahanadi basin, two in Cambay and one each in Rajasthan and Cauvery are on offer.

Officials said the 14 blocks are estimated to hold in-place resource of 12,609 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas.

In the third window, EoIs have been put for one deepsea block in Mahanadi basin and one shallow water area in Kerala Konkan basin. Nine onland areas - three in Assam, two in Cambay and one each in Mahanadi, Rajasthan, KG and Bengal-Purnea basin have been sought.

In OALP-1, mining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two.

State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) won one block each.

The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration prior to OALP.

Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.

Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10 per cent to 67 per cent by 2022 and to half by 2030.

Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 81 per cent of its oil needs.

The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

The government prior to this had been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.

Under this, 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospect."

The Nifty50 index had a volatile day on Wednesday, as it drifted towards the 10,750 level in the second half of the session and recovered sharply to 10,865 level by the end. The index has got stuck in a range and buying emerged on every dip while Nifty took support at the 50-day EMA.

26,2019-01-15,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Bhuwan Chandra Tripathi will likely get his tenure extended as the chairman of state-run GAIL after his second five-year term ends in July this year, according to sources.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has recommended extending Tripathi’s term until his retirement, which is due in January 2020, sources said. The recommendation will now go to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, or ACC, for approval.

Tripathi has been the CMD of GAIL since August 2009, before which he held the position of Director (Marketing) for about two years. It’s rare for the chief of a state-run firm to have such long stints that straddle governments led by different parties.

GAIL, India’s biggest natural gas marketer and transporter, has been in the middle of some of the key initiatives of the Modi government. It is building a 3400-km gas pipeline, which would bring cleaner fuel to much of eastern India and help revive three fertilizer units along the way.

Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBI Cap Securities in an interaction with ETNow said, “Certain auto ancillaries can deliver better results as we go forward partly due to their own expansion plans.

Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice-President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking said, “A lot of smart money is staying away from pharma because nothing specifically is happening even though there was anticipation about the pharma cycle bottoming out and there may be a chance of uptick in overall pharma and new additions. But that definitely did not happen.

“Smart money is staying away and after the deep corrections in October, November in the Indian markets, there are many opportunities available now which were highly expensive in the beginning of the year 2018,” he said in an interaction with ETNow.

32,2019-01-18,GAIL,"New Delhi: GAIL is planning to terminate Rs 270 crore pipe laying contracts it awarded IL&FS last year as the financially-troubled contractor is unable to make progress, delaying the Prime Minister’s pet pipeline project that would take natural gas to much of eastern India via his constituency Varanasi, sources said.

GAIL is building the 2,655-km natural gas pipeline, called Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga, which crosses Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha and connects several key cities on the way. The pipeline, whose completion is crucial to the planned revival of three fertilizer units in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, will also introduce millions of homes, vehicles, shops and factories to the cleaner fuel.

IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Ltd, a unit of the troubled IL&FS, had won two contracts last year to lay pipelines: 160 km in the Dobhi-Durgapur stretch and 100 km in the Bokaro-Angul stretch of the Urja Ganga project. Other contractors have the mandate for the remainder of two stretches, which are together about 850 km long. The 260-km pipeline contract is worth about Rs 270 crore. Gail had aimed to ready the two stretches by the end of 2019 but IL&FS’ sluggishness could become a hurdle.

GAIL is planning to take away the two contracts from IL&FS and award these to others for speedy completion of the project, a source said, adding that fresh tenders for the two stretches will be issued by the end of next month.

“Due to its financial crisis, IL&FS is unable to pay its subcontractors and suppliers. So, these sub-contractors have stopped working and vendors have stopped supplies. This can delay the entire project,” the source said. Some IL&FS executives linked to the two contracts have also quit, sources said. IL&FS declined to comment for the story.

The problem began in November, and GAIL has since written multiple letters to IL&FS and held meetings with its executives to sort this out. GAIL has now concluded that new contractors will have to be brought in to meet project deadlines, sources said

39,2019-01-21,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Indian Oil and Gail are still evaluating plans to invest in a Rs 6,000-crore liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal being developed by the Adani Group in Odisha. The plan was announced in 2016.

According to a preliminary pact signed in September 2016, the Adani Group had agreed to give away half of equity stake in the LNG terminal to Indian Oil and Gail. The two state-run companies were to also book 3 million tonnes and 1.5 million tonnes a year of regasification capacity, respectively, in the 5-million-tonne terminal.

The PSUs have gone ahead with their plans on regasification capacity but have yet to take a final call on their equity investments.

“Gail and Indian Oil Corp are jointly carrying out techno-commercial and legal due-diligence studies,” Gail said in an emailed response to ET’s query on the status of planned investments in the LNG terminal. Indian Oil, too, said it was carrying out due diligence in the matter.

It is unclear why the government firms have taken so long to make up their mind on investing in the project. A spokesperson for the Adani Group said construction orders have been placed and the LNG terminal is on track.

Adanis have roped in French energy giant Total to invest in Dhamra LNG terminal. “The companies will jointly develop various regasification LNG terminals, including Dhamra LNG, on the East coast of India,” the two companies said in a statement in October 2018. The Adani Group didn’t offer an update on Total’s investment plans for Dhamra LNG terminal.

According to the 2016 pact, the country’s top refiner IOC and top gas transporter Gail were to hold 39% and 11% equity stakes, respectively, in the Dhamra LNG terminal. The Adani Group was to hold the remaining 50%. IOC and Adani were to give away 1% each to a financial institution at a later stage, reducing their stakes to 38% and 49%, respectively. Indian Oil’s 5-mt-a-year LNG terminal at Ennore in TN is almost ready to go on stream."

44,2019-01-22,GAIL,"Oil producing countries have to realise that if Indian economy continues to grow, demand will continue to grow and it is a win-win situation for both. BC Tripathi, CMD, GAIL, Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, IOC and MK Surana, Chairman, HPCL, talk to Supriya Shrinate of ET Now in Davos. 

Edited excerpts: 

Supriya Shrinate: Even though the government is missing in action at Davos this time, it seems the corporate veterans are all out here!
BC Tripathi, GAIL: Well we are here. It is a very much a government in action. All three Maharatna company are here and we are trying to see what new thing is happening in the global economy. What are the new developments in the space of technology, in climate change and in the energy space at large. We are looking for new avenues, new businesses that people are talking about and this is a wonderful place to interact with the people and to find out how global geopolitics is going to affect the economy and the energy space.


Supriya Shrinate: It is about India’s energy security. You run IOC and it is India’s largest oil retailer. Do you think oil at about $60 a barrel is the new normal? Most projections by the IMF and everybody else are based on that. Is oil going to stay at those levels? 
Sanjiv Singh, IOC: It is extremely difficult to predict whether it will stay at this level. But one thing is very true that India’s energy demands are going to increase because we are growing at a very robust rate. While our commitments towards environment or a sustainable affordable energy is extremely essential for the country, we have operated at more than $100 a barrel also. We had been operating at a much lower level also. Nearly 84-85% of our oil is imported today. It is difficult to say but we do not see the prices going up very much.


Supriya Shrinate: When prices are volatile and stay up, players like yourselves get questioned when oil prices are high. When oil prices were lower globally, your retail prices did not come down substantially. I know the exchequer and all those things are concerned. But what would you say to people who get anxious when oil prices go down but not for the consumer.
MK Surana, HPCL: We need to take care of all our stakeholders which includes the consumers, shareholders and the government. Actually the oil pricing and its correlation to the international prices and the domestic prices are a misunderstood phenomenon because it is more complex than what people normally think. There is a timing impact, there is a foreign exchange impact, there is a time of processing the oil. 

By the time it gets sold, there are inventory gains losses issues. What we try to do is ensure that we pass on the international variation to consumers and at the same time, see to it that the consumers are not extremely inconvenienced.

To that extent, we have tried to balance the two to raise the prices to the extent we can and bring it down also. Since 4th October, it has been coming down except last week when we saw crude prices going up.


Supriya Shrinate: A lot of people will turn around and tell you that the exchequer has been taken into consideration as far as India’s oil prices are concerned and not the consumer. But why should excise duty not go down?
Sanjiv Singh, IOC: Excise duty is not in our control but many a times, we try to see what percentage crude prices have fallen and whether the product prices have also fallen in the same ratio or not. There are two things which we miss sometimes. Number one is exchange rate. Again in recent times when the prices were falling, the rupee was also falling which had probably more impact than the change in the oil price. 

Secondly, the prices which we work out is linked with the global prices of the product and not the crude. Within the product retail prices, there is a substantial fixed component, close to 50% which includes the shipping cost, excise duties and things like that which are more or less independent of the product prices at global market. 

So there is no way that domestic oil prices will fall in the same proportion to the crude. As Mr Surana was also saying, in the recent past when the product prices were falling in the international market, the same trend followed in the domestic market also.


Supriya Shrinate: The US has been able to get shale gas to the negotiating table. Every time global prices go up, they manoeuvre shale production. How close or far are we from such a scenario?
BC Tripathi, GAIL: If you talk about the energy security for India, we need to understand the natural resources available to us. To what extent we can produce domestically is the first priority which government is focusing. All our upstream sister companies are focusing on that. But the major impact which we can probably make is how as a large consuming country, we are able to make impact in the international arena and how the voice of the second largest consumer in the world is being felt by major producing countries like OPEC, Russia and US.

In the recent past, right from the Prime Minister to all levels, the government has been making a pitch and that is making an impact on how global prices go. That will have an impact on India because we are still 80% plus import dependent and will remain so in foreseeable future. 

But if we are able to make our presence felt and convince and pressurise the world to bring in balanced price -- which we call the reasonable price -- that will ensure our energy sustainability because at the end of the day we will have to see what is available in India that can be produced. 

We will have to remain import dependent but we need to make a bigger pitch and the voice should be heard. The other important thing is the oil producing countries have to realise that if Indian economy continues to grow, demand will continue to grow. We will also create demand for them. It is basically a win-win for both the sides and that will be the major area of focus."

46,2019-01-24,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Gail India has filed an application before the National Company Law Tribunal, opposing a resolution plan that Reliance Industries has proposed in partnership with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company for Alok Industries. In its petition before the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT, the state-run gas transporter said the proposal had ignored its claim of Rs 506 crore as an operational creditor to the bankrupt textile manufacturer.

Alok Industries is one of the top 12 loan default cases in India and under insolvency proceedings for the past year and a half. NCLT cases are supposed to be resolved within a 270-day period.

ET has obtained a copy of the application. Senior advocate Sudhir Nanavati, along with Prachiti Shah and Akshat Khare, represented Gail India at the NCLT.

Last year, Gail filed another application demanding its recognition as an operation creditor. The matter was reserved on December 7 for order.

Alok Industries’ resolution professional had initially declined Gail’s claim to be recognised as operational creditor. This has “jeopardised the entire investment of (the) applicant for ensuring availability of gas to (the) corporate debtor,” the latest application said.

The Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT is scheduled to hear a series of Alok Industries-related matters on Friday.

Operational creditors are those who supply goods and services. The resolution plan for Alok Industries proposes to make full payments to such creditors with claims only up to Rs 3 lakh, according to Gail’s application.

There are about 55 financial creditors to the company.

Gail said the dues were from 2014 to 2016."

The joint ventures are also likely to enable Coal India inject coal bed methane into the proposed Urja Ganga gas pipeline that aims to meet energy requirements of 40 districts and 2,600 villages covering Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal.

In June last year, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had waived the requirement for procuring separate licences from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas for taking up coal bed methane projects on its lease hold areas.

Following the development, the world’s largest coal producer lined up two coal bed methane projects at an estimated investment of Rs 3,000 crore.

The first project will be undertaken by Coal India subsidiary, Bharat Coking Coal, at Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand. This block is estimated to hold methane reserves of 25 billion cubic meters and is expected to start production two years after the project is initiated.

The second project at Ranigunj in West Bengal is to be undertaken by Eastern Coalfields. The block holds around 3 billion cubic meter of coal bed methane that can be viably extracted and sold.

1,2019-02-03,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-owned oil firms' capital expenditure has hit a four-year low with PSUs such as ONGC and IOC planning to invest Rs 93,693 crore in oil and gas exploration, refining and petrochemicals in the 2019-20 fiscal year.

The capital expenditure outlay of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Indian Oil Corp (IOC), GAIL (India) Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd and their subsidiaries is the lowest since 2014-15, according to Union Budget for 2019-20 documents.

Oil PSUs had proposed an investment of Rs 89,335 crore in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, but will end up investing Rs 94,438 crore. This is lower than Rs 132,003 crore invested in 2017-18, Rs 104,426 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 97,223 crore invested in 2015-16.

They had invested Rs 89,180 crore in 2014-15.

The decline in spending comes at a time when the government is emphasising on raising domestic output to cut costly oil imports.

India had spent USD 109.1 billion on oil and gas imports in 2017-18 while the same for the current fiscal are projected to rise to about USD 130 billion.

ONGC, according to Budget documents, is projected to spend Rs 32,921 crore in 2019-20, down from Rs 33,007 crore in the current year. IOC's planned capex will see almost 2 per cent reduction at Rs 25,083 crore.

Oil refining and fuel marketing companies HPCL and BPCL will, however, see a rise in capex at Rs 9,500 crore and Rs 7,900 crore respectively.

Gas utility GAIL has proposed 10 per cent less capex at Rs 5,339 crore.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of ONGC, has proposed 15.5 per cent lower capex at Rs 5,161 crore.

""India's import dependence on crude oil and natural gas has been a source of big concern to our Government. While we have taken a large number of measures to moderate the increasing demand through the usage of bio-fuel and alternate technologies, urgent action is needed to increase hydrocarbon production to reduce imports,"" Finance Minister Piyush Goyal had said in his Budget speech in Lok Sabha on February 1.

He had stated that a high-level inter-ministerial committee has made several specific recommendations, including transforming the system of bidding for exploration, changing from revenue sharing to exploration programme for Category II and III basins.

""The Government is in the process of implementing these recommendations,"" he had stated.

The BJP-led NDA government had moved from production sharing contracts, where acreage for exploration of oil and gas was allocated to firms offering the largest work programmes, to revenue sharing contracts, where the firm offering highest revenue to the government was given the blocks.

Now it seems the government is reverting to the old regime, at least for areas in some basins.

India has 26 sedimentary basins measuring 3.14 million square kilometers. These are classified into four categories: Category-I basins where commercial production has been established like Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery, Assam Shelf and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt; Category-II basins with known accumulation of hydrocarbons but no commercial production so far such as Kutch, Mahanadi-NEC (North East Coast), Andaman-Nicobar and Kerala-Konkan-Lakshadweep.

Category-III basins have hydrocarbon reserves that are considered geologically prospective such as in Himalayan Foreland Basin, Ganga Basin, Vindhyan basin, Saurashtra basin, Kerela Konkan basin, Bengal basin; and Category-IV which are the ones having uncertain potential which may be prospective by analogy with similar basins in the world. These include Karewa basin, Spiti-Zanskar basin, Satpura–South Rewa–Damodar basin, Chhattisgarh basin, Narmada basin, Deccan Syneclise, Bhima-Kaladgi, Bastar basin, Pranhita Godavari basin and Cuddapah basin.

Deepak Mahurkar, Partner and Leader India Oil & Gas, PwC said: ""The government has acknowledged the need for reforms in the upstream industry to overcome the issue of significant energy import dependence. Pure exploration contracts are appearing to be issued, which will be a new dimension to India's E&P sector.""

K Ravichandran, Senior Vice President, Group Head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said the announcement on the impending changes in bidding framework for new oil and gas blocks in order to boost domestic production will be a positive development for the sector."

Swiss Tax Letters Leave Indians in a Catch-22 Situation
Since last week, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (FTA) has started shooting letters to these customers, seeking their consent — an old ritual under the Swiss law — before revealing their account information to Indian authorities.

They will have to respond in ten days. The development has put these people in a Catch-22 situation. If they give their consent, it would be an admission of their guilt of holding undisclosed funds in Swiss accounts. But, if they don’t, they would find it difficult to prepare their defence strategy as they won’t know the nature of information which is shared with India.

7,2019-02-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-run GAIL is expected to report a tepid set of numbers in December quarter results on a sequential basis. GAIL has been hurt by lower contribution from its gas marketing segment in the wake of adverse economics of the US LNG volumes.

Kotak Institutional Research expects the state-run company to report 21 per cent QoQ decline in adjusted net profit Rs 1,530 crore led by sharp fall in gas marketing contribution due to weaker economics of the US LNG volumes and lower petchem profits amid planned shutdown, which it says will partially be offset by higher profits on LPG/LHC production.

Edelweiss Securities expects revenue growth to slow down QoQ with flat volumes across segments offsetting higher realisations due to higher LPG prices and depreciating rupee.

Ebitda is seen falling 3 per cent QoQ, with sharp decline in petchem earnings (down 45.7 per cent QoQ) and trading (down 7 per cent QoQ), offsetting higher LPG earnings (up 8.5 per cent QoQ).

ET first reported on January 18 that GAIL was planning to cancel some contracts awarded to IL&FS last year as the contractor wasn’t making much progress due to its financial problems. 

“In a swift move to safeguard project schedule of the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga natural gas pipeline to eastern India states, GAIL (India) Limited as the owner and operator of the prestigious project under execution has offloaded the pipe laying contract from M/s IL&FS due to poor project progress driven on account of acute financial crisis,” GAIL said in a statement.

14,2019-02-07,GAIL,"HDFC Securities has a buy call on GAIL (India) with a target price of Rs 406.

The current market price of GAIL (India) is Rs 339.25.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when GAIL (India) price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage: 
(1) Rising supply from Shale gas fields and associated gas from shale oil fields and (2) Large number of LNG liquefaction terminal to come on-stream towards the fag end of CY19 that will boost LNG exports; will keep be HH prices subdued in the near term and enable the company to easily swap more cargoes. GAIL has already swapped 76 (nearly 87 per cent) out of 87 cargoes from US for CY19, thus we do not see US LNG as a stress point.

GAIL has signed Gas Supply and Purchase Agreements (GSPA) with 6 fertiliser plants for nearly 12mmscmd of NG. Along with these fertiliser plants, the demand from the 6 CGD network will ensure a healthy utilisation of the upcoming JHBDPL.

The management expects a 15-20 per cent upside in tariff from the current provisional tariff of Rs 25.46/mmbtu and Rs 53.65/mmbtu for HVJ-GREP-DVPL and DVPL- II/GREP-II respectively. These two pipelines contribute 70 per cent in transmission revenue and transmit 65 per cent of total NG volumes. 20 per cent increase in tariff will increase GAIL’s FY20 EBIDTA by 6.9 per cent from Rs108.4bn to Rs 116bn.

Our SOTP target is Rs 406 (7.5x Dec-20E EV/e for the more stable Gas and LPG tran. busi. and 5.0x EV/e to more volatile gas marketing busi. And 6.5x EV/e for the cyclical petchem and LPG/LHC busi.), Rs 73 for investments and Rs 18 per share for CWIP. Maintain BUY."
16,2019-02-08,GAIL,"KOLKATA: Coal India and Gail have formed a committee of senior executives to work jointly on coal bed methane projects of Coal India on its blocks. They are considering a joint venture in which Coal India would be producing the gas while Gail would be marketing it through its network.

Coal India chairman AK Jha and Gail chairman B C Tripathi met in Kolkata on Wednesday to discuss the proposed projects, company executives said.

The proposed joint venture is likely to enable Coal India inject coal bed methane into the proposed Urja Ganga gas pipeline that aims to meet energy requirements of 40 districts and 2,600 villages covering Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal.

A Coal India executive said Gail India is interested in downstream processing, transport and selling the gas in bulk to industries. Gail is into transport of bulk gases and has its own distribution network including pipeline which could be used to sell the produce.

“Gail can also help Coal India supply the produce in eastern states via the Urja Ganga gas pipeline project since it is being undertaken by a consortium of state-run companies headed by Gail,” the executive said.

In June last year, the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs waived the requirement for procuring separate licences from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas for taking up coal bed methane projects on its lease hold areas. Following the waiver, Coal India has already lined up investments of Rs 3000 crore for its coal bed methane projects.

The first project will be undertaken by Coal India subsidiary, Bharat Coking Coal, at Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand. This block is estimated to hold methane reserves of 25 billion cubic meters and is expected to start production two years after the project is initiated.

The second project, at Raniganj in West Bengal, is to be undertaken by Eastern Coalfields."
15,2019-02-08,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Gail has set up a satellite liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Bhubaneswar to supply local customers in the absence of a gas pipeline — an innovative model that may get replicated by other city gas distributors eager to quickly start supply in new licence areas where gas pipelines are yet to reach.

City gas licences have proliferated lately in the country: the downstream regulator offered 86 licences last year, and the process to award another 50 is under way. Just a year ago, licences were limited to 92 geographical areas that covered just a fifth of country’s population. After the current round of licensing is complete in a month or so, 70% of the country’s population will have been covered.

But taking gas to people can take much longer than distributing licences. Gail, which has a licence to supply gas to Bhubaneswar, decided last year not to wait for the gas pipeline, which is expected to connect the city next year. It started using gas cascades to supply natural gas to homes, shops and vehicles. This involved bringing in gas cascades from Andhra Pradesh to serve local demand, which is about 3,800 kg a day.

Last month, Gail switched its supply method. It started operating a satellite LNG storage and regasification terminal in Bhubaneswar, which can cater to 3,000 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and 1,000 homes. This is the first such operation in the country but satellite LNG terminals are quite popular in several countries to supply gas to areas where laying gas pipelines are difficult or economically unviable.

Gail’s terminal contains two verticals tanks of 20 kilo litres each, and low pressure vaporiser for supply to homes, and high pressure vaporiser for CNG vehicles. Each tank has to be replenished every 3-4 days by LNG brought by road from Gujarat port.

“This is a short-term arrangement until the Urja Ganga gas pipeline reaches Bhubaneswar. Using LNG station is better than using gas cascades as the latter involves higher transportation cost and increased delivery uncertainty,” a Gail executive said.

Sourcing gas via satellite LNG station is much cheaper than using cascades. Pipeline gas, however, is much cheaper than both.

“This can be a model for other city gas distributors as well who would want to start operation and tap customers before the main gas pipeline has reached their licence areas,” said the executive.

Many companies, which have obtained licences in the recent round, do plan to start serving customer this year. Indian Oil Corp, which has more than a dozen licences individually and in joint venture, plans to start CNG stations by the middle of this year in its new licence areas. It is tying up with Gail for supply and plans to use cascades to ferry gas."

20,2019-02-10,GAIL,"State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has emerged as the biggest bidder for city gas licences in the 10th bid round that also saw Adani Group, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Indraprastha Gas Ltd as the other prominent bidders, according to oil regulator PNGRB.

IOC, the country's top oil refiner and fuel marketing company that is looking to diversify into natural gas distribution business big time, bid for licences to retail CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to households in 35 out of the 50 cities put on offer for the 10th round and another seven in partnership with Adani Gas.

Adani Gas bid for 19 cities on its own and seven in partnership with IOC, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) said after opening of bids between February 7 and 9.

HPCL, a subsidiary of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), emerged as the third largest bidder, putting in bids for 24 towns and cities while Gujarat-based Torrent Gas applied for 20 areas.

Indraprastha Gas Ltd, which retails CNG and piped cooking gas in the national capital, put in bids for 15 areas while Bharat Gas Resources Ltd, a subsidiary of state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), bid for 14 cities.

State-owned GAIL India Ltd, which is country's biggest gas marketer and transporting company, put in bids for just 10 areas through its subsidiary GAIL Gas Ltd.

In the last bid round, it had managed to bag just 5 out of the 86 Geographical Areas (GAs) put on offer.

In the previous 9th round which was awarded just a few months back, Adani Gas had won city gas licences for 13 cities on its own and nine in a joint venture with IOC.

IOC had won licences for seven cities on its own. Bharat Gas Resources Ltd had walked away with 11 cities while Torrent Gas had made 10 winning bids.

Sholagasco Pvt Ltd bid for 9 out of the 50 GAs put on offer in the 10th round while Gujarat Gas bid for seven and Petronet LNG Ltd put in bids for five areas.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) had at the close of bidding on February 5 stated about 225 bids were received for licence to retail CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to households in 50 GAs offered in the 10th City Gas Distribution (CGD) bidding round. It had not revealed the names of the bidders then.

Eight out of the 50 GAs received single bids, with IOC being the only applicant for six areas in Bihar and Jharkhand while other two single bidders were Bharat Gas Resources Ltd and GAIL Gas Ltd for one area each.

Stating that the licences would be awarded by the month end, PNGRB had on February 5 said, ""Once awarded, it is envisaged that this initiative would help in creating a robust infrastructure by bringing an investment of about Rs 50,000 crore, generate employment and play a significant role in achieving the shift towards a gas-based economy, with natural gas as the next generation, cheaper and environment-friendly fossil fuel.""

In the 10th round of CGD, 50 GAs, covering 124 districts -- 112 complete and 12 part -- in 14 states were put on offer in November 2018. The round would extend city gas coverage to 18 per cent of India's geographical area and 24 per cent of its population, the regulator said.

Together with past rounds, CGD network would now extend to 400 districts, covering 70 per cent of the population.

In the 10th round, bidders were asked to quote the number of CNG stations to be set up and the number of domestic cooking gas connections to be given in the first eight years of operation. Also, they had to quote the length of pipeline to be laid in the GA and the tariff proposed for city gas and compressed natural gas (CNG), according to PNGRB.

The bid round comes within months of the close of the 9th round, which was the biggest ever CGD licensing round where 86 permits for selling CNG and piped cooking in 174 districts in 22 states and union territories were offered.

The government is targeting to raise the share of natural gas in the primary energy basket to 15 per cent from the current 6.2 per cent in the next few years.

The bid rounds are also aimed at meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of giving piped cooking gas connection to 1 crore households, roughly triple the current size, by 2020.

Cities offered in the 10th round include Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, Muzaffarpur in Bihar, Kaithal in Haryana, Mysore and Gulbarga in Karnataka, Allapuza and Kollam in Kerala, Ujjain, Gwalior and Morena in Madhya Pradesh, Jhansi and Basti in Uttar Pradesh, Firozpur and Hoshiarpur in Punjab, Ajmer and Jalor in Rajasthan, Nainital in Uttarakhand and Darjeeling and Howrah in West Bengal."
21,2019-02-11,GAIL,"MUMBAI: A set of marquee asset management companies, family offices, banks and insurers are said to be interested in participating in the Brookfield-led infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) that is buying the lossmaking East West Pipeline Ltd (EWPL), earlier known as Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd, for an enterprise valuation of Rs 13,000 crore ($2 billion).

ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company and the family office of the Poonawallas of Serum Institute are likely to join the Canadian investor in India Infrastructure Trust, the vehicle that is being created for the acquisition to take over the 1,400 km common carrier pipeline from Kakinada on the east coast to Bharuch in Gujarat, said people aware of the development. Three or four more ultra-high net worth individuals like Uday Kotak or their family offices too are expected to join the consortium, added the people mentioned above.

Negotiations are believed to be ongoing to include private sector banks like ICICI or state-run Bank of Baroda too. This will be the first time a private pipeline is getting monetised in India.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is expected to give its approval in the coming weeks, following which the InvIT will get formed and the much-awaited transaction will close this month end. The Competition Commission of India had approved the transaction in September 2018.

The Rs 13,000 crore will be evenly split between equity and debt. Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are providing the financing. The other investors together are likely to put in Rs 1,000-1,200 crore as equity contribution and will own 10-15% of the asset. Of the five, the two financial institutions are contributing the maximum. Brookfield will remain the sponsor with an 85-90% economic interest and will run the asset for 20 years.

As part of the agreement, Reliance Industries Ltd will buy back the asset after 20 years, said the sources. The company will also sign a commercial agreement with Brookfield assuring a volume commitment—a take or pay contract in industry parlance—based on which the cash flows and returns calculations have been made. Analysts estimate that the steady cash-flow generating business should yield a 12-13% internal rate of return (IRR), excluding leverage.

Sebi guidelines stipulate at least five non-sponsor investors or unit holders for privately placed InvITs. The instrument will be listed but privately placed to institutions and HNIs, much like listed nonconvertible debentures. “It is listed technically in the form of a stock exchange registration but there is no trading as only four-five people own it,” said an executive on condition of anonymity.

The pipeline housed under EWPL is being transferred to an entity called Pipeline Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd (PIPL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Holding Pvt. Ltd (RIHPL). That’s a holding arm of Mukesh Ambani and his family, the promoters of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).



EWPL has built and operates the critical pipeline to transport natural gas produced by Reliance-BP from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin on the east coast and links to users on the west coast. It also transports gas from other sources including RLNG (regasified liquefied natural gas) terminals along the stretch of the pipeline and is connected to pipelines of other operators such as state-run GAIL (India) Ltd and Gujarat State Petronet Ltd for onward delivery nationwide.

Reliance, ICICI Prudential, Bank of Baroda and Kotak didn’t respond to queries. Brookfield and the Poonawallas declined to comment. JM Financial and Ambit are advisors to the transaction. ET was the first to report on the transaction in its September 17 edition.


UNIQUE DEAL
The Poonawallas of Serum Institute, India’s leading vaccine maker, have been investing in real estate, equities and art to deploy the family wealth, estimated at $8.3 billion. Adar Poonawalla, the family scion, has also been backing young companies like pharmacy chains Wellness Forever and microfinance company Svasti.

“For Mukesh Ambani, it’s a great way of monetising an asset and deleverage. Brookfield and the sponsors of the trust will get cash flows from the pipeline, which will give them their desired yields,” said a Reliance executive on condition of anonymity. “InvITs are tax-efficient vehicles. This will be a single-asset InvIT but Brookfield is keen to create an energy platform.” It has acquired a pipeline in Brazil for $5 billion.

EWPL had operational revenue of Rs 884 crore and posted a net loss of Rs 715 crore in the year ended March 2018. The company was bleeding due to high interest expenses, which were almost equal to its revenue, and depreciation costs. It had a total outstanding debt of Rs 12,715.5 crore as of March, a lion’s share of which is from the shareholders, while its plant, property and equipment had an asset value of around Rs 11,040 crore. EWPL had separately disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was hiving off its investment division to immediate holding company Sikka Ports.

The pipeline, Sikka Ports & Terminals Ltd (SPTL) and Reliance Utilities and Power Pvt Ltd (RUPPL) are key companies in Ambani’s privately held RIHPL Group and their operations are critical for Reliance Industries as they are closely integrated with its facilities in Jamnagar, Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat, and with its KG-D6 gas fields. The facilities cater exclusively to RIL’s existing facilities as well as its expansion in the petrochemicals and refining business.

“EWPL’s cash flow is sensitive to the volume of gas available for transportation. Low volume reduces capacity utilisation and revenue, thus impacting cash accrual,” said a Crisil note last November.

There has been a significant drop in RIL’s gas production from its KG-D6 block over the past few years, which has constrained its cash flows."

27,2019-02-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government will launch an additional offering of Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on February 14 to raise at least Rs 3,500 crore, officials said Tuesday.

The ETF sale would be for a single day, in which both institutional and retail investors can participate, they said.

""The additional offering of Bharat-22 ETF would be on February 14. This is an on-tap issuance. The base issue size has been fixed at Rs 3,500 crore, with an option to retain any additional subscription,"" one of the officials told PTI.

The proceeds from the ETF sale would help the government move towards meeting the Rs 80,000 crore disinvestment target set for the current fiscal.

So far, the government has mopped up approximately Rs 36,000 crore by paring minority stake in public sector companies, and through ETFs.

Conventionally, the follow-on fund offer (FFO) of an ETF remains open for four days in which the first day of the sale is reserved for anchor investors. The next three days are kept open for subscription from retail and other institutional investors.

Since this is an additional on-tap offering of Bharat-22 ETF, the issue would open for a single day for both institutional and retail buyers.

The government has so far raised Rs 22,900 crore through the Bharat-22 ETF. While Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018.

The central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) that are part of the ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Other constituents include Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

Also, the government's strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T, held through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), has been put in the ETF basket.

This would be the second ETF offering by the government in the current fiscal which ends in March. In November last year, the government had raised Rs 17,300 crore through a follow-on offer of another exchange traded fund -- CPSE ETF, which comprises shares of 11 public sector enterprises.

26,2019-02-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: India’s top three mutual funds, which manage over Rs 9 lakh crore in debt and equity assets, added a number of PSU stocks to their schemes in January, as valuation discounts of many state-operated enterprises vis-à-vis Nifty widened to more than a half.

While India’s largest HDFC AMC was seen buying PSU stocks such as Union Bank, NTPC, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC and Punjab National Bank, second largest fund ICICI Prudential added shares of Power Grid, NHPC, GAIL, SBI and HPCL. SBI Mutual Fund, the third largest, bought fresh shares of SBI, NTPC and ONGC, among others, data compiled from database Ace Mutual Fund showed.

PSU stocks have had a poor start to 2019, with the benchmark BSE PSU Index falling 4.58 per cent in January and another 3.26 per cent so far in February. This was against a 0.52 per cent rise in BSE Sensex in January and 0.79 per cent jump so far this month. Analysts say some of the PSUs look very attractive due to lower valuations.

HDFC AMC bought 76.49 lakh shares of Union Bank in January, as the exposure of its schemes to the PSU bank rose to Rs 398 crore at the end of January from Rs 348 crore last month. This was HDFC’s top buy in January in terms of number of shares purchased.



Out of the top 10 stocks HDFC AMC bought (in terms of number of shares) during the month, five were PSUs. The fund house added 50.49 lakh shares of NTPC, even as the total value of its investment on the counter declined to Rs 3,783 crore at the end of January from Rs 3,961 crore at the end of December. The fund house also bought additional shares in Bharat Electronics, REC and Indian Bank.

CLSA, which showed preference for PSU stocks such as ONGC, NTPC, SBI and Coal India last month, argued that while India was the only emerging market trading above its historical average, its state-owned enterprises were trading close to their all-time lows at a forward PE of 8.8 times. Their valuations relative the Nifty were compelling at a 50 per cent discount, it said. 

ICICI Prudential bought 2.14 crore shares in NTPC, raising total holding to 43.21 crore at the end of January, up 5.2 per cent in a month. Its holding in ONGC jumped 7.78 per cent, or by 2 crore shares, to 25.70 crore shares. In value terms, it held Rs 6,000 crore worth of NTPC shares and Rs 3,900 crore worth of ONGC shares as of January 31.



In BHEL, the fund house raising its holding by 50 per cent. IOC and Coal India were the other PSUs where the fund raised its holding. 

""Coal India is a proverbial value play with 8.5 per cent dividend yield. December quarter earnings will be the best in 18 quarters. At 11 times PE, I have never seen it cheaper. Obviously, there is an overhang that the government may sell some of its stake. But PSU stocks such as ONGC, NTPC, GMDC and Coal India are trading at abysmal levels. Once we are through these elections, PSUs will create a lot of wealth in the second half of 2019. Because they will then be focussed on governance,” Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL told ET Now. 



SBI MF was seen buying shares in SBI, NTPC and ONGC during the month. “Concerns over rising fiscal deficit, cross-holdings and PSUs being called to do national duties were the key reasons for the de-rating. However, a lot of the bad news is in the price, and select PSUs now offer favourable risk-reward, especially as we see the risk of slowing domestic flows driving a market derating,” CLSA said in January note."

29,2019-02-14,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: India is keen to collaborate with the US department of energy to source technology for coal gasification to tap into the country’s large reserves, improve its fuel efficiency and reduce dependence on imports.

The move was triggered after recent attempts by the government and private players to set up their own coal gasification plants failed. A high-level meeting chaired by NITI Aayog member VK Saraswat was held recently with officials from US department of energy.

A senior government official told ET that the meeting was called because the government is keen on global partnerships to achieve coal gasification at lower costs and integrate technology for smarter handling of the fuel in an economically viable way.

“India is well endowed with vast reserves of coal which are vital in meeting the country’s energy needs. Coal gasification is one of the prominent areas that need to be looked at, being one of the cost-effective options that would also bring down import dependence,” the official said.

According to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the discussions are in preliminary stage and the challenge for India is the high ash content in indigenous coal. “In this regard, highend technology and expertise are required for coal gasification in India,” he said, pointing out that most US companies too have limited experience in dealing with high ash content coal.

Sources present at the meeting told ET that Mark Menezes, under-secretary to the US department of energy, outlined various initiatives being undertaken by the National Petroleum Council on different areas where carbon dioxide may be used.

Making a detailed presentation on coal gasification, Atanu Mukherjee, president of MN Dastur, one of the largest independent engineering consultancy services in the world, said at the meeting that the idea is to bring coal to the technology rather taking technology to the coal.

“The primary efforts would be aimed towards capturing carbon in an economically prudent manner to be implemented on a large scale,” he said, adding that the need is to make this source of energy economically viable by holistically looking at the entire chain of coal gasification.

The meeting was attended by more than two dozen people from NITI Aayog, ministry of steel, ministry of petroleum and natural gas, department of chemicals, officials from US department of energy and National Carbon Capture Center, USA, besides officials from GAIL, Engineers India and Projects & Development India and representatives from MN Dastur.

The coal requirement in India stands at around 20 million tonnes. India imports petrochemicals worth ?70,000 crore annually. This can be brought down significantly if India gets economically viable coal gasification technology."

The index formed a Hammer candle on the daily scale and a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the weekly chart. The candle setup suggests overall weakness, but the daily setup shows every meaningful dips could be bought into. Now, Nifty has to negate the formation of lower highs by moving above 10,785 to witness a bounce towards 10,850 and then 10,929 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 10,630 and then 10,580 levels.

42,2019-02-22,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Following the crowd usually takes you nowhere in the stock market. True!

But what do you make of the stocks that figure in portfolios of one after another mutual fund scheme? At the end of January, there were 78 stocks that were part of the portfolios of at least 100 mutual fund schemes, including ETFs, data from Ace Mutual Fund showed.

Don’t forget domestic institutional investors have become one of the key market drivers in recent years, having managed to cushion severe corrections every time there has been a big selloff by the overseas portfolio investors. 

Foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in Indian market, having offloaded shares worth over Rs 34,000 crore since January 2018. DIIs poured in some Rs 1,15,000 crore in the same period.

Not surprisingly, the list of 78 stocks includes the usual suspects. HDFC Bank is part of at least 535 mutual fund schemes; ICICI Bank 528 schemes, State Bank of India 465 schemes and Axis Bank 450 schemes.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

What’s worse was the junction did not have a traffic policeman either.

While traffic junctions on important roads are manned, smaller intersections are increasingly becoming a nightmare for commuters.

Data shared by Bengaluru Traffic Police show that there are 44,000 intersections in the city but the department has a staff strength of only 5,000 police personnel. Signalised and manned intersections are only 388 and 500 respectively.

“The traffic police are always blamed for the chaos on the road but there are multiple reasons which are not in our hands,” P Harishekaran, additional commissioner of police (traffic), said during a recent interaction with the media. He was referring to the lack of manpower, interdepartmental coordination and policy changes.

0,2019-03-01,GAIL,"As investors chase dividend-paying stocks on Dalal Street in an uncertain market, it has spelt good times for Bharat 22 ETF, the exchange-traded fund that made news this past fortnight with record subscription to its third tranche offering.

In a volatile market with mixed outlook, companies with a strong track records of doling out dividends are finding favour with investors.

Many of the cash-rich PSU stocks that are part of Bharat 22 are high dividend yield companies and are trading at cheaper valuations compared with the broader market. These stocks have been performing well in the past few days, aiding the performance of the ETF. 

This has come as an icing on the cake for the investors, who subscribed to the additional offering of Bharat-22 ETF during the single-day window for the third tranche. While these subscribers were offered a 5 per cent discount on the units, the scheme also delivered around 9 per cent return this past fortnight against a 0.14 per cent rise in Nifty50. 

On an absolute basis, the ETF delivered 3.87 per cent return compared with a 0.58 per cent gain in Nifty during this period.

Analysts on Dalal Street estimate Nifty50 companies to deliver an aggregate dividend yield of 2.2 per cent for financial year 2020. Within the Nifty pack, the constituents are projected to deliver an aggregate dividend yield of 2.2 per cent for FY20. The highest yield is expected from the energy sector at 5.3 per cent and lowest from the pharma basket at 0.75 per cent. Analysts expect six out of 50 Nifty stocks to have a dividend yield in excess of 5 per cent.

The PSUs that are part of Bharat 22 ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India, Nalco, Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Besides, there are three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- and private sector firms Axis Bank, ITC and L&T, where the government holds small stakes through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India or SUUTI.

Most of these are cash-rich companies with history of declaring dividends generously. Analysts expect Coal India, ONGC and IOC to deliver best dividend yields in the Nifty50 pack in excess of 5 per cent in FY20. In the midcap basket, Nalco is projected to deliver over 5 per cent dividend yield.

The Bharat 22 ETF, which is managed by ICICI Prudential AMC, tracks the BHARAT 22 Index.

“BHARAT 22 Index is available at a cheap valuation compared with the broad market indices. All the companies forming part of BHARAT 22 are high dividend yielding companies. The index constituents of BHARAT 22 have performed well in last few days, which has added to the performance of the scheme,"" said Chintan Haria, Head of Product Development and Strategy at ICICI Prudential AMC.

The government has been using the BHARAT 22 ETF for disinvesting its holdings in profitable PSUs. The government has so far raised Rs 26,400 crore through the Bharat-22 ETF – Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018 and Rs 3,500 crore this February.

BHARAT 22 ETF is exposed to six sectors with a 15 per cent cap on single stock and 20 per cent on a single sector.

ETFs are considered better investment options within the mutual fund basket because of the cost advantage they offer. Being passive funds, they charge miniscule fund management fee.

Bharat 22 ETF has a 93 per cent exposure to largecaps, which makes it a safer bet in an uncertain market. Haria says improving domestic macros are a major positive for the ETF, while favourable government policies, too, are expected to work to the advantage of some of the PSUs, eventually helping the ETF."
1,2019-03-02,GAIL,"MUMBAI: India’s weight in the MSCI Emerging Market Index is likely to fall at least by a percentage point in the next one year, causing an expected outflow of as much as $2-3 billion investment by passive funds.

Events that are going to affect India’s weight in the index include an increase in the representation of Chinese mainland shares, addition of Argentina and Saudi Arabia, a modification in the calculation methodology for foreign ownership limits and erosion in the market value of Indian stocks. The country could take steps to reduce the impact of some of these and it should do that immediately, said fund managers.

Global index provider MSCI on Thursday announced that it would quadruple the weightage of Chinese mainland shares in the MSCI benchmark in three steps. It will increase the inclusion factor of Chinese large-cap stocks to 20% from the current 5%, with increments of 5 percentage points each in May, August and November.

On completion of this, the weightage of Chinese mainland stocks in the MSCI Emerging Market Index will jump to 3.3% from roughly 0.7% at present. India’s weightage will come down by 32 basis points, or 0.32 percentage point, resulting in an investment outflow of nearly $1 billion, as funds that invest according to the weight of the index components adjust their holdings.





Currently, China overall has a 32.12% weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market Index, which will go up to 34.72% by November, while India’s weightage will reduce to 8.13% from 8.45%. Korea has a 13.69% weight, while Taiwan and Brazil have 11.16% and 7.62%, respectively.

“Increase in the weights of Chinese mainland shares by 260 bps will result in a fall of India’s weight by 32 bps with an outflow of nearly a $1 billion,” said Sanjiv Prasad, co-head of Kotak Institutional Equities. “However, a $1- billion outflow over a period of six months from May to November will not have much impact on the market,” he added.

Some of the stocks that will be hit because of the change in weight are L&T with an outflow of $135 million, ITC ($96 million), Tata Motors ($78 million), and Mahindra & Mahindra, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and GAIL (about $60 million each).

MSCI also proposed changes to the calculation methodology for foreign ownership limits for Indian stocks. The result of this depends on consultation process and will be announced on March 29. If the changes are accepted, it will reduce India’s weight in MSCI Emerging Market Index by a further quarter percentage point.

“India should take corrective measures by increasing the FPI limits in various sectors and should negotiate with MSCI to include stocks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, etc, if it wants FII flows,” said Nilesh Shah, chief executive of Kotak Mutual Fund. “The government can also consider restructuring their holding of PSUs by transferring it to a trust, like what China did to increase their weights in the MSCI.”

MSCI had earlier announced that it would include Argentina and Saudi Arabia in the emerging market index, broadening the investor base in a move that could affect the representation of other countries, including India, in the benchmark.

Indian market capitalisation has declined by $90 million since the beginning of the year, compared with an increase in China, Korea and Brazil by $1.3 billion, $92 million and $118 million, respectively."
2,2019-03-02,GAIL,"AGARTALA: Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan Saturday inaugurated and laid foundation of several oil and gas projects in Tripura and said the northeast state is ranked number one in production of natural gas in the country.

""Tripura produces 4.96 mmscmd gas per day which is highest in the country. But we want to augment productions, so we have set a target of producing 10 mmscmd per day,"" Pradhan said after inaugurating several projects by remote here.

The Petroleum and Natural Gas minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is focused on improving the standard of living for the people of North East. Collaborative efforts of both Central and state governments along with contribution by oil and gas companies are bringing a developmental shift in the economy of Tripura.

Pradhan inaugurated the ONGC Sonamura Gas Collecting Station (GCS) in Sipahijala district, Piped Natural Gas (PNG) connections in West Tripura district, laid foundation of the first CNG station at Udaipur in Gomati district and foundation stone of National Skill Training Institute for women to be set up at Ananda Nagar, near here.

He said the ONGCs Sonamura Gas Collecting Station (GCS) was built at a cost of Rs 215 crore and will provide additional gas to NEEPCO Monarchak Power Plant to generate power for Tripura and northeast region.

Pradhan said the launch of first CNG Station will create a CNG green corridor between South Tripura, Gomati, Sepahijala and West Tripura district and also provide cost effective green fuel to the people.

The Petroleum minister said Gail's Khilpara Mother Station will be the hub of City Gas Distribution Network for Gomati District and will also be helpful in creating a gas based economy in the region, thereby creating direct and indirect employment and livelihood for people of this region.

Pradhan, who is also the Union Skill Development and Entrepreneurship minister said the upcoming National Skill Training Institute for a women in Agartala will fulfil the need for skill training of women in Tripura and other North-Eastern States. Central government will bear the cost for all training materials, merit-cum-stipend and scholarship.

""Tripura is one of the fastest growing state in the country after the BJP government came to power, ONGC Tripura Asset had played a major role in this connection,"" he said.

The Petroleum minister said the Modi government is committed to provide energy justice to the poorest of the poor specially people residing in the the remotest areas of our country. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) has empowered more than 2.17 lakh women in Tripura and LPG has reached 73 per cent households in the state.

He said 150 more petrol pumps and one more LPG bottling centre would be opened in Tripura shortly and the storage capacity of petrol depot at Dharmanagar in North Tripura district would be increased.

Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb who present on the occasion said Tripura would be made a model state in terms of development as both state and the central government has a good understanding and the Centre is serious about development of Tripura which remained neglected for years.

The Tripura chief minister said the Central government has recently sanctioned Rs 2,300 crore as additional fund to the state."
4,2019-03-04,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has nominated state-run GAIL to buy the gas output from Vedanta’s prolific Barmer block, which has recently begun pumping the energy resource after accounting for a fourth of India’s domestic crude oil production.

The block, which would produce up to 4 million metric standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd), must sell the output to an entity chosen by the government. The production sharing contract for the Barmer block gives the producer pricing freedom but not marketing freedom.

A long-drawn negotiation between GAIL and Vedanta hasn’t yet yielded an agreement, underscoring how hard it can be to settle on a rate in the absence of a widely acceptable domestic-market benchmark.

“We are in the middle of a productive commercial discussion, which will enable all stakeholders to optimise revenue, investment, and production. We cannot, however, comment on speculation about commercial discussions since these are confidential,” Vedanta said in an emailed response to ET’s query.

People familiar with the negotiations said there was a yawning expectation gap between the two parties as the seller has been demanding a rate equal to that of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), while the buyer favours the domestic formula price or a reasonable margin on top of the cost of production. For producers and buyers, there are at least five gas price reference points in the country.

A domestic formula price of $3.36 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) applies to most gas produced in the country. Then there are the following: 

The maximum rate of $7.67 for gas from difficult fields, prices discovered in limited auctions for gas that is difficult to extract, imported LNG rates, and economically viable rates submitted in field development plans (FDP) by producers.

In their FDPs submitted to the upstream regulator, producers mention the price at which developing a field would be viable. These prices are rarely publicised and so are less likely to become the basis of negotiations between a producer and buyer.

Producers demand higher rates equal to that of imported LNG, pointing out that the rising local appetite for LNG shows consumer willingness to pay a higher price. But buyers say high prices can dent local demand for gas and hurt industries."
3,2019-03-04,GAIL,"New Delhi: Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Co of Manila Inc (AG&P) plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in its city gas business in India over eight years. The company is confident of meeting the steep targets it had promised: to win 12 city gas distribution licences, the highest by a foreign bidder.

In the recent tenth round that offered 50 licences, AG&P shared the top slot with Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum Corp, each winning nine geographical areas. Other winners included Gujarat Gas (six), Gail Gas (four), Indraprastha Gas (three), Torrent Gas (three), Adani (two) and Bharat Petroleum Corp (two).

Eleven of the 12 geographical areas for which AG&P has licences— it won three in the ninth round last year— are in the four southern states, and their proximity to each other as well as to current and proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the region will facilitate easy and cheaper sourcing of gas for customers, said PPG Sarma, managing director for CGD and logistics at AG&P. Sarma, credited with building GSPC Gas’ vast city networks as CEO, said that the experience would come in handy in launching AG&P’s services.

It’s planning a floating LNG storage unit in Puducherry by the end of next year and may also tap Petronet’s LNG terminal in Kerala and that of Indian Oil in Tamil Nadu. The government provides cheaper domestic gas for use by households and vehicles but industrial and commercial users pay market rates. Its ability to import LNG and control over import infrastructure can thus give AG&P the advantage.



“The city gas areas awarded to AG&P in this round will benefit in the schedule, pricing and gas availability by leveraging our global project teams, our standard designs and our ownership of the full, integrated supply chain of LNG and gas,” said AG&P CEO Joseph Sigelman.

AG&P plans to haul LNG via tankers from import terminals to planned satellite terminals in its licence areas to quickly launch CNG services without waiting for pipelines to be built. State-run GAIL operates a satellite LNG station in Bhubaneswar to serve customers in the absence of a pipeline.

The Philippines company plans to launch a few CNG stations by the end of this year and piped gas services by next year-end, Sarma said. AG&P is confident of meeting its target of connecting 12 million households, building 1,500 CNG stations and laying 17,000 inch-kilometres of steel pipeline over eight years, he said, allaying apprehension that the company had been over-ambitious in its bids for licences.

AG&P will try and move away from “conventional city gas models” and introduce measures that will create more value for customers, Sarma said, citing the possibility of providing a single platform for customer billing and payments, laying broadband fibre along pipelines, encouraging gas-based kitchen appliances and working with industrial customers for better efficiency."

8,2019-03-08,GAIL,"AHMEDABAD: ArcelorMittal on Friday won a crucial round in its highstakes battle to wrest control of Essar Steel after the Ahmedabad bench of the bankruptcy court approved the lenders’ plan to award the firm to the global steel giant.

But the legal wrangling over the bankrupt steel firm may not be over yet, with the promoter Ruia family and British bank Standard Chartered seeking permission to appeal against the order.

The National Company Law Tribunal okayed the resolution professional’s (RP’s) plan, approved by the bankrupt firm’s lenders, with a slight amendment that could throw in a bit more for operational creditors. The court suggested that the payment of Rs 42,000 crore by Arcelor-Mittal be distributed among financial and operational creditors in the ratio of 85:15. The earlier proposal envisaged just about a few hundred crores for operational creditors whose claims are below Rs 1 crore.

“It’s of our concern that the dues of operational creditors should be considered,” said Harihar Prakash Chaturvedi, judicial member at NCLT-Ahmedabad.

As per the current plan, about 92% of the payment by ArcelorMittal will go to financial creditors. The total claim of operational creditors amounts to nearly Rs 4,700 crore. If the court-suggested ratio is implemented, operational creditors would get nearly Rs 4,600 crore while financial creditors wouldn’t have to take a big hit.

“However, it’s just a suggestion. It’s upon the CoC (Committee of Creditors) to consider this suggestion,” said Chaturvedi.

The order came after a bunch of operational creditors, Standard Chartered and the Ruias challenged the RP’s proposal, which had approved ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan.



The resolution plan for Essar Steel has been tied up in legal knots for almost two years with the Ruias challenging nearly every procedure associated with the bankruptcy proceedings. The steelmaker was among the first 12 cases selected by the Reserve Bank of India to be resolved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

“We continue to believe that our settlement proposal of Rs 54,389 crore is the most compelling one available to Essar Steel creditors and fulfills the IBC’s declared overriding objective of value maximisation, which has been established time and again by courts at all levels,” said an Essar Group spokesman. “We are also confident of the legal validity of our said offer made under Section 12A, which provides for the withdrawal from the IBC process by making full payment to creditors. We will take a call on next steps after examining the same.”

Even as the cases continued in various courts, including the Supreme Court, Essar Steel’s lenders went ahead with the resolution and approved ArcelorMittal’s bid, which offered to pay Rs 42,000 crore. The long-drawn drama also saw the disqualification of the bids by ArcelorMittal and the Ruias — the two were left ineligible due to an amendment to the IBC, which prohibited defaulters from bidding unless they cleared dues.

The Supreme Court had allowed ArcelorMittal and Numetal (a consortium headed by Russia’s VTB Bank) to rebid after both cleared their dues within a fortnight of the court order. In the second round of bidding, metals giant Vedanta had thrown in its hat as a contender.

While Arcelor-Mittal cleared the dues of KSS Petron and Uttam Galva Steel (where the global steel giant was classified as promoter), the Ruias made a last-minute bid to pull Essar Steel out of insolvency proceedings by offering to pay Rs 54,000 crore to lenders. The NCLT’s Ahmedabad bench rejected the Ruias’ settlement offer in January this year.

In December, multiple operational creditors, including big ones like Indian Oil Corporation, GAIL India, Dakshin Gujarat Vij and Bharat Petroleum, had approached the NCLT seeking rejection of ArcelorMittal’s proposal.

On Friday, the NCLT ruled in favour of ArcelorMittal. “The main application for resolutions deserved to be allowed and the Arcelor-Mittal proposal of Rs 42,000 crore along with ?8,000 crore is approved,” judicial member Chaturvedi said.

Immediately after the pronouncement of the order, lawyers of the Essar Group and Standard Chartered requested the NCLT to suspend the order so they could appeal in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

They fear that if the order is implemented and disbursement of money begins, it would be difficult to turn the clock back.

The NCLT judge didn’t accept the request, but said the order won’t be applicable till it is put out on Monday, thus giving time to the Essar Group and Standard Chartered to appeal."

11,2019-03-11,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Market maintained a clean slate right from the word go on Monday as strong all-round buying boosted Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty by over 1 per cent. 

Experts put it down to a pre-election rally, given strong FPI inflows amid a stronger rupee.

Overseas investors have pumped in a net Rs 2,741 crore into the Indian capital markets in the first five trading sessions of March, which is likely to continue for some time.

There is an optimism that Modi-led NDA will retain power in 2019 general elections as it is seen to benefit from the recent cross border flare-up. The RBI move of lifting the cap on FPI investment in corporate bonds also did its bit.

Positive sentiment from Asian markets nudged the bulls to go higher. Asian shares advanced on hopes of more policy support for the slowing Chinese economy.

The Sensex reclaimed 37,000-mark by surging 383 points, or 1.04 per cent, to close at 37,054.10. Only five stocks -- TCS (down 0.41 per cent), HCL Tech (down 0.39 per cent), NTPC (down 0.23 per cent), IndusInd Bank (down 0.21 per cent) and Infosys (down 0.13 per cent) - settled with nominal losses.

12,2019-03-12,GAIL,"Fund managers of top 10 fund houses by assets under management (AUMs) have shown considerable interest in public sector undertakings (PSUs) in February. A key reason for this is valuation (one-year forward basis) of key PSU companies are at multi-year lows and the discount between prominent PSU stocks and the Nifty is as high as 50per cent. Several stocks are trading at historic low valuations on the basis of price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. Fund managers believe improved outlook on both global and China growth, low oil prices and lower worries on India’s fiscal situation can lead to a re-rating for the segment. Here are five PSU stocks which have attracted large amount of buying from leading fund managers in February.


NTPC

CMP: Rs 152

MARKET CAP: Rs 125,331 crore 
BOUGHT BY: DSP Mutual Fund

In Dec, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) come out with draft tariff regulations which were perceived unfavourable for NTPC and other power companies. This resulted in the fall of NTPC's stock price which offered opportunity for fund managers to enhance their exposure to NTPC. Recently, CERC has notified final tariff regulations (FY20-FY24) which are extremely favourable to NTPC's business model in terms of high tariffs. Analysts expect NTPC's EPS to grow by more than 6per cent between FY20 and FY24, which is higher than the earlier estimates.


GAIL


CMP: Rs 352
MARKET CAP: Rs 79,266 crore
BOUGHT BY: ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund

The company is expected to benefit from a few revenueenhancing factors. One, the company's gas volumes are expected to swing to high tariff volumes from low tariff volumes. Two, the company is likely to benefit if Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) revises tariff rates in the next six to eight months. Besides this, the company's capacity utilisation levels are expected to improve to close to 98per cent in FY21 from 74per cent in FY19. These factors should boost the company's earnings per share (EPS) by 8-10per cent in the next two years.

Engineers India


CMP: Rs 115MARKET CAP: Rs 7,273 crore
BOUGHT BY: Kotak Mutual Fund

Factors such as a healthy order book (Rs 10,800 croreore), which gives revenue visibility of at least next three years, asset light business model, debt-free balance sheet, leadership position in hydrocarbon consulting business, which promises strong revenue growth in the next two years, foray into new business segments and incroreeasing contribution from low-margin business have triggered fund managers' interest in the stock of Engineers India. Given these factors, analysts expect the company's EPS to grow in the range of 6-9per cent over the next two fiscals.

Coal India

CMP: Rs 243.40MARKET CAP: Rs 151,088 crore
BOUGHT BY: Aditya Birla SL Mutual Fund / DSP Mutual Fund

One of the lowest-cost producers of coal in the world, the company is the world’s largest coal reserve holder and producer, controlling 80per cent of the Indian coal market. It will be a big beneficiary of the structural deficit of coal in India. The company has a near monopoly position in coal and is considered as a utility player. This is due to assured volume off-take and negligible chance of product price cut, as prices already remain at a discount to current international benchmark prices. Volume growth will happen as the government incroreeases domestic production.


NALCO


CMP: Rs 54.5MARKET CAP: Rs 10,167 crore
BOUGHT BY: ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund

NALCO, a Navaratna PSU, is an integrated aluminium producer. It has 6.8 mtpa bauxite mine, 2.23 mtpa alumina refinery and 460 ktpa aluminium smelter along with a 1200-MW captive power generation capacity. Its strategic location of Odisha with nearby operations helps it in cost optimisations. Being a debt-free and high dividend paying company, it is an attractive defensive bet for institutional investors."

14,2019-03-12,GAIL,"The government has deferred by one month the last date for bidding for the 14 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in the second round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP).

Bids for the 14 blocks offered in OALP-II bid round, covering an area of 29,333 square kilometres, were to close Tuesday.

""Bid submission closing date for OALP Bid Round-II stands extended up to April 10, 2019,"" the Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) said in a brief notice.

It did not give reasons for extending the deadline.

The last date of bidding coincides with the bid deadline for the 23 oil and gas and coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks offered in the third round of OALP, which was launched on February 10.

OALP-II bid round was delayed at six months and its launch came barely a month before the third round.

Officials said OALP-II and OALP-III will run concurrently.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had at the time of launch of OALP-II bid round on January 7 stated that an investment of about Rs 40,000 crore is expected in the prospecting of oil and gas in blocks offered.

In the first round of OALP last year, as much as Rs 60,000 crore was committed in the exploration of oil and gas in 55 blocks or areas.

In the third round, the government is expecting up to USD 700 million (about Rs 49,000 crore) of investment that it hopes will help raise domestic output and cut imports.

India had in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration.

Under this policy, called open acreage licensing policy or OALP, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.

The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.

The two window of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31.

The first OALP round was launched in 2017 and bids came in by May 2018. EoIs for second round closed on May 15, 2018, and the blocks were supposed to be put for auction by June but the round was for reasons unknown delayed. OALP-II was finally launched on January 7.

In the meanwhile, EoIs in the third window also closed on November 15, 2018 with as many as 18 blocks and five CBM blocks, measuring 31,722 sq km, being sought for. OALP-III bid round was launched on February 10 with April 10 as the last date for bidding.

Officials said the 14 blocks in OALP-II are estimated to hold in-place resource of 12,609 million tonne oil and oil equivalent gas.

In OALP-1, mining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two.

State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) won one block each.

The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration prior to OALP.

Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to doing maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.

Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10 per cent to 67 per cent by 2022 and to half by 2030.

Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 83 per cent of its oil needs.

The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

The government prior to this had been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.

Under this, 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospect."
17,2019-03-14,GAIL,"Brookfield on Thursday announced it is buying the loss-making East West Pipeline Ltd (EWPL), earlier known as Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd, for an enterprise valuation of Rs 13,000 crore ($2 billion) from Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries.

This will be the first time a private pipeline is India is being monetised. It's also the first time Reliance, India's largest private sector company. Brookfield is also buying Reliance Jio’s telecom tower assets in a similarly structured transaction that could value the portfolio at $7-8 billion, said sources aware of the developments.

Brookfield has already filed the preliminary placement memorandum for setting up a infrastructure investment trust ( InvIT). Brookfield will be the sponsor or this India Infrastructure Trust and will own 90% of it. The InvIT will acquire 100% equity interest in Pipeline Infrastructure Private Limited (“PIPL”) which currently owns and operates the Pipeline.



Brookfield is also tying up with a clutch of marquee asset management companies, family offices, banks and insurers to come on board with a 10% stake. ET on February 11th reported that ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company, the family office of the Poonawallas of Serum Institute, Russell Mehta of Rosy Blue, also the father in law of Akash Ambani, Bank of Baroda are likely to join the Canadian investor in India Infrastructure Trust, the vehicle that is being created for the acquisition to take over the 1,400 km common carrier pipeline from Kakinada on the east coast to Bharuch in Gujarat. The law stipulates at least 5 non promoter sponsors for such InvITs. These investors need to come on board within a fortnight.

The identity of these investors are not yet disclosed.

EWPL has built and operates the critical pipeline to transport natural gas produced by Reliance-BP from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin on the east coast and links to users on the west coast.

The Competition Commission of India had approved the transaction in September 2018.

The Rs 13,000 crore will be evenly split between equity and debt. Axis and ICICI Bank are providing the financing. The other investors together are likely to put in Rs 1,000-1,200 crore as equity contribution and will own 10-15% of the asset. 

As part of the agreement, RIL has the right to acquire equity shares of PIPL held by the InvIT at an equity value of Rs. 50 crore. It's current investment in preference shares valued at Rs. 4,000 crore to continue and will be converted into equity at the end of 20 years.

The refining and oil and gas major will continue to be entitled to transport gas, either by itself or of any customers, free of cost against any outstanding unutilized capacity payments.

At the current approved final tariff of Rs. 71.66/MMBTU, if the average volume of gas transported is 22 MMSCMD, RIL will not be liable to make unutilized capacity payments. 

The next review of tariff in April 2020 will also consider upward revision arising from 

determination of lower revised capacity of the pipeline. Considering the new investments in the upstream sector in the KG basin, and the growing LNG imports, ability to swap gas, the average volume expected to be transported through the pipeline is expected to be significantly higher compared to the current levels, Reliance said in a statement.

RIL will be entitled to a significant participation in the net earnings of PIPL under the mechanism specified in the pipeline usage agreement. JM and Ambit are the advisors in the transaction


KEY INFRASTRUCTURE
Other than KG Basin output, the pipeline also transports gas from other sources including RLNG (regasified LNG) terminals along the stretch of the pipeline and is connected to pipelines of other operators such as state-run GAIL (India) Ltd and Gujarat State Petronet Ltd for onward delivery nationwide.

But its cash flow is sensitive to the volume of gas available for transportation and the drop in RIL’s gas production from its KG-D6 block over the past few years, has made it bleed. In FY18, the operational revenue of the pipeline was Rs 884 crore and a net loss of Rs 715 crore. The total debt is Rs 13,715 crore. 

The pipeline, Sikka Ports & Terminals Ltd (SPTL) and Reliance Utilities and Power Pvt Ltd (RUPPL) are key companies in Ambani’s privately held RIHPL Group and their operations are critical for Reliance Industries as they are closely integrated with its facilities in Jamnagar, Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat, and with its KG-D6 gas fields. The facilities cater exclusively to RIL’s existing facilities as well as its expansion in the petrochemicals and refining business.

In five years since April 2012, RIHPL group has extended support to EWPL in the form of subordinated debt and preference shares of about Rs 4,826 crore and Rs 8,000 crore, respectively, as of March 31."

15,2019-03-14,GAIL,"Gail India called on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers to offer more flexibility contract terms as the state-owned gas distribution gas company hunts for supplies from the middle of the next decade.

 India last year was the fifth largest importer of U.S. LNG and natural gas is projected to double its share of the nation's energy mix by 2030 as oil-fired power plants convert.

 Shri B.C. Tripathi, chairman and managing director of Gail India, said on Wednesday at the CERAWeek energy conference his company is in discussions with U.S. gas exporters to acquire new LNG supplies from 2024-2025.

 ""Traditional suppliers like Qatar or Russia have shown a lot of flexibility in recent past where they have modified their contracts, re-negotiated their contracts, aligned them to the market,"" Tripathi said in a brief interview.

 ""However, the U.S. contracts are purely a tolling model. Their tolling fee is fixed,"" he said, adding that U.S. LNG becomes less competitive against traditional supplies when oil prices drop.

 The company has 20-year LNG contracts to buy 5.8 million tonnes per year of U.S. LNG, split between Dominion Energy Inc's Cove Point plant and Cheniere Energy Inc's Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana.

 Gail currently sends up to 75 percent of its U.S. LNG supplies back to India, Tripathi said, and sells the rest into the spot market. All the LNG will eventually be shipped to India when more gas pipelines and regasification terminals are completed, he said.

 Natural gas is expected to account for 15 percent of India's energy mix by 2030, up from the current 6.2 percent, MM Kutty, secretary of India's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, said earlier in the week.

 Half of that demand will be met by LNG imports, he said.

 The world's fourth largest energy consumer is replacing oil-fired power plants with gas and is building pipelines so that piped gas can reach 70 percent of its population.

 India also aims to expand the number of compressed natural gas (CNG) refuelling stations by 10-fold to 10,000."
21,2019-03-15,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: After Thursday's muted gains, it looked that the market was headed southward and the pre-election rally was ending prematurely. 

The bulls proved those apprehensions wrong on Friday. Thanks to steady capital flows, the equity benchmarks logged gains for the fifth straight session.

Overseas investors have poured nearly Rs 29,000 crore in Indian equities on a year-to-date basis till March 14 against Rs 14,400 crore in the same quarter last year.

In this backdrop, and the fact that domestic indices are already looking tired on the technical charts, Dalal Street is most likely headed for some consolidation today. 

Let us check out what all may move market all through Friday:


TRADE SETUP:- 


Singapore trading sets stage for tepid start
Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 8 points, or 0.07 per cent, lower at 11,384, indicating a tepid start for the Nifty50.

Tech view: Nifty50 likely to consolidate
The bulls got tired, as suggested by Wednesday’s ‘Hanging Man’ pattern on Nifty chart. A bearish candle on Thursday’s daily charts made the case stronger for rangebound trade going ahead. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities sees downside supports at 11,280 and 11,222. Nifty must hold on to the 11,280 level for any possible upside, he said. 


F&O watch: Option premium surges in runup to elections
Usually, current month contracts (in this case: March) are the most active, while far month derivatives (like May) are hardly traded. This time, traders are betting on May futures and options as the market has swung wildly in reaction to the election results. Nifty put options of strike 10,500, 10,700 and 11,000 among others in the May series have seen an increase in activity in the last week .


Asian stocks higher on Brexit reprieve
Asian stocks made modest gains on Friday, tracking improved global sentiment after UK lawmakers voted to delay Brexit, but a fresh flare up in US-China trade concerns is expected to cap gains. Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.9 percent and South Korea's KOSPI rose 0.45 percent.

Oil edges lower on supply deficit hopes
Oil prices were steady on Friday, supported as production cuts led by OPEC and US sanctions against Venezuela and Iran likely created a slight deficit in global supply in the first quarter of 2019. But oil prices have been capped by concerns that an economic slowdown will soon start denting growth in fuel demand. Brent crude oil futures were at $67.15 per barrel, 8 cents below their last close.


US stocks snap 3-day winning streak
The S&P 500 slipped on Thursday, snapping a three-day streak of gains, as uncertainty over when a trade deal between the United States and China would be reached left investors on edge.

However, the delay in the Brexit process would now require unanimous approval of all 27 remaining EU member states.


Carmakers told to go easy on production
Saddled with high stocks amid slowing demand in the local market, automobile dealers have urged manufacturers to rationalise production and correct inventory levels.

18,2019-03-15,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Mutual funds have been adding shares of oil and gas companies such as GAIL, HPCL, BPCL and ONGC over the last few months, encouraged by cheap valuations. As per a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services, equity schemes have increased their oil and gas sector weight for the fourth successive month in February to reach a new high of 7.8 per cent, a rise of 20 basis points from the previous months, and 120 basis points from the same month a year ago. The sector is now at the fifth position in sector allocation of mutual funds, it was at the seventh position 12 months ago.

Fund managers and analysts point out that there are a number of stocks in the space which are trading at a 15-year low valuations. Many companies are now trading at historically low valuations on both price-to-earnings (P/E) as well as price-to-book (P/B) basis.

“Valuations are extremely attractive for both upstream as well as downstream companies and that is the reason for increasing exposure. In addition, companies are now rewarding shareholders by giving dividends and buybacks which are close to 50-70 per cent of cash flows,” says Vinay Paharia, chief investment officer at Union Mutual Fund.

As per data from Value Research, GAIL trades at a PE ratio of 13.49 times and PB of 1.78 times, while BPCL trades at a PE of 12.67 and PB of 2.33, while HPCL trades at a PE of 8.48 and PB of 1.53, and ONGC at PE of 6.7 and PB of 0.9.


JP Morgan points out that ONGC is trading at near all-time lows on PE and P/B. The earnings estimates are based on $60/bbl oil which is mid cycle, and ONGC’s organic growth pipeline (gas production growth, ramp up of petchem project) looks robust, while realisations have not been impacted by subsidies. Similarly, IOC is also trading at near all-time low valuations across both PE and PB. Earnings estimates are based on mid cycle assumptions of refining margins, while marketing margins have stabilised."

They have also been spending on setting up new pipelines, depots and retail outlets.

Indian oil companies have been investing heavily in finding, refining and distributing oil and gas across the country for the last many years to meet mounting demand for fuel and feedstock. Meanwhile, economic expansion has pushed up oil demand by 3.2% during April-Feb of 2018-19. India is also hoping to increase its domestic oil output and reduce its dependence on import by making massive investments in exploration and production. Domestic crude oil output has been declining for years. India imports about 80% of the oil and about half of the natural gas it consumes. The import bill of crude oil is estimated to expand 27% from $88 billion in 2017-18 to $112 billion in 2018-19."

0,2019-04-01,GAIL,"In a big relief to the Indian markets, MSCI has deferred its decision to exclude the shares being offered through Global and American Depository Receipts (GDRs, ADRs) while calculating foreign ownership limits (FOL), the measures that could have led over $1 billion outflow of overseas funds from India. Hectic negotiations between Indian government officials and MSCI have led the global index provider to postpone its decision, according to people in the know.

This is the second such decisions in three months where the global index provider differed its decision that could have impacted foreign flows to India. Earlier this year, MSCI deferred action against India for limiting investor access. The global index provider had earlier planned to cap India’s weight in the MSCI-EM index after local exchanges suggested curbs on data sharing with the Singapore bourse.

“Both pressure tactic and positive approach by the Indian government officials prompted MSCI to defer those negative actions against Indian stocks,” said a person aware of the development.

After several fund managers and domestic investors’ demanded that the government should take corrective measures immediately to address the situation, officials led by Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic advisor to the Prime Minister, held a series of discussions on the ideal MSCI weights that represent India’s economic performance and prospects.

The Indian government is said to have expressed concerns about the relative disparity in the weightages of India and other countries with positive approach to open up more free floats shares to foreign investors. Currently, China has a 32.12 per cent weight, while India’s weight is at 8.45 per cent. S Korea has 13.69 per cent, while Taiwan and Brazil have 11.16 per cent and 7.62 per cent, respectively.

“To avoid a potential reverse turnover following any such enhancements or other initiatives to increase investable market capitalisation of Indian equity market for international institutional investors, MSCI will temporarily maintain the current treatment and not reduce the weight of the impacted index constituents,” MSCI said in a statement on Friday.

MSCI will closely monitor the developments related to accessibility of DRs, as well as other enhancements related to FOL in India and will re-assess the situation prior to November 2019, it said.

While determining the weight of a company, MSCI considers both domestic shares and depository receipts for calculating the foreign inclusion factor (FIF), which determines the total proportion of shares of a company that offshore investors can buy from the exchanges.

MSCI wanted to exclude depository receipts, which would reduce the proportion of free-float shares available for foreign investors, thereby slashing the weight of the company. Stocks such as L&T, ITC, M&M, Dr Reddy’s, Gail and Hindalco could have seen the steepest selling in case of any change in methodology. For instance, Tata Motors’ free float would have shrunk to 51.8 per cent from 63 per cent if its shares in the form of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) were excluded for calculating foreign inclusion factor.

However, the biggest worry for Indian markets today is the global index provider’s decision to quadruple the weights of Chinese mainland shares in the MSCI benchmark in three steps. It will increase the inclusion factor of Chinese large-cap stocks to 20 per cent from the current 5 per cent, with increments of 5 per cent each in May, August and November.

On completion, the weight of Chinese mainland stocks in the MSCI Emerging Market Index will jump to 3.3 per cent from roughly 0.7 per cent at present. India’s weight will come down by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, resulting in an investment outflow of nearly $2 billion, as funds that invest according to the weights of the index components adjust their holdings."
7,2019-04-02,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The rates of compressed natural gas (CNG) likely to rise by about Rs 1.25 per kg and domestic piped gas by about 70-80 paise per standard cubic meters (SCM) in Delhi following a 10% rise in domestic natural gas price in the sixmonthly revision on Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. Other cities too will see similar price increases.

Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL), the city gas distributor in Delhi and its satellite cities, is expected to shortly announce new prices. The rate for Noida in Uttar Pradesh will be slightly less due to lower taxes. Mahanagar Gas, Gail Gas and other city gas distributors too are in the process of raising rates in their respective license areas. Higher prices mean costlier drive for CNG vehicle owners and increased kitchen fuel bills.

City gas distributors depend on cheaply priced domestic gas for supply to vehicles and homes but source expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) for their commercial and industrial clients.

Domestic gas price, which is revised twice a year and announced at the end of March and September, is calculated by a government-set formula that takes average rates from international trading hubs.

Domestic gas price has risen to $3.69 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) from $3.36 per mmBtu. The new price will be applicable for April-September period.

The maximum price producers can charge for gas from difficult fields has risen to to $9.32 per mmBtu from $7.67 per mmBtu, much higher than the spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) rates that are around $6.5 per mmBtu. Spot rates are subdued these days mainly due to oversupply in the Asian region and weaker demand. The price ceiling, linked to alternative fuels, is based on the average of preceding 12 months. The ceiling has jumped 40% since it was introduced in April-September 2016.

The gas price jump will boost earnings at ONGC, Oil India, RIL and Vedanta but would hurt consumers.

The input cost will also rise for power, fertiliser, petrochemicals, refineries and other factories using natural gas as fuel or feedstock."

13,2019-04-09,GAIL,"Mumbai: Gail India is the front -runner to buy the energy assets of troubled Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services, two persons in the know of the development, said. The assets on the block could fetch Rs 6,000 crore for IL&FS and include a controlling stake in the wind power generating plants with an aggregate capacity of 873.5 MW and those under construction with a combined capacity of 104 MW. Solar power plants and projects under development of about 300 MW is also up for sale.

“Gail India is the front-runner to buy energy assets while Japanese investor Orix reserves the right of refusal to buy the stake if the valuation falls below a particular price,” said a source close to the development. Orix owns 49% in the energy assets up for sale.

Though the company received 22 expressions of interest from investors, including Global Infra partners, KKR, Brookfield, I Squared Capital and Macquarie to buy over 1,000-megawatt renewable energy assets, response in terms of binding bids were poor. The company was expecting to get Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 8,000 crore from the sale of energy assets.


“The approximate value of the asset is around Rs 6,000 crore and the deal will help pare debt by Rs 5,000 crore,” said another source.

The company spokesperson said bids for renewable assets have been received and are being processed.

Ashwini Kumar, head of energy business, had said that the energy business is a green business, which is paying off everything. Though they are performing assets, the response to the sale has been relatively poor.

“The wind and solar power projects remain highly cost competitive against conventional sources and would continue to increase their share in the generation mix over the next few years. As per ICRA estimate, the share of renewable energy in the generation mix is expected to increase to 12-13% by FY22 from 7.7% in FY18,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, group head — corporate ratings, ICRA.

The subsidiaries are part of the resolution plans for IL&FS Group. Arpwood Capital and JM Financial are the financial and transaction advisors while Alvarez & Marsal is the resolution consultant. The IL&FS group submitted a progress report to courts categorising assets into three categories; red, green and amber. IL&FS has been looking to sell stakes in subsidiaries and pare its debt. The company has debt of Rs 91,000 crore."

16,2019-04-10,GAIL,"The rally has been extremely narrow and it has been largely limited to Reliance, a handful of private banks and maybe some 
  
  
  IT, said Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

We are talking about a rally despite the fact that there are quite a few negative factors -- be it the way crude oil prices are shaping up, global growth forecast is being slashed, elections, earnings. Do you think that the liquidity driven rally is going to continue?
The liquidity has been the highest in the last few years. Year to date, FII inflows into India have been higher than the average annual inflows over the last three years. That is a lot of money chasing a very few stocks. The rally has been extremely narrow and it has been largely limited to Reliance, a handful of private banks and maybe some IT. Against this backdrop, the markets are likely to pause between now and the completion of elections and largely be sideways. 


What is the outlook when it comes to banks and financials? Is this a sector that largely has growth as well as valuation comfort for some of the private names? What is your expectation from earnings? Within banking, the rally has been largely limited to the private banks and maybe SBI has rallied. But outside of that, stocks fell. Stocks rose but net-net over the last one year or so, PSU banks and several of the NBFCs are still actually in the negative. This year, after a couple of years we will see strong earnings growth from both private, public and NBFCs. They will probably support the market. Against this backdrop, we are beginning to look at names like Canara Bank and some of the NBFCs like Can Fin Homes. So, yes it is broadening out.


Would you subscribe into Idea-Vodafone or Vodafone-Idea right issue?
I would not at this juncture.


Why?
They have a humongous amount of debt. Even after all this, they still don’t have pricing power and the volumes have also peaked out. Against this whole backdrop, we will stay away.


Come Friday, what is the expectation? Both Infy and TCS will report their numbers and the bigger question is what has happened with IT after the last year and a half’s significant outperformance? It has been almost like a dream run. How much higher can the stocks go?
The stocks will continue doing their compounding 15% plus type of return simply because earnings visibility is very high. Against that backdrop, you have companies with a decent amount of pricing power. The margins are still very strong for the front-name ITs and their valuations are largely within the range that they traded in. They will compound at their usual 15 percent even from current levels. 


What is your outlook for the media space as a whole? A lot of companies have been spending lots of cash on OTT business.
Yes, it does create a whole new bunch of revenue streams for a whole bunch of companies. Just about every single mainstream media company is also now talking about web series and YouTube is already is a platform for small businesses to showcase their services and products to the outside world. The Netflix reach is more expensive for them. It is a different approach in terms of the business model. So from that perspective, there are 550 million smart phones users in this country and it is only a question of making them more profitable users.


Where you are finding value? I believe building materials is a space that you like. Which stocks have you identified?
Across the board, cement companies’ profit margins are at a multi-year low and their pricing power has been non-existent. Anything with volumes coming back marginally and a cyclical low improving, turning upwards will provide some amount of profit margin expansion because of pricing power. 

If you extend that logic downwards into the building material companies such as the tile companies, the Kajarias, the Somany and these companies are also benefitting because in recent NGT changes has moved away from coal as raw material to LNG. 

Against this backdrop, they will gain some market share. By the same logic, Century Plywood, which saw a very bad last year, will also rebound from a cyclical low. When all these companies rebound, then earnings will look very strong for the next couple of years and against that backdrop, there will be fairly decent multiples.


Are you also circumspect about the LVB deal?
I would think that both the banks -- LVB as well as Indiabulls -- must have consulted and I do not think this deal is coming out the blue and also against the current dispensation, where there is increased need to lower the bad debts of various banks and NBFCs, it is likely that this deal will go through and maybe they will have to divest some businesses. Indiabulls has mentioned that they are open to getting out of some businesses. There is a good probability this deal will go through.


How exactly are you looking at the crude oil price link? Crude at around $70 cannot be good for India but for individual sectors, how do you see the correlation?
Both OPEC and Iran are indicating that as you go into the US driving season in June, there will be an increase in supply. I guess there is a desire to maintain oil at around the $65-70 mark. Now against that backdrop, refining companies have had their run but they are still underperformers and valuation is still looking good. Also the elections will be over by then in terms of controls. 

HP, BP and IOCL are looking good. Gas Authority of India (GAIL) is looking good. Both its petchem and transmission businesses are looking good, All these stocks have been underperformers. I would cyclically rotate into these stocks. 


Which is the one auto stock that is suddenly available at a distress level?
The entire frontline auto pack is down about 25-30% over the last one year but if you look at companies, maybe Hero Motors. The stock is trading at about 12-13 times. The stock is down about 30%. They have a couple of new models coming up and volumes while not spectacular, will rebound from the current levels."

21,2019-04-11,GAIL,"The Supreme Court on Thursday closed the case of alleged corruption involving politicians, bureaucrats and corporates in the Enron-Dabhol power project, noting the inordinate delay in the case which was filed in 1997.

A bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna allowed the plea of the Maharashtra government to close the case.

The USD 3 billion mega power project was set up in Maharashtra by US-based Enron and its associates Dabhol Power Corporation in 1996 after signing of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) in 1993.

The apex Court had in 1997 admitted the petition of the Centre for Indian Trade Union (CITU) challenging a Bombay High Court order upholding the PPA and issued notice to MSEB on the role of government and its officials in the signing of the agreement.

In the previous hearing on February 14, the court was informed by the Maharashtra government about the developments that have taken place since the matter came up before the Bombay High Court in 1996.

The state government had appointed a committee headed by IAS officer Madhav Godbole which in its report in April 10, 2001 suggested the setting of a judicial commission after giving its finding of alleged irregularities in the deal.

The report, which was submitted to the Maharashtra government, had dealt with handling of the issues during the tenure of Sharad Pawar as the Chief Minister when he was in Congress Party, the 13-day BJP-led Union government which reworked the deal in 1996, the then Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra headed by Manohar Joshi.

According to the suggestion of the Godbole Committee, a one-man enquiry commission headed by Justice S P Kurdukar, former apex court judge, was appointed.

However, proceedings before the Justice Kurdukar Commission, was stayed in April 2003 as the Centre had filed a lawsuit against the Maharashtra government which was later dismissed paving the way for the commission to go ahead with the proceedings, which never happened.

The last information made available to the apex court was on March 7, 2018 by the Centre that the Union of India was no longer interested in the Commission (headed by Justice Khurdukar) to continue.

In July 2005, Ratnagiri Gas and Power Pvt Ltd, a joint venture of NTPC, GAIL and Maharashtra government was set up to take over and revive the assets of the defunct DPC.

In an earlier order, the apex court had said it was hearing the matter as a public interest litigation and as the principal issue arising for decision was to determine the question of accountability of the Maharashtra government and its officials."

19,2019-04-11,GAIL,"ET Intelligence Group: The current reading of India VIX, a gauge for market perceived risk, reflects that market participants are yet to factor in a major change in market volatility due to ensuing general elections.

India VIX is currently at 21.1 per cent, trading below the 10-year average of 21.4 per cent. In addition, the 30-day historical volatility of the Nifty has been consistently coming down from the November 2018 peak. It is currently at 10.1 per cent against the 10- year average of 16.2 per cent. The reading indicates how much an index may fluctuate on an annualised basis.

Contrary to the general expectation of a spike in the volatility during elections, historical data show that four of the last six elections did not see any meaningful rise in volatility.



Another indicator of the market’s current lower risk perception is the pricing of straddles. A straddle is a derivative strategy involving simultaneously purchasing options to buy and sell a security. It is used to take advantage of volatility. The pricing of the straddle on Nifty 50 at Wednesday’s close denoted an expectation of just over 3.5 per cent volatility in either direction (gain or loss in the Nifty).

The volatility has historically increased after the election. Also, stocks show more volatility than the benchmark indices such as Nifty. According to Credit Suisse, in case of 11 of the Nifty stocks, volatility more than doubled in the month after election results in 2014 than it was in the prior month and most of these were public sector stocks including ONGC, Coal India, NMDC, GAIL, PGCIL, NTPC, SBI and PNB."

38,2019-04-17,GAIL,"“
The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.” 
— Sir John Templeton

Going by this wisdom of one of the most successful investors and mutual fund managers of the 20th century, public sector companies appear to be making a solid investment case. Gloominess in this space is at its peak.

Mumbai-based brokerage B&K Securities in its recent research report wrote many of the funds that they met told them that they were not interested in even discussing PSUs.

With up to 97 per cent drop since the beginning of this decade, these stocks have become a minefield investors now fear to tread. BSE PSU index is down over 21 per cent during this period.

Will this trend change anytime soon? Analysts are not very hopeful.

But valuations, which have turned a lot cheaper relative to fundamentals, tell a different story: It could just be the time to nibble at select names from this basket.

Public sector banks are already drawing some interest, as their private peers have witnessed a good runup in recent weeks and the crippling NPA mess appears to have bottomed out.

They together with other top PSUs like IFCI, Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL), Shipping Corporation of India, Nalco, GMDC, Oil India, ONGC, PFC and SJVN are trading at valuations lower than their book values. Trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratios of most of these companies have slipped below the industry averages.

“Healthy pessimism is still there in the PSU space, but opportunistic buying can happen now,” says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman, Inditrade Capital.

Kotak Institutional Equities says PSU stocks are trading at inexpensive multiples mainly because of the market’s worries about unfavourable regulations, irrational government actions and repeated disinvestments. It says most of these stocks are offering meaningful value at their current price levels.

There are chances that some of the PSUs would deliver some quick returns in the near term. The index representing these stocks has a track record of outpacing Nifty at least for some time after every general election.


Others
“Historical data of election years suggest a post-poll hope rally in PSU stocks. Time is ripe for that rally to take off,” B&K Securities said.

S Naren, ED & CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, expects a re-rating for the PSU stocks. “I am hoping that the new government would recognise that most PSUs are deeply undervalued and there are huge opportunities to rerate them through effective management of the shareholding in next five years. Strategic value of many of these PSUs is simply fantastic,” he told ETNOW during an interaction.

SBI Securities says the government’s aggressive divestment targets for FY18 and FY19 led to rapid stake reductions in most central public sector enterprises (CPSEs). That overhang continuous over many CPSEs. But current attractive valuations with high return ratios make it a favourable case for investing in select CPSEs.



ICICI Prudential’s Naren says already gone “massively overweight” on PSU stocks. “PSUs got de-rated for 10 years and at this point of time I have a simple metric to look for stocks that are trading at single-digit trailing PE. Look for stocks that trade at 5 per cent dividend yields and look for names that are not too leveraged. If I look at this combination of high dividend yields, low trailing PE and not too much leverage, I get a number of stocks and that is why we are massively overweight on PSU stocks,” he said.

Since the beginning of January 2011, public sector players like MMTC, Indian Overseas Bank, Hindustan Copper, UCO Bank, Andhra Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, IFCI, Bank of India, BHEL and Central Bank of India have eroded over 75 per cent of investor wealth till March 18, 2019.

At the same time, others like HPCL, BPCL, Balmer Lawrie, ITI and Power Grid have delivered returns from 100 per cent to 270 per cent.

From an investment perspective, B&K Securities prefers BEL, Concor, GAIL, GSFC, HPCL and SBI.

Bandyopadhyay says most of the PSUs are looking oversold and undervalued. “Leaving the banking space aside, there is merit in buying stocks like Bharat Electronics and NTPC from a medium- to long-term perspective. Some of them are looking good from dividend perspective. In the banking space, one can look at SBI and Bank of Baroda, but one should stay cautious on smaller lenders.”"

GAIL heads the bidding list for 7 operating wind power plants (special purpose vehicles or SPVs), with total generation capacity of 874 MW. ORIX has the first right of refusal on the deal.

The offer assumes no haircut to the outstanding debt of the SPVs, at about Rs 3,700 crore, IL&FS said in a statement. The transaction is likely to close in three weeks. Sale proceeds will be held in a trust for distribution to the relevant stakeholders, sticking to the resolution framework filed with an appellate court that deals with bankruptcies, the company said.

The process began on November 29. Although IL&FS received 22 expressions of interest from investors including Global Infra Partners, KKR, Brookfield, I Squared Capital and Macquarie, to buy more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy assets, responses by way of binding bids were poor.

The proposal was approved by the Committee of Creditors of IL&FS Wind Energy (IWEL), the majority owner of the SPVs.

“Engagement with ORIX Japan, the other shareholder in the SPVs, with regards to the proposal is currently in progress,” the company said.

Sale processes for assets, including education, funds, roads and thermal power plant, are currently underway and binding financial bids are expected for these companies/businesses in stages by May."

Analyst calls 
• IDBI Capital has maintained buy rating on DCB Bank and increased target price to ₹250 from ₹220. DCB Bank’s FY19 guidance given 3 years back on operational efficiency is largely met, said IDBI Capital. Cost-to-income, ROA and ROE is at 53.7%, 1.1% and 13.7% against its guidance of 55%, 1% and 14% respectively, it said. 

• IIFL has maintained buy rating on Coal India with a target price of ₹323. The brokerage has cut FY20-21 EBITDA estimates by 5%, to factor-in the lower e-auction realisations. Coal India faces near-term volume headwinds, given normalised 18-day inventory at power plants with expected seasonal uptick in TPP generation, said IIFL. 

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has retained sell rating on RBL Bank and increased fair value to ₹560 from ₹550. RBL reported another solid quarter with earnings growth of 40% YoY on the back of 40% YoY revenue growth, the brokerage said. 

 • CLSA has retained buy rating on Reliance Industries and raised target price to ₹1,665 from ₹1,500 to included value from broadband, IMO and listed investments. Benefits from petcoke gasification, clarity on ecommerce plans, further asset monetisation and a pick-up in broadband are near-term trigger, said CLSA.

 • Centrum Broking has downgraded CRISIL to add from buy and cut target price to ₹1,600 from ₹1,980. The brokerage sees growth headwinds across the non-ratings businesses, and this, along with little room for cost rationalisation would keep earnings under pressure.

41,2019-04-23,GAIL,"Mumbai: The sharp rise of crude oil prices following comments by US President Donald Trump on Iran sanctions sparked a sell-off in shares of domestic oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Monday.

Shares of Hindustan Petroleum fell 6 per cent, Indian Oil Corp declined 4.1 per cent and Bharat Petroleum 3.3 per cent, respectively. Investors worry that higher crude prices may not lead to an increase in retail fuel prices because of the general elections.

“The margins of OMCs are under serious pressure due to the global crude oil prices,” said Yogesh Patil, oil and gas sector analyst at Reliance Securities. “Prices have shot up from $64-65 a barrel in February to $74 now. However, due to the ongoing election, this price increase has not been passed on to the consumers impacting the margins of OMCs.”

Shares of Gail, Petronet LNG and Mahanagar Gas fell over 1.5 per cent each. Analysts expect the volatility in the sector to remain and are advising clients to stay away from most of these stocks.

The downturn in the OMC stocks was on account of comments made by the US President that there won’t be any further waiver to countries like China, Greece, India and Japan from buying Iranian oil.

Iran is currently facing both US and international sanctions on account of several global issues. The US had provided a six month waiver to select few countries which enabled them to buy Iranian Oil despite the sanctions. The waiver will end in May and Trump has now said the US is not keen on extending this waiver.

Responding to the announcement, global crude oil prices surged 2 per cent to nearly $74 a barrel. Oil prices have already surged 37 per cent in 2019 so far, data showed. The non-extension of waiver is only a part of the problem as the OMCs are dealing with bigger issues, say analysts.

“The shortfall in oil exports from Iran can be compensated by higher production by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries but the process will take time,” said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research, IIFL Securities. “There are still several structural issues when it comes to Indian oil stocks such as lacklustre earnings, which will continue to weigh on the investor sentiment.”

Analysts said investors should pick the companies which do not depend on the oil business alone such as Reliance Industries. Also, Petronet and Gail which are not primarily into oil marketing could be safer bets.

Sectors sensitive to oil prices like paints could see a correction, said analysts. Asian Paints could be an exception in the space since it has ability to sustain margins without having to increase the prices of its products significantly, they said."

The Nifty50 index failed to surpass the 11,650 level on Tuesday and consolidated for most part of the session with sustained pressure at every small bounceback. 

The index has been falling from last three sessions and has started forming lower highs, but it is still respecting its multiple support at 11,550 level from last 16 sessions.

The index formed a bearish candle followed by a Bearish Belt Hold pattern on the daily scale, which indicated that the bears are now forcing the market to restrict its momentum.

The index saw its lowest daily close in last 16 sessions as the bears appeared to have got a grip on it near major support zones. If Nifty fails to hold the 11,550 level, then a consolidation breakdown could take it lower towards the 11,500-11,480 zone while resistance is shifting lower towards the 11,666 level.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,500 followed by 11,000 levels while maximum Call OI was at 11,700 followed by 12,000 levels. There was a shift in congestion of Call open interest from strike price 12,000 to 11,700, which indicated that the upside is being restricted to the 11,666-11,700 zone.

Meaningful Call writing was seen at 11,700 followed by 11,600 levels, while there was Put writing at 11,500 followed by 11,600 levels. The option band signified a shift in trading range to the 11,500-11,700 zone.

India VIX moved up 2.47 per cent to 24.65 level even as it made a high of 26.31 during the session. VIX is at its highest level in 38 months since February 2016. A rising VIX indicates limited upside with volatile swings.

Bank Nifty remained volatile and drifted towards the 29,450 level as it failed to hold multiple supports at 29,650 level. It formed a Three Black Crows pattern on the daily scale, which implies supply at higher levels as it tumbled from its lifetime high of 30,669. Now as long as the index holds below 29,750 level, it could extend losses towards 29,250 and then 29,000 levels, while on the upside, a major hurdle is seen at 30,000.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 11,590 with a loss of 0.24 per cent. There was long buildup in ONGC, Coal India, Bata India and ICICI Bank while shorts were seen in Bharti Infratel, Berger Paints, Bharti Airtel and GAIL.

60,2019-04-24,GAIL,"Dalal Street is testing the patience of stock investors. A spike in crude oil prices and a falling rupee have increased their worries amid uncertainty over election outcome and the ongoing earnings season.

Through the past week, Brent crude prices inched higher to come near the highs of Calendar 2019 after the US announced that all Iran sanction waivers would end in May. This put pressure on oil importers to stop buying oil from Tehran.

The rupee also lost muscles and weakened to the lowest level in more than a month on Monday.

The depressed rupee and boiling oil have added another layer of uncertainty for stock investors.

On Tuesday, the rupee recovered from the day's lows point to close higher by 5 paise at 69.62 against the dollar on some dollar selling by banks and exporters.

Oil prices inched lower on Wednesday on signs that global markets remain adequately supplied despite a jump to 2019 highs this week. Brent futures slipped 27 cents to $74.24 a barrel while WTI futures fell 28 cents to $66.02 a barrel.

But analysts say the local currency may remain under pressure, as crude oil prices are likely to remain at elevated levels in the near term.

Some analysts advised investors to tweak their portfolios to include sectors and stocks that may gain from these adversity for rupee and oil.

“In case of a falling rupee, investors should focus on sectors that earn major revenue from exports such as IT and pharmaceuticals. We believe the best bet would be IT, as pharma companies are currently grappling with pricing pressure in overseas markets and US FDA concerns,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Broking.

The BSE IT and Healthcare indices have risen 2.69 per cent and 0.89 per cent, respectively, in the past one month till April 22. On the other hand, BSE Sensex has advanced 1.26 per cent during the same period.

“Given the rise in crude oil prices, investors can also take sector and stock-specific bets,” said Manglik.

ETMarkets.com also collated a list of companies which garner more than 75 per cent of their revenues from exports. Besides IT and pharma companies, the list also includes players such as Tata Motors, Om Metals, Motherson Sumi, Sharda Cropchem, Allcargo Logistics, Hindalco Industries, Tokyo Plast, Kridhan Infra, Tata Coffee, Pearl Global, Zenith Exports, Camlin Fine Sciences and Aro Granite Industries, among others.

Ajay Bodke, CEO, PMS, Prabhudas Lilladher, said, “Companies that earn their revenues in dollars and whose costs are in rupee terms are the natural beneficiaries. All the exporters benefit from a falling rupee. IT and pharma would be major beneficiaries. When the rupee falls, exports become more competitive and imports become expensive. Global cyclicals like metal companies will also benefit, because the landed cost of steel would go up in rupee terms, thus raising the entry barrier. Auto ancillary companies would be the other major beneficiary of a weakening rupee.” 

Bodke, though, expects the rupee to stablilise in the near term, while he does not see crude oil price going back to its previous high of $86 per barrel.

Sameer Kalra, Founder, Target Investing, said White House has issued a statement confirming the curbs. “Opec will help make up for the gap left by Iran going to zero. But Brent will still be going up quickly towards our target of $80-85 a barrel,” he said. 

Bhavik Patel, Senior Technical Analyst of Commodities at Tradebulls Securities, said with Brent hovering above $70 level, it will be just a matter of time before rising current account deficit will create pressure on the rupee. “We may not see any sudden depreciation. Expect the rupee to take the stairs, instead of an elevator, on its way up,” he said.

Considering the likely rise in crude oil prices, some analysts recommended options in key FMCG stocks, which have better pricing power to pass on the hike in input costs to end users without taking a major hit on profitability. 

Kotak Institutional Equities maintained ‘buy’ ratings on GAIL and ONGC. The brokerage said both would be beneficiaries of elevated crude prices and can act as a good hedge against any spike in crude oil prices."

62,2019-04-24,GAIL,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India’s largest institutional investor, raised bets on banking as well as select auto, gas, retail and midcap IT stocks during March quarter, which saw domestic equity benchmark Sensex jump 7.22 per cent to 38,672 as of March 29 from 36,068 on December 31, 2018.

At the same time, LIC did some major portfolio overhaul, offloading shares of several telecom, metals, power generation, pharma, hotels, chemicals and cement companies.

The banking sector emerged a tempting bet during the quarter on hopes of earnings recovery and likely bottoming out of NPA provisioning. The insurance behemoth seems to have lapped up a number of banking stocks – both largecap and midcap. Shareholding data of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Federal Bank and IDBI Bank all showed a spike in LIC holding.

LIC also upped stake in Indian Overseas Bank and Syndicate Bank, but offloaded shares in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI. 

During the quarter, LIC completed the acquisition of 51 per cent controlling stake in IDBI Bank. RBI in March categorised IDBI Bank as a private lender for regulatory purposes with effect from January 21, 2019. LIC held 44.31 per cent stake in the bank as of December 31.

Elara Capital in a report said there has been a structural shift in the private banking space in the past few quarters, wherein private lenders steadily raised their term deposit (TD) rates.

“This is because private banks’ credit growth is outperforming CASA deposit growth. We expect credit growth of 20 per cent YoY for Q4FY19E against CASA deposit growth of 12 per cent YoY for private banks,” the brokerage said

The domestic equity market was upbeat through much of March quarter amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors on hopes of the Narendra Modi government coming back to power. 

Beyond banking, LIC also increased stake in select auto firms like Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Motors and M&M. LIC was not among key shareholders in Hindustan Motors as of December 31, 2018.

At the same time, it offloaded some stakes in the beaten-down Tata Motors. LIC held 5.10 per cent stake in the auto major as of March 2019 against 5.17 per cent at the end of December quarter.

Tata Motors earlier this month reported a 5 per cent decline in March sales globally, including that of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) vehicles, at 1,45,459 units. It had sold 1,53,156 units in March 2018.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 22 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 40 companies in March quarter, but reduced it in nearly 60 others.

India’s leading gas players Gail and Indraprastha Gas saw a lot of interest from the domestic institutional investor. 

LIC also picked up over 1 per cent stake in Linde India, NIIT Technologies, UPL and Spencer's Retail during the quarter. It was not among the key shareholders in these companies at December end.



In the pharma space, LIC sold shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, GSK Pharma, Glenmark Pharma, Lupin and Sanofi India, but bought additional shares in Cipla and Piramal Enterprises.

Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala recently said that the price erosion in the pharma sector is behind us. “Indian pharma market will tend to grow faster than it has grown. Pharma is not a market where demand can go down. You must know that 40-45 per cent of all medicines used in the US is made in India. I think it is a sunrise industry, it is not a sunset industry, it can never be a sunset industry,” he said.

Crisil, Tata Coffee, Bombay Dyeing, Indo Rama, Adani Ports, ONGC, OFSS, Rajesh Exports, Tata Chemicals, Exide Industries, Century Textiles, UltraTech Cement and Gillette India were among the other stocks in which LIC increased stake during the quarter.

However, it reduced stake in cement players ACC, Ambuja Cement, Heidelberg Cement, Jaiprakash Associates and India Cement and several hotel stocks including EIH, Hotel Leela Ventures, India Tourism Development Corporation and The Indian Hotels.

In the telecom space, LIC brought down its stake in Bharti Airtel to 3.72 per cent from 3.73 per cent in MTNL from 19.02 per cent to 18.49 per cent and in Reliance Communications from 5.97 per cent to 5.94 per cent."

65,2019-04-26,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: How have five years of the Modi raj changed Varanasi, his own constituency? Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to turn Varanasi into Kyoto, the Japanese town famous for its temples. The VVIP constituency of Varanasi may not have become another Kyoto but PM Modi sure has started and even inaugurated many ambitious projects. 

While election results will tell how Varanasi residents judge PM Modi's performance in his own constituency, on the day when PM Modi files his nomination papers to seek another term from Varanasi, we list below some of the prominent developmental projects initiated and delivered by the Modi government.


Multi-modal terminal on the Ganga 
For the first time in India's history, river transport has begun starting with Varanasi. Last year, PM Modi inaugurated India's first multi-modal terminal on the Ganga river in Varanasi and received the country's first container cargo transported on inland waterways from Kolkata. The first consignment containing food and beverage had set sail from Kolkata. This is the first of the four multi-modal terminals being constructed on the National Waterway-1 (river Ganga) as part of the World Bank-aided Jal Marg Vikas project of the Inland Waterways Authority of India. 


Roads
In November last year, PM Modi inaugurated two important roads, having a total length of 34 kilometres and built at a cost of Rs 1,571.95 crore, in Varanasi. The 16.55-km-long Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I has been built at a cost of Rs 759.36 crore, while the work of four-laning and construction of 17.25 km Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 cost Rs 812.59 crore. 

The Ring Road, with two rail overbridges and a flyover, allows traffic on NH 56 (Lucknow-Varanasi), NH 233 (Azamgarh-Varanasi), NH 29 (Gorakhpur-Varanasi) and Ayodhya-Varanasi highways to bypass Varanasi, thereby reducing traffic congestion in the city. This reduces travel time, fuel usage and pollution in the area.

The Babatpur Airport highway connects the city with the airport and goes on to link Jaunpur, Sultanpur and Lucknow. With a flyover at Harhua and a rail overbridge at Tarna, it reduces the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, providing a big relief to the people of the holy city and tourists.

National highway projects of total length 2,833 km, costing Rs 63,885 crore, are underway to link Varanasi with other places in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Of these, 15 road projects of 1,143 kilometre length are under various stages of construction. These include Varanasi-Jaunpur, Varanasi-Sultanpur, Sultanpur-Lucknow, Varanasi Ghaghra Bridge and Varanasi-Azamgarh. 


Kashi Vishwanath Temple to Ganga Ghat corridor 
This is PM Modi's dream project that can give Varanasi pilgrimage area a big makeover. This project will make Kashi Vishwanath Temple accessible to the pilgrims directly from the ghats along the Ganga, sparing them the struggle of reaching it through congested, serpentine lanes. The project, costing Rs 600 crore, is expected to be complete this year. 166 buildings have been demolished and 46 ancient temples and other buildings of architectural importance have been preserved. The 56-meter wide corridor will be over 300 meters in length. The temple is surrounded by narrow lanes which are full of dilapidated buildings and crumbling basic infrastructure. The narrow lanes and dilapidated buildings prevent fire-fighting system and medical facilities. The project aims to build world-class facilities for pilgrims in and around the temple. 


Cleaning the Ganga 
A total of 13 projects worth Rs 913 crore have been sanctioned for Varanasi under Namami Gange programme. Additionally, sewerage projects worth Rs 703.14 crore have been taken under JNNURM and AMRUT schemes. Varanasi is set to have zero sewer discharge in the holy river by November this year.
The Ganga Action Plan was launched by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in Varanasi on June 14, 1986 to reduce the pollution load on Ganga. Under Nitin Gadkari, the Ministry of Ganga Rejuvenation and its implementing arm National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) have taken up several projects for treatment of sewer water in Varanasi. 
According to officials, work on 50 MLD (million litres per day) sewage treatment plant at Ramana is nearing completion. By November this year, it is expected to be fully operational for treating discharge of Assi Nala. With this, flow of untreated sewer water from Varanasi city into the Ganga will be completely checked. Another 120 MLD treatment plant at Goitha is undergoing trials which will increase sewage treatment capacity to 412 MLD. 


Piped gas to households
PM Modi dedicated to the nation the Varanasi City Gas Distribution (CGD) network last year which will supply environment-friendly natural gas to the city's households, transport sector and industries. The foundation stone of the project was laid by PM Modi in 2016 as part of the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga initiative. The CGD network, which is being implemented by GAIL (India) Limited at a cost of Rs 755 crores, will cover 1,535 sq km and cater to a population of 36.76 lakh. 


Making Varanasi 'wireless'
Eighty-six years after Varanasi got electricity, overhead power cables in Varanasi were dismantled after a project to lay underground lines over 16 sq-km was completed last year. Laying underground cables for 50,000 consumers through the serpentine lanes and congested markets in one of the world’s oldest cities was quite a challenge. Powergrid took two years and finished the project in 2017. 


Cancer treatment facilities
PM Modi inaugurated the Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital in Varanasi last year. It is run by the Tata Memorial Trust. This is Tata Memorial Trust’s first such big cancer treatment centre in this region to cater to the population of Uttar Pradesh as well as Bihar. PM Modi had requested the Trust to take over the Railway Cancer Institute and refurbish it with the latest machines and equipment. The Trust has built another cancer tratment facility inside the Banaras Hindu University. The 352-bed Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre was built in record 10 months and was inaugurated in February.


Convention Centre

71,2019-04-30,GAIL,"Understanding valuation of the markets has become a tad difficult in the current situation. Most analysts are finding it difficult to ascertain whether the present valuation of big corporations justify their future trend of earnings. This is because of a lack of secular growth in demand across key sectors. Because of this, many big companies have adopted a cautious stance on capital expenditure. Given such an uncertainty, it makes sense to go to the basics of investing: Value Investing. The key reason being it is sharply focused on attractiveness of a stock based on its intrinsic value.

Among schemes which focus on value investing, investors can consider investing in Invesco India Contra Fund. The scheme is the best performer among its peers. In the past three- and five-year periods, it has given 16% and 19% returns while its peers logged 12% and 15% returns during the same periods, respectively. In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers Amit Ganatra and Taher Badshah have constructed a portfolio which has high weightage to private sector banks and IT companies. With a falling rupee and relatively lower non-performing asset (NPA) issues, private sector banks and IT companies look attractive.

A distinct feature of the scheme’s portfolio is it is quite diversified in terms of sectoral approach which works in identifying long-term ideas.

3,2019-05-06,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Tabassum Manzoor, 18, from Adampora in J&K's Kupwara district, will always remember the day she received a call from Indian Oil, asking her to join the company's 'Vidushi' programme in Noida for an all paid 11-month intensive coaching on cracking the IIT joint entrance exam (JEE).

That call is proving to be life-changing for Tabassum, who is among those who cracked the JEE Mains exam this year, the results of which were announced last week.

""I love computers and dreamt of becoming a software engineer. But I had no hope of turning it into reality as my family couldn't afford coaching. There's hardly any information or scope (on career building) in Kashmir. Vidushi has given me a chance to step out of Kashmir and pursue my dream by doing BTech, I have gained friends from different states… it's opened up a new world,"" she told TOI.

Tabassum is among the 252 successful aspirants, including 64 girls, from poor homes in J&K, Manipur, Assam, Odisha, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and UP tutored under CSR initiatives of cash-rich energy companies - Indian Oil's 'Vidushi', Central Coalfields Ltd's 'CCL Ke Lal and Ladli', GAIL's 'Utkarsh Super 100' and ONGC's 'Super 30'.

But involvement of company executives in mentoring sets 'Vidushi' and 'CCL Ke Lal and Ladli' programmes apart. ""Our programme is for girls only and hands-on. Women alumni of IITs head the batches in Noida and Bhubaneswar Vidushi centres, respectively. CGM Rashmi Govil in Noida and information systems officer Debjani Panda in Bhubaneswar give the girls pep talk. Chairman (Sanjiv Singh) has also visited to motivate them,"" IndianOil director (HR) Ranjan Kumar Mohapatra said.

CCL chairman Gopal Singh said a clutch of CCL executives based in Ranchi, themselves alumni of the premier institutions, coach the aspirants chosen from project-affected families. CCL also provides the selected students formal schooling for Class XI and XII.

The efforts are yielding rich dividends. Forty-six of the 56 'Vidushi' girls cracked JEE this year. All the 100 aspirants, including 14 girls at GAIL's Kanpur 'Utkarsh' centre sailed through. Its Dwarahat and Srinagar centres in Uttarakhand saw 24 and 26 students out of a batch of 30 each clearing JEE. Four 'Ladlis' and eight 'Ladlas' too made the grade as did 28 out of 30 of ONGC's 'Super 30' programme.

The companies fund the coaching programmes, which include free boarding and lodging as well as other consumables. Indian Oil also provide insurance to cover exigencies during the course. The aspirants are chosen through merit/exam schemes."

10,2019-05-09,GAIL,"HDFC Asset Management, the country’s largest mutual fund house by assets, lightened its largecap holdings and bought additional shares of select midcap and smallcap companies in April, when the benchmark equity indices advanced 1 per cent. 

The money manager more than doubled its holding in select aviation, NBFC, cement and consumer durables plays in April, even as it sold stake in industry leaders Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints and ICICI Bank. 

The fund house added more shares in as many as 61 companies, while reduced its holdings in as many as 84. NSE’s Nifty index rose nearly 8 per cent during the January-April period, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap100 shed up to 2 per cent each.

Brokerage Elara Capital says midcaps continue their underperformance against largecaps. “Relative valuations are plunging towards -1 standard deviation levels, making midcaps very attractive. A negative SD shows the price to equity ratio has slipped to the lower end of average valuations.

Stocks where the top fund manager raised its holding in April included in InterGlobe Aviation, where its holding has gone up to a whooping 1,94,200 shares as of April 30 from 15,600 on March 31. Likewise, it increased stake in Indiabulls Housing Finance (from 99,238 shares to 3,72,605), ACC (from 8,000 to 27,200) and Bajaj Electricals (from 8,65,300 to 24,60,000).

According to Stewart & Mackertich, improved pricing power, lower ATF coupled with rupee appreciation should aid an improvement in profitability of domestic airlines. With the global ban on Boeing 737 Max 8 planes coming into force from March, capacity is not likely to rise at the expected pace, thus demand should outpace supply in the near future. This means the prospects for yields would be encouraging, the brokerage said. 

“We expect IndiGo to outperform, as it has a deep domestic network with over 43 per cent market share, availability of slots, lowest cost structure and a healthy cash balance to fuel the airline,” the brokerage said.

ACC has been demonstrating sustained ability to improve sales volume since Q1CY17, which had remained stagnant through CY11-CY16. While its CY18 volume growth stood at 8.7 per cent YoY, capacity utilisation came in 85 per cent, Ashika Stock Broking said in a report. 

“We expect ACC to deliver improved RoE backed by better pricing and lower operating expenditure,” the brokerage said.

HDFC AMC also developed fancy for select power plays. Data shows the fund house bought over 1 crore additional shares in NTPC and BHEL during the month. It held 35.75 crore shares of NTPC and 2.04 crore shares of BHEL as of April 30, 2019.

Antique Stock Broking prefers utilities firm like NTPC over equipment makers like BHEL. “In the short run, for a year or two, demand in power equipment and projects is unlikely to grow. Policy makers are consolidating and streamlining the existing 68GW of projects under construction. Plus, in the near term, the focus is on making good of the 175GW renewable target. This is visible in subdued order pipeline for BHEL, a state-owned power-equipment manufacturer. However, with commissioning pace of thermal plants are inching up,” it said

Tiles firm Kajaria Ceramics, telecom major Bharti Airtel as well as private sector bank Karur Vysya Bank also drew interest of HDFC AMC, which added 13,000 shares of Kajaria, 43.65 lakh shares of Karur and 16.77 lakh shares of Airtel during the month.

Coal India, Bank of Baroda, Apollo Tyres, GAIL India, Sadbhav Engineering, Bharat Electronics, Tata Steel, Bharat Dynamics, Jagran Prakashan, Chambal Fertiliser, Power Finance Corporation, Firstsource Solution, REC, Redington, REC, Kalpataru Power, KEC International, Axis Bank, Indian Hotel, BPCL, Gabriel India, SBI, Cipla, ITC, ICICI Prudential, Zee Entertainment and HDFC were among other stocks where the fund house raised its stake during the month.

On the other hand, it offloaded more than 13 lakh shares in Infosys, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries. It also sold over 50,000 shares in Maruti Suzuki, Adani Enterprises, HPCL, Britannia, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Allahabad Bank, Wipro and NBCC, among others.

Brokerage firm YES Securities recently gave a ‘sell’ rating to Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 5,850. “Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) reported a weak performance in Q4FY19 with Ebidta coming in 8 per cent below expectations,” said YES Securities.

In the Nifty50 pack, shares of companies like Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, Wipro and HCL Technologies surged over 20 per cent in the first four months of 2019, while Hero Moto, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki declined over 10 per cent.

Average asset under management (AUM) of HDFC AMC stood at Rs 3.43 lakh crore as of March 31, 2019. It was followed by ICICI Prudential AMC (Rs 3.21 lakh crore) and SBI Fund Management (Rs 2.84 lakh crore) in terms of AUM."

20,2019-05-16,GAIL,"New Delhi: The RIL-BP combine made its first bid for an oil and gas exploration block in more than a decade, vying for one of the 32 blocks up for auction in the OALP-II and III bid rounds, which saw mining major Vedanta put in as many as 30 bids and ONGC, for 20 areas. Bidding for 14 blocks on offer in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round-II and another 18 oil and gas blocks and 5 coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks on offer in OALP-III closed on Wednesday. 

Official sources said Vedanta, which had walked away with 41 out of the 55 blocks offered in OALP-I last year, bid for 30 areas. 

 Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bid for 20 blocks while Oil India Ltd (OIL) bid for 15. 

Indian Oil Corp (IOC), GAIL (India) and SunPetro bid for two blocks each, they said. 

 Reliance Industries-BP made an offer for one block off the east coast. 

 The block they bid for possibly is the one which BP had demarcated during the expression of interest (EoI) stage. 

India had in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. 

Under this policy, called open acreage licensing policy or OALP, companies are allowed to put in an EoI for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually. 

The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage. 

 The two window of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31. 

 Sources said EoIs accumulated till May 15, 2018 were offered in OALP-II and those that came in by November 15, 2018 in OALP-III. The two rounds ran concurrently. 

 The government had in January offered 14 blocks in OALP-II bid round and a month later offered another 23 oil and gas blocks and CBM blocks in third round. 

 Bids for the 14 blocks offered in OALP-II bid round, covering an area of 29,333 square kilometers, were to close on March 12 but the deadline was extended to April 10 and then again to May 15, according to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH). 

 April 10 was also the bid deadline for the 23 oil and gas and CBM blocks offered in the third round, which was launched on February 10. Its bid deadline too was extended to May 15. 

 OALP-II bid round was delayed by six months and its launch came barely a month before the third round. 

 Sources said OALP-II and OALP-III ran concurrently. 

 Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had at the time of launch of OALP-II bid round on January 7 stated that an investment of about Rs 40,000 crore is expected in the prospecting of oil and gas in blocks offered. 

 In the first round of OALP last year, as much as Rs 60,000 crore was committed in the exploration of oil and gas in 55 blocks or areas. 

 In the third round, the government is expecting up to $700 million (about Rs 49,000 crore) of investment that it hopes will help raise domestic output and cut imports. 

 The first OALP round was launched in 2017 and bids came in by May 2018. EoIs for second round closed on May 15, 2018, and the blocks were supposed to be put for auction by June but the round was delayed for unknown reasons. OALP-II was finally launched on January 7. 

 In the meanwhile, EoIs in the third window also closed on November 15, 2018 with as many as 18 blocks and five CBM blocks, measuring 31,722 sq km, being sought for. OALP-III bid round was launched on February 10 with April 10 as the last date for bidding. 

 Officials said the 14 blocks in OALP-II are estimated to hold in-place resource of 12,609 million tonne oil and oil equivalent gas. 

 In OALP-1, mining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. State-owned Oil India won nine blocks while ONGC managed to win just two. 

 The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration prior to OALP. 

 Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells. 

 Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence. 

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10 per cent to 67 per cent by 2022 and to half by 2030. 

 Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India imports nearly 84 per cent of its oil needs. 

 The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block."

26,2019-05-21,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The resolution process for 10 profitable IL&FS group companies, having total debt of Rs 11,564 crore, is underway, the government informed the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday.

The board IL&FS, which has to repay over Rs 90,000 crore to lenders, has decided to adopt an ""asset level resolution"" with regard to various group companies and entities.

The directors of IL&FS have contemplated that ""an asset level resolution and the sale of business verticals comprising of a basket of companies and other entities"" is the most feasible option for the resolution of the debt of the company.

State-run GAIL has emerged as the highest bidder with offer of Rs 4,800 crore for IL&FS Wind Energy Ltd (IWEL), which has seven operating wind power plants.

""Final bids received. GAIL India Ltd has emerged as the highest bidder,"" the affidavit said.

The ministry also said Japan-based Orix Corporation, which has 49 per cent stake in each of the seven projects, has expressed its intention to acquire remaining 51 per cent stake in each of them.

The expected date of closure of the process for IWEL is June 30.

Regarding ONGC Tripura Company Ltd, which has a total debt of Rs 3,337 crore, discussions are going on between ONGC and Tripura government.

For Gujarat International Finance Tec-City Company Ltd -- which has a total debt of Rs 1,233 crore -- discussions are going on with the Gujarat government. The government has 50 per cent stake in the entity.

According to the affidavit, discussions are progressing with IOCL regarding IL&FS Paradip Refinery Water Ltd's valuation of assets. The entity's debt is around Rs 747 crore.

However, no bids have been received for IL&FS Solar Power, which has debt of Rs 632 crore.

For Mangalore SEZ, discussions is going on with ONGC on valuation while sale process is being looked at for Tamil Nadu Water Investment Co and its subsidiary New Tirupur Area Development Corporation.

The resolution process for IL&FS Securities Services and its subsidiary ISSL Settlement & Transaction Services Ltd, which owes Rs 223 crore, is facing challenges due to ongoing investigations.

They are ""currently facing challenges due to restriction imposed under investigations being carried out by investigative and regulatory agencies against an intermediary broker-client of ISSL,"" the affidavit said.

In the case of IL&FS Technologies, the ""board has approved a process akin to a Swiss challenge process,"" it noted.

During proceedings at the NCLAT, senior advocate Ramji Srinivasan said classification of seven more entities has been completed. Five of them have been put under 'green' category and the remaining two have been put under 'red' category.

Classification of 11 other entities is under process, he added.

NCLAT has directed listing the matter for hearing on May 27.

Under its resolution plan, the government has categorised IL&FS group entities into green, amber and red categories based on their respective financial positions.

Entities classified as 'green' would continue to meet their payment obligations, while 'amber' category firms can meet only operational payment obligations to senior secured financial creditors.

Those falling in the 'red' category are entities which cannot meet their payment obligations towards even senior secured financial creditors."

29,2019-05-26,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Equity markets are likely to remain euphoric in the coming days following the BJP's emphatic victory in the general elections, even as participants may start to shift their focus to policy reforms, earnings growth and global cues, analysts said.

The Sensex and Nifty rallied to record closing highs Friday after the ruling BJP secured a comfortable majority in the lower house, raising expectations of more business-friendly measures by the Narendra Modi-led government.

""Stock market likes certainty. The strength of this mandate for the BJP assures stability in government, stability in governance and continuation of the development agenda for the next five years. In all likelihood, the market will remain euphoric in the coming days. Post that, focus will shift back to corporate earnings, liquidity situation and global events,"" said Amar Ambani, President and Head of Research, Yes Securities.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won over 300 seats on its own out of 542 seats in the Lok Sabha elections.

""Markets had a very vigorous week and therefore sufficient rest will be needed before it can find new pace. Volatility will eventually come down and rationality will prevail. Benchmark indices might not give any direction this week but could face mild downward pressure and Indian markets will finally align with global mood.

""As of now, a wait and watch approach should be followed by markets at least till the monetary policy and budget announcement by the elected government, which might be a game changer,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities and StockNote.

Last week, the 30-share BSE Sensex gained over 1,503 points to close at 39,434.72 on Friday.

Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research said, ""An event has finally come to an end with the mandate and now markets are about to shift its focus to other factors. At this point of time for market, we believe one of the factors that's crucial is crude oil. Markets will also try to establish the earnings guidance for next fiscal and quarters.""

BHEL, GAIL, InterGlobe Aviation, PNB and SpiceJet are among the major companies set to announce their results this week.

The ongoing trade tussle between the US and China, movement of rupee, crude oil and investment trend by overseas investors would also influence trading, analysts added.

According to Vijay Chandok, MD and CEO, ICICI Securities, ""With the decisive mandate, we expect policy continuity and look forward to next generation of reforms, which will take Indian economy to the next phase of accelerated growth. The optimism of a strong mandate could have a positive impact on both FPI flows and domestic flows (which have been lacklustre in the recent past).""

""With the stable government in the saddle for the next five years, we expect reforms process to gather momentum. The economy was in the repair mode for the last 5 years. We expect the government to take affirmative measures to ensure that the economic engine fires on all cylinders.

""The government has to ensure that rural distress is attended, liquidity crisis in financial/debt markets is taken care of and conducive atmosphere for industrial growth is established to capitalise on the demographic dividends of the country,"" Axis Securities said in a note."
28,2019-05-26,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Despite strong volatility, domestic equities logged solid gains during the week gone by as a majority verdict for the Narendra Modi-led NDA infused bullish sentiment in the market. 

Analysts said investors, who were staying away from the market due to uncertainty in the runup to the general election, are coming to the market now.

For the week gone by, headline indices Sensex and Nifty jumped 4 per cent.

The coming week may see more volatility due to the expiry of May series futures & options contracts. Analysts are advising investors to go for contrarian bets as the market may now start reacting to macroeconomic numbers, corporate earnings and global cues.

“When corporate or election results are as per market expectations, it is pointless to act on information that is already known to all. Everything has been already discounted for and, therefore, taking a contrarian bet could be far more profitable than going with the consensus,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote.

Board meetings (FULL LIST) 



Analyst calls 
• Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Sun TV Network and lowered target price to ₹690 from ₹740. Till the time the flux gets settled, impact from TRAI’s tariff order along with mounting pressure on viewership share and margins, warrants a discount to the average multiple, said Motilal Oswal. 

• CLSA has retained sell rating on Ashok Leyland with a target price of ₹65. Truck industry growth has slowed down in the last six months and there is high likelihood of a downturn ahead after five years of upcycle and new axle norms raising capacity of existing fleet, said CLSA. Falling share of highertonnage trucks in volumes is a further drag, said CLSA. 

• ICICIdirect has maintained reduce rating on eClerx Services with a revised target price of ₹860. Healthy growth trajectory in managed services and improving deal pipeline are key positives, said ICICIdirect. However, client specific issues in some buckets and limited visibility of margin enhancement levers is expected to keep profitability muted for the next two years, the brokerage said. 

• Phillip Capital retained sell rating on ITD Cementation India and revised target price to ₹90 from ₹115. ITDC delivered a disastrous March quarter, with loss at EBITDA level, the brokerage said. The loss, attributable to the Bengaluru metro project, is expected to dampen the FY20 margins too, the brokerage said.

• Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on Dabur India and revised target price to ₹470 from ₹500. Dabur has the bestpositioned staples portfolio in India, said Morgan Stanley. That said, execution on new product launches over the past two years has been weak, the brokerage said.

41,2019-05-29,GAIL,"MUMBAI: State-run Gail India has approached the bankruptcy court to include its claim of around Rs 390 crore in the insolvency resolution process of Videocon Industries.

The natural gas transportation and distribution company has approached the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) after the resolution professional of Videocon rejected its claim.

“There was already a dispute between Gail and Videocon and it was in arbitration,” argued Akshat Khare, partner of law firm Moson Le Exparts, who was appearing for Gail. However, soon after the admission of the insolvency petition, the moratorium period to legal proceedings against the company started and so the arbitration also got stayed, he said.

MK Shrawat, a judicial member of the NCLT, asked Videocon’s resolution professional (RP), Anuj Jain of KPMG, to file his reply by June 10, and gave Gail until June 17 to file its rejoinder. The tribunal will hear the matter further on July 8. “Earlier, in a similar development, the RP of Essar steel, as well as Alok Industries, had also rejected the claim of Gail but after it contested in the NCLT, respective tribunals had directed the resolution professionals of those companies to include Gail’s claim as an operational creditor,” Khare argued.

Jain didn’t respond to an email seeking comment until press time Wednesday.

Videocon Industries owes more than Rs 4,188 crore to its operational creditors as of April 9, and Rs 59,450 crore to financial creditors. The Videocon Group, which includes telecom, energy and consumer durable businesses, owes over Rs 85,000 crore to lenders."

48,2019-05-31,GAIL,"There are three pockets where we are seeing continuous interest from HNI investors and even FIIs, said Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, in an interview with ETNOW. The three themes are PSU banks, capital goods and the smallcaps and midcaps.Edited excerpts:

What are you telling your clients? Is it time to cash out or time to just ride the good trend?After the election, there are three broader themes that customers are clearly looking at; one is obviously the PSU banks side, where there is a clear thought that liquidity is going to improve going forward. There is also an expectation that because of the Bimal Jalan Committee recommendation, some money could come in and that could be used for the recapitalisation of PSU banks. 

Second, on the midcap, smallcap side, there were a lot of stocks. Since they have corrected a lot, there is a lot of expectation of rebound there. 

Third, on the capital goods side, one is clearly seeing a good amount of traction. These are the three pockets where we are seeing continuous interest, especially from HNI investors. From the FIIs side also, one can see a positive bias in the flows that one is seeing in the markets. Add to that, the crude price going down is an icing on the cake for the Indian markets over the last 10 days. 


 Crude is down. Should we start celebrating or realise that the slowdown in crude is largely because of demand constraints?For a country like India, it helps even if it is because of a slowdown in demand. We are oil importers and with the kind of constraint that we are seeing on the fiscal front, when the crude prices go to higher levels, like for example, $100 in 2009-10, Pranab Mukherjee had to come out with a stimulus that hurt the economy a lot. So from that perspective, even if some amount of slowdown occurs, net-net, it is positive for India. I do not at all see that as a big negative unless crude price goes to $25 which is unlikely. That is likely to happen only when you see a real slowdown happening in the global economy. 

From my perspective, if the crude price stays at the current level that is still good. See there is some amount of inflation which is always required in the economy. For India if you need a nominal GDP growth of between 13% and 16%, so that there are some amount of corporate earnings, a decent amount of crude is always good but if it is very high, then also it affects negatively.

At the current price, things look quite sanguine to us. A lot of companies within India are facing challenges because of higher commodity prices. Once you see this fall, ultimately impacting the prices of raw material, they can easily pass it on stimulating demand for the domestic market. 


What is your best idea from the midcap space? Where is a six-eight month positioning warranted?Gujarat Gas is one of the stocks which going forward could see significant improvement in terms of earnings. In Morbi, there has been an order by the National Green Tribunal and as a result of that everyone is shifting to gas from other conventional fuels and as a result of that, we clearly see that the volumes from Morbi doubling for Gujarat Gas. 

For that reason, we believe that the stock should do pretty well going forward irrespective of what happens on the market, they have a clear advantage over other companies like GAIL in Morbi and for that reason this is one stock one can buy for the next six months and it is a high conviction pick from our side. 


What would be your strategy within the financials?When you have banks like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI, those would be the favourites in terms of going forward, in terms of what takes this rally up within the space. However, one can look at some of the smaller banks like Federal Bank which came out with very good set of numbers. 

On the PSU side, BoB is likely to do pretty well over the next couple of quarters, as we see a significant reduction in slippages. Going forward, a lot of the issues with regard to funding, growth capital required for the PSU banks would be taken care of at least partly by the government because that is one major overhang. 

The cost of income ratio of most of the PSU banks is coming down. Going forward, clearly with the mergers within the PSU banks, you can clearly see structurally the opex per branch coming down for most of the banks and that could add significantly to the ROA of these banks going forward. 

I feel that financials is the right one to look at if you want to go on the non-banking space. Clearly, the macro finance companies or even the gold loan companies will continue to lead the rally going forward within the space.


Do you believe that all the positives are already in the price on a headline index level and may be now time has come to shift focus to hunting within mid and small caps?Just four days back, we had an investor event where I asked around 80 people if they believed that the market could go up 15% from current levels over next one year and not even 1% was ready to put his hand up. So, there is this still a little bit of concern among retail investors whose hands have clearly been burnt in the last couple of quarters.

There is some positivity but that is largely happening on more of the HNI money which has started to come in. Going forward, we see recovery in some of the stocks, like we have seen in last one week. Most of the midcap, smallcap stocks are up 7% to 10%. 

Going forward, we do see that the fear would come down and greed would probably take over in the next couple of weeks."

0,2019-06-03,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Despite weak global cues, domestic benchmark indices got off to a positive start on Monday as ease in crude oil prices globally further boosted hopes of a policy rate cut by the RBI in its policy review later this week. 

The upside in the market though remained capped as macro data including a 5-year low GDP and weak auto sales numbers suggested that the domestic economy might not be immune to the global slowdown.

3,2019-06-05,GAIL,"India has started work on restructuring state-owned companies and on the immediate agenda is the bifurcation of GAIL (India) into marketing and transportation units — one of them to be sold — and a three-way merger of power generation companies NTPC, SJVN and NHPC.

“We are looking at various combinations,” said a finance ministry official aware of developments.


Agencies

Indian Oil Corporation, the state-owned refiner, had evinced interest in natural gas processing and distribution company GAIL last year, and may be a potential buyer, the official said.

IOC is the second-biggest gas marketer in India, after GAIL.

The government holds 52.64% in GAIL, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 80,844 crore.

“In the past, the petroleum ministry had some reservations... we expect to iron out these issues this time,” the official said, adding that the government could raise about Rs 30,000 crore from a stake sale in such an exercise.

In a similar transaction last fiscal, the government sold its entire stake in REC, formerly Rural Electrification Corporation, to state-run Power Finance Corporation for Rs 14,500 crore. Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, India’s biggest exploration company, bought the government’s entire stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation for Rs 36,915 crore.

The government has set a disinvestment target of Rs 90,000 crore for the current financial year. It raised Rs 84,972.16 crore in 2018-19 against a target of Rs 80,000 crore.

The other plan being considered is the merger of NTPC, NHPC and SJVN. NTPC, the country’s largest power generator, may eventually becoming a holding company. The official said one option is for NHPC to buy out government stake in SJVN and at a later stage, become holding company for both utilities. The government’s 61.93% in SJVN is valued at about Rs 6,000 crore at current market price. It holds 73.33% in NHPC, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 25,597 crore.

Another government official said an alternative is that NTPC buys out the Centre’s entire stake in SJVN and NHPC takes over North Eastern Electric Power Corporation, making it a strong portfolio of hydropower firms.

“These are being discussed,” the second official said, adding that the proposals will be taken up by the new ministerial committee that will oversee mergers and stake sales once the panel is notified.

Experts said the government should focus on strategic sales.

“Rather than raid the cash reserves of CPSEs, the government should look to sell non-strategic companies to the private sector or opt for golden share and sell the rest,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Container Corporation of India."
23,2019-06-06,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: A slowdown in economic growth had led to Dalal Street already pricing in a 25-basis point cut in repo rate and a change in stance was also not ruled out. But on Thursday when RBI moved along the expected lines, concerns over growth and liquidity overshadowed the rate cut, so much so that benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty logged biggest one-day fall of 2019.

BSE barometer Sensex slipped 554 points or 1.38 per cent to 39,530. NSE Nifty settled at 11,844, down 178 points or 1.48 per cent.

The MPC voted unanimously in favour of a rate cut and RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that a rate hike was off the table for now.

Bank, financials along with index heavyweight RIL were the cause behind market's decline. For every one stock that gained on BSE, three declined.

Besides, Donald Trump's fresh threat of tariffs on China further soured the already weak global market sentiment.


Market at a glance
Among Sensex stocks, eight settled in the black and 22 in the red. IndusInd Bank, YES Bank, SBI, L&T, Tata Steel and M&M were the top losers, shedding up to 7 per cent.

Coal India, on the other hand, rose 1.92 per cent to top the leaderboard. Power Grid, HUL, Hero MotoCorp and NTPC were among other gainers.

All sectors on BSE ended in the red. Oil & Gas was the worst performing sector, with GAIL as the top drag. Capital Goods, Bankex, Financials and Industrials were other sectors that put on a weak show, falling over 2 per cent each.

Midcaps and smallcaps fell in line with Sensex. BSE Midcap shed 1.77 per cent and BSE Smallcap 1.60 per cent.

DHFL shares tanked to end 15.86 per cent lower after rating agencies downgraded the commercial papers (CP) issued by the debt-laden company to ‘default’ grade.


Factors that weighed on the market:

Liquidity remains a concernRBI didn’t have much to say on addressing the liquidity crisis, which killed market enthusiasm. RBI, analysts said, failed to assuage investor concerns over NBFCs a day after DHFL’s failure to pay interest on NCDs led to its downgrade to ‘default’ status by three rating agencies

Governor Das during media interaction said liquidity -- where a deficit had been bothering the financial system for nearly a year -- is in surplus now, and he vowed to ensure there is enough liquidity for every productive purpose.


Revision of GDP forecastAssuming more headwinds, the Reserve Bank of India narrowed down its GDP forecast for the current fiscal to 7 per cent from 7.2 per cent. It can be noted that that FY19 ended with a lower than estimated 6.8 percent, as the fourth quarter GDP came in at a five-year low of 5.8 per cent.


Trump's trade war saga continuesUS President Donald Trump threatened to hit China with tariffs on “at least” another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, but said he thought both China and Mexico wanted to make deals in their trade disputes with the United States. China's major stock indexes fell to close at near four-month lows while pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.6 per cent.


Expert Take
A possible reason of the fall could also be that there was no mention in the policy about addressing the liquidity stress in the NBFC space. With recent news around DHFL and the possible contagion effect, several financials corrected heavily today. However, I believe that market will soon take cognizance of the change in policy stance to accommodative and LAF liquidity turning surplus. This dovish policy opens the doors to another rate cut in 2019- Amar Ambani, President & Research Head, YES Securities"

25,2019-06-06,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended with heavy losses on Thursday, dragged by concerns of slowing economic growth and liquidity crunch in the NBFC space. 

A rate cut by RBI and change in policy stance failed to lift investor sentiment, as the market was expecting a positive surprise, especially some steps to address the concerns over the poor health of NBFCs. 

“While the rate cut of 25 basis points was in line with expectations, concerns over growth and challenges regarding liquidity continued to linger. The market did not cheer the rate cut, as it had already been factored in and something more was expected,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

26,2019-06-07,GAIL,"ET Intelligence Group: GAIL (India), the country’s largest gas transmission company, lost over onetenth of its market capitalisation on Thursday after the industry regulator raised gas tariffs far below the analysts’ expectations.

The gas transportation tariff under the new norms of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) will increase by 4 per cent for its most significant pipeline for FY20, compared with the Street’s expectation of a 15-20 per cent hike.

The lower-than-expected tariff hike will translate into 4-8 per cent earnings downgrade for the current fiscal. The company derives about onethird of the operating profit and 45 per cent of the sum of part valuation from the gas transmission segment. The other segments include petrochemicals, LPG production and transportation and natural gas marketing.

Bloomberg
The gas regulator has computed tariff of the old Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) pipeline and new HVJ pipeline on an integrated basis, which means it has considered both the pipelines as one unit.

The tariff is calculated based on capacity utilisation, capital expenditure, inflation and economic life in such a way that the pipeline earns a post-tax return of 12 per cent and pre-tax return of 18 per cent. The procedure uses a discounted cash flow model to arrive at the gas transmission tariff.

The old and new HVJ are parallel pipelines and account for nearly 60 per cent of the gas transmission volume of GAIL. Historically, the regulator has been computing the tariff of both the pipelines separately. The gas tariff of the old HVJ and new HVJ were Rs 25.46 and Rs 53.65 per MMBtu, respectively, under the old method of tariff calculation.

GAIL had sought tariffs of Rs 114 and Rs 79 per MMBtu for old and new HVJ respectively. However, PNGRB approved lower tariffs of Rs 43.7 for the old pipeline and Rs 56.7 for the new one. On an integrated basis, the approved tariff for the pipeline is Rs 41.1 per MMBtu.

The key reason for the tariff hike being lower than Street expectation is the economic life of the pipelines under the integrated tariff regime, which has been extended to March 2035 from March 2032.

The higher economic life has resulted in a relatively lower integrated gas tariff on account of the increase in the number of years in the discounted cash flow model.

Another explanation for the lower tariff is that under PNGRB rules, a company has to forego 50 per cent of incremental regulated revenue for an existing network. The regulator has considered new HVJ as an extension of the old HVJ, which has resulted in lower blended tariff.

The lower gas tariff for the key pipeline may lead to a downward revision in the blended tariff for the current fiscal. In FY19, GAIL had blended gas tariff of Rs 1.47 per standard cubic metre. The 4 per cent rise in tariff would translate into marginal growth for FY20.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects 6 per cent increase in GAIL’s blended tariffs for the gas transmission segment to Rs 1.57/scm from its earlier expectation of Rs 1.62/scm. Consequently, it cut EPS for FY20 and FY21by 3 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.

CLSA said that tariff revision proved to be a big disappointment and reduced the stock’s target price to Rs 365 from Rs 420 and downgraded the stock from ‘buy’ to ‘underperform’."

Bull or Bear? Stay on top of the game with our LIVE MARKET BLOG"
28,2019-06-07,GAIL,"Half of India’s problems come from huge profiteering by a protected sector of banks under the RBI umbrella. You link all the loans to RBI repo rate and you will see the economic growth going up, says Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance. The only place fully invested in right now is PSUs and banks. Like Shylock, banks make money and therefore we will invest in Shylocks.  Edited excerpts: 


Are you bullish, are you bearish? How are you feeling about the market?I would say it is an excellent market. Markets are looking good because even the correction yesterday came at the back of a 1000-point-odd rally and it is normal if you are a market operator that you will create some short positions and you will sell out at this kind of a rally. This rally is based on liquidity and if you are a decent trader or investor, you will know that there will be bad days in the market in terms of liquidity and in terms of news flow. Yesterday apparently both happened at the same time. 

RBI never came up with anything on NBFCs and the FIIs sold in the afternoon. It was a pretty potent mixture. If you are in a rally which is not based on fundamentals, which is based on pure liquidity, the way it is today, then you will have to go through this good and bad days and that is the good part of it. 

Now the next part is what are we doing? What we are doing is taking cues from what is happening in politics, the new Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, taking cues to believe in our belief that this five-year term will be the term of the PSU stocks, they will be sold. I think the companies will be sold. First the industrial companies, then the banking sector will be put under the sale banner. We are positioned pretty strongly with large allocations to PSU companies, which has done reasonably well so far. They should do pretty good in the times to come, either in terms of a sale and value which is pretty cheap or in terms of dividend. Whichever way, I will not complain.


First privatisation will happen. You say first industrials and then banks and then non-core businesses. By now, you must have your list ready also?Yes, the power sector is straight away on top of the agenda that will be privatised first in our view because there is global demand for utilities as companies. It is a huge demand from pension funds, etc, who want to invest in fixed income utilities equivalent and therefore we believe that the easiest ones to park out could be the power companies and all the power companies -- luckily in Indian context, the PSUs -- are profitable. They are not very badly leveraged. This quarter’s performance has been good across the board. The block of companies involved in the power sector would be the first to go because they can be easily sold as global capital likes these kind of companies. And it does not have too many linkages with the government. Of course they need to sort out issues of Discom, etc. But I am sure they can do that. The set of power companies should be the first to go.


Are there any specific companies that you are thinking of? You have actually seen a pretty strong exposure there. Would you recommend investors to get into some of these names in anticipation of privatisation?I cannot recommend any cases for regulatory reasons. I am not here to recommend. But I can only tell you that we have positioned ourselves pretty strongly in things like transmission, which is Power Grid, at this point of time. It is the number one holding and then we have gone into Power Finance which is linked to Power Grid and the power sector. Then, of course, there is NTPC and BHEL down the line. It is a whole gamut of companies. There are not too many luckily and so it is not too difficult to pick and choose what you want but I believe that the transmission companies, like Power Grid, etc, have the best chances and best value because they are into serious annuity income business and they cannot be duplicated easily. They got a monopoly status. If somebody is buying them, I think there will be a reasonable chance of annuity income. 

Of course, you can have a surprise in transmission company like GAIL happened yesterday which can bring the price down quite sharply. But I am quite sure that some pitfall will be avoided as the new government steps in. Yesterday GAIL was a misfortune accentuated by market sentiments. I am sure that will not happen. So, you will start from the grid companies to the generation companies and then to the capital equipment would be the last in the hierarchy. 


Do you think now there is enough reason to remain fully invested? You may have an odd bout of volatility -- it could be 5% for largecaps, 15% for midcaps and even higher for smallcaps. Do you think the optimism will be rewarded and one should be fully invested for the course of next one to three years now?That is a difficult question because we have got a cash holding of almost 20% at this point of time because we reasonably believe that the worst is still to come in terms of economic data. Whether it translates to share price, I do not know but it is wise to keep some money on the sides. We wouldn’t recommend to remain 100% invested at this point of time. Since it is a liquidity-driven rally, fundamentals can overwhelm at any point of time and that is when you want to keep some powder dry to go and invest into companies. 

When you are looking into a euphoric market like what it is today, you must have something on the sidelines and corrections will come. Corrections will come. It has nothing to do with India. Its the global flows which make a difference. Oil prices are very benign at this point of time. They may spike up. So investing 100% at this point in an economy which is wobbling so badly, is not a good idea. Whether we will be rewarded in three years timeframe, I am sure we should be rewarded because the question remains that how much worse can it get and the reason I say how worse is because the drought conditions in the country could literally overwhelm the government finances as they try to deal with issues of rural distress, farm distress, provide succour to people. Even water is not easily available. It is not like you give money and say go buy water. The kind of cost involved in getting water to literally a population the size of America is not going to be cheap and that is where the problem lies. It will upset the whole market dynamics for some time to come. May not be three years but certainly the next six months. I would say 20% money on the side is definitely required. You will get lots of chances to buy in this market.



What is your take on an ADAG Group or the Indiabulls Group? Would you be interested in having exposure to these names?Of course not, but having said that, there is demand and enough capital available for promoters to exit a business like real estate in an environment like this today. It is a great news for the capital market that there is enough capital in silos. Number two is disappointment in valuations. It is going at one time book value which really tells me that the business had no premium built into it. To that extent, if you are on fire sale mode, there is enough capital available. 

I do not think it is a good idea to invest in ADAG etc, because it is not only the issue of what is the residual value of the business, but also the regulatory risk of what is happening in those companies, the kind of transactions you already saw in IL&FS, in Jet Airways. The SFIO has walked in. So, some of the companies which had regulatory overhangs will continue to have them for sometimes. It is not a wise thing to start investing in those kind of stocks. 

A speculator can do it, he can sell and buy at 10 paisa difference in a day that is a job of a speculator, not an investor. You get good companies, do not waste your hard-earned money .


In light of the correction that one has seen in ITC, there are lots of rumour doing the rounds that perhaps in the next GST meeting, there is going to be another sin tax coming in and it may be a tobacco tax. What would that would make you a little wary of investments into liquor names or for that matter some of the tobacco names?We have to pare down our holdings. We look at the budget of the government. There is no discretionary money left for for them to spend on any of the schemes they have announced -- be it Ayushman Bharat or PM Kisan. Money has to come from somewhere. The normal sectors of the economy are fully loaded and under the GST council. Now what is left with the government?

Budget has lost relevance because only the GST council decides all the domestic taxes. Only import taxes can be levied by the budget. Therefore, it is logical to assume two things will happen down the line: one, more resources will be required and therefore you can go and tap tobacco and the sin tax. Two, liquor companies have an overhang now with this kind of government majority and the preponderance theme is that we should have prohibition in more states than one,

You could see a lot of pressure coming in the Assembly elections. A local party announcing prohibition in the state, we saw some resonance of that in Telangana. We can see it in the northeast. The liquor companies are going to be pushed against the wall in India in a scenario where there is a demand for prohibition. That should shrink the market or at least make it uncertain. Sin tax, definitely, is on the way in a big way because there is nobody else who can pay the tax. Income tax is over. The GST rates are already much higher. Where do you go for money? Easy money is where the liquor and tobacco is. It is prudent to believe that these will be taxed in a big way, if not this year, but years to come.


This is something which the government is going to take cognisance of. We have seen in the past, cigarette smuggling from neighbouring countries had become a huge menace.In Europe it is. The biggest items being smuggled across from England to France and elsewhere is cigarettes. There is a political dynamics playing out as well and the scramble for resources is a problem. Politicians in the country need money to take distress-alleviation measures in a big way. In the next 12 to 18 months where does the government find the resources? In defence, they have to replace obsolete AN-32s. People in drought ridden states need money. The government needs money. Healthcare for all needs money. 

At the end of the day in an economy growing at 5% and 5.5%, who is going to fund all these plans? Someone should and will and those are the only places that you go to the guy who cannot get out of addiction and buys whatever packet of cigarette at double the price. Maybe he will downgrade perhaps but there is no choice. So economic logic notwithstanding, circumstances will force this at least in the present context of the budget and in the next 12 to 18 months.


So how should we summarise our today’s interaction? You were sounding bullish but yet you are sitting on cash. What does that mean?It is quite simple. You have to wait for the economics to play itself out and this kind of market which runs on liquidity will give you lots of chances to buy into. We get cash because every year most investors generate more, surplus cash income. They have fresh money to invest. It is incremental money coming into the system. Now do I want to deploy it in this market at this stratospheric level? I would say no, definitely not. Am I exiting the market? No. So it is a greed and fear at the same time. I feel there will be enough chances for me to buy in, still I am holding on to the long position in various stocks. 

It is difficult to explain but I would say that in the present state of the economy, there will be lots of chances. We have not seen the end of the economic cycle on the downturn. We will see more of it in the April, May, June quarter and I know lots of brokerages have said 25% growth rate, etc, etc, but that is all bunkum. 

There is no 25% growth any CEO is talking about in this country on earning side. So leave that aside. The only thing where we are fully invested is the banks and the reason I tell you very quickly is because banks are the protected species of India. If you historically write the economic history for the last 10 years, the single reason why India has struggled on growth is that the banks have taken too much off the table in profitability. There is no other reason why bank loans are still not linked to RBI rate, repo rate in the market. The banks have stalled it for some time for a long time now. It was supposed to be on the agenda for last year. There have stalled it. So if you write economic history today, half of India’s problems come from huge profiteering by a protected sector of banks under the RBI umbrella. You link all the loans to RBI repo rate and you see the economic growth going up. 

So the only place we are max invested is banks because it is a protected species, has given fantastic returns, will give more superlative returns because the NBFC imbroglio is going to now give people the only option to go to banks to borrow and they will really be shylocks in the market and like shylocks they make the money and therefore we will invest in shylocks. The only place fully invested in right now is PSUs and banks. We believe that in a lot of other sectors we will get chances to buy at a better price."

31,2019-06-07,GAIL,"I do not see the liquidity crisis going off anytime soon, unless strong action is being taken in the form of certain injection of funds happening directly either in DHFL or indirectly to protect the investors in DHFL instruments, said Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


What is it that you are making of the entire DHFL issue and how RBI did not quite address the issue. Unlike market expectations, no measure was announced in terms of tackling liquidity issues and systemic crisis within NBFCs. Do you think there is contagion fear in the market that has been playing out for the last two days?RBI has clarified on DHFL issue. There were a lot of questions that were asked and they clarified that they do not have regulatory powers on the housing finance side and therefore the market gave up hope that RBI will do something related to DHFL. But from a macro perspective, what RBI has incidentally done is that it has changed its stance to accommodative. It is going to provide ample liquidity into the system. This will help partly in addressing the systemic issue that created a DHFL like situation in the market. 

Having said that, the major issue ahead is the DHFL fiasco or the IL&FS kind of liquidity crisis which was engulfing the market. I do not see that going off anytime soon, unless there is a strong action taken in the form of certain injection of funds happening directly either in DHFL or indirectly to protect the investors in DHFL instruments.


Do you think the markets are getting worried about the growth in NBFCs with liquidity problem and their inability to raise funds or pricing in some sort of a black swan event in the NBFC space with one or two players which could probably lead to consolidation?What you are alluding to is something the market seems to be now taking cognisance of because it has been too long that the NBFC crisis has been festering in the market and therefore unless a strong action and intervention happens from the regulatory authorities, we would not see any further respite. 

But consolidation is something that will soon take place. In the past, we had seen that a lot of lending market share had gone away from the banking sector to the NBFC sector. This is a phenomenon that got played out over the past three or four odd years and now we are going to see perhaps some bit of that market share coming back into the banking system while NBFCs will see that consolidation phase happening.


Which of the IT names are looking attractive now? IT has been steady but not necessarily the most exciting mover in the market.As far as the IT sector is concerned, given the turmoil that exists in the market, a lot of players would rather want to be in a designated safe place and park their investments in that designated safe place. Right now, the designated safe place for the market seems to be the IT sector. While outwardly there are challenges that we see for some of the IT players in terms of rupee appreciation, in terms of H-1B visa cost going up and general lacklustre activity as far as order wins and deal wins are concerned. But having said that, Indian IT companies particularly have weathered the storm and are moving in the right direction. 

One of the major things that we have observed over the last one year and I am not going to single out just one particular quarter, but rather over the past one, one-and-a-half odd years, IT companies have been able to get their margins improved despite headwinds that they have faced on the cost particularly on the SG&A side and that is auguring well. 

The top line guidance that most IT companies have given is also fairly robust in the range of 8.5% thereabouts plus/minus a few percentage points thereabout. To us therefore IT companies have become the designated safe places to get into in such market turmoil conditions. The larger the company, the better it is. We would rather look at an Infy, TCS kind of combo for the recommendations that we give to our retail clients.


What do you make of private banks? Would private banks like Axis, ICICI and some of the others still have room for expansion?There is room for expansion. From the capital point of view, the capital buffer that most of these private banks have now got after the clean-up activity, is fairly strong. If you look at Axis, they managed to raise capital more than a year back and while ICICI Bank may not have raised fresh capital, its capital buffer is quite adequate. 

Even the smaller private sector banks are doing well on this metric. Today, for us, the capital buffer is an important buffer because if the markets are poised for growth, especially in an environment where interest rates have been cut, obviously you will see credit growth pick up. In such a situation, a capital buffer is important to have. Most of these private sector banks will do well in the coming quarters and years.


In terms of news flow regarding Indiabulls Group or these groups where a lot of corporate action changes are happening. How would you approach it?M&A activities are bound to pick up especially in a low interest rate environment. Further rate cuts are likely to happen. Typically this is a phase where you will see a lot of M&A activities come in and therefore not really surprised. Many of the highly indebted business groups that you have in the country would look at some of the other mechanism to either deleverage by selling off their stakes or through the merger activity. 

What you just talked of in terms of Indiabulls and the likely merger with LBB is something that we have seen happen earlier with Bharat Finance and IndusInd Bank. There is that bit of consolidation cum M&A activity and so we are not really surprised and such M&A activities are from a minority investor point of view which is always welcome because they lead to eventually an open offer kind of situation. It is always better for minority shareholders.


What is your take on aviation? Both these stocks have run up quite massively over the past year or so. There has been volatility associated with the stock price rise but most investors who would have got into these shares would right now be sitting on a kind of profit. I am not surprised if some broker or some research analyst downgrade from a buy to hold rating. We are not really surprised. As far as the sector is concerned, there is ample room for growth now. One large player like Jet Airways has gone out of operations currently. Although it is struggling to get back, such a situation always augurs well for incumbent players. So SpiceJet and IndiGo have made the most of it.


You were one of the first people to start covering the aviation pack. What is the sense that you are getting now that Jet is out of sunning? IndiGo, SpiceJet, the remaining players who gained market share that is probably the one that you would want to chase?That is the natural way to look at the aviation sector. Market share is an important parameter. But having said that, there is also another important parameter to look at. This is the market share which is not often reported -- the market share in the international businesses. There is a lot of traffic growth that we are seeing to and fro from India and there is substantial market share available for Indian carriers to grab. 

When I say available, what I am actually alluding to is the fact that much of this market share is tightly controlled through various air service agreements that we have with many countries. There is a typical 50-50 kind of sharing of seats that get flown between two sets of countries. The Indian carrier share in that particular market is quite low and it is available. Any of these players -- SpiceJet and IndiGo -- which can offer international destinations or cover international destinations can gain further share. International operations typically are better from profitability point of view relative to the domestic operations but although it varies from season to season, the thumb rule is that the international operations are typically better and more profitable. 

Therefore I would look at your question and say it is not about domestic market share, it is also about international market share. The player or the airline that can get that market share or grab most of that is the one that would be the natural choice for any analyst pick. 


Crude is at low levels. Would you be monitoring really what is happening there given the sharp slide in crude?Yes, we do monitor what is happening with OMCs, especially in a situation where crude oil has sharply corrected in the past month and a half. That sharp correction would typically be accompanied by a sharp rise in marketing margins, if not on the refining margin. 

The refining margin is more a function of what is happening globally in terms of demand-supply situation on finished products. But the marketing margins for oil marketing companies would typically tend to rise. But having said that, there is a lot of fluid news flow that we are seeing as far as OMCs are concerned. 

Particularly in the past few days, these fluid news flows relate to M&A activity within the oil and gas space, relate to certain regulatory action particularly what we saw in case of GAIL, the PNGRB order on gas transmission prices also in a way affect some of these OMCs, because they too are partially present in that activity. The fluid set of news apart from the crude oil price news is something that is worrying us as far as OMCs are concerned right now.


Within PSUs, is SBI an obvious choice or would you be willing to bet on a BOB?I cannot comment on SBI, but yes BOB has been one of our favourites within the PSU pack. Lately the stock has come under pressure. But I guess over a longer term, the investor should be able to ride the merger wave. It has consummated now and therefore better returns can be had in the year ahead. The bank has now been capitalised as well and in an environment where like I just spoke about, in an interest rate cut cycle, most of the banks tend to do well. BOB should also be able to ride the oncoming credit growth that we see.


Autos have been seen a slowdown and you used to always track autos. You think autos will once again give you the first signal of any pickup in growth. Will they be the first ones to recover as they were the first ones to see a slowdown?In a way, most of the market participants watch for automobile sales, the monthly sales that are reported and try to figure out where is the economy headed, particularly on the manufacturing side. Manufacturing activity is closely related to what happens in terms of automobile sales. But this is a year of a structural change that we are undergoing. 

We are jumping directly from Euro IV norm to Euro VI norm and that jump would mean that there are quite a bit of disturbances that are getting created both in terms of costs for automobile companies which either will get passed on or some portion will have to be borne by them and an activity where there will be pre-buying will be induced probably towards the later part of the fiscal year and therefore volumes could sharply recover. 

But the volume growth may not necessarily be a sign of any activity pick up as far as the economy is concerned or as far as manufacturing activity is concerned. These pre-buying activities are followed by a long pause or fall in automobile sales. This is an unusual year and therefore very difficult to comment on what the automobile companies activity would translate into as far as the economy is concerned."
30,2019-06-07,GAIL,"Edelweiss Securities has given a hold recommendation on GAIL (India) with a target price of Rs 367.

Shares of GAIL (India) traded at Rs 315.65 around 1:45 pm on 7 June, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has approved the long-pending tariff revision for Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) and HVJ expansion pipelines. 

As per the brokerage, blended tariff at Rs 1.7 per standard cubic meter (scm) is 11.5 per cent lower than its estimate of Rs 2 per scm, but 0.4 per cent higher than the earlier tariff. However, this is 58 per cent below GAIL’s submission (Rs 4.1 per scm) due to much lower tariffs for the HVJ pipeline. 

With the two pipelines contributing over 60 per cent to GAIL’s overall throughput, the tariff revision prompts a 9.9 per cent and 9.3 per cent cut in FY20E and FY21E transmission Ebitda, the brokerage said. Given the PNGRB’s volume assumptions of 80mmscmd (currently 65mmscmd), the brokerage expects GAIL may appeal the PNGRB order. 

According to PNGRB regulations, an integrated tariff will be levied on combined volumes instead of separate tariffs for the two pipelines which will drive future revenue, said the brokerage. 

""The hike of just 0.4 per cent is 20 per cent lower than what we had factored in. The revised tariff also significantly undercuts the tariff submitted by GAIL,"" said the brokerage.

The brokerage expects GAIL’s earnings to remain fairly muted at a 13.8 per cent CAGR over FY19–22E due to disappointing tariff revisions. 

A potential split and sale of the marketing division provides an upside risk though. The brokerage has retained a hold recommendation on the stock with valuations at 6.2 times FY21E EV/Ebitda fully pricing in earnings growth.

""We are revising down the target price by 4.4 per cent to Rs 367 per share due to a 4.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent cut in FY20E and FY21E Ebitda, respectively. We retain ‘hold’ as the stock is fairly priced at 5.3 times FY21E EV/Ebitda,"" the brokerage added."
32,2019-06-08,GAIL,"Domestic equity investors took money off the table for the week ended June 7, sending benchmark equity indices down for the first time in four weeks. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty kicked off the truncated week on a positive note after Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched Rs 1 lakh crore in May 2019 as compared to Rs 94,016 crore in the year-ago period.

Markets participants ignored CSO data which showed that economic growth slowed to a 5-year low of 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, pushing India behind China, due to a poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

However, sentiments got dampened after a private weather forecaster Skymet Weather said the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. Also, lack of a comment from RBI on the on-going NBFC crisis overshadowed the 25 bps rate cut and change in stance.

However, some buying on Friday capped the downside.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Markets started the holiday trimmed week on a positive note. The momentum was triggered by weakness in crude oil prices and hopes of RBI cutting rates in the bi-monthly policy. But the momentum was short-lived and markets traded lower after RBI cut repo rates by 25 bps and changed stance to accommodative from neutral that came mostly in expected lines. No further comments by RBI regarding the on-going NBFC funding crisis was taken as a surprise by the market that added to the negativity.”

As a result, the BSE Sensex closed 98.30 points, or 0.25 per cent down at 39,615.90 on June 7 against 39714.20 on May 31. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index closed 52.15 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 11,870.65. 

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week.

DHFL, the third-largest pure-play mortgage lender, during the week received a rating downgrade on its Rs 850 crore worth commercial papers (CPs) to default grade by Crisil and Icra due to delay in meeting its obligations. The mortgage lender had defaulted on bond repayments on June 4.

Bharti Infratel: Shares of the company rallied nearly 4 per cent to Rs 279.70 for the week ended June 7. The National Company Law Tribunal during the week approved the planned merger of the company with Indus Towers, according to a regulatory filing.


Top Nifty Losers

The scrip came pressure amid the tariff revision for its Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) pipeline came in much lower than expected. Oil regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) said the levelised tariff for integrated HVJ is Rs 41.11 per mBtu on a GCV (gross calorific value) basis. However, GAIL had sought to raise the tariff to Rs 97.04 per mBtu in HVJ, citing a capex spending of Rs 24,708 crore over the economic life of the pipeline lasting till 2035.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance declined 7 per cent to Rs 731.10 for the week ended June 7. It was followed by Yes Bank (down 5 per cent), Zee Entertainment (down 4.83 per cent) and Ultratech Cement (down 3.93 per cent).

33,2019-06-09,GAIL,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and mining billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd are set to win nine oil and gas blocks each in the latest auction while Reliance Industries and its British partner BP Plc is set to retain a block that contains gas discoveries they had previously made. Sources said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has completed the evaluation of the bids received for 32 oil and gas exploration blocks that were auctioned in the latest licensing round. 

 As per the bid evaluation, ONGC and Vedanta Ltd are top bidders in nine blocks each and state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) in 12 areas. 

 Reliance-BP combine outbid ONGC in one Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal. 

 The winners of the auction will be announced after the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources added. 

 Bidding for 14 blocks on offer in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round-II and another 18 oil and gas blocks and 5 coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks on offer in OALP-III closed on May 15. 

 Reliance-BP had made their first bid in eight years when they sought an area that contained natural gas discoveries they had previously made, sources said. 

 The partners had to relinquish more than half of their eastern offshore KG-D6 area in 2013 after failing to meet government timelines. The area given away contained 3-4 natural gas discoveries. 

 So, when the government in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bring about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration, Reliance-BP sought the KG area containing the discoveries. 

 Under the new policy, areas sought by any company are put on auction with the initiator or the company that originally carved out the block, getting a 5 point advantage. 

 Sources said Reliance-BP managed to get the coveted KG block in the latest auction by a small margin that possibly came from the originator marks and a commitment to do a shale core exploration. 

 Reliance-BP had last jointly bid for a KG deep water block in the 8th bid round under previous licensing policy in 2008. They, however, gave up the block after not finding any commercially exploitable oil and gas reserves. 

 In the following year, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance on its own bid for six blocks in the ninth round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) but did not win any block. 

 Sources said at the close of bidding for the current round on May 15, ONGC had put in bids for 20 out of the 32 blocks on offer, while OIL made bids for 16 blocks. 

 Vedanta, which had walked away with 41 out of the 55 blocks offered in OALP-I last year, bid for 30 areas. 

 Indian Oil Corp (IOC), GAIL (India) and SunPetro bid for two blocks each, they said. 

 BP had more than a decade back entered the country buying 30 per cent stake in Reliance's 21 oil and gas exploration blocks for USD 7.2 billion. All but a couple of blocks have since been relinquished. 

 NELP has since been replaced by Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) under which OALP bids round have been held. 

 Under the new policy, called open acreage licensing policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest or EoI for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. 

 The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually. 

 The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage. 

 The two windows of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31. 

 But a delay in offering of blocks meant that OALP-II and OALP-III ran concurrently. 

 While the OALP-I round saw an investment commitment of about Rs 60,000 crore, the government is expecting about 90,000 crore of investment in the latest round. 

 In OALP-1, Vedanta walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. Oil India won nine blocks while ONGC managed to win just two. 

 Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells. 

 The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

39,2019-06-11,GAIL,"A joint resolution plan submitted by JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Ltd and Reliance Industries to take over distressed textiles company Alok Industries has hit a roadblock after Gail India, an operational creditor to Alok, challenged the plan before an appellate court.

In a petition filed before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in Delhi on May 27, Gail has opposed the resolution plan because it did not consider the government-owned gas and petrochemical company’s claims, people familiar with the development said. The appellate tribunal will hear the matter on July 16.

The development is likely to further delay the resolution plan for the Mumbai-based fully integrated textile company that was in the Reserve Bank of India’s first list of 12 large corporate debtors to be referred for insolvency proceedings, released in 2017.

“Gail was not in the picture when the resolution plan was finalised,” a banker involved in the process said. “It came in late and has filed a petition to be considered. It has claimed outstanding dues of Rs 506 crore, but the total amount that operational creditors got was just Rs 4.3 crore in the approved plan so it remains to be seen whether Gail gets anything.”

In March, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Ahmedabad had approved the sole JM-RIL joint bid. The bid amount was Rs 5,000 crore, just above the Rs 4,500 crore liquidation value of Alok. The company owes lenders a total of Rs 30,000 crore, which means they are taking a haircut of a whopping 83%.

State-run GAIL India has argued that while submitting the revival plan the resolution applicant didn’t give equal weightage to the operational creditors. Bankers however said the amount of recovery is too small to consider anything for non-financial creditors.

“The resolution plan submitted by the resolution applicant (JM Financial-RIL) is totally silent towards the operational creditors and that is against the spirit of the law,” said one of the persons privy to the development. “Gail has challenged the resolution plan, approved by the National Company Law Tribunal.”

Gail has made Ajay Joshi, resolution professional (RP) of Alok Industries, as one of the respondents of the case. Joshi did not respond to messages on his mobile phone as of press time Monday.

The banker quoted earlier said, “Operational creditors below Rs 3 lakh were accommodated in the plan. GAIL was a large supplier and so it wasn’t on the list.”

Nishant Awana, partner at law firm NMA Law Chambers, who is advising Gail India in the matter, declined to comment since the matter is sub judice."

Analyst calls
• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Phoenix Mills and raised target price to ₹870 from ₹800. While FY20 is likely to be challenging on account of slower consumption in economy, rental growth is likely to remain strong on the ramp up of Palladium, Chennai and the start up of the Lucknow mall, said HSBC. 

• Maybank Kim Eng Securities has maintained sell rating on Vodafone Idea with a target price of ₹12. The stock price has weakened the last 12 months and it will continue to lag Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio as high leverage will restrict its ability to spend for growth, the brokerage said. 

• Investec Securities has maintained hold rating on IFB Industries and revised target price lower to ₹870 from ₹970. Investec said IFB's fourth quarter result was dismal, with margins eroding sharply due to higher commodity costs, forex fluctuations, and customs duty hike on ACs/microwaves.

• Elara Capital has downgraded Hindustan Unilever to reduce from accumulate with a target price of ₹1,872. The brokerage has downgraded the stock due to recent run-up in its price. The brokerage believes HUL will continue to deliver strong double-digit value CAGR of 13% over FY19-21E, given its core portfolio (45% of sales) is growing in the double digits, cost savings (7% of sales) and precision marketing and enhanced demand-capturing abilities. 

• IIFL has a buy rating on Navin Fluorine International with a target price of ₹810. Navin Fluorine’s FY19 annual report underscores that although the company witnessed a challenging FY19 due to input cost pressures and deferrals in CRAMS orders, its financial health remains robust and opportunities ahead attractive, said IIFL.

44,2019-06-12,GAIL,"In the Indian context, it is a win-win situation and despite pessimism, I do not rule out 12,200 coming before the budget, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

Could Reliance signing this term sheet with Brookfield as reported by The Economic Times be a material and sizable positive considering the valuation at $15 billion? We are talking about almost halving the debt on their books?Finally, the sun is shining for Reliance. First, came the Saudi Aramco deal for selling part of their energy assets and now they are trying to monetise the Jio towers. It is a very big positive in the sense that Reliance is now going to try and become a lean mean fighting machine in the sense they realise that they are slowly transitioning into a technology company and there is going to be a huge capex involved there. Slowly but surely, they are trying to get the financialisations on the right path and I see no let up in this. 

Reliance is truly on its way to becoming a Rs 10-lakh-crore market cap company in the next one year. All declines should be used to buy. We have a one-year target of Rs 1,500. Its underperformance in the recent months may start to see an uptick again in Reliance, given that both the monetisation on the spectrum side and on the energy side is on the cards in the next six months.


What is happening in crude on the back of the OMCs cooling off yesterday? ONGC was showing a lot of strength. Overall, it is going to be positive for India but on the back of the trend that we are currently seeing, if crude were to continue to cool off, would you be taking a closer look at some of the names impacted by that?We have had a contrarian view on most of the OMC. They have smartly rewarded in the last four months. I still think HP, BP, IOC are wonderful businesses and if crude is going to be a tailwind, now with prices slowly but surely drifting below $60, it is a win-win situation. 

Also along with that, look at the strength in the rupee. We think that free pricing has been extremely positive for them. There will be regular bouts of profit booking but we still think there is a 20% upside even after such a sharp run-up in some of the OMCs. We are also very positive on select gas utilities and IGL, MGL on decline remain our top pick. 

We think the selloff in GAIL may be overdone. Even with a 4% rise in PNGRB pricing, they can still give a 10% CAGR over the next two years cum bonus. At Rs 300, GAIL also becomes an attractive buy. So, OMCs, gas utilities all are in a very very sweet spot right now.


Would you look deeper into IT, perhaps into some of the midcap names?The rupee which was a tailwind, is now a headwind and globally the environment for IT and BFSI space is not all that alluring. We want to play the India story given the budget and the underperformance of PSUs. We think alpha will really be created by cement, construction, infrastructure. In the short run, the volatility and protection of capital will be seen by IT given it has been a bellwether. 

If I can take two names, it would be TCS and HCL Tech. HCL Tech has moved up very sharply from those Rs 950 levels to Rs 1,120 but we still think that it is the best executor on the BFSI space. TCS itself has become a prima donna. It has become the largest market cap. If you want to be in these stocks, these two merit ownership. However, any pullback now in the rally at above 12,000, it will be the broader market which will lead and IT may tend to become a market performer to slight underperformer going ahead. 


What is your perspective on DHFL? They have managed to avert the defaulter tag after making that due payment of Rs 960 odd crore to NCDs. Does that make them worthy of investment? You know where the problem is. We have still not filled the void created by IL&FS. The short term commercial borrowing is still in a limbo and the competitors have gained because of some of these errant promoters. Over-leverage is not a bad word but if you had a very good run in the last five years, adequate checks and balances should have been on the cards for the likes of Indiabulls or DHFL or Zee. 

ADAG came and clarified. Words will not materially change it. You got to show the money on the table. We think there are enough other plays which are going to make up for that and already corporate banks are in the best of shape as they take on the loan portfolios of most of these debt saddled players. So ICICI, Axis, SBI would be the key over there. 

Among housing finance companies, it will continue to be Bajaj Finance. LIC Housing Finance can be further rerated, given its pedigree performance and now the book size is increasing with NIMs also expanding. The other two would be Cholamandalam and HDFC if you want to stick with the top names. As a trading bounce, DHFL definitely could see some rearguard actions. You could see the stock maybe trading towards Rs 120 in the next three to four months. 


The next big trigger would only come from the budget. How big an event could it turn out to be from an equity market standpoint?Before the budget, you have Trump and Xi meeting at the G-20. If anything, the Dow has seen the best rally in the last one year in June. The Dow is up 1,600 points in the last 10 days on the back of Mexico sanctions getting averted. We will have to keep our fingers crossed that Trump does not wake up on the wrong side on the 29th and if you have a deal, then that will actually set the cat amongst the pigeons. In the last fortnight, global markets have been rallying sharply, given that the dollar is at a three-month low; the carry trade is up and running; also the Fed is going to cut rates. 

In the Indian context, you have one of the best budgets on the anvil given the strong mandate and given the macros have been very positive for the government. They can instil a lot of confidence through liquidity and sort out some of the imbroglio on consumption. It is a win-win situation and despite the pessimism we are closer to 12,000. I do not rule out 12,200 coming before the budget.


You were so bullish with regards to the domestic story, the capital goods story, infra. Let us talk about some of the names that you are looking at in that basket. Would you also go in for higher risk names?We think cement, construction, capex, corporate banks are going to lead from the front. In banks we like ICICI, Axis, SBI; in the smaller banks we are very bullish on DCB, Federal Bank, IDFC First. In cement it is UltraTech, ACC and Shree Cement as they have been able to expand margins during a lean season. Once you are through with monsoons, cement will be an outperforming sector in the next one year. 

Construction picks would be again NBCC, Nagarjuna where a lot of weakness has crept in because of some change of government. It is just temporary. Sadbhav Engineering over is another top pick. In capex, it is L&T, Siemens, ABB, pedigree names which are going to get a huge order flow which show that books are swelling and execution is the name of the game. 

We know that the government capex has been in the front running and now private capex is going to be the next game changer. For the next 12 to 18 months, the stocks should be India centric and they can generate a lot of wealth going forward."

40,2019-06-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government will within this week float two large proposals offering subsidy to states for deployment of 5,000 electric charging stations in cities and highways. This is the pilot electric infrastructure layout plan by the government and aims at promoting India’s plan to shift 40% fleet to battery-operated vehicles. Presently, there are 150 charging stations in India. Setting up stations in cities will be open to all companies while only central utilities will be eligible to deploy such infrastructure on highways.

Two separate expressions of interest for electric vehicle charging infrastructure in cities and on highways will be floated by the department of heavy industries this week, an official said.

For securing subsidy for deployment of charging stations within cities, states through their nodal agencies, mostly electricity distribution companies, will have to submit their proposals to the department.

Interestingly, for setting up electric charging points at highways, proposals can be submitted only by central public sector enterprises. For deployment of charging stations at highways 100% subsidy will be given on cost of charger and transformer, the official said.

The government has de-licensed public charging stations business for electric vehicles enabling individuals to extend such facilities, but at a regulated tariff.

Companies like ABB, Acme Industries, Fortum India and a few Dutch firms are actively considering setting up vehicle charging stations. State-run companies like NTPC, GAIL India, Indian Oil Corp and Power Grid Corp have been exploring diversification into electric vehicle charging infrastructure business.

India has recently approved phase-II of FAME India Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India), for a period of three years commencing from April 1, 2019 with total budgetary support of Rs 10,000 crore. The main focus of this phase of the scheme is the electrification of public and shared transportation and laying of electric vehicles charging infrastructure.

The government targets setting up of one charging station every three km in cities and every 25 km on both sides of highways."

47,2019-06-13,GAIL,"ET Intelligence Group: Moderating gas consumption in the country amid growing installed re-gasification capacity are likely to weigh on the stock of Petronet LNG, India’s largest re-gas terminal operator. With 4 per cent return since the beginning of 2019, the stock has underperformed the BSE Oil and Gas Index, which has gained 10 per cent.

The company is in the business of converting liquified natural gas into gaseous form and these conversion charges form its earnings.

India’s gas consumption fell by 1.6 per cent year-on-year to 161 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in April 2019, the lowest monthly growth in the past 12 months. Barring city gas distribution and petrochemicals verticals, major gas consuming sectors such as fertiliser, power and other industrial segments reported contraction in demand.

Of the total gas consumption in India, about 45 per cent is catered through LNG where gas conversion is required. The slowdown in India’s LNG imports affected Petronet’s volumes which fell in the last three quarters of FY19. For the full fiscal, its volume dropped by 1 per cent.

The company has attributed the recent volume weakness to refinery shutdowns. It expects higher utilisation of the Kochi terminal to drive up volumes in the current fiscal.

A significant recovery in gas offtake would, however, require policy push to start the stuck gas-based power projects in the country. Until that happens, volume growth in the medium term may not match the historical growth.

Petronet’s gas volumes had grown by 11.8 per cent annually between FY14 and FY19 while the average growth is expected to be 4 per cent in each of the next four years.

The short-term volume growth will hinge upon whether the Kochi-Mangaluru gas pipeline will be commissioned by June 2019 as guided by GAIL in its conference call with analysts after releasing the March 2019 earnings.


However, the project has missed several deadlines in the past. This pipeline is critical for higher volume offtake from the company’s Kochi terminal, which has been running at around 10 per cent of utilisation due to unavailability of the pipeline network.

Petronet is expanding the Dahej terminal capacity to 17.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) from 15 mmtpa, and it is expected to completed by June 2019. Besides, it plans to put additional tanks at Dahej, which would increase the capacity of the terminal to 19.5 mmtpa. The capacity expansion amidst moderating LNG volume growth would have a bearing on Petronet’s incremental utilisation.

The stock trades at 13.7 times the projected one-year forward earnings, a 9 per cent discount to its longterm average. Historically, Petronet’s stock has traded at a premium to the state-owned energy stocks due to lower risk of regulatory intervention. However, the valuation gap will depend upon how it deploys the free cash flow.

The company has been looking at several overseas investments. Any investment diversification from the company’s core business will be treated with caution by investors."
50,2019-06-13,GAIL,"US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster is set to highlight the strategic relationship between the two countries and the bilateral trade at an event organised by Indo-American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston on Saturday, IACCGH said.

Juster was invited to the 20th gala celebrations of the chamber to deliver a keynote address by Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and IACCGH president Swapan Dhairyawan and its founder & executive director Jagdip Ahluwalia in November last year.

IACCGH Gala is the annual fundraiser for the chamber and attracts over 800 attendees.

CEOs of Fortune 500 companies in the energy, healthcare, education and technology, space as well as Indian and US ambassadors, senators have been speakers at the high-caliber chamber events.

Ahluwalia said the chamber has come a long way since its inception in 1999.

""Now after two decades it is instrumental in building bridges between India and Houston, boosting trade and major investments and is cited among the upper echelons of the US Small Business Administration as a model chamber.""

Some of the things that IACCGH has been advocating and made investments possible between Houston & India are — BMC, HP – Compaq's investment in India, MD Anderson's partnership with Tata cancer, United's non-stop service to India, Mahindra Tractor's (Americas) presence in the US, Reliance, ONGC & GAIL's investment in the US.

Dhairyavan said the chamber has graduated from conducting informational events to strategic outcome driven programs on all facets of business."

56,2019-06-18,GAIL,"BENGALURU: If the number of electric cars on a city’s roads is a barometer of its eco-friendliness, then Bengaluru isn’t doing all that well. The city registered only 410 electric cars among a total registration of about 1.30 lakh cars in 2017-18. Over 55,000 diesel cars — said to cause more pollution than petrol cars — hit the roads during the period. The IT city’s acceptance of CNG and LPG cars also remained low.

The data giving fuel-wise breakup of cars, jeeps, motor cabs and maxi cabs (more than 10-seater passenger vehicles) as of March 2018 was obtained recently by DT Devare, trustee of Bangalore Environment Trust, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

With 976 electric cars, Jayanagar regional transport office (RTO) registered the highest number of electric cars in Bengaluru, followed by Indiranagar (733) and Koramangala (582). As many as 3,731 electric cars were registered in all the 10 RTOs in the city. Bengaluru has only 140 CNG and LPG cars, faring poorly when compared to other cities.

Bengaluru had 13.08 lakh petrol cars, while the number of diesel cars is 5.23 lakh at the end of March 2018. Since March 2016, the sale of diesel cars has grown by about 10% each year whereas the growth of petrol cars is only about 6%. This could possibly mean there is an increase in the usage of cars for commercial purposes in recent times rather than for personal use.

“Diesel vehicles are popular as their operating cost is low. When we collected data from a couple of regional transport offices, we found that the bulk of SUVs and luxury cars also fall in the diesel category. Everybody agrees that diesel causes pollution, but it’s the city, in general, which bears the cost,” Devare said. He said the government should come up with policies to ensure diesel car users do not reap the benefits of “subsidised fuel.”

Officials in the transport department said the registration of diesel cars could come down in future. “The Centre is coming up with new norms (BSVI), which bans diesel engine in smaller vehicles. Even Maruti (India’s biggest automobile manufacturer) has announced it will not make small diesel cars from April 2020,” an officer said.

Currently, the department charges anywhere between 13% and 18% as tax, depending on the total value of the car. An additional 11% of cess is levied on the tax component for developing infrastructure.

Radhakrishna Holla, president of Bengaluru Tourist Taxi Operators Association, said the association is more inclined to shifting towards CNG cars in the coming days. “Thousands of CNG cars ply in cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad whereas Bengaluru has only about 100 CNG or LPG cars. We are in talks with our counterparts in other cities and with the representatives of GAIL. If they build at least 75 CNG stations, we will buy such cars as it works out to be cheaper,” he said."

Board meetings 
 
Analyst calls 

 • Deutsche Bank has maintained buy rating on ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company with a target price of ₹465 following a meeting with the company's management. Management sounded confident of achieving midteens growth in FY20, and remains excited about the protection opportunity over the medium term, said Deutsche Bank.

 • HSBC has maintained buy rating on GAIL India and cut target price to ₹366 from ₹456. GAIL stock is down 15 per cent after the much expected tariff order for its key pipeline network earlier this month disappointed, said HSBC. GAIL is trading at 1-year forward core PE of 8.1 times which is 25% below its historical average of the last 10 years, making valuations attractive, said HSBC. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained reduce rating on Maruti Suzuki India and reduced fair value to ₹6,000 from ₹6,600.

61,2019-06-21,GAIL,"While the domestic equity market is looking intact optically at the benchmark level, a selloff below the surface has nudged 75 per cent of the NSE-listed stocks below their 200-day moving averages; meaning they have entered a bearish phase. 

The 50-share Nifty is up over 7 per cent this year at 11,691 till June 19, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap250 indices have declined up to 5 per cent in the same period. 

On Friday, as much as 42 per cent of Nifty components traded below their 200-day moving averages (DMAs). The list included Britannia Industries, Cipla, Eicher Motors, Gail India, Hindalco, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, ITC, YES Bank, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel and Tata Motors.



“A stock trading below 200 DMA means it is in the corrective zone. The benchmark index looks well placed currently, but individual stocks have been beaten down badly. Ideally, one should focus on stocks that are sustaining above their 50-DMAs,” said Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher.

“I do not see Nifty going down below 11,550,” she said, adding that market participants can consider pharma and capital goods stocks at this point. 

Even in the Nifty500 pack, 60 per cent or 300 stocks are trading below 200-DMAs in clear signs of selling pressure across sectors. 





Stocks trading below this crucial support line included 3M India, ACC, Adani Green, Avenue Supermarts, Bank of Baroda, Deepak Fertilisers, Crisil, Cochin Shipyard, ICICI Securities, Jaiprakash Associates, Jain Irrigation, among others. 

Moving averages (MA) are a tool for analysing trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance levels. 

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major MAs, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is considered a continuous uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks test 50-DMAs or 100-DMAs, while serious corrections may cause a stock slip below 200-DMA. 

The 200-day average, also known as a long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for an index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. The 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks. 

On Thursday, stocks like Wipro, Voltas, UPL, Va Tech Wabag, Symphony, Sunteck Realty, SRF and Sonata Software traded above their 200-DMA, while SAIL, Sterling Tools, Tata Chemicals, Tata Motors, Videocon Industries, VIP Industries and Wonderla Holidays are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs. 

Around 300 stocks, including Aarti Industries, DCM Shriram, BPCL, Bata India, Info Edge, Infosys, Inox Leisure, HDFC, Redington and PNC Infratech, were above all the three DMAs, signalling a bullish trend. 

“Available data clearly shows the market has begun a sideways secondary trend after a long primary uptrend. In the secondary phase, the market first consolidates and takes a fresh call either on the upside or downside depending on the technical setup at that point of time. PSE and infrastructure stocks, including L&T and NCC, should remain resilient in the coming days,” said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst for Technicals and Derivatives at Angel Broking, said the primary uptrend is expected to resume soon.

“However till then traders are advised to keep positions light and avoid bottom fishing in stocks that have run into the abyss through this volatile period,” Chavan said."

Is the bullion market telling you something which we cannot see today because markets are forward looking and tend to capture the events well ahead of its occurrence?Donald Trump’s tweets on the Federal Reserve are playing out and we think that yields are going to head below 2%. It also means a 50 bps and may be more rate cut coming in the US. This means the dollar is at a three-month low and can get weaker. Not buying the euro because of the weakness of prolonged quantitative easing and so gold becomes a good destination. Also, it shows you that the risk-on trade globally is there with the emerging markets outperforming to hit a new high. 

In the Indian context it cannot be more bullish because there are no buyers, there are only people lining up for selling.This time gold is not going to be for fancy buying. It should be a sellers’ market. In fact people will liquidate gold and get back into SIPs which is the new gold for the longer term. People’s fancy for gold is now abating and I can only see sellers who are going to encash that and may be plough back part of it into SIPs. I remain extremely bullish on Indian equities and globally the easy liquidity is going to see much more of a risk-on trade for the next part of the year.


What is your go-to stock right now from the midcap space where a 20-30% move is coming in the next 12 months and where you are ready to allocate 5-7% of your portfolio?There are two sectors. OEMs have bottomed out before the auto sector. Three stocks which were taken to the cleaners, are now seeing a lot of revival. These are Motherson Sumi, Apollo Tyres and Exide. They can be huge wealth creators given that the festive season in the next three months and some initiative from the government will be a key game changer. 

The other one would be definitely be dark horse BHEL, where capex is reviving. If electric vehicles is the theme, the BHEL network has the best transmission going across the country. From Rs 65-67, the stock has inched up to Rs 74. I do not rule out Rs 100, given the risk-on trade coming in 2020. Last year, when everyone was very bearish on PFC and REC, we stuck our neck out. Those stocks are up 50% and more given the dividend yields and are still looking strong. 

We suggest some of the PSU basket stocks, the CPSE ETF or alternatively Engineers India, NBCC, BEL, IGL and GAIL. GAIL cum bonus at these prices is giving you a very good opportunity. Either you buy that or buy the CPSE ETF, which can deliver stellar returns in the next two years. 


Why are markets not getting excited about what is happening around us?It is the lull before the storm. The budget can be a game changer. Already, we are talking of interest waivers and some sort of increments on the housing sector. You are talking of an MSME distressed fund which is the need of the hour. The transmission of money to the end user after the IL&FS fiasco. That is where there will be keen monitoring. 

Also, consumption is raring to go. Look at the ground level, look at the numbers on both auto and capex. The stocks have bottomed out before the sector and this is just the lull before the storm. However for macros to kick in and earnings to catch up may take a quarter or so.

After October, you would see a very strong rally globally as well and in the Indian context, the underperformance of midcaps is now almost through. In next 18 months, we will see the best part of the equity market which we have seen in a long time. There will be broader outperformance of the midcaps. If you have a three-month window where you can sit and accumulate stocks. We think the budget can be a game changer in the near term.


Where are you shopping in NBFCs? Not everything is good but not everything is bad either?Correct. Bajaj Finance, HDFC and LIC Housing are the three in our pecking order and we stay with that. We are very contrarian on L&T Finance. We think most of the bad news is in the price. They have a strong parentage and the management has guided that they have provisioned well enough for most of the downside. For them, capitalisation will not be such a big issue and they have weathered the storm well. 

At a price of Rs 115, it offers a very good risk opportunity of at least a 50% upside given that the government is looking at the MSME space and seeing the mistrust goes ahead. I would also like to point out IndusInd Bank. It has corrected quite a bit because of this IndusInd Bharat Financial merger. But given that the commercial vehicle market is now looking to pick up in the next three months and the promoter is putting his money where his mouth is, they have just issued warrants at Rs 1,700. I cannot but be bullish and use this opportunity to buy IndusInd Bank as a contrarian. 

IndusInd deserves to be rerated over here and on more quarter of weakness where IL&FS provisioning is through you should start to see a very strong uptick on the credit and the NIMs. 


Would you say there is merit in buying cement stocks afresh even after the run-up that we have seen from the lows?If you have a slightly longer-term view, you cannot go wrong on cement. The monsoon and beyond that the return of pricing power will help. Already prices are fairly firm in most of the regions and going forward the whole impetus on a Rs 1 lakh-crore budget of spending, rural housing, rural income and the “housing for all” provide a huge impetus. 

Also, infrastructure growth is visible. For us, it would be UltraTech, ACC and Shree Cement in that pecking order. A dark horse on a midcap would be JK Lakshmi Cement and will standout over a period of time given that its cost of production is the lowest in the midcap stocks."

71,2019-06-30,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Debt-ridden IL&FS has decided to constitute a sub-committee to oversee the process of divestment of its assets in light of the Reserve Bank of India's June 7 circular which has laid guidelines for resolution of bad loans.

The decision to form a sub-panel was taken in its board meeting held on June 28, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) said in a statement.

During the meeting, IL&FS board reviewed the progress on divestment of all domestic and foreign assets outlined in its resolution framework.

The board has decided to constitute a six-member empowered committee, including four directors Vineet Nayyar, C S Rajan and Bijay Kumar to discuss and finalise the asset-wise framework of resolution with lenders.

The board decided to empower the panel to take necessary steps to enhance enterprise value of assets under divestment.

""This committee is formed in view of positive response received from financial institutions to the framework outlined, by Prudent Norms for resolution of stressed assets issued by RBI on June 7 earlier this year,"" it said.

After the Supreme Court quashed RBI's guidelines on stressed assets, released in February 2018, the central bank on June 7 came out with revised norms which gave more room to lenders for resolution of bad loans.

It further said the board also decided to allow the bidders for toll road assets to jointly monitor traffic data and assess revenue stream.

The board noted that the stake sale in seven wind energy special purpose vehicles (SPVs) is in final stage after Orix has conveyed it's decision to match GAIL's offer.

Long lower shadows on weekly charts depicted Hammer kind of formation. Besides, this counter closed above its short-term moving average, on daily charts, which was acting as an hurdle on the way upside. Hence, sooner than latter this counter shall register a breakout with a close above Rs 314 which shall set the tone for a decent short-term upmove,"" Mohammad said.

1,2019-07-01,GAIL,"MUMBAI: After the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) took a strong view against the big four audit firms, the board of IL&FS has shortlisted Indian firms to reopen and recast IL&FS’ books and the mandate for the job is likely to go to Borkar & Muzumdar and GM Kapadia and Co.

The recast is expected to be completed in three months once the matter is conformed. Since the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the SFIO have taken a strong view against some of the big four agencies that were auditors to IL&FS and are being probed for their role in not being able to raise the red flag, the choice may fall upon Indian firms from a list of potential firms available with the board.

“Borkar and Muzumdar would be auditing IFIN and IL&FS while GM Kapadia would be auditing ITNL accounts for the past five years from FY13-FY18,” a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.

The IL&FS board has already shared its recommendations with the MCA, which in turn will seek the court’s approval, the person said. An IL&FS spokesperson declined to comment on the development. This move by the board follows the Supreme Court order on June 4, 2019, allowing the company to reopen and recast past five-year books of accounts to ascertain the extent of irregularities by the erstwhile management in case of IL&FS, IFIN and ITNL.



NCLAT had already approved the reopening and recasting of accounts of IL&FS and group companies but it was challenged in the Supreme Court, which was vacated by the apex court recently.

This move of completing the recast in a time-bound manner will also help in divesting assets in these companies, as the bidders would be able to take an informed, call-based decision on the revised audited accounts of the company, the person cited earlier said.

The board has already announced divestment of various businesses, including roads, which are in various stages of due diligence by companies that have participated in the expression of interest process. It has raised funds by selling renewable energy business. Stake sale in seven wind energy SPVs is in the final stage after Japan’s Orix has conveyed its decision to match Gail's offer.

Last week, the board reviewed the progress on divestment of all domestic and overseas assets and decided to constitute a six-member empowered committee -- including four directors Vineet Nayyar, CS Rajan, Bijay Kumar, N Srinivasan, and COO N Sivaraman -- to discuss and finalise the asset-wise framework of resolution with lenders. The board also decided to allow the bidders for toll road assets to jointly monitor traffic data and assess the revenue stream."
0,2019-07-01,GAIL,"Long-term equity investors have earned decent returns over the past 10 years. The Sensex rose from 14,765 to 39,592 during the past decade, generating an absolute return of 168% and an annualised return of 10.37%. But people who invested in PSUs have been left disappointed. 

The BSE PSU Index shrank 1.21% during the past 10 years, falling from 7,923 to 7,827.


BSE PSU Index fell 1.2% over the past 10 years

The PSU index fell even as the Sensex rose 168% during the same period.



Index values normalised to a base of 100. Compiled by ETIG.

The loss at the index level is relatively limited because some of its constituent companies such as IOC, BPCL, Gail, among others, did reasonably well during this period, mostly because their subsidy burden got reduced due to deregulation. Defence-related stocks such as Bharat Electronics and logistic major Container Corporation also did reasonably well. However, the value destruction by others has been enormous: MMTC fell 98%, MTNL lost 92%, IOB fell 87%, IFCI shrank 85% and Hind Copper dropped 84%. The combined market capitalisation loss incurred by the top five wealth destroyers stands at around Rs 5 lakh crore.

The performance of the PSUs has not been any different over the past five years as well. While the Sensex generated an absolute return of 58%—annualised gain of 9.58%—the BSE PSU Index lost 7%—annualised loss of 1.44%—over the past five years. Mutual fund investors who relied on the PSU theme have also suffered during the past five years. Though some of the PSU-themed mutual funds did better and generated positive returns during this period, these were too meagre to offer any comfort.


Why PSUs suffered 
According to most experts, piecemeal divestment by the government is primarily responsible for the poor performance of PSU stocks. Just like any other commodity, the price of a stock is also decided by demand and supply. Piecemeal divestment increases the supply on a regular basis. “The government has chosen to divest PSUs gradually. As this continued selling pressure on these counters will also remain,” says Upendra Kulkarni, Executive Director, Fortress Capital. 

Privatising several big companies is politically sensitive and, therefore, the government has chosen to do it by way of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But most investors subscribe to these PSU ETFs to make a quick buck because these ETFs are offered at a discount to market prices. Since mutual funds have to sell PSU stocks to redeem its units, they end up creating more supply of the PSU stock.


Biggest PSU wealth destroyers poor long-term performance

PSUs may remain under pressure till the govt ends piecemeal divestment.

Poor long-term performance

But these funds could do well over the medium term, say experts.


Souce: Value Research.
The delay in strategic divestment has adversely impacted the government as well. For example, MTNL used to be a strong company due to its monopoly status, but it lost out once the competition in telecom intensified. Similarly, the government could have minted a fortune had it divested BSNL or Air India before the competition nearly killed them.

There is no clear strategy on the part of the owner (government) or the management and this has hurt PSU companies fundamentally. “The government has to make its strategy clear—is it putting in more money to revive the PSUs or is it looking to exit these businesses by divesting them,” says Kunj Bansal, Partner and CIO, Acepro Sarthi Group. Most PSU managements fail to do strategic planning because they comprise bureaucrats who are appointed for short periods of time.

The government also tries to meet its fiscal targets by extracting high dividends or through buybacks from these companies. “These forced high dividends and buybacks create internal liquidity issues for some of the PSUs and they are not able to fund their future growth,” says Kulkarni.


What investors should do
Experts advise that those inclined to invest and forget for decades should ignore the PSU space. “Long-term investors should keep away from PSU counters because it will be a value destroyer in the long term,” says Bansal. There are better companies investors can opt for. “While some PSU companies have reasonable decent fundamentals, there’s no need to bet on them for the long-term because there are better opportunities available elsewhere,” says Kulkarni.

However, you may not avoid PSU stocks altogether. “Depending on the market situation, PSUs offer mediumterm trading opportunities that may last for 1-3 years,” says Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst. The catchword here is ‘selective’. Either stick with the companies that have clear earnings visibility or those that offer deep discounts. For example, NBCC and Engineers India offer clear earnings visibility in the medium term. You may also invest in market leaders like SBI and NTPC based on current low valuations for the medium term."

8,2019-07-03,GAIL,"Motilal Oswal Financial Services has reiterated neutral call on GAIL (India) with a target price of Rs 346.

Shares of GAIL (India) traded at Rs 309.7 around 9:25 am on 3 July, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 


View of the brokerage
The Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has announced tariff for the K.G. Basin Natural Gas Pipeline Network (KGBNGPL) at Rs 16.14/MMBtu (metric million British thermal unit) against the proposed Rs 47.20/MMBtu by GAIL.

""As against the current tariff of Rs 45.32/MMBtu, the revised tariff is nearly 65 per cent lower, and would bear a negative impact of 2 per cent on the FY20/21 earning per share (EPS),"" the brokerage said.

The pipeline currently handles nearly 5mmscmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of volumes, lowering PAT by nearly Rs 150 crore.

PNGRB, in its Mar'16 order, issued final initial tariff for the KGBNGPL pipeline at Rs 45.32/MMBtu against the proposed Rs 180.77/MMBtu by GAIL.

In a letter dated 22 October, 2018, GAIL proposed tariff revision for KGBNGPL at Rs 47.20/MMBtu and an extension of 10 years to the life of the pipeline.

However, PNGRB approved a tariff nearly 65 per cent lower — sharply reduced from the current Rs 45.32/MMBtu to Rs 16.14/MMBtu, effective 1 July, 2019.

Sharp reduction in the revised tariff is on account of huge divergence in opex, future capex, and unaccounted gas loss guidance by GAIL against the PNGRB approval.

The PNGRB recently announced an integrated tariff hike for GAIL’s HVJ and HVJ upgradation pipelines (which together handles nearly 62 per cent of the company’s volumes) to Rs 41.1/MMBtu (against proposed Rs 97.0/MMBtu).

This came in as a dampener for the stock, as the regulator-approved tariff was only nearly 4 per cent higher than the weighted average margin of Rs 39.7/MMBtu.

""We reiterate our Neutral call on GAIL factoring in the aforementioned disappointment, along with rising concerns on other business segments, such as LPG segment profitability due to the expanding global glut, weakness in petrochemical segment due to upcoming global expansions and profitability of US long-term contracts due to declining spot LNG prices,"" said the brokerage.

The stock is trading at 10.4 times FY20 EPS and 6.2 times FY20 EV/Ebitda. 

""We value it at 9 times FY21 EPS adjusted for other income and then adding the value of investments to arrive at a target price of Rs 346 (from Rs 351),"" the brokerage added."
13,2019-07-04,GAIL,"New Delhi: The downstream regulator has rejected GAIL’s plea seeking to recover from its customers the compensation it paid to victims of 2014 pipeline fire that killed 29 in Andhra Pradesh.

The state-run pipeline operator had recently proposed that the amount spent on compensation and rehabilitation of the victims and their families be considered as operating expenditure for the determination of tariff of its KG Basin Natural Gas Pipeline Network.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), the regulator, didn’t accept GAIL’s plea. “Opex amounting to Rs 8.60 crore incurred towards ‘disbursement of compensation /rehabilitation expenditure’ after the fire incident took place on 27.06.2014 during the FY 2014-15 has been disallowed,” the board said in its tariff order on June 29.

In its order, the board didn’t elaborate on the reasons for rejection of GAIL’s plea. But an executive well-versed with the workings of PNGRB said accepting GAIL’s proposal would have sent a conflicting signal.

“PNGRB had penalised GAIL earlier for the lapses that led to the pipeline fire, and now it couldn’t be seen supporting the company in recovering compensation from customers,” the executive said. “GAIL can’t make customers pay for its own mistakes. It should pay from its own profit. It gets 12% return on the capital employed,” he added. GAIL didn’t respond to ET’s emailed query on why it considered appropriate to shift compensation and rehabilitation expenses on to its customers.

A government probe following the 2014 pipeline explosion had found GAIL responsible for many lapses. Based on the official report and a subsequent explanation by GAIL, PNGRB decided in July 2015 to impose a fine of Rs 20 lakh on the pipeline operator. GAIL paid the fine.

GAIL had admitted to many lapses highlighted in the probe findings, including transporting wet gas through a pipeline meant only for dry gas, not providing gas dehydration unit despite promising to do so, and not complying with norms needed to keep the pipeline fit for transportation, the regulator had said in the 2015 order.

“M/S GAIL has also defaulted in compliance of the various provisions with respect to design, maintenance, operation, inspection, integrity management, quality of gas etc of the PNGRB Regulations,” the regulator said in the 2015 order.

Following the incident, GAIL spent hundreds of crores to replace older pipelines with new ones besides taking many other safety measures."

Petronet LNG (up 0.16 per cent), Indian Oil Corporation (up 0.10 per cent), GAIL (India) (up 0.07 per cent) and Castrol India (up 0.04 per cent) too were trading higher. 

The S&P BSE Oil & Gas index was trading 0.27 per cent up at 14,780.63 around 11:23 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 33.20 points at 11,949.95 while the BSE Sensex was up 86.08 points at 39,925.33. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 33 were trading in the green, while 16 were in the red. 

Shares of Vodafone Idea, IDFC, YES Bank, Dish TV India, Bank of Baroda, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Adani Power, Bank of India, Adani Enterprises and PNB were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
16,2019-07-07,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is open to reducing its stake in select state-run firms including oil companies to as low as 40%, said a senior finance ministry official. This will help the government meet the budgeted disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore. 

“The idea is to unlock the value in these firms. In case of oil firms, their crossholdings amongst each other give us that space,” the official said. 

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her budget speech that the government was considering the option of taking its stake below 51% to an appropriate level on a case-by-case basis in companies that have to be retained under state control. She noted that the government has decided to modify the 51% government stake definition to include the holdings of state-controlled entities. 

In the case of Oil & Natural Gas Co. (ONGC), the current government holding is 64.25% but around 19% is held by Indian Oil Corp, Gail (India) Ltd and Life Insurance Corp of India, all state-owned companies. 




“We will discuss it with respective stakeholders wherever required and take an appropriate call depending on how much (stake) they would like to retain,” the official said, adding that in some companies the government may want to keep the threshold at 40-45%. The government may pare its stake in nonstrategic companies to as low as 26%. 

“We may like to retain it at that threshold because if we want to strategically divest, the new owner may like to have that control for purposes of voting rights etc,” he said. 

In a post-budget interaction with ET, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management secretary Atanu Chakraborty noted that the government had made the separation between control and a 51% stake for the first time. 

“We have decided to go below 51% and open much larger investment space for people to come in, including international funds, which is needed,” he had said, adding that there are a lot of professionally run companies where promoters do not even hold 2-3% and if you look at Sensex 30, in around 18 out of 27 companies, promoter group holding is below 40%."

19,2019-07-08,GAIL,"New Delhi: Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan Monday said there is no proposal, at present, for the merger of state-owned oil and gas entities under consideration of his ministry.

While state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) had last year acquired government stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) were both keen on acquiring gas utility GAIL India Ltd.

""At present, there is no proposal to merge state-run oil and gas entities under consideration of the ministry,"" Pradhan said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha here.

He had on February 7, 2018, told the Rajya Sabha that IOC and BPCL have separately indicated to the petroleum ministry their interest in taking over GAIL to add natural gas to their oil refining and marketing business.

Then finance minister Arun Jaitley had in the Budget 2017-18 unveiled the government's plan to create integrated public sector oil majors ""through consolidation, mergers, and acquisitions"" so that the merged company has the ""capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions"" and is ""able to match the performance of international and domestic private companies"".

In response to this, ONGC expressed interest in taking over refiner HPCL and completed the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition in January last year.

""IOC and BPCL had written to the ministry for integration with GAIL (India) Ltd. However, the government has not taken any decision in this regard,"" Pradhan had said last year.

In the reply on Monday, he said ONGC has acquired 51.11 per cent of government equity shareholding in HPCL.

""Post-acquisition by ONGC, HPCL will continue to be a central government public enterprise (PSE), having become a subsidiary of ONGC. It will maintain its cultural uniqueness and brand identity,"" he said.

For GAIL, it was said that the government may separate the firm's natural gas transportation and marketing business and sell off the later to a prospective bidder.

Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off the gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 14,000 km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country.

The government has a 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL India."
20,2019-07-09,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: After two days of massive fall on Dalal Street, investors may shift focus to the earnings season, which kicks off today with TCS' June quarter results. Here is breaking down the pre-market actions.


TRADE SETUP
Singapore trading sets stage for tepid startNifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 14 points, or 0.12 per cent, lower at 11,554.50, indicating a tepid start for Dalal Street.


Tech view: Nifty forms ‘Bearish Belt Hold’ candleThe index decisively broke below its 50-day exponential moving average and ended up forming a ‘Bearish Belt Hold’ pattern on the daily chart, as the bulls ran for covers. A strong support for the index is seen in the 11,500-11,426 range and the immediate strong hurdle is near the 11,620-11,690 zone.


Asian stocks tick higherAsian stocks struggled to rebound on Tuesday as investors came to terms with sharply reduced expectations the Federal Reserve will deliver a large interest rate cut at the end of July. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.1 per cent in early trade, after falling 0.6 per cent the previous day. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.5 per cent.


US stocks drop on waning rate cut hopesIn overnight trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115.98 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 26,806.14. The S&P500 index declined 14.46 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 2,975.95. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 63.41 points, or 0.78 per cent, to 8,098.38. Weakness persisted as better-than-expected jobs data released last week tempered expectations for potential rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.


Oil prices edge lowerOil fell amid worries over the outlook for demand after the latest signs that international trade disputes have been dragging on the global economy, although tensions in the Middle East offered some support to prices. Brent crude futures were down 21 cents, or 0.3 per cent, at $63.90 a barrel. They fell 12 cents on Monday.


TCS to kick off earnings season todayIT major Tata Consultancy Services is expected to report a 2.5-3.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) rise in revenue growth in constant currency (CC) terms. Profit is expected to drop 4-6 per cent sequentially while margins are seen falling 90-150 basis points, led by wage hikes and rupee appreciation.


FIIs sell Rs 402 cr worth equitiesNet-net, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 402 crore on Monday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 321 crore, data suggests.


MONEY MARKETS


Rupee down: The rupee Monday declined by 24 paise to close at 68.66 against the US dollar, cutting short its three winning run due to a massive selloff in equities and weakening expectations of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in near future. 



10-year bonds: India 10-year bond yields fell 0.12% to 6.58% on Monday, from 6.70% in the previous session, according to RBI data.



Call rates: The overnight call money rate weighted average was 5.52% on Monday, according to RBI data. It moved in a range of 4.50-5.80%.

Bharat lags India in consumtion in June QtrGrowth in rural consumption was slightly slower than that in urban areas in the June quarter, the first time this has happened in over two years, due to liquidity issues and lower farm wage growth that impacted sentiment, said companies and analysts. Consumption in rural India, which accounts for about a third of the market, has been under stress over the past three quarters even though its rate of expansion has been faster than that in the cities. Rural growth rates, which were nearly double those in urban areas, moderated to 1.5 times in the December quarter and subsequently about 1.2 times in the March quarter. The rural market grew 3.3% in volume during April and May, compared with a 6.6% expansion in urban areas, according to Kantar data.


Govt introduces 8 Bills in LS in an hourThe government on Monday introduced eight Bills in the Lok Sabha within an hour. The Bills include The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019; The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2019; The National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2019; The Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2019; The Consumer Protection Bill, 2019; The Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Amendment Bill, 2019; The Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2019; and The Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2019. 


Final blueprint of big ticket FDI reform soon The government has drawn a blueprint for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the country, even as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced big ticket FDI reforms in her maiden budget presented on Friday. ET Now has learnt that the FDI blueprint, aimed at opening sectors like Digital Media, Insurance, Information Utilities and Contract Manufacturing, is ready and will be sent to Cabinet in a few weeks time. 


No proposal to merge state-owned firms: Oil MinisterOil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan Monday said there is no proposal, at present, for the merger of state-owned oil and gas entities under consideration of his ministry. While state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) had last year acquired government stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) were both keen on acquiring gas utility GAIL India Ltd. 


RBI Guv to meet CEOs of pvt banks in July endThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das is to hold a meeting with the chief executive officers of private sector banks in the last week of July on credit and liquidity concerns. The meeting, tentatively slotted for July 25 or July 26, is also expected to discuss the transmission of interest rates and non-performing assets, even as it takes up issues with regard to specific sectors such as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and realty."

Nifty opened in negative on Tuesday and drifted towards the 11,460 mark in the first half of the session as it partially filled the bullish gap that had occurred on May 20. The index later recovered from lower levels to close on a flat note near the 11,550 mark. It formed a Hammer candle on the daily scale as some buying interest emerged in the 11,480- 11,500 zone while supply pressure remained intact at 11,600.

As long as it holds below 11,650, Nifty’s immediate structure could remain under pressure to retest the next major support at 11,420, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 11,720 and then 11,777 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,300 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,900 levels. There was Put writing at 11,200 and then 11,300 levels, while Call writing was seen at 11,600 followed by 11,900 levels. Options data suggested a lower trading range between 11,400 and 11,800 levels.

India VIX fell 1.17 per cent to 13.68 level.

Bank Nifty opened negative but traded in a range of 300 points for the entire session. It formed a Doji candle after a sharp decline of past three sessions, which indicated some pause in selling pressure but the index needs to surpass the immediate hurdle to get short-term stability. As long as it remains below 31,000, the index could continue its weakness towards the next major support at 30,250 while on the upside hurdle is seen at 30,850 and then 31,000 levels.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,550 with a loss of 0.14 per cent. Long buildup was seen in JustDial, BEL, Bank Of India, Bajaj Finserv and IOC while shorts were seen in GAIL, REC, Titan, Concor and PFC.

23,2019-07-09,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended flat on Tuesday ahead of June quarter earnings of IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). 

As Budget blues take its toll on stocks, investors are hoping for some relief from June quarter earnings. The rupee's tepid rise against the US dollar also gave a leg up to market sentiment. 

Global cues remained lacklustre as stronger jobs data in the US dented hopes of an aggressive rate cut by the US Fed. 
Sensex ended 10 points higher at 38,730, while Nifty settled 3 points down at 11,555. 


Here is breaking down key highlights of Tuesday's session:

Titan plunges 12%Falling for the fourth day in a row, shares of Titan ended 12.26 per cent down at Rs 1,099.10. The company in its quarterly update on Monday said it witnessed a tough macro-economic environment with consumption being hit during April-June quarter due to rising gold prices. In the last four sessions, the stock has come off 17 per cent.


DHFL shares fall 9%Extending losses into the fourth session, shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) plunged 8.75 per cent to close at Rs 70.95 even as reports suggested that the lenders to the company will meet on July 10 to discuss resolution proposal submitted by it. 


TCS falls ahead of Q1 numbersEnding the day as the top loser in the Sensex index, shares of the IT heavyweight fell 2.05 per cent to Rs 2,131.45 ahead of its June quarter results. Brokerage Edelweiss Securities said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is likely to post a healthy 2.8-2.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in constant currency term for Q1 of FY20.

27,2019-07-11,GAIL,"July onwards we are very bullish on consumption and think durable, discretionary and staples will do extremely well for the second half of 2019, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.


A Economic Times report says that the FPIs are mulling going corporate but they are saying the change would not be easy and that is when one of the overhangs for us.It is the perfect storm. If you are looking at stocks doubling in the next two years, why are you tinkering around with 2% to 3% tax and if you are uncomfortable with that, it is better you withdraw money and go and invest in two years 2% yields on the US treasury. In the short run, that is an opportunity. 

There was nothing as such negative in the Budget. We thought it to be a very consumption-led Budget. You are not highlighting that the rupee at 68.50 is at a six-month high while bond yields are at a three-year low. That can only mean the next 12 weeks will see the bottoming out of all indices. We are very bullish with the three-month view onwards and we think October onwards we will see the best markets rally in a long time. Use this fall to buy and the pessimism is very much overdone.


Do you think markets are pricing in a recovery for some of the large corporate banks or do you still think there is an element of surprise over there?There is a big element of surprise because you are not aware you are just seeing the frontline numbers on NCLT and IBC. I know for a fact that thousands of corporates are settling their accounts across the board and what were once termed as NPAs will now become write-backs. So, we are extremely positive on the corporate banks, the PSU banks as a whole and some of the midcap banks. 

So ICICI, Axis, SBI from the front line, SBI Cap, Bank of Baroda, and Canara Bank on the PSU side but it is DCB, Federal Bank, IDFC First where we think numbers will be much higher than estimate. Also, on a contrarian play on IndusInd Bank, the completion of merger with Bharat Financial will give it a pan India presence on financial inclusion and micro finance space.


What do you do with select PSU banks, leave apart SBI? Is there some value emerging especially after the Rs 70,000-crore PSU recap?Well yes that added to the bond yields which will give them huge treasury income and the bigger beneficiaries will of course be the largest bond holders -- that is SBI, Can Bank and Bank of Baroda. But we see a follow down effect in a stock like say an IDBI. It has gone through a massive restructuring. LIC has infused much more capital their new lending book will be 20 times the base capital and so on. There is a whole host of stocks which can do well. On the PSUs, I would still recommend the CPSE ETF. This government launch is a very innovative idea where they are not going to put pressure on individual stocks. If you are going to be a systematic investor in ETFs, in the next two years you will be laughing your way to the banks because there is going to be a lot of unlocking of value for select PSUs and that CPSE ETF fits the bill perfectly.


What is happening to the oil marketing companies (OMCs)? How are you looking at them in correlation with crude oil prices?Crude oil has been in this range and actually crude strengthening means that global growth maybe slightly better. Mots of the oil marketing companies have been market neutral. They have had a very good run up. I still think crude is headed lower maybe by the end of this month because a) the demand-supply mismatch is more to do with geopolitical tensions; b) Free market pricing has made HP, BP, IOC very prone to an upside but they are going to be market neutral. We would be more positive on some of the gas utilities. 

We think the selloff in GAIL is overdone and now the government is talking of selling its stake beyond 51% and letting private partnership come into GAIL on the pipeline side. We are missing the woods for the trees. If that happens, this could be a re-rating of GAIL on the upside. We know they have got a lower end of the price range hike from the PNGRB. But that was just one offset. We still think GAIL can easily give you a 10% return on equity in the next two-three years. We are very positive on GAIL, IGL and Petronet LNG. 


Do you have a view on PVR?It has done relatively well in a market which has done nothing. I still think the competition is intense on the Netflix side and we think Jio is coming out with more launches. So, there may be more footfalls, but margins are going to be a problem. 

If you have some of those rulings on add-ons being restricted, then that could be but the stock has been a relative outperformer and it is a small midcap stock. If you are holding it, you should own because we think the best of consumption is just going to start. July onwards we are very bullish on consumption and think durable, discretionary and staples will do extremely well for the second half of 2019. 


What do you make of the TCS numbers? What are you expecting from Infosys?The numbers were lukewarm. What used to be a tailwind is rupee and wages are now a headwind. The input costs have gone up and margins have fallen. So for me IT is no longer the defensive space I would rather put my money on select pharma stocks where I see potential of them adding much more delta. We think the strength of the rupee notwithstanding we would rather be more bullish on industrials. 

TCS may standout as a stock and has been one of the biggest wealth creators in the last three years but the best may be in the price. We are also seeing some slowdown on the BFSI space globally. 

Real money will be made in pharma and industrials across the board in the Indian context."

The Joint Venture Company shall implement the City Gas Distribution (CGD) Networks and supply Piped Natural Gas to the domestic, commercial and industrial customers and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) to the vehicles in Kamrup, Kamrup (Metro), Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts in Assam.

 In these five districts, approximately 4.16 lakh households will be connected with the Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and 72 CNG stations will be set up in these districts. 

In a statement the state government stated, Government of Assam, “ Under the persuasive follow up of the Government of Assam, the National Gas Grid Pipeline 

(Urja Ganga Project) which was originally planned for extension from Jagadishpur in Western Uttar Pradesh, to Haldia in West Bengal, was consented to be extended to Guwahati in Assam, by the Government of India through an intermediate spur line from Barauni in Bihar to Guwahati and the Gas Pipeline construction work is being carried out by GAIL India Limited. The Barauni to Guwahati section of the Nation Gas Grid is likely to be completed by December, 2020. Thereafter, eight states of the North East will be connected by Indradhanush Gas Grid Ltd. to the National Gas Grid.”

Managing Director, AGCL., Aditya Kumar Sharma; Executive Director (Business Development), Oil India Limited, S. K. Singh; CEO, GAIL, Gas Ltd., A. K. Jana signed the Joint Venture Agreement in the presence of Industries & Commerce Minister Chandra Mohan Patwary, Media Adviser to Chief Minister, Hrishikesh Goswami.

The statement stated with the connection of Assam to the National Gas Grid, steady supply of Natural Gas shall initiate a spurt in the industrial sector, power generation sector, automotive CNG sector and domestic piped gas to households sector and it will act as a catalyst to trigger immense development and employment opportunities throughout Assam and other parts of Northeast Region. 

The supply of Piped Natural Gas to the industrial, commercial and domestic customers in the first phase in Kamrup, Kamrup (Metro), Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts will be a major initiative in this regard.

AGCL, along with OIL and GAIL Gas Ltd (GGL) formed a Consortium and bid for laying, building and operating the City Gas Distribution Networks in two Geographical Areas (GA) in Assam. GA-2 comprises of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts and GA-3 comprises of Kamrup and Kamrup (Metro) districts. 

After competitive bidding, the Consortium won and was awarded by the Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) the authorization for the work. Around Rs.1,700 crores will be spent for the purpose in the coming years. Around 95,000 households will be connected with the Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and 21 CNG 

stations will be set up in Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts at an estimated cost of approximately Rs. 500 crores. Around 3,21,000 households will be connected with the Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and 51 CNG stations will be set up in Kamrup and Kamrup (Metro) districts in the coming years at an estimated cost of approximately Rs. 1,200 crores. 

The Government of Assam has initiated the preliminary work on the project and the Detailed Feasibility Study has been completed. Domestic and commercial pipe gas connections in Guwahati city will be available within the next two years on the city being connected with the National Gas Grid. In addition, CNG Stations will also be set up during this period to meet the requirement of clean fuel for transport sector."

31,2019-07-15,GAIL,"MUMBAI: A total of 26 deviations were committed by close to a fourth of the Nifty-50 companies, 11 to be exact, for the year 2018-19, according to the first ‘secretarial compliance report’ that captures adherence to Sebi regulations, which kicked in this year.

Following recommendations from the Uday Kotak-led committee on corporate governance, Sebi has mandated that all listed companies disclose their ‘secretarial compliance status’, intended to ensure efficient board functioning and an in-depth check specific to the regulator’s norms.

The 11 companies are SBI, Larsen & Toubro, IndianOil, NTPC, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, GAIL, Adani Ports, Bharat Petroleum, Eicher Motors and ONGC, according to CimplyFive, a tech solution provider for compliance standards, which analysed information filed by Nifty-50 companies with the stock exchanges.

Inadequate representation of independent directors on the board tops the list with six companies, closely followed by five companies that did not conduct an evaluation for their independent directors — both being areas of concern, according to industry experts.

Of the six companies that reported non-compliance with board composition, penal action is reported only in the case of four — IndianOil, NTPC, Power Grid and Adani Ports. A penalty of nearly Rs 19 lakh was imposed on Adani Ports. In the other two companies — Bharat Petroleum and SBI — penal action is either not taken or, if taken, not reported to exchanges.

Further, for the five companies that had not undertaken evaluation of independent directors, no penal action is reported by auditors. In all these companies, penal action is either not taken or, if taken, not been reported, the analysis said.

A questionnaire emailed to Sebi went unanswered till the time of going to press.

Of the 26 deviations, stock exchanges took penal action against five companies for six lapses. The Companies Act, 2013 requires every listed company to have a minimum onethird of their total number of directors as independent and at least one woman director on their board.

Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head (CFO advisory) at KPMG India, said, “Independent directors have a very significant role to play in ensuring good corporate governance. Similarly, board evaluation is an important step. Therefore, not having the requisite number of independent directors or board evaluation not being done periodically should be areas of concern.”

Shankar Jaganathan, founder and CEO of CimplyFive, said, “Our analysis of the applicable LODR regulations indicates that there are over 150 compliances that an equity listed company needs to undertake every year. Even among the cream of the corporate sector, 26 deviations are reported by 22 per cent of the population. We believe annual secretarial compliance report does not pass the test of cost-benefit analysis. Further, by adding a superfluous reporting requirement, it also could be a deterrent to ease of doing business in India.”"
32,2019-07-15,GAIL,"Kolkata: A reduction of direct controlling stakes by the government of India in large state-owned energy companies is unlikely to negatively impact the ratings on these entities, as long as the government maintains majority effective ownership and broad control of their activities, said Fitch Ratings, in a statement made on Monday.

The Fitch Ratings update comes on the backdrop of a statement made by a government official steering the centre’s asset sale department on stake sale of energy PSUs. The official indicated that that the centre may reduce its direct controlling stakes in large energy companies, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, NPTC and GAIL (India), while maintaining effective controlling stakes of at least 51 per cent through arms such as Life Insurance Corporation of India. This comes as the government has set an enhanced target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore of divestment receipts for the financial year ending 31 March 2020.

Fitch will continue to apply its government-related entities rating criteria if the government continues to have sufficient control over these rated government-related entities (GREs) through involvement in and influence over these entities' strategic, operational and financial activities, while other government-controlled institutions are only used to hold investments on behalf of the government.

“However, if the latter take over control of the rated entities, which is not likely to be the case based on our understanding, Fitch may re-assess the credit profiles of the rated entities based on its parent and subsidiary rating linkage criteria, similar to when the state's direct majority ownership in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd was transferred to ONGC in FY18,” Fitch said in the statement.

A reduction in government's direct stakes in these GREs will not change Fitch's assessment of the four GRE factors, if the government retains majority effective ownership and a similar level of control over the GREs' activities.

However, if the reduction of the government's effective ownership is significant and there is also evidence of a weakening of the government's involvement in the GREs' activities, Fitch may re-assess the 'status, ownership and control' and 'financial implications of default' factors.

The 'support track record and expectations' factor could also be lowered if tangible support is expected to be reduced. However, the 'socio-political implications of default' factor will likely remain unchanged.

The impact on rated Indian GREs' credit profiles is likely limited, even if there were to be re-assessments of their GRE scores, which is the sum of scores assigned to each GRE factor.

Both Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd and GAIL have standalone credit profiles (SCP) above the Indian sovereign rating at 'bbb', while NTPC's and Oil India Ltd's (BBB-/Stable) SCPs are the same as the sovereign rating at 'bbb-'.

As a result, their ratings will remain unchanged, even if their GRE scores are lowered. IOC's and Bharat Petroleum Corporation's (BPCL, BBB-/Stable) current GRE scores equal 40 points under Fitch criteria; a significant reduction in this score to 25 is required for their ratings to be lowered to one notch below the sovereign rating.

HPCL's rating is aligned with the credit profile of its parent ONGC under the parent and subsidiary rating linkage criteria, while Fitch expects the latter's credit profile to remain stable even if there is a re-assessment of its GRE factors.

In addition, the government may also monetise its direct stakes in state-owned companies through share buybacks. Share buybacks are limited to once a year and limited to 25 per cent of a company's aggregate paid-up equity capital, such that after the buyback, the company's aggregate debt is not more than twice its paid-up capital and free reserves. Large share buybacks can weaken the GREs' financial profiles. Oil India bought back 4.45 per cent of shares in FY19, reducing the government's effective ownership from 66 per cent to 61.6 per cent, while its headroom under the 'bbb-' SCP negative rating guideline of 2x has been reduced."
33,2019-07-15,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is considering to split state-run gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd by hiving off its pipeline business into a separate entity and selling it off to strategic investors, sources privy to the development said.

GAIL is India's biggest natural gas marketing and trading firm and owns more than two-thirds of the country's 16,234-km pipeline network, giving it a stranglehold on the market.

Users of natural gas have often complained about not getting access to GAIL's 11,551-km pipeline network to transport their own fuel.

The sources said that to resolve the conflict arising out of the same entity owning the two jobs, bifurcating GAIL is being considered.

While previously selling of the marketing business, possibly to another state-owned firm, was being considered, the government is now mulling on hiving off the pipelines into a separate entity and selling off a majority stake in it, they said.

GAIL has multiple long-term contracts to import gas in its liquid form (LNG) from countries such as the US and no strategic buyer would like to take the responsibility of those, particularly when the fuel is available at a cheaper price in the spot or current market, the sources said.

They said it is now being considered that GAIL continues with the marketing business that would include all the sale contracts as also city gas retailing.

The pipeline business can be spun off into a separate company, where the government may divest a majority stake to a strategic investor such as Canadian asset management company Brookfield that recently bought a 1,480-km pipeline owned by Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL).

The sources said the strategic partner will operate the pipelines and give access on a non-discriminatory basis to any entity wanting to transport gas either from a natural gas field or an LNG import terminal to consumers.

GAIL already keeps separate accounts for it's gas pipeline and marketing businesses, making it easier to split them into two entities.

By unbundling GAIL and opening the sector, the government hopes to increase gas use to 15 per cent of the energy mix by 2030 from current 6.2 per cent.

When talk of splitting first started in January last year, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had stated that GAIL should focus on laying pipelines, suggesting hiving of the marketing business.

The sale of a stake in pipeline business would help the government meet a part of its Rs 1,05,000 crore target for raising revenue from disinvestment in the year to March 31, 2020.

Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off the gas business of ONGC, GAIL owns and operates over 11,500-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country.

The sources said the oil ministry has not been very happy with GAIL's performance in building pipeline network. Besides, there is a possible conflict of interest in its role as an infrastructure provider and carrier.

GAIL did not start executing the Rs 12,940 crore Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra pipeline until the government agreed to give 40 per cent of the project cost as a grant from the budget. The pipeline takes the gas to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency, Varanasi.

Plans to split the company had been discussed more than a decade back too but it did not materialise.

The sources said refiners Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) had in 2017 evinced interest in acquiring GAIL to expand their gas marketing business.

GAIL also owns a petrochemical plant at Pata in Uttar Pradesh, which too could be sold to either IOC or BPCL.

The company had in the past resisted the split on grounds that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm's length and hence do not need to be separated.

GAIL's marketing business formed 76 per cent of its 2018-19 total sales and about 30 per cent pre-tax profit.

The government has a 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL India. Its current market cap is Rs 65,600 crore."
34,2019-07-15,GAIL,"As many as 16 Indian companies, including IT bigwigs Infosys and TCS, have expressed worries about the risks of climate change to their businesses in the next five years, according to a report. The 16 Indian companies are in various sectors like banking, cement, IT, consumer goods, automobiles, electric utility, mining, gas processing and distribution, business and financial services and textiles, the report by global forum Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) stated.

""As climate change threats are on the rise, risks to businesses are also correspondingly increasing. A group of world's biggest companies representing nearly 17 trillion US Dollars (USD) in market capitalization have valued the climate risks to their businesses at almost 1 trillion USD - with many likely to hit within the next five years,"" the report said. The CDP is a global disclosure system that enables companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts. It collects and collates self-reported environmental data in the world.

The data was collected by the CDP and compiled into a report after over 200 global companies, including 16 Indian businesses responded to its questionnaire and shared threats to their business due to water scarcity. The Indian companies are - Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services(TCS), GAIL, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, State Bank of India, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services, Hindustan Zinc, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Shree Cement, Tata Chemicals, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Motors, Tata Power Co, Wipro and Arvind Ltd, a textile company.

Infosys and TCS expressed concern over their workforce and operations being affected due to climate change and the changes in the availability of natural resources like water in regions where they operate. ""A significant proportion of our workforce is based out of offices in coastal cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata which have high exposure to extreme weather events like precipitation, cyclones, rise in sea level, etc,"" the report said quoting TCS.

According to the report, banks and financial institutions lend money to a myriad of industries that face direct climate risks such as increased instances of natural disasters, depletion of water resources and impact on human capital. It said that Axis Bank is a lender to the agricultural sector, which has a high risk of crop failures or disruptions in production due to floods, droughts, cyclones and other natural disasters.

""The disasters affect the production capacity and ability of industries lying in their wake. The Bank is a significant lender to all such sectors, and thus these risks also impact its own portfolio,"" it said. SBI, which also has a significant agricultural portfolio, told the CDP that the negative effect of climate change and increased probability of droughts will adversely affect loans to be paid back in time, thereby leaving it susceptible to credit risk.

Gas processing and distribution company GAIL is also at the risk of being hit by climate change as its major compressor station and pipeline installation is located near the sea and is highly vulnerable to get adversely impacted due to rising sea levels. ""Rising sea levels would for certain impact our coastal facilities and can lead to even closure of operations in the worst case. Even higher probability occurrence is likely floods due to storm surges becoming more frequent,"" the report said quoting GAIL.

Hindustan Zinc, the mining company said it has three smelters and five mines located in Rajasthan, so change in the precipitation level is one of the major risk areas for it. ""Change in precipitation level further intensifies the problem as our operations in mining and smelter industry are heavily dependent on water availability. If there is less rainfall in these areas in future, it may affect our operations and productivity due to inadequate supply of water leading to a direct impact on company's revenue."""

36,2019-07-16,GAIL,"New Delhi: Moody's Investors Service Tuesday affirmed state-owned ONGC's Baa1 local and foreign currency issuer ratings, saying it reflect an improvement in the firm's credit metrics because of rise in oil prices.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) consolidated credit metrics - as measured by retained cash flow (RCF) to net debt - improved to 51 per cent for the fiscal ended March 31, 2019 (fiscal 2019) as compared to 40 per cent for fiscal 2018. ""The improvement was largely driven by better earnings, which in turn was because of higher realized crude oil prices,"" Moody's said in a statement.

This should result in ONGC generating positive free cash flow - despite the company's high level of capital spending and shareholder returns - which Moody's expects the company will use to reduce its borrowings. Its credit metrics will likely remain appropriate for its rating category over the next 12-18 months.

""The rating affirmation reflects our expectation that ONGC's credit metrics, which have improved over the last 12 months because of the high net realized oil price, will remain appropriate for its ratings,"" said Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President. ""Based on an average net realized oil price assumption of USD 65 per barrel, we expect that the company's earnings for fiscal 2020 will be broadly in line with fiscal 2019.""

ONGC's Baa1 issuer ratings are primarily driven by its standalone credit profile, as captured in its baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA).

The company's BCA reflects in turn its position as the largest integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity; substantial operating cash flow generation capacity; and credit metrics that have improved but will remain constrained by volatile - although range-bound - oil prices and high shareholder returns, it said.

""At the same time, the BCA incorporates Moody's expectation that the company will not be asked to share fuel subsidies, as long as oil prices stay below USD 70 per barrel,"" Moody's said.

ONGC's rating also incorporates a high likelihood of extraordinary support from and very high dependence on the government.

However, this assumption does not result in any rating uplift, because the sovereign rating is below ONGC's BCA.

ONGC generates sufficient cash flow to fund its capital spending and shareholder returns. However, the company's cash and cash equivalents of Rs 10,20 crore as of March 31, 2019, are insufficient to cover its debt maturing over the next 12 months of Rs 54,500 crore. Of this, about Rs 25,500 crore represents working capital loans and scheduled debt maturities at its subsidiaries - HPCL and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical Ltd - and are not guaranteed by ONGC.

Of the remaining Rs 29,000 crore, ONGC has already repaid or refinanced about Rs 10,000 crore as of July 15, 2019.

""Given ONGC's strong credit metrics and status as a government-owned company, it maintains strong access to debt funding markets and can refinance its remaining short-term borrowings,"" Moody's said.

Also, the company maintains substantial financial flexibility, as seen by its stakes in Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Gail (India) Ltd (Baa2 stable), which were valued at about Rs 22,600 crore at July 15.

The government owns a 64.25 per cent direct stake in ONGC and appoints all the directors on the company's board.

Moreover, the risk from government influence was evident in January 2018, when the government sold its 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC for Rs 36,900 crore, which resulted in the weakening of ONGC's credit metrics.

""Because of this risk, ONGC's ratings are constrained to no more than one notch above the sovereign's Baa2 rating,"" Moody's said, adding the rating outlook is stable on the expectation that shareholder returns and the company's growth plans will continue to be executed within the tolerance level of its current ratings.

In addition, the stable outlook assumes the company will improve its debt maturity profile, such that its cash and cash equivalents, along with committed bank facilities, can cover debt maturing over the next 12 months.

""A rating upgrade to A3 will require ONGC to improve its liquidity profile, maintain strong credit metrics, and also for Moody's to upgrade India's sovereign rating to at least Baa1,"" the statement said.

ONGC's ratings could experience downward pressure if Moody's downgrades the sovereign's rating or the oil prices decline or the company increases its pace of acquisitions such that it faces higher business risk and a deterioration in its credit metrics."
37,2019-07-16,GAIL,"State-owned 
ONGC and 
Oil India Ltd alongside private sector 
Vedanta Ltd Tuesday walked away with almost all of the 
oil
blocks auctioned in the latest licensing round as part of the government's effort to raise domestic production.

The winners of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Round II and III, which closed earlier this year, signed exploration and production contracts with the government at a function here Tuesday.

Speaking on the occassion, 
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said more production of 
oil and gas is priority of Modi-2.0 government as it looks to meet its rising energy demand of fast growing economy.

""There is possibility of USD 1 billion ?in OALP-II and III,"" he said.


Oil India Ltd signed up 
for the 
12 out of 32 
oil and gas exploration 
blocks it won in the twin rounds that ran parallelly because OALP-II was delayed. 
Vedanta Ltd walked away with 
10 and 
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (
ONGC) got eight 
blocks.

Reliance Industries and its British partner BP Plc signed a 
contract
for the sole KG basin gas they had bid, while Indian 
Oil Corp (IOC) too got one block.

Reliance-BP combine outbid 
ONGC in one Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal. This is an area that 
ONGC had previously relinquished and is said to hold natural gas prospects.

According to the DGH, 
OIL won 6 out of the 14 
blocks on offer in OALP-II, while 
Vedanta walked away with five. 
ONGC, Reliance-BP and IOC won one block each.

In OALP-III, 
ONGC won 7 
blocks while 
OIL got 6 and 
Vedanta the remaining five.

Bidding 
for 14 
blocks on offer in the OALP round-II and another 18 
oil and gas 
blocks as well as 5 coal-bed methane (CBM) 
blocks on offer in OALP-III closed on May 15. No bid was received 
for any of the CBM 
blocks.

Reliance-BP had made their first bid in eight years when they sought an area that previously was held by 
ONGC, sources said.

When the government in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out 
blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration, Reliance-BP sought the KG area containing the discoveries.

Under the new policy, areas sought by any company are put on auction with the initiator or the company that originally carved out the block, getting a 5 point advantage.

Reliance-BP had last jointly bid 
for a KG deepwater block in the 8th bid round under previous licensing policy in 2008. They, however, gave up the block after not finding any commercially exploitable 
oil and gas reserves.

In the following year, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance on its own bid 
for six 
blocks in the ninth round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) but did not win any block.

Sources said at the close of bidding 
for the current round on May 15, 
ONGC had put in bids 
for 20 out of the 32 
blocks on offer, while 
OIL made bids 
for 16 
blocks.


Vedanta, which had walked away with 41 out of the 55 
blocks offered in OALP-I last year, bid 
for 30 areas.

Indian 
Oil Corp (IOC), GAIL (India) and SunPetro bid 
for two 
blocks each, they said.

BP had more than a decade back entered the country, buying 30 per cent stake in Reliance's 21 
oiland gas exploration 
blocks
for USD 7.2 billion. All but a couple of 
blocks have since been relinquished.

NELP has since been replaced by Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) under which OALP bids round have been held.

Under the new policy, called open acreage licensing policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest or EoI 
for prospecting of 
oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence.

The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.

The 
blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up 
for auction.

The two windows of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31.

But, a delay in the offering of 
blocks meant that OALP-II and OALP-III ran concurrently. In OALP-1, 
Vedanta walked away with 41 out of 55 
blocks bid out. 
Oil India won nine 
blocks while 
ONGC managed to win just two.


Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of 
oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.

The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out.

It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of 
oil and gas to the government are awarded the block."

38,2019-07-17,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government has no plans to ban the sale of fossil fuel-driven vehicles as India cannot afford to do so, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said — a statement that counters reports that an official deadline for their phaseout is in the offing as part of a larger plan to promote electric vehicles (EVs).

This would come as a respite to automakers and oil companies that are opposed to any move to ban fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Pradhan’s statement also reflects the lack of consensus between different arms of the government on promoting EVs and the ways to deal with the pollution emergency that several Indian cities today face.

“There is no ban. India cannot afford to do that,” Pradhan said, responding to whether the government is considering a ban on the new sale of fossil fuel vehicles in order to promote electric vehicles. India is heavily dependent on fossil fuels and would find it hard to manage without these, he said.

“Niti Aayog or any other arm of the government has never said they would ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles,” Pradhan said. “With full responsibility I’m saying that, as per my understanding, EV is our priority, but so is piped natural gas, compressed natural gas and BS-VI fuel.”

A Niti Aayog-led panel has reportedly proposed permitting the sale of only electric three-wheelers from April 2023, electric twowheelers below 150cc from April 2025, and electric cars for commercial use from April 2026. Automakers have opposed this, saying such timelines are impractical and would cause hardship to the industry that’s already seeing deceleration in sales.

A phaseout of fossil fuel vehicles can also deeply hurt oil companies that are planning to spend billions of dollars in expanding their refinery, fuel stations and city gas network.

“The government wants to promote electric vehicle. It is very much focused to develop city gas network and to diversify its energy basket,” Pradhan said, adding that conventional, renewable, biofuel and EVs will together help fulfil India’s energy needs in future.


GAIL SPLIT
The oil ministry has asked GAIL to separate its transportation and marketing business and the company is working on that, Pradhan said, without specifying if the transportation business will become a separate entity or will stay as the subsidiary of the state-run firm.

51,2019-07-19,GAIL,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India’s largest domestic institutional investor, raised bets on select banks as well as agrochemical, pharma and FMCG stocks during June quarter, which saw domestic equity benchmark Sensex gain marginally 1.87 per cent to 39,395 as of June 28, 2019 from 38,673 on March 29, 2019. 

The insurance behemoth offloaded shares of telecom, power, mining, public sector banks, NBFCs, power generation and oil exploration firms during the quarter.

Private sector lenders emerged as institutional investors’ favourites amid hopes that with adequate provisioning and fewer concerns over incremental slippages, corporate-focused players would see an improvement in return on assets going forward. 

Shareholding pattern of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Federal Bank showed a rise in LIC holding, according to data from corporate database Ace Equity. Among the companies that have reported their shareholding data so far, LIC held a stake in 150.

Federal Bank recently posted a 46.25 per cent rise in June quarter profit at Rs 384.21 crore on healthy growth in non-crore income and stable asset quality. Brokerage Anand Rathi has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Federal Bank with a price target of Rs 130. 

Shares of Federal Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have rallied 10 per cent and 22 per cent on a year-to-date basis till July 17, while the benchmark Sensex has gained 7 per cent in the same period.



Among the public sector banks, LIC upped stake in Bank of Baroda, but cut holdings in Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India.

Punjab National Bank earlier this month reported a fraud of more than Rs 3,800 crore by Bhushan Power & Steel. The development came at a time when the bank was coping with a major financial fraud of around Rs 13,000 crore by diamond merchant Nirav Modi.

Mutual funds also increased holdings in some of the private banks during June quarter, raising their total exposure by 370 basis points to 19.90 per cent YoY and 20 basis points QoQ. 

The domestic equity market was upbeat through much of June quarter amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) on hopes of the Narendra Modi government coming back to power. FIIs poured more than Rs 30,000 crore in domestic stocks during April-June.

Beyond banking, LIC also increased stake in pesticide and agrochemicals firm UPL, industrial gases and fuel firm GAIL India, FMCG major ITC, pharma and drug companies Granules India and Bliss GVS Pharma and household and personal product-related firm Gillette India. 

Among others, Blue Dart Express, Havells India and Adani Ports also reported a rise in LIC holding during the quarter. 

On the other hand, the insurance behemoth brought down its stake in MTNL to 14.56 per cent at the end of June quarter from 18.49 per cent in the preceding quarter. It also reduced stake in Power Grid (from 7.50 per cent to 4.89 per cent), BHEL (14.13 per cent to 11.67 per cent), NMDC (14.72 per cent to 12.89 per cent) and Shipping Corporation of India (11.91 per cent to 10.32 per cent). 

It also cut stake in other companies including Welspun Corp, Nalco, NTPC, SAIL, Paisalo Digital, OMDC, Tamboli Captal, Oil India and SV Global Mill.

53,2019-07-19,GAIL,"There is an extremely good opportunity to buy in the next 10-12 weeks through SIP in select midcaps and large caps, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What should one do with the midcaps that are cracking?The fear is overdone. Market is very despondent and that has more to do with some of the FIIs exiting because of the tax. A large part of the imponderables are on the positive side and we are calling it the 12-week factor, from here till middle of October. October onwards we are very bullish on the market and we think that in this fear, you should do a SIP for the next 10-12 weeks in select midcaps and select largecaps, because we think midcaps maybe on the way to the bottom. This is a very good selloff in the broader market and the largecaps. 

It tells you that inherently over ownership or the exit of some of the FIIs are giving you an opportunity. The cement numbers are a clear indicator for an economy and it says the economy is only going to get better from here. So, there is an extremely good opportunity to buy in the next 10-12 weeks through a SIP in select midcaps and large caps. 


Though the sentiment has turned really sour currently and we have been getting some really dire predictions on liquidity, growth, no one is seeing the light around the corner. We are now hearing an outlook which is a little bit more long term -- four to six quarters -- as opposed to a pick up as early as the festive season or the end of the year? Would you disagree?It is overdone and it is always the screen which tells you. When I was in Mumbai for many years, the best saying was what a Guajarati bhai told me: Bhav bhagwan che. Bhav is what is telling you that the fear is there. That fear is overblown and I am not saying that there is not macro weakness, but look at the cost of money on the bond yields, look at the rupee and global liquidity. It is just a matter of time, maybe once this expiry is over, you should start to see very good inflows from FIIs. 

Wait for the government to start to act on more consumption-led themes. They have already given you a wicket on some of the NBFCs and the recapitalisation of PSBs. Going ahead, they have a good opportunity of instigating growth through a lot of other measures. We are being opposite. We think these 11,400 on the Nifty is an ideal place to start a SIP in both the Nifty, Bank Nifty and select stocks both on largecaps and midcaps. 

After October, you will be very happy that you did this because fear is generally the best time to be contrarian and start to buy.


What is your view on Reliance?Reliance will give a slightly weaker number on the net and we have to see how the GRMs are. But do not miss the wood for the trees. Yesterday, they announced $1 billion capex in the gas basin of KG which is telling you they are putting their money where their mouth is -- whether it is technology in the shape of Jio and the other businesses which are online. They are taking on Netflix in OTT. And on the energy side on gas. In fact, for gas, this participation in new pipeline in partnership with GAIL should see a lot of flows from overseas and Reliance is one of the key players there. 

Any fall over here is a very good opportunity. In fact, Reliance, ITC, UltraTech Cement, ICICI Bank and Sun are five names which we are suggesting to very actively have a large SIP for the next 12 weeks. By the end of the year, you will be much happier that you bought this fear and Reliance would be one of the constituents. We think Reliance by the end of the year and maybe March 2020 should be closer to Rs 1,450-1,500."
54,2019-07-22,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The oil ministry will soon approach the Cabinet for about Rs 6,000 crore in viability gap funding (VGF) for the proposed gas grid in the northeast. Indradhanush Gas Grid Ltd (IGGL), a joint venture of Indian Oil, ONGC, GAIL, Oil India, and Numaligarh Refinery, plans to lay 1,600-kilometre northeast gas grid at a cost of about RS 10,000 crore. IGGL would need about 60% funding support from the central government for this, an official said.

Without funding support from the Centre, state firms will find it hard to launch the project, the official said, adding that the project was crucial to building the national gas grid and the economic development of the northeast region.

The government had in 2016 provided a capital grant of Rs 5,176 crore, or 40% of the project cost, for 2,500-km-long Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) project, which GAIL is currently executing.

A higher 60% project funding support from the Centre would be needed for the northeast gas grid project since it is tougher than Jagdishpur-Haldia project due to the physical and economic conditions in the region, the official said. Indradhanush Gas Grid was set up in August 2018 but has not made much progress in a year due to lack of clarity on project financing.

The oil ministry had earlier hoped to receive the Cabinet’s approval on funding ahead of the general election but the process got delayed. Delay in funding can affect the timelines and cost of the project that connects eight states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim.

The pipeline would connect to the proposed national grid at Guwahati. At present, about 16,800 km of natural gas pipeline is operational and about 14,200 km of pipelines are being developed across the country to increase supply of gas to households and industries.

The government plans to raise the share of natural gas in country’s primary energy mix to 15% by 2030 from 6% now. In its quest to turn India into a gas-based economy, the government is encouraging companies to build more gas pipelines, import terminals and compressed natural gas distribution stations. Increased transport and distribution infrastructure and production capability can boost local consumption of natural gas, which is a relatively cleaner fossil fuel."

62,2019-07-23,GAIL,"After a brief lull, the Essar Steel insolvency case is back in news again following the Supreme Court's order for a status quo on its sale to ArcelorMittal. The apex court said it would take a decision only after receiving formal legal views of all parties involved, and that it would hear the matter after two weeks.

How did matters come to this pass in the Essar Steel case? ET explains:


How much does Essar Steel owe?
Essar Steel owes Rs 54,547 crore to its creditors — financial creditors and operational creditors combined. The company had been put on the block under IBC to recover the unpaid dues.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had on March 8 okayed the bid submitted by ArcelorMittal, led by steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, for the takeover of Essar Steel.

The operational creditors had opposed the bid on the basis that they were getting notional payment, while 92.5 per cent of the financial creditors' dues were being paid.


Who are Essar Steel's creditors?
Public-sector lenders are Essar Steel's primary financial creditors. Vendors and suppliers are the operational creditors, the most prominent ones being Dakshin Gujarat, Gujarat Energy, Bharat Petroleum, Indian Oil, GAIL, ONGC, and the NTPC.

Financial creditors are those who provide long-term capital in the form of loans. Operational creditors are usually the suppliers of raw materials, etc.


Who are the litigants?
A consortium of banks led by the SBI had moved the Supreme Court against a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order in the case.

The NCLAT had held that Essar Steel's operational creditors be treated on par with financial creditors when settling the claims.


Where does the latest issue lie?
Essar Steel's Committee of Creditors (CoC) had sought the quashing of NCLAT's July 4 order that approved the Rs 42,000-crore bid for the debt-laden firm by ArcelorMittal. This was to be divided between the financial creditors who are owed Rs 30,030 crore and the operational creditors who are owed Rs 11,969 crore.


What was the NCLAT order all about?
The NCLAT, in its order, said financial creditors would get 60.7 per cent of their admitted claims of Rs 49,473 crore, about the same as operational creditors.

The operational creditors with admitted claim amount of less than Rs 1 crore would get 100 per cent, while above Rs 1 crore would get 60.26 per cent and workmen and employees would get 100 per cent.

The tribunal had said that the CoC will have no role in the distribution of Rs 42,000 crore and allowed claims of the operational creditors.

ArcelorMittal had told the NCLAT that it would pay Rs 42,000 crore, including a minimum guarantee of Rs 2,500 crore as working capital, for acquiring Essar Steel under the insolvency process.


Why are the financial creditors miffed?
The financial creditors — in this case state-run banks — comprise the committee of creditors. While financial creditors are secured creditors, the operational ones are not. That's why financial creditors are up in arms against the NCLAT's equal status order, which they say is a disincentive to lenders and investors.

According to the lenders and the CoC, the IBC framework does not envisage such a parity between the two categories — operational creditors are expected to be paid only after all secured creditors have been paid off.


Why is the Essar Steel case so important?
This being one of India's most high-profile insolvency cases, any order on Essar Steel is likely to have ramifications for similar resolution schemes."
63,2019-07-23,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-owned gas firm GAIL India has hired a newly-built LNG ship from Japan's Mitsui OSK Lines for ferrying gas from nations such as the US for three years beginning 2021, and plans to charter hire additional vessels.

GAIL in its latest annual report said it has contracted long-term LNG from the USA (5.8 million tonnes per annum) and Russia (2.5 million tonnes) and is now actively trading the gas in international market.

The company in 2017 chartered hired the vessel Meridian Spirit from Total for three years, extendable by one year, to transport the LNG sourced from the USA.

It also hired two vessels - Cadiz Knuten and CLean Horizon - in 2018 for shorter periods to meet its shipping requirements.

""Based on the intermittent spot requirements during the FY 2019-20, GAIL plans to charter hire additional LNG ship(s) on spot / short term basis,"" it said. ""Recently, GAIL has signed a Charter Party Agreement with Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) for the hiring of a new build LNG vessel for a period of three years from the year 2021 onwards.""

GAIL said it is fully equipped to meet its spot /short/mid/ long term shipping requirements and has been able to develop LNG shipping capabilities in a very short span of time.

It is the largest natural gas company of India with about 11,400 kilometers of the cross country existing trunk pipeline network and another 4,000-km pipeline in advance stage of completion.

The company has a contract to buy 2.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Sabine Pass Liquefaction LLC, USA. Supplies under this contract started in February 2018.

Also, it has booked 2.3 million tonnes per annum of capacity in the Cove Point LNG liquefaction terminal in the US, with supplies commencing from April 2018.

With Gazprom of Russia, it has signed a contract to buy 2.85 million tonnes per annum of LNG beginning 2018-19.

""Your company has successfully renegotiated LNG contracts with GMTS (Gazprom) in view of the changing market scenario, as spot / short-term LNG prices had declined substantially amid a supply glut,"" the annual report said.

In addition, GAIL was instrumental in renegotiating LNG supply contract from Australia through Petronet LNG Ltd.

""Through these renegotiations, your company has managed to renegotiate the timeline, volume, LNG price and price indexation of these long-term LNG contracts, resulting in significant price advantage,"" it added.

These contracts, GAIL said, were entered into with the primary objective of meeting the demand of a growing Indian economy and with power sector being considered as one of the major long-term buyers of LNG.

""However, power produced from LNG is not being scheduled by Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) due to cheaper alternatives including renewables thereby leading to the stranding of significant capacity out of the approx 25,000 MW of installed gas-based power plants,"" it said.

To mitigate this risk, GAIL said it is exploring opportunities to market LNG volumes in the international markets either directly and/or through its subsidiary, GGSPL Singapore.

""In parallel, your company has also optimized LNG sourced from the US through destination swap transactions to optimize the cost of shipping this LNG to the Indian ports resulting in the efficient management of the portfolio. Your company has also undertaken time swap transactions to even out the LNG supply-demand fluctuations,"" the report said.

GAIL is looking at the fertilizer sector for market some of the LNG and is also looking at refineries and steel plants for the same."

68,2019-07-26,GAIL,"BENGALURU: Shilpa Rao, a SAP consultant at a reputed private firm in Electronic City, used to cover the 18 km journey from her Jayanagar home in 45 minutes. As travel time doubled, she now opts to work from home thrice a week, the most an employee can avail.

Shilpa is among lakhs of Bengalureans for whom commuting to work or anywhere else in the city has become a nightmare, all thanks to multiple ongoing construction projects. While some disruption during any project is natural, the sheer number of such disruptions — most of them on major arterial roads — is frustrating Bengalureans, interfering with their quality of life.

These projects — variously referred to as developmental, remodelling, upgrading works — were conceived, approved and begun with enthusiasm. While the approvals came through quickly, the rate of progress of the projects is the opposite.

For instance, of the 24 roads identified for white-topping (concretising) under Phase I in 2017, work has been completed only on one road, the 20th main road in Koramangala, admit officials. The civic body has dug up or closed parts of several important roads, including highways such as Hosur Road, Mysuru Road and Outer Ring Road for this work. White-topping, conceived in 2016 and taken up since 2018, was presented as a solution to the city’s pothole-filled roads. The construction-friendly BBMP managed to get clearances for three phases of this money-guzzling project in quick succession. The 266-km white-topping project costs ?2,867.64 crore, or over ?10 crore for every kilometre of road.

The BBMP’s lack of seriousness in meeting deadlines and failure to provide alternative roads has only made it worse. Nirup Gowda, a civil engineer, has been a mute witness to the slow progress of both the Metro and the whitetopping project during his daily trip between Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Indiranagar. “The worst pain point is between Gopalan Mall and Gali Anjaneya Temple where white-topping is in progress. Even the bylanes are choked. So, my entire trip, which would take 45 minutes earlier, now takes oneand-a-half to two hours,” Gowda said. He chooses the Metro whenever his work schedule does not compel him to use a two-wheeler.

The Bengaluru Traffic Police has permitted infrastructure-related work on over 50 roads in the city. While the BWSSB has been laying pipelines for water supply and sewage on 14 roads, the Gas Authority of India (GAIL) is digging up three roads to lay pipelines. What’s more, there are many flyovers, railway bridges and underpasses under construction.

Urban expert V Ravichandar said the correct way to plan projects was to base them on resources and manpower availability. “With BBMP elections coming up next year, everybody wants to show that something happened in their area. So imagine 198 councillors and 28 MLA doing the same,” he said.

While transportation experts and former bureaucrats believe there could be no end to infrastructure projects in a growing city like Bengaluru, they want authorities to execute the projects better. Retired IAS officer MR Sreenivasa Murthy said the civic body should avoid many projects in the same area. “Projects should be taken up in a phased manner. Only after one project is completed should the BBMP take up another in one locality so that there is no inconvenience to people,” he said.



BBMP commissioner Manjunath Prasad agreed such mistakes have happened in the past. He promised not to repeat them. “We are going slow with white-topping projects. If three to four roads are identified for white-topping in one locality, we focus on completing one project before moving on to another. This is being done to minimise disruption,” he said.

There is, however, chaos on the ground.

Take the case of the signal-free corridor project on Old Airport Road. The BBMP is simultaneously constructing underpasses at three junctions — HAL, Isro and Kundalahalli. The lanes and bylanes between the central business district and Koramangala are bursting with traffic, thanks to a construction overkill in this region. The Sony World flyover and white-topping are taking place simultaneously. Dual projects (Metro and white-topping) are also underway on Mysuru Road, Bannerghatta Road and Kanakapura Road.

The worst, perhaps, is around the corner. The civic body is planning white-topping of an additional 1,200 km of road in the city, again another questionable decision. Among the roads chosen are MG Road and Cubbon Road, which are in good condition.

As the city administration continues its construction spree and contractors thrive, the very reasons that made Bengaluru a lovable city are disappearing in a haze of sand, dust and steel."
69,2019-07-26,GAIL,"Mumbai: Mutual funds mostly lapped up financials and software services stocks in June, even as they shunned energy companies within the largecap universe.

TCS was the most sought after stock among mutual funds in June, as they lapped up Rs 866 crore shares, data from Morningstar showed. This was followed by HDFC, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank.

“Mutual funds were underweight IT, and are coming back through select names such as TCS and the like,” said Kaustubh Belapurkar, director of fund research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

TCS, India’s top software services exporter, missed Street estimates on June quarter revenue, as spending in the key banking and financial services segment slowed. The company said its performance in the ongoing quarter would be key to meeting its full-year target of double-digit growth.

“Incrementally, cautious commentary led by weak BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) outlook is a negative. Further, the current quarter will be critical with improved performance to aid double-digit growth for the year,” Reliance Securities said in a note on July 10.

“We expect the stock to remain subdued in the next quarter owing to below-par revenue performance,” Reliance Securities said.

Belapurkar said financials were a large part of the index. “There has been this thrust towards corporate banks for last 9-12 months. HDFC twins – are the quality names, and continue to see flows,” added Belpurkar.
That was a popular tone

“Financials is one-third of the index, so, even if one has a mildly positive view, you can’t but buy financials. Among the financials space, private lenders are preferred,” Dipen Sheth, head of institutional research at HDFC Securities

“Interest rates are also headed southwards, which makes a case for financials,” added Sheth. 

The other banks that found their names in the top large cap buys were Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank.
The stock they sold the most was Tata Steel. They sold a collective of Rs 655 crore worth the company’s stocks.

The most-sold large cap stocks in the list included Power Grid, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, GAIL (India), Hindustan Petroleum, Coal India.

Belapurkar said energy stocks have been drags on the portfolio and mutual funds have been cutting exposure. Sheth pointed that all of these energy companies were state-owned.

“The Street is increasingly wary of a government which is not letting go the control and command approach over PSUs . The driving style is too socialist. Even if these stocks look attractive from valuation perspective, the way some of them are run is a turn off,” Sheth said."

73,2019-07-29,GAIL,"The government has declined Bhuwan Chandra Tripathi, the country's longest-serving head of a major PSU, a third extension as Chairman and Managing Director of India's biggest natural gas firm GAIL India Ltd, sources said. 

 Tripathi, 59, who was the youngest person to become a chairman of an oil and gas PSU in August 2009, completes his second five-year term on July 31 and was eligible for an extension till his date of superannuation on January 31 next year. 

 Sources said the government has, however, declined an extension. 

 While no official reason has been given for the denial of extension, he was the person who stood between plans of splitting GAIL into two by hiving-off gas pipeline or the marketing business into a separate unit for a possible sale to a strategic investor. 

 Widely rated as one of the finest CEOs in the petroleum sector in the country, Tripathi is credited with steering the GAIL through several challenging times in project management. He was the youngest chairman of a PSU when he in August 2009 took over as the head of GAIL and is the longest-serving one of a major PSU. 

 During his 10 year tenure, GAIL saw three-fold growth in turnover to over Rs 74,000 crore, doubling of profit to over Rs 9,000 crore, a three-time growth in asset base and about two-and-half times growth in market cap to around Rs 78,000 crore. GAIL is now virtually a debt-free company. 

 From aggressive foray into city gas business and striking Henry Hub linked LNG import deals, he is also credited with leading GAIL's transformation into the league Global Top 10 gas majors with his aggressive globalisation moves and opening up of GAIL offices in the US, Singapore, and Myanmar. 

 The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has communicated to the Petroleum Ministry the decision of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), which was seized of the issue after Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had recommended an extension early this year, they said. 

 DoPT, however, did not give any reasons for denying Tripathi an extension, they added. 

 According to sources, the order noted that the senior-most director of GAIL be appointed as interim Chairman and Managing Director till a full-time head is selected. 

 Director (Projects) Ashutosh Karnatak is the senior-most director on GAIL board and is likely to made named interim chairman. 

 Some months back, the ACC had approved an extension of Karnatak's tenure by 16 months till his superannuation age of 60 years to be achieved in June 2020. 

 Karnatak was appointed for a five-year term beginning March 1, 2014, and this term ended on February 28. 

 Tripathi was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of GAIL by the Congress-led UPA government in 2009, for an initial five-year term. His extension was due to be reviewed in 2014, but the UPA government in October 2013 approved another five-year term till July 31, 2019. 

 Prior to taking over as CMD, Tripathi had served as Director of Marketing at GAIL from July 2007 to July 31, 2009. 

 A mechanical engineering graduate from NIT, formerly known as Motilal Nehru Regional Engineering College, Allahabad in 1982, Tripathi started his career with ONGC. He joined GAIL India during its inception in 1984 and was one of the initial team members involved in the construction and commissioning of the Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) pipeline system. 

 Incidentally, he is the only chief of a major PSU entity to have won an extension of service in recent times. 

 Directors, including chairmen, on the boards of public sector enterprises, are appointed for five years or until the superannuation age of 60 years, whichever is earlier. 

 Upon completion of five years, an executive is eligible for an extension if there is time left for retirement. The Government had, however, denied extensions to Subir Raha of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), P Banerjee of GAIL, Sarthak Behuria of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Ashok Sinha of Bharat Petroleum Corp. 

 Tripathi, who is credited with turning GAIL into an aggressive gas marketing and transmission company, was considered the youngest chairman of a Navaratna PSU when he took over at GAIL at the age of 49 on August 1, 2009. 

 During his tenure, GAIL was conferred the 'Maharatna' public sector enterprise status. 

 The company has strengthened its core businesses across natural gas midstream and downstream chains during the last decade by doubling gas transmission capacity, tripling petrochemicals marketable portfolio. It has also forayed into newer game-changing opportunities by securing over 8.0 million tonnes per annum long-term LNG supply commitments. ANZ MR"

74,2019-07-30,GAIL,"When there is high pessimism in markets, one can either stay put or shift a part of the investments into schemes that follow value investing. The key to this approach is spotting companies that are either attractive in comparison with historical valuation or with respect to their peers. 

It makes sense to be with such firms since in the long-term, they tend do well as the Street recognises the merits of having positive financial ratios in their favour. One of the schemes, which follows this strategy, is Tata Equity PE. The scheme follows an effective strategy of investing in stocks which trade (trailing) cheaper than the valuation of the Sensex at the time of entry. 

Close to 70 per cent of the scheme’s portfolio is constructed based on this criterion. This is one of the reasons why the scheme has been a consistent performer in almost all market cycles. This is more evident especially in the long-term cycles of markets. 

The scheme has given 12 per cent and 14.5 per cent returns in the past 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively, while its peers in the category have given 9 per cent and 13 per cent returns, respectively, over the same periods. 

In the past six months, the scheme has invested in firms which have sound business model but are trading at cheap valuation. They are available at cheap valuation not because of lack of growth in earnings but largely due to broad pessimistic sentiment in the market. A few of these companies are Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Jubilant Foodworks.

Expert Take

Amit Singh, CEO, Investica
The strategy this fund follows is to invest in stocks that have a rolling 12-month P/E less than that of the Sensex. Such a strategy is especially useful during rising markets. With this investment objective, the fund has managed to beat the benchmark as well as category if we look at 5-year, 7-year or 10-year performance."
76,2019-07-30,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The CBI has booked London-based Rolls Royce in a corruption case for allegedly paying over Rs 77 crore as commission to an agent to win contracts from public sector undertakings HAL, ONCG and GAIL during 2007-11, officials said Tuesday.

The action comes after a five-year-long inquiry by the agency initiated on the basis of a complaint from the Defence Ministry which had received a letter about the engagement of Singapore-based Ashok Patni and his company Aashmore Pvt Ltd by Rolls Royce, they said.

The inquiry was launched on the basis of the letter which was forwarded to the CBI.

There was no immediate response from Rolls Royce.

It was alleged that the total business of HAL with Rolls Royce was around Rs 4,700 crore between 2000 to 2013.

It is alleged that Rolls Royce paid Rs 18 crore to Patni as ""commercial advisor"" in the 100 supply orders of Avon and Allison Engines spare parts to HAL between 2007-11, they alleged.

The agency alleged that Patni was also engaged in direct contracts of Rolls Royce with ONGC and GAIL for the supply of spare parts. 

Although contracts with ONGC and GAIL allowed services of an agent but it was mandatory to declare the name at the time of bidding, a condition violated by Rolls Royce, they said.

The company declared the name of its agent to the oil and gas sector behemoths in 2013, the agency alleged.

It is alleged that Roll Royce paid Rs 29.81 crore in 73 purchase orders from 2007 to 2011 for procurement of material and spare parts pertaining to the engines for ONGC, but the company declared it in 2013, they alleged.

The company also paid one million British pounds with regard to 68 purchase orders from GAIL for spare parts from 2007 to 2010, the CBI alleged.

It also said that the company entered in an arrangement with Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd and another company Infinity, also owned by Patni, to which extra commission was paid, but not declared to GAIL, it alleged.

The total commission paid by Rolls Royce comes to the tune of Rs 28.09 crore during the period 2007-10 for supplies to GAIL, they alleged. 

Rolls Royce, its Indian subsidiary, Patni, his company and Mumbai-based Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd besides unidentified officials of HAL, ONGC and GAIL have been booked by the CBI for criminal conspiracy and bribery, they said.

There was an alleged conspiracy by Rolls Royce Plc and its subsidiary Rolls Royce India Pvt Ltd to misrepresent the facts before HAL regarding the engagement of the agent in order to win contracts with HAL with ""deception"", they said.

The Indian Marine Gas Turbine unit of the HAL provides support in areas of inspection, spare parts, maintenance, equipment overhaul and assembly for Industrial and Marine Gas Turbines under licence from reputed manufactures. 

The unit provides overhaul and repair of Avon and Allison Engines for ONGC and GAIL for which spare parts are supplied by energy division of Rolls Royce, they said.

The contract between Rolls Royce Power Engineering Plc .and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. was signed June, 2007 which was valid till December, 2011 to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services for the units owned by the GAIL and ONGC under above licence from Rolls Royce.

""The purchase order condition specifically mentioned that Rolls Royce is not supposed to appoint any agent in India to promote this contract and no commission is payable to such agent,"" the CBI FIR has alleged.

It is alleged that Rolls Royce violated the condition of purchase order and integrity pact by engaging Patni and his company as commercial advisor from 2007 to 2011 and paid a commission ranging from 10 per cent to 11.3 per cent for supply of spare parts of Avon and Allison Engines. 

The commission amount comes to the tune of Rs 18.32 crore during the period from 2007 to 2011 for 100 purchase order, they alleged."

79,2019-07-31,GAIL,"New Delhi: July turned out to be the worst month for Nifty in 17 years. The NSE benchmark is on course to end the month 6 per cent lower, marking its biggest fall monthly drop since 2002.

Market sentiment was hit this month following disappointing announcements in Union Budget amid tepid corporate earnings.

In July 2002, Nifty had registered a 9.35 per cent fall, which was also its biggest fall that year. The index has ended July in the red on five instances in last 17 years. It fell 2.93 per cent in 2011, 0.95 per cent in 2012 and 1.72 per cent in 2013.

FII have sold equities around Rs 12,000 crore this July, leading to major wealth destruction across sectors. Nifty shed over 700 points during the month. The overseas portfolio investors had brought in over Rs 80,000 crore during February-June.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told ETNow that the income-tax surcharge hurt FPI sentiment, adding to the market’s woes.

The pain is even worse in the broader market. BSE midcap and Smallcap indices fell 8.52 per cent and 11.16 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Within the Nifty pack, 44 stocks eroded investor wealth in July, with Coal India, YES Bank, Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj Finserve, JSW Steel, Grasim and M&M falling up to 21 per cent till July 30.

However, stocks like Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints gained up to 13 per cent to help cushion the fall. Among others, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid and Dr Reddy's Labs managed to deliver positive returns to investors.

“Poor Q1 earnings, a slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing NBFC crisis have dampened investor sentiments on Dalal Street,” said Hemang Jani, Head of Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We are cautious on the NBFC space. Rising credit costs and higher provisioning are likely to impact bottom line and credit growth. As per recent reports and data domestic growth will be weaker over the next 12-18 months,” he said.

Khemka of MOSL said, “The broader market has turned weak mainly because of poor fundamentals. The underlying earnings growth has remained elusive and Q1 numbers have proved to be a dampener for earnings recovery expectations for FY20.”

Jani prefers stocks like Ramco Cement, HUL and Asian Paints which have shown decent growth in a challenging environment."

7,2019-08-04,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Hopes that the government may exempt FPIs from the income-tax surcharge and do away with the proposal to raise the minimum public shareholding in listed companies to 35 per cent from 25 per cent helped market benchmarks to end with gains on Friday.

Even though it is too early to say that the government will roll back or dilute the provisions, market observers say any such step will stem the market fall.

""The recent selling spree in India can be attributed to higher taxation on trust entities of FPIs combined with the slowdown in the economy. We think soon the government may act by diluting the excessive provisions in the law. That may act as a relief. For that matter, any reversal in the Budget provisions which were taken negatively by the bourses might bring about a relief rally,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote.

Besides, RBI's monetary policy meet, earnings and flow of foreign funds will also influence the market significantly. 


Let's take a look at the factors that will guide Dalal Street in the coming week:


RBI's MPC
Will RBI go for a fourth rate cut in 2019 coming Wednesday? Economists and market observers say, probably yes, due to benign inflation and clear signs of weakness in the economy. As per a survey by Reuters, almost 80 per cent of 66 economists polled expected RBI to cut the repo rate by 25 bps. If it does materialise, the market will have a reason to rejoice. 


Key June quarter earnings
Among sectoral majors, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Titan, HCL Technologies, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Steel, Ultratech Cement, BPCL, Cadila Healthcare and GAIL will come out with their June quarter numbers during the week. While the numbers so far have been uninspiring, a continuation of this trend will further weigh on market sentiment.


Foreign fund flow
In just two sessions of August, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have taken out Rs 2,859 crore from Indian equities and debt, data available with NSDL showed. In the month of July, FPIs were net sellers at the tune of Rs 3,003 crore. The flow of foreign funds will remain a key trigger for the rise and fall of the market.


Trade war jitters
Hopes of a truce in the trade war were dashed last week when the US President threatened fresh tariffs on Chinese imports. China said it would take countermeasures. The world remains mute spectators as major economies suffer. Market experts expect more capital outflow from emerging markets in case of any further escalation on this front. 


Crude oil & rupee
The rupee dived 54 paise on Friday to close at an over six-week low of 69.60 against the US dollar as soaring crude oil prices and a fresh flare-up in US-China trade tensions weighed on emerging market currencies. Oil prices gained about 3 per cent on Friday. Elevated crude oil prices and falling rupee may spook investors as it will only add misery to the economy which already appears to be in poor health. 


Technical outlook
Nifty made a High Wave-like candle on the daily chart last Friday but formed a bearish candle for the fourth straight week. Analysts say a followup buying is essential for a trend reversal. ""If Friday's pullback sustains, Nifty shall initially head to test its 200-day simple moving average, which is placed at the 11,154 level,"" said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. After the 11,154 level, the 11,300 and 11,350 may act as strong resistance levels for the market. 

""In the short to medium term, the market may witness a bounceback given it's in oversold zone and any bounceback can further be extended to 11,200-11,300, if it sustains above the 10,900 mark. However, it would be tough for the market to breach the 11,300 - 11,350 zone. Hence consolidation is also around the corner. Short sellers should remain cautious as current levels favour the bulls,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research."

Shares of Cera Sanitaryware traded at Rs 2,362.45 around 1:20 pm on 5 August, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 

CRS reported a consolidated revenue de-growth of 3.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) led by 9 per cent and 2 per cent growth in faucet-ware (FW) and tiles segments, respectively.

Sanitary-ware (SW) segment saw a decline of 12.7 per cent YoY. Consolidated Ebitda was down 5.5 per cent YoY with margins contracting by 24bps YoY to 13 per cent, primarily due to decline in high margin SW business. 

Consolidated PAT was down 11.5 per cent YoY as depreciation expenses increased 46 per cent YoY due to Ind-AS 116 accounting standards.

""Even as residential segment in the real estate sector continues to be plagued with piling inventory, dealer re-stocking in SW segment remains far below than our expectations due to liquidity crisis & tough demand environment,"" said Yes Securities. 

CRS’s unwavering focus on rejuvenating its product basket with aesthetically superior products, widening the distribution network, and its initiatives in cementing a lasting recall, will facilitate in growing its market share. 

CRS has remained very selective in project business which has yielded positive results in form of working capital improvement during Q1FY20. 

In quest of higher volume growth, management is not willing to sacrifice the Ebitda margins and also not extending credit terms to channel partners. 

As per the brokerage, CRS would be focusing on profitable growth and cash conversion cycle through better control over working capital. 

""We trim FY20E and FY21E earnings estimates by 9 per cent and 10 per cent to factor in slower growth from SW and tiles segments in the first half of FY20. With price hikes taken in both SW and FW in May’19, we expect near-term Ebitdam to remain stable,"" said the brokerage. 

Yes Securities said it expects CRS to deliver 14 per cent earning CAGR over FY19-21E with an over 17 per cent Core ROICs. It has maintain ‘buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 2,801 at 25 times FY21 earnings per share (EPS).

CRS has two main sources of energy - GAIL and Sabarmati Gas, for operating its SW plant. The pricing of both sources are different. GAIL sources gas from isolated wells in and around Cera’s manufacturing facility, and is able to contract gas at a lower price over prevailing market pricing. 

Medium-term contracts with these suppliers are renewed on a periodic basis. For energy conservation, CRS has installed fuel efficient burners to control gas consumption and in addition to this, every effort is done to adapt any technological developments in energy conservation by the company. 

The second type of energy, electricity, which is required for running the machineries, is supplied by the local Discom. To compensate within the energy consumption by way of electricity, CRS has an installed capacity of Wind Turbines of 8.3MW and 2MW Solar Plant which generates about 90 per cent of the requirements and gets offset against monthly consumption of the energy bill.

CRS has been constantly upgrading its technology, increasing automation, upgrading consumer visible manufacturing processes via robotic glazing machines which help in evenness of glaze and also save glaze.

The Company is now going in for further mechanization of casting. It has developed 3D printing machines allow designs to be prototypes in a manner of weeks, facilitating quicker time to market of new designs. 

FW unit has attained critical mass, the product offerings span most consumer tastes in price and design. In FW manufacturing, continuous technology upgradation programs have enabled higher productivity and minimum human intervention in the manufacturing process.

12,2019-08-07,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The recent amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), passed by Parliament and awaiting assent of the President, were brought to the notice of the Supreme Court by a section of creditors on Wednesday.

A bench of Justices R F Nariman and Surya Kant was told by some operational creditors in Essar insolvency case that they will be challenging the new amendments passed by Parliament as they affected them.

The top court sought assistance of the Attorney General in the matter and requested him to be present on August 19.

The bench was hearing a plea by Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel challenging NCLAT's July 4 order which approved steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal's Rs 42,000 crore bid for acquiring the debt-laden firm.

The CoC has sought quashing of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order which had given financial creditors equal status with operational creditors in the distribution of the ArcelorMittal's bid amount.

The top court on Wednesday gave a week to the operational creditors to file a writ petition challenging the new amendments to IBC and sought assistance of Attorney General K K Venugopal in the case.

""During the course of hearing, we have been apprised of the fact that amendments to the IBC have been passed by both houses of the Parliament. Counsel for respondents (operational creditors) take umbrage to some of these amendments and they want to challenge them by way of writ petition,"" the bench said.

""We request the attorney general to be present on the next day of hearing,"" it said and ordered the listing of Essar matter on August 19 along with the writ petitions to be filed within a week.

At the outset, the bench observed that the new amendments passed by Parliament may have some bearing in the case and said that it would be better if the matter is heard after some time.

When some counsels said that the new amendments may affect the interest of operational creditors in the case, the bench said it is of the prima facie view that operational creditors cannot be simply asked to go home.

The counsels for operational creditors of Essar said that they may challenge the new amendments, to which the bench said that they should file the writ petitions challenging the same within a week.

On August 1, Parliament had approved changes in the three-year old IBC providing greater clarity over distribution of proceeds of the auction of loan defaulting companies, with the Lok Sabha passing the Bill with voice vote.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill 2019 gives CoC of the loan defaulting company explicit authority over the distribution of proceeds in the resolution process and fixes a firm timeline of 330 days for resolving cases referred to the IBC.

Among others, the approved resolution plan would be binding on central and state governments as well as various statutory authorities.

On July 22, the top court had put on hold the sale of Essar Steel to ArcelorMittal as it agreed to hear the appeal filed by lenders against the NCLAT order, saying it would like to settle the issue ""once and for all"".

The top court had said that the monitoring committee will continue to manage the company.

""Once the Committee of Creditors in their concerned wisdom had decided on division of assets, there should have been no re-distribution, like you are an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP). We would settle this issue once and for all,"" the bench had observed at the outset.

Essar Steel was auctioned under the new IBC to recover Rs 54,547 crore of unpaid dues of financial lenders and operational creditors.

In its July 4 order, the NCLAT had said that financial creditors will get 60.7 per cent of their admitted claims of Rs 49,473 crore, almost same as operational creditors.

The operational creditors with admitted claim amount of less than Rs 1 crore would get 100 per cent, while above Rs 1 crore would get 60.26 per cent and workmen and employees would get 100 per cent.

13,2019-08-08,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: If it goes through, it may turn out to be the mother of all public asset sales – Rs 3 lakh crore of proceeds by monetising public sector transmission lines, telecom towers, gas pipelines, airports and, as ET had earlier reported, land parcels.

Government think tank , after consultation with many ministries, has drawn up a list of assets that can be sold including electricity transmission lines of Power Grid, towers of BSNL & MTNL, pipelines of Gail India Ltd, airports in some cities and prime real estate owned by central public sector enterprises. CPSEs in the Niti list that have monetisable land assets include National Textile Corporation, Hindustan Antibiotics and NTPC.

“The idea is to push CPSEs to monetise their existing assets and use the proceeds to fund greenfield assets,” a government official said.

Unspent Proceeds to go to Govt
The official added that if CPSEs are unable to use the proceeds towards capital expenditure it will flow to the government through dividends or other routes. The official spoke off record.

“Towers of BSNL & MTNL can be further leased out, or in some cases sold outright,” said the above quoted official adding that the pipeline business of GAIL can be demerged from the parent company and given on long term lease or completely sold off depending on buyer interest.



BSNL and MTNL have already rented out 13,051 and 392 mobile tower sites, respectively, to private telecom service providers. Powergrid owns and operates about 1,45,400 circuit kms of transmission lines, GAIL owns over 11,500-km of natural gas pipelines in the country.

In March 2019, Canadian fund Brookfield had bought 1,400 km of pipeline owned by Reliance Industries for Rs 14,000 crore.

The department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) has already issued expression of interest for appointing consultants who will provide transaction advisory services for monetisation of land assets.

“Land assets can also be monetised through Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) route. Already, firms such as Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers International have expressed their interest,” said another official aware of the developments. He, too, spoke off record.

There will be increased focus on strategic sales as well this year as the government has the mandate to bring down its holding in select public sector firms to below 51%. The government has set a disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in 2019-20.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the central government will be open to bringing down its stake below 51% in a government-owned company provided the combined stake of the government and government-owned agencies stays above that threshold. Already, there is ‘inprinciple’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 23 central public sector enterprises (CPSEs)."

23,2019-08-13,GAIL,"Mumbai: The recent decline in the markets has brought down the valuations of country’s largest stocks with a majority of them trading at a discount to their longterm valuations.

Over half of the Nifty50 stocks are currently trading at a discount compared to their 10-year average price to earnings (P/E) ratio — a popular valuation measure. Also, 32 are trading at a discount to their 10-year average price to book (P/B) ratio — a valuation ratio based on a company’s assets, data showed.

But, Nifty is trading above its 10-year average P/E ratio. According to data compiled by brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities, the Nifty is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 18.2 times against tenyear average of 17.9. It’s P/B multiple, however, is in line with the 10-year average of 2.6.

The trend indicates the broader weakness amongst India’s top 50 stocks that has not been captured at the index level.

“The movement in the Nifty during the last few years has largely been driven by a handful of stocks,” said Gaurav Dua, head-capital market strategy, Sharekhan. These include HDFC, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, TCS and Infosys. “This skewed rally of select few stocks has led to a situation where majority of the Nifty stocks are now trading at lower valuations while a few stocks continue to command premiums.”

While Nifty has fallen 8 per cent from its January peaks, some of the stocks have witnessed much steeper falls. For instance, Yes Bank shares have lost over 50 per cent since the beginning of the year while Maruti Suzuki is down 25 per cent.

State-owned entities lead the pack of stocks that are trading at a discount to their long-term price to earnings. ONGC is currently trading at 51 per cent discount to its 10-year P/E ratio while Bharat Petroleum and GAIL are trading at discounts of 27 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively.


Auto stocks, too, are trading at deep discounts with companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra and Hero MotoCorp trading over 15 per cent lower than their average price to earnings. The sector has been impacted by slowdown in demand leading to a slump in sales of both two and four wheelers.

At the P/B level, IndusInd Bank is trading 12 per cent lower than its longterm average while Indiabulls Housing Finance is at a 47 per cent discount.

“The sell-off is happening across the market expect for those handful stocks where bulk of the mutual fund money is going,” said G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.

“There are several concerns like slowdown in demand, lacklustre earnings and uncertainty about monsoon and hence investors are turning cautious.”"
22,2019-08-13,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is planning to introduce a wave of reforms in the natural gas sector, aimed at l ocal discovery of prices and development of a national gas market.

The oil ministry has prepared a Cabinet note that proposes snapping the power sector’s priority access to cheap local gas, setting up a gas trading platform to encourage market-discovery of prices, and hive off GAIL’s transportation unit to enhance thirdparty access to its pipelines.
At present, India produces just half of the gas it consumes, a government setformula determines rates for most local gas, and the absence of market price deters producers from investing in the country. By allowing marketing freedom to gas from new discoveries, the government has tried to address much of the investors’ concerns in recent years but officials think developing a free market was essential to sustained investment in the sector.

Which is why the government wants to build a gas trading platform that can facilitate market discovery of prices. A gas exchange will enhance trade transparency, boost consumer confidence, and increase market opportunities for suppliers, officials said.



“But an exchange can work only if we have enough domestic gas to trade. Most of the gas is already allocated to priority consumers. We need to free up some gas,” an official said. Official guidelines bind producers to supply their output to certain consumers, mostly at rates based on a government-set formula.

The oil ministry has, therefore, proposed to knock off the power sector, the biggest consumer of local gas, from the so-called priority list. It has proposed limiting the allocation to city gas (CNG vehicles and households) and the fertiliser sector, an official said.

The power sector consumes about 31% of the local gas while the fertiliser and city gas sectors consume 24% and 22%, respectively.

The proposal is likely to meet a fierce opposition by the power ministry and generators. India has 25,000 MW of gas-based plants in a total generation capacity of 356,000 MW."

25,2019-08-13,GAIL,"Increasing talks over attractive valuation of mid-sized companies and extremely stable performance of large-sized companies provide a strong basis for investments in schemes which invest in both. 

Presently, the Nifty mid cap 100 is trading at 25 per cent discount to its three-year average price to earnings multiple while the Nifty 50 is trading at a premium of 8 per cent to its three-year average price to earnings multiple. Given these factors, a portfolio which offers a combination of large sized companies that would add stability and mid-sized companies which would provide alpha and add incremental returns to the portfolio makes sense in the present market conditions.

Among such schemes, Canara Robeco Emerging Equities Fund fits the bill. The scheme has long performance record which covers close to 15 years. In almost all cycles it has beaten its peers and the benchmark index by a reasonably good margin. 

In the past three-year, five-year and ten-year periods, the scheme has given returns of 9 per cent, 15 per cent and 19.4 per cent returns, respectively, while its peers have given average return of 6 per cent, 10 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, over the same periods.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers Krishna Sanghvi and Nitish Gandhi have constructed a portfolio which has companies which are both value and growth buys. Besides, these companies offer stability in current phase of volatile markets. A few prominent companies are ITC, PoweGrid and ICICI Prudential Life. 

Investors can consider the scheme with a horizon of at least five years.

Canara Robeco Emerging Equities Fund has built an excellent long-term track record over the years. It has a highly diversified portfolio of 60 plus stocks, but due to its high beta resulting in volatility over shorter time periods, it is ideally suited for investors with aggressive risk tolerance and are willing to invest with a 7-10 year view through SIPs or STPs."

30,2019-08-13,GAIL,"New Delhi: A collapse in global liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices is fuelling demand at home for reworking the government-set price ceiling for gas from difficult terrains to cut high domestic rates in line with global prices, a move that could cap gains for producers such as ONGC and Reliance Industries while boosting affordability for consumers.

The price ceiling for gas from difficult fields today stands at $9.32 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) while the domestic formula price, which applies to most locally-produced gas, is $3.69 per mmBtu. By comparison, the spot rates of LNG delivered to Indian shores are in the range of $3.5-$4 per mmBtu.


Agencies

Local rates, published every six months, factor in data for the trailing four quarters with one quarter lag. The next revision, due in October, will likely bring down ceiling but executives at key gas buying firms fear the fall could be small and delayed as the calculation is based on price data for a longer period. They want the government to among producers, executives at key gas buyers told ET. Such high reference points can result in unnecessary pressure on gas buyers to quote a higher price during auctions, executives said, adding that unrealistic price expectations among producers can delay sale as well as production of domestic gas.

GAIL, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and GSPC are some of the major buyers of domestic and imported gas in India.

So far, ONGC is the only beneficiary of higher rates for gas from difficult terrains.

And the two buyers of its gas, GAIL and GSPC, are paying about $8 per mmBtu currently for its gas, according to sources, much higher than the spot LNG rates. ONGC has more supplies lined up for next year while Reliance too plans to produce gas from its deep sea fields early next year, for which bids are likely to be invited later this year. Vedanta also enjoys pricing freedom for its gas even though its Barmer field is not a difficult field. It is currently engaged in pricing negotiations with GAIL.

Local producers often cite expensive long-term LNG deal with Qatar to seek a higher price. “Domestic producers want their gas to be benchmarked to Qatar deal and not spot rates, which is unfair. They must realise that the global gas market has totally changed and the LNG market is oversupplied and would remain so for years,” said an executive. Indian buyer pays Qatar $9 per mmBtu under the longterm deal that was renegotiated in 2015 and yet looks expensive today.

Price ceiling has risen 40% since April-September 2016, when it was introduced, while the domestic formula price is up 20%."

32,2019-08-14,GAIL,"Asset under management of the mutual fund industry inched higher to Rs 24.53 lakh crore in July despite a harsh selloff in the domestic equity market, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed. Total AUM stood at Rs 24.25 lakh crore in June. 

Investors’ mutual fund portfolios suffered a dent after the Union Budget 2019 slapped a surcharge in the high income-tax bracket that hit foreign portfolio investors (FPI). In response, FPIs, who had poured in around Rs 80,000 crore during February-June, offloaded stocks worth more than Rs 12,000 crore in July itself.

Even the bluest of blue chips like Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank cracked up to 8 per cent during the month. The BSE Sensex dipped around 5 per cent, while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined 8 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.

37,2019-08-17,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the red, following mixed macroeconomic data amid fears of a global economic slowdown. 

The 30-share Sensex shed 231 points, or 0.62 per cent, to end at 37,350 for the week ended August 16. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty lost 61.85 points, or 0.56 per cent, to end at 11,047.

The market kicked off the week on a bleak note on Tuesday as sentiment got hit after government data showed that India’s factory output growth, as measured by IIP, slowed down for the second straight month to 2 per cent in June compared with 7 per cent in June, 2018 and 3.1 per cent in May, 2019. 

However, the market pared some of the losses in the remaining two days of trade amid hope of a stimulus package for the economy from the government. Investors also took comfort as India’s retail inflation based on CPI eased to 3.15 per cent in July, 2019 from 3.18 per cent in June, 2019 and 4.17 per cent in July, 2018. WPI inflation also eased to a multi-year low of 1.08 per cent in the month of July, on account of cheaper fuel and food items. 

Meanwhile, trade deficit, the gap between imports and exports, narrowed to $13.43 billion in July from $18.63 billion a year ago, helped by a lower oil import bill.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the week. 


Stars of the week
Reliance Industries (RIL) advanced 10 per cent after Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) with Saudi Aramco to sell a 20 per cent stake in the oil-to-chemicals business.

40,2019-08-20,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: An appellate tribunal on Monday dismissed appeals by some creditors of steelmaker Monnet Ispat & Energy against a Rs 2,875-crore resolution plan offered by AION Investments and JSW Steel.

The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved the proposal last year. Operational creditors Bharat Heavy Electricals, GAIL India and Bharat PetroResources, and financial creditor IFCI had alleged discriminatory treatment under the resolution plan.

Under the AION-JSW Steel resolution plan, operational creditors are entitled to Rs 25 crore against their total admitted claims of about Rs 450 crore.

IFCI had claimed that the plan discriminated against it relative to other financial creditors. IFCI had claimed that it was entitled to an additional Rs 70 crore over the Rs 95 crore that it was paid under the resolution plan, through its exclusive rights over an asset of Monnet Ispat. IFCI had a total claim of Rs 559 crore against a principal amount of Rs 250 crore.

Financial creditors got just 24% of their loans to Monnet Ispat, against which creditors had total admitted claims of around Rs 11,400 crore. JSW Steel-AION were the sole bidders for Monnet Ispat, which manufactures various steel- and Iron-based products and has a production capacity of around 1.5 million tonnes a year.

This judgement comes after recent amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, passed by Parliament in the Monsoon session, which have clarified that a committee of creditors has the right to take commercial decisions on the distribution of the proceeds of a resolution plan."

Of this, Rs 32,000 crore would go into pipeline laying and another Rs 12,000 crore in city gas distribution (CGD) networks for retailing of CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to household kitchens. Investments would also go into the expansion of petrochemical plants.

GAIL is looking to put up 400 CNG stations and give out a record 10 lakh piped natural gas (PNG) connections to household kitchens in the next 3-5 years.

It is rapidly building infrastructure to support the government push towards a gas-based economy by raising the share of natural gas in the energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 from current 6.2 per cent.

The company is building a 2,655-km gas pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal and Odisha.

""Around 1,050 km of pipeline projects along Varanasi-Dobhi-Patna/Barauni, Auraiya-Phulpur and other last-mile connectivity were completed during the 2018-19 fiscal,"" he said at the AGM.

Jagdishpur-Haldia & Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) project, also known as the 'Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga' project, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2015.

The pipeline would be extended to Guwahati by laying an additional 750-km line. At Guwahati, it would interconnect with the upcoming 1,500-km 'Indradhanush' pipeline network conceived to operate in northeast by the public sector oil and gas majors.

""Your company has recently been authorised by (regulator) PNGRB to lay the 600 km Srikakulam-Angul natural gas pipeline through the recently-concluded bidding process. This limb is expected to be an important segment of the National Gas Grid and enhance your company's coverage of natural gas markets along the eastern coast as well,"" he said.

Karnatak said the company's board has approved the utilisation of existing assets and premises of LPG plant at Usar in Maharasthra by converting it into 500,000 tonnes polypropylene complex at an investment of around Rs 8,800 crore.

""This is first of its kind project in India,"" he said, adding GAIL Board has also approved setting up of 60,000 tones polypropylene unit at the existing petrochemical facility at Pata in Uttar Pradesh.

Polypropylene is used in a variety of applications, including packaging of consumer products, plastic parts of various industries including the automotive industry, special devices like living hinges, and textiles."
43,2019-08-20,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Shell India, the local arm of the Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Shell Plc, on Tuesday exited the city gas business in the country after it sold its 10 per cent stake in Mahanagar Gas Ltd for Rs 770 crore.

According to stock exchange data, BG Asia Pacific Holdings (BGAPH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell, sold 9.98 million shares in the company through block deals at Rs 780 apiece.

Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL), where the majority stake is owned by state-owned GAIL India Ltd, sells compressed natural gas (CNG) to automobiles and piped-cooking gas to households in and around Mumbai.

When MGL was listed in July 2016, Shell and GAIL held 32.5 per cent stake each in the company. Last year, Shell sold 24 per cent of its shareholding in two tranches -- 8.5 per cent in April and 14 per cent in August -- in the open market through bulk deals.

The government of Maharashtra has 10 per cent shareholding in MGL, while the remaining is with the public.

Shell sold its stake in the open market after GAIL waived off its first right of refusal.

According to the shareholding agreement, partners had the first right to buy in case either one of them wanted to exit.

""We already have a controlling stake. What purpose would it have served to buy the additional stake at market price,"" a senior GAIL official said.

He said the sale price was ""too high"".

""It doesn't make any sense for us to buy the stake at the market price,"" he added.

When Shell first started diluting its take in MGL in April last year, the company had stated that this was ""part of Shell's ongoing portfolio optimisation to transform Shell into a simpler company, delivering stronger returns"".

""Our investment in the Hazira LNG receiving terminal in Gujarat and the recent creation of Shell Energy India, our gas marketing and trading business, shows our commitment to grow in India and to increase gas penetration in the country,"" it had said.

Shell operates a 5 million tonnes a year liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Hazira in Gujarat.

Founded in 1995, it sells CNG to over 6 lakh vehicles and piped natural gas to over 10 lakh households. It operates 203 CNG stations and has a pipeline network of 4,838 kilometers.

MGL originally was an equal joint venture of GAIL and UK's BG Group. Shell became a partner after it in February 2016 acquired BG worldwide.

Shell exercised its option to exit the city gas distribution business as the lock-in period for minimum promoter holding after listing of a company expired last month. MGL was listed in June 2016 and the three-year lock-in period, according to the market regulator's listing norms expired on July 1, 2019."

46,2019-08-22,GAIL,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."

50,2019-08-27,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government has kick-started the process of diluting its stake in state-run companies below 51% and has identified nearly a dozen firms for implementing the Budget announcement. The department of public investment and asset management (Dipam) is in the process of floating a discussion paper to consider the pros and cons of the move and thrash out a strategy for rolling out the plan that is expected to account for a significant share of this year’s target from asset sales, which has been estimated at Rs 1.05 lakh crore. 

The nearly dozen companies, which have been identified in a preliminary list, include those in which the government’s holding ranges from about 50% to 60%. Sources in the government said that Dipam will hold consultations with various ministries to try and resolve any issues linked to the stake dilution. 

They said the government wants to make sure that crucial issues such as reservation policy in PSUs need to be discussed threadbare to ensure that no controversies emerge after the stake dilution. Among the companies that may be taken up for disinvestment are IOC, NTPC, Power Grid, Oil India, GAIL, NALCO, BPCL and EIL, the sources said. 

They made it clear that no final view has been taken on the process and once the discussions are over, a Cabinet note will be floated. They also pointed out that the quantum of dilution has also not been finalised and would depend on how the discussions proceed. 

The sources also said that the government is aiming to wrap up at least two-three such cases by the third quarter of the current financial year that ends in March. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her maiden Budget speech in July, had said that the government is considering, in cases where the undertaking is still to be retained in government control, to go below 51% to an appropriate level on a case-to-case basis. She had said that the government has also decided to modify the present policy of retaining 51% government stake to retaining 51% stake inclusive of the stake of government-controlled institutions. 

In a post-Budget interview, the then Dipam secretary Atanu Chakraborty had said, “The basic understanding is that we can go below 51% on a case-to-case basis. How 51% is to be calculated also has to be stated. Government has also decided to modify present policy of retaining 51% stake inclusive of stake from government-controlled institutions. Large stake is held by public financial institutions or cross holdings, then that adds to 51% and that leaves very little float for people to come in. Now, with this the float is more.”"

55,2019-08-28,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: In only the second instance of providing funds for a gas pipeline, the government is considering shelling out about Rs 5,400 crore in viability gap funding for a proposed Northeast gas grid, officials said. The 1,656-km North-East Natural Gas Pipeline Grid will connect Guwahati in Assam to major cities in the region such as Itanagar, Dimapur, Kohima, Imphal, Aizwal, Agartala, Shillong, Silchar, Gangtok, and Numaligarh. 

However, in the absence of anchor customers, the Rs 9,000 crore pipeline is not economically viable. 

""A viability gap funding of 60 per cent of the project cost has been sought,"" an official. 

The oil ministry is supporting the proposal and it is likely to be considered by the Cabinet soon, he said. 

 The Northeast pipeline grid is to be implemented by Indradhanush Gas Grid, a joint venture of state-owned GAIL India, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL). 

 The consortium has pitched for a 60 per cent funding support from the government and would raise the rest via equity and debt, the official said. 

 Without the government support, the pipeline would not be viable.

This is a second time that a gas pipeline project in the country would be funded by the government. 

 In 2016, the government provided a capital grant of Rs 5,176 crore, or 40 per cent of the project cost, of the 2,655-km Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra (JHBDPL) gas pipeline project, which GAIL is currently executing. 

 GAIL is also laying a 750-km line from Barauni to Guwahati as part of the Rs 12,940 crore JHBDPL project, which is also known as the 'Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga' project. This is proposed to be connected to the Northeast via the Indradhanush grid. 

All other pipelines in the country have been funded by public or private sector companies. 

 The official said oil companies will not be able to execute the Northeast grid project without the viability gap funding. 

 The project is critical towards implementing the government's Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for Northeast. The Vision envisages the development of the region by leveraging its hydrocarbon potential, enhancing access to clean fuel and accelerating the growth. 

 This is a part of a broader goal of the government to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030 from current 6.2 per cent. 

 The government has envisaged developing the National Gas Grid. At present, about 16,788 km natural gas pipeline is operational and about 14,239 km gas pipelines are being developed to increase the availability of natural gas across the country."

The US-based company, which was founded by former NASA scientist K R Sridhar, said it could generate and distribute electricity for domestic use at “grid parity”, given the government supports by making policies, bringing natural gas under Goods and Services Tax (GST) etc. 

Bloom Energy Server generates power through an electro-chemical process that can operate using natural gas, biogas from landfills, food or animal waste, or hydrogen as fuel. The company counts technology giants such as Google, Walmart, E-Bay globally and has installed capacity for electricity generation for chipmaker Intel in Bengaluru. 

Bloom Energy currently uses natural gas supplied by Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) here and has installed another capacity at an upcoming commercial space in Bengaluru. 

Venkat Venkataraman, chief technology officer, Bloom Energy, said providing a GST concession for fuel cells would help boost industries to adopt such non-polluting source of energy; while exemption of customs duty on equipment to set up capacities could encourage more use of fuel-cell based energy. 

While policy support and initiatives for cost reduction would play a key role; pushing fuel-cell based power generation should mean a huge gain for environmental sustainability, said B C Tripathi, former chairman and managing director, GAIL."

The transmission segment is likely to remain the major contributor to Ebidta (>35% share), with volumes estimated to grow to ~117mmscmd in FY21. The stock trades attractively at 8.6 times FY21E EPS of Rs 14.9 and PBV of 1.1 times FY21En BV of Rs 117. It maintains a strong dividend payout of ~37%, yielding 3.6% per share. We value GAIL at 8 times FY21E EPS adjusted for other income and then add value of investments. With a target price of Rs 150, we reiterate a 'buy' rating on the stock,"" the brokerage said."

Where are We? The Nifty closed the week at 11,023 with gains of 1.79% and formed ‘Doji candle’ on weekly chart, suggesting indecision in the markets. The Nifty Bank index closed the week at 27,428 with gains of 1.74% and has also formed ‘Doji candle’ on weekly chart.


What is in Store
? Technically, on weekly chart, the Nifty is back in rising channel pattern after giving a breakdown last week and current prices are hovering near the lower band of the channel suggesting if it holds to manage 10,750 zone we may see a northward move towards 11,200 in the near term. On derivative front, the highest open interest concentration is witnessed at 10,800 PE strike followed by 11,000 strike and on higher side highest open interest is at 11,700 CE strike followed by 11,200 CE strike hinting broader range for the Nifty could be 10,800-11,200 in the near term.


What should Investors Do? The Nifty has corrected 9% so far from the recent highs and the index has good support near the 10,750-10,700 zone. And if it manages to hold the said levels, it can see a good bounce in the nearterm suggesting investor can use the ‘buy on dip’ strategy. Some of the technical picks where investor can catch dips for 10-15% upsides in the short term with keeping stop out levels below 5-7% from the current levels are GAIL, Exide Industries, JB Chemicals, Kansai Nerolac and Bharat Electronics Limited."

Investment Rationale

The completion of three fertiliser plants along the Jagdishpur-HaldiaBokaro-Dhamra pipeline (JHBDPL), combined with the contribution from Matix Fertilizer startup and Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCFL) conversion, is likely to de-risk ~60% of total US Henry Hub (HH) contracts, said Motilal Oswal.

0,2019-09-03,GAIL,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Tuesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 4 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

1. Edelweiss has maintained hold rating on 
Cummins India with a target price of Rs 670. The brokerage said it remains optimistic on growth in the domestic market, challenges pertaining to scale up of operating margin persist given sluggish exports and the company’s focus on maintaining market share. Shares of Cummins ended up 0.5 per cent at Rs 573.65 on Friday.

2. Motilal Oswal has a buy rating on 
GAIL India with a target price of Rs 50. The completion of three fertiliser plants along the Jagdishpur-HaldiaBokaro-Dhamra pipeline (JHBDPL), combined with the contribution from Matix Fertilizer startup and Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCFL) conversion, is likely to de-risk ~60 per cent of total US Henry Hub (HH) contracts, said Motilal Oswal. The brokerage said the stock presents an attractive investment opportunity as it is trading at a discount of around 40 per cent to long term one-year forward PE of 14 times. Shares of GAIL India ended up 0.9 per cent at Rs 129.65 on Friday.


3. Ambit has initiated coverage on 
Metropolis Healthcare with a target price of Rs 1168. Metropolis is building a DLPL-like moat in West India by milking its reputation and test range through deepening customer reach, said Ambit. With weakening competition and scope for market share gains in West, 16 per cent revenue CAGR is doable over FY19-22 despite smaller addressable market and higher PE inflow, said Ambit. Shares of Metropolis Healthcare ended up 8.9 per cent at Rs 1162.20 on Friday.

4. IIFL has maintained buy rating on 
Somany Ceramics with a target price of Rs 363. The management indicated that unprecedented demand tightness in the market since a few weeks which it attributed to weak sentiment in the economy and severe floods across the country over the past 2-3 weeks, said IIFL. Given declining footfalls at the retailer-end, achieving double-digit volume growth for FY20 looks tough, as per management, the brokerage said. Shares of Somany Ceramics ended down 0.2 per cent at Rs 289.30 on Friday.

5. HSBC has maintained hold rating on 
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries with a target price of Rs 400 after reports of clearance by Sebiin securities law allegations. Sebi clearance for alleged irregularities removes a large overhang for Sun but the positives are now largely priced in as the company had implemented most of measures, said HSBC. It will be a gradual process for Sun to fully regain investor confidence on its record of lending to third parties (often with insufficient details), its unusual tax-efficient structure, and so on, said HSBC. Shares of Sun Pharma ended up 3.68 per cent at Rs 450.65 on Friday."
6,2019-09-04,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday at their annual summit decided to widen their trade, investment, energy and ICT partnership including five year roadmap for hydro-carbon sector comprising joint development of oil and gas fields in Russia and India, including offshore fields. 

The two sides expressed satisfaction with the stable mutual growth of trade turnover. To bring it to $ 30 billion by 2025, they agreed to more actively engage the impressive resource and human resources potential of India and Russia, enhance industrial cooperation, create new technological and investment partnership, especially in advanced high-tech areas and find new avenues and forms of cooperation.

Both Sides expressed their interest in expanding the participation of Russian business in ”Make in India“ program and that of Indian companies in investment projects in Russia. In this context, they agreed to speed up preparations for signing of the India-Russia Intergovernmental Agreement on Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments.

The Sides agreed to intensify joint work towards eliminating barriers in mutual trade, including protective measures, customs and administrative barriers, to further consider reducing restrictive measures through bilateral dialogue.

The energy industry has traditionally been a key area of interaction between the two countries – this is an area where Indian and Russian economies complement each other beneficially. Civil nuclear cooperation between India and Russia is an important component of strategic partnership. The Sides noted the pace of progress achieved in the construction of the remaining four of the six nuclear power plants at Kudankulam. Both Sides engaged in discussion on the second site and welcomed continuation of technical discussions on the VVER 1200 of the Russian design and joint manufacturing of equipment and fuel.

The two sides highlighted successful cooperation in the construction of the Rooppur NPP in Bangladesh and expressed their readiness to expand similar cooperation in third countries.

The leaders noted immense potential of cooperation in the field of non-nuclear fuel and energy. India and Russia welcome the success of interaction between Rosneft Oil Company and Consortium of Oil and Gas Public Sector Undertakings in implementing the Vankorneft and Taas-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha projects, the work of the Nayara Energy Limited oil refinery, cooperation in extracting hydrocarbon resources over the last two decades as well as the timely delivery of liquefied natural gas under the agreement between Gazprom and GAIL India. The Sides agreed to cooperate in supply of coking coal from Russian Far East to India.

The leaders are determined to forge cooperation in geological exploration and joint development of oil and gas fields in Russia and India, including offshore fields. They will continue their work to develop the ways of delivering energy resources from Russia to India, including a long-term agreement for sourcing Russian crude oil, the possible use of the Northern Sea Route and a pipeline system. They noted the prospects of Nayara Energy Limited increasing the capacity in Vadinar oil refinery. India and Russia agreed to consider the prospects for expanding cooperation in hydro and thermal power, energy efficiency as well as for designing and constructing facilities that generate energy from non-conventional sources.

With the signing of the Roadmap for cooperation in Hydrocarbons for 2019–24 during the Summit, both Sides expect bilateral cooperation in this sector to touch new heights in the next five years.

They attached high importance to cooperation in the diamond industry. The successful activity of the ALROSA office in India was noted by the Sides. They declared their interest in enhancing rough diamonds trading system and exploring ways to further improve the regulatory environment in this field with the aim of protecting the equity of natural diamonds.

The two Sides reaffirmed the commonality of approaches to provision of security in the use of ICTs and willingness to strengthen bilateral inter-agency practical cooperation through realization of the India-Russia intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in Security in the use of ICTs.

They resolved to take necessary steps to enhance bilateral cooperation in accordance with the Plan to implement the main directions of cooperation between India and Russia on the security in the use of Information and Communication Technologies for 2019–2020. Both sides stressed the need to continue efforts aimed at improving the international security environment, as well as to work consistently with a view to increasing the level of inter-state trust and strengthening global and regional stability in all its aspects as a basis for ensuring lasting peace founded on the principle of equal and indivisible security for all, while respecting the interests and concerns of all states.

They emphasized the need to establish a framework for cooperation among BRICS countries in the sphere of security in the use of ICTs, including through concluding relevant intergovernmental agreement between the association’s member-states."

7,2019-09-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The oil ministry is planning to let Vedanta freely market natural gas produced at its prolific Rajasthan block, a move that would fetch higher prices while ending any compulsion to sell gas to government nominee GAIL.

Vedanta has pricing freedom but not marketing freedom, according to the current interpretation of the production sharing contract for the Rajasthan block. But ministry officials are increasingly of the view that this interpretation may not be the best and so plan to publish a clarification, which would explicitly give Vedanta both marketing and pricing freedom, according to people familiar with the matter.

“Pricing freedom has no meaning without marketing freedom. It’s impossible for a seller to extract the best price if faced with just one buyer,” the person said. The production sharing contract offers enough scope for reinterpretation and doesn’t explicitly bar marketing freedom, he added.

The proposed decision could widen the universe of possible gas buyers for Vedanta, which would then be expected to pick a buyer in an open, transparent auction conducted at arms’ length. Such auction would throw up higher prices than what a deal with a government nominee can, the person said, adding that higher prices would also translate into increased government revenue from the block.



Last year, the government nominated GAIL as sole buyer for gas produced from Vedanta’s Rajasthan block. Executives at the two firms held several rounds of negotiations since then, but couldn’t strike a deal. This prompted Vedanta to lobby for relief from the current marketing restriction. The government is likely to announce a clarification on this shortly, people aware of the matter said.

The Rajasthan block, whose contract was extended last year until 2030, produces nearly a quarter of India’s crude oil and has begun producing natural gas in recent years. Gas production averaged 51 million standard cubic feet a day (mmscfd) in 2018-19. The target is to raise gas output to 150 mmscfd.

Pricing of locally-produced natural gas has been a contentious topic in India. Key gas consumers have been demanding change in the way gas price ceiling is calculated, so the official price cap quickly starts reflecting the international slump."
11,2019-09-06,GAIL,"Any changes in divestment or dividend policies would benefit undervalued public sector undertakings (PSUs) such as Indian Oil, BPCL, Bharat Electronics, ONGC, NTPC, Powergrid Corporation, NMDC and Petronet LNG, among others, which could offer good value to the investors, analysts said. Stocks such as Coal India, Hindustan Copper, ONGC, BPCL, National Aluminium and Indian Oil rallied up to 10 per cent intraday on Thursday over news the government is likely to sell stake in state-owned companies through strategic divestments instead of an offer-for-sale or exchange traded funds (ETFs).

The multiple offerings of CPSE ETF over the past one year has acted as a key overhang for some PSU stocks, which remained flattish during this period. BSE PSU plunged 18 per cent in the last one year against 3.5 per cent decline of the Sensex.

“The news of a possible rethink on selling of government stake at the present low valuations have come as a relief to public sector companies that are anyway trading at attractive valuations,” said Gaurav Dua, senior VP, head, capital market strategy, Sharekhan. “Within the PSU basket, we prefer Bharat Electronics, ONGC, NTPC, Powergrid Corporation and Petronet LNG.”



In the past, public sector companies have grossly underperformed due to the hangover of additional supply of paper by the government to raise resources. Lately, the government also resorted to transfer of its holdings to cash-rich companies or via regular cash transfer by way of dividend payouts.

Stocks such as Steel Authority of India, National Aluminium, BHEL, Gail and Coal India have declined between 20 per cent and 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.

“The government’s current stance of not willing to sell at distress valuations is a significant positive and that has been the reason for the interest in state-run stocks,” said Naveen Kulkarni, head of research, Reliance Securities. “PSU companies have seen consistent declines because of lots of supply from the government.” Stocks such as Ircon International, REC, Hindustan Aeronautics, NTPC and Engineers India currently offer an attractive dividend yield between 4 per cent and 10 per cent. A few of them like NMDC, ONGC, BHEL, National Aluminium and Oil India are trading at their book value.

“Some of the PSUs with sound fundamentals can offer good trading opportunities for the midterm if government changes its divestment and dividend policies,” said Asutosh Mishra, head of research, institutions, Ashika Stock Broking. “Stocks such as HPCL, BPCL, Indian Oil, NMDC, among others, with clear earnings visibility are currently available at discounted valuations.”

In her budget speech on July 5, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would continue with strategic disinvestment of select central public sector enterprises. The government has raised the divestment target for financial year 2020 to Rs 1.05 lakh crore from Rs 90,000 crore earlier."
12,2019-09-06,GAIL,"Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities Limited has a buy call on GAIL (India) Ltd. with a target price of Rs 137.

13,2019-09-06,GAIL,"Prabhudas Lilladher has given a buy rating on Bharat Petroleum Corporation with a price target of Rs 466.“We believe divestment of BPCL to private sector will help maximise revenue for the government (Rs 84,700 crore). Divestment to IOCL will create a behemoth although it is unlikely to alter market dynamics in the near term. While divestment to IOCL is the easy way out, real price discovery of BPCL will happen with stake sale to foreign/private players. Sale to IOCL will attract reasonable premium as HPCL transaction was done at ~18% premium. However, stake sale to any private/foreign major can value BPCL at Rs 800 per share and unlock value,” the brokerage said.


BPCL stake sale will also remove the divestment overhang plaguing the PSUs. “We tweak our estimates post annual report updation and other changes. We remain constructive on OMCs as they are well placed to benefit from benign crude oil prices and GRM improvement from IMO 2020 implementation. “We reiterate a ‘buy’ rating on the stock,” the brokerage said.
Media reports suggests that the government is looking to divest its 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL to IOCL or even private players. BPCL is the second largest oil marketing company (OMC) after IOCL and is one of the best managed PSU with presence across refining (33.2 MTPA or 13 per cent of Indian refining), fuel retailing (14,977 stations or 23 per cent of total outlets), E&P stakes in Mozambique, Brazil, Russia etc along with City Gas Distribution (CGD) stake in 17 Geographical Areas. Besides, BPCL is one of the promoters of IGL, Petronet etc.


Scenario 1- BPCL + IOCL-an energy behemoth


The merger of BPCL with IOCL will create an energy behemoth with disproportionate share in the Indian energy market across refining, fuel retailing and City Gas Distribution (CGD) players. This will be an easiest way out for the government to raise money to meet part of their divestment target of Rs 1 lakh crore. However, such high share might invite attention of the Competition Commission as this run contrary to government intention to bring in more competition in fuel retailing and reduce fuel prices.
Synergy in refining and product sourcing


In terms of synergy, there is lot of overlap in fuel retailing business and major savings can be achieved by way of coordinated marketing plans. However, in refining, while IOCL is predominantly strong in North and East India and has stake in Chennai Petroleum (11.5MTPA), BPCL is a sizeable player in high growth West and South India.


BPCL also has 50% stake in Central India based Bina refinery (7.8MTPA) and 62% stake in Northeast-based Numaligarh refinery (3MTPA). Crude sourcing is another area where there is immense scope for cooperation.
Funding the acquisition not a concern


Funding the BPCL stake by IOC will not be a major concern, as IOC's net debt to equity stands comfortable at 0.55 times. Besides, IOCL also holds value accretive stakes in ONGC, GAIL and OIL India (current value Rs137bn). In addition, BPCL has a much better earnings profile with ROEs of >20% vis-à-vis 15% for IOCL.
Scenario 2: Stake sale to private/foreign players- real value unlocking


BPCL stake sale to private/foreign players will help unlock the real value of the company and help realize government strategy to bring competition in fuel retailing and break the hegemony of the OMCs, which has over 90% market share. Post sale, share of private/foreign players in fuel retailing will increase to ~33% from current 10%.
BPCL's well-laid pipeline infrastructure and oil terminals across India can be used by the entrant to significantly scale up operations in a competitive landscape. India is one of the largest growth markets and players will be ready to pay significant premium to get a share in this pie."
14,2019-09-06,GAIL,"Shares of BPCL fell for the first time in 10 sessions amid reports that the government is mulling divesting 53.29 per cent stake in the company to IOC or even private players.

Such a divestment to IOCL will create a behemoth, although it is unlikely to alter market dynamics in the near term, said brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher (PL).

In case of merger of BPCL with IOCL, “Funding the BPCL stake by IOC will not be a major concern, as IOC's net debt-to-equity stands comfortable at 0.55 times. Besides, IOC also holds value accretive stakes in ONGC, GAIL and OIL India. But BPCL has a much better earnings profile with ROEs of over 20 per cent vis-à-vis 15 per cent for IOCL,” PL said.

The brokerage said that the stake sale to private foreign players will help unlock the real value of the company and help realise government strategy to bring competition in fuel retailing and break the hegemony of the OMCs. Post sale, share of private players in fuel retailing will increase to 33 per cent from current 10 per cent, PL said."
15,2019-09-08,GAIL,"Reliance Industries is seeking a minimum price of USD 5.4 per unit for the natural gas it plans to produce from newer fields in the Bay of Bengal block KG-D6 as it changed parameters to suit government policies.

Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK have sought bids from potential users for the 5 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from second quarter of 2020, according to the bid document.

Bidders have been asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.

It set a floor or minimum quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price -- which means bidders would have to quote 9 or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.

At USD 60 per barrel price, the gas price comes to USD 5.4 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu). E-bidding would happen on October 10, the bid document said.

The rate compares to the government mandated USD 3.69 rate that its currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in KG-D6 block are getting.

The government gas pricing policy however provides for a higher cap price for future gas produced from difficult fields like those in deepsea. This cap currently is fixed at USD 9.32 per mmBtu. Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites and MJ by 2022.

The document said the gas price would be lower of the quoted rate or the government mandated ceiling for the difficult fields. The formula Reliance is using to price gas for R-Series fields is different from its last price discovery it made for the coal seam gas (CBM) from its Sohagpur coal-bed methane blocks in Madhya Pradesh.

For Sohagpur CBM, it had in 2012 sought bids at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.

The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.

At USD 60 per barrel oil price, CBM from its Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 7.8. That formula was, however, rejected by the oil ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.

It in 2017 changed the formula by seeking bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document of CBM pricing.

Reliance ended up buying the CBM gas from its block after it bid deducting USD 1.836 per mmBtu, lower than USD 3.156 bid by rival Piramal Glass and USD 3.495 bid by state-owned GAIL."
16,2019-09-08,GAIL,"The ED has filed a criminal case to probe money laundering charges in an alleged corruption case involving London-based Rolls Royce that is said to have made a payment of over Rs 77 crore as commission to an agent to win contracts from PSUs HAL, ONCG and GAIL during 2007-11, officials said on Sunday.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has booked the case under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after going through a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR, which was registered in the case in July this year, they said.

Rolls Royce and its Indian subsidiary, Singapore-based Ashok Patni and his company Aashmore Pvt Ltd, and Mumbai-based Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd, besides unidentified officials of public sector units (PSUs) Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and GAIL were booked by the CBI for criminal conspiracy and bribery.

The CBI complaint alleged that the total business of HAL with Rolls Royce was around Rs 4,700 crore between 2000 to 2013.

It is alleged that Rolls Royce paid Rs 18 crore to Patni as ""commercial advisor"" in the 100 supply orders of Avon and Allison engines' spare parts to HAL between 2007-11, the bureau's FIR stated.

The CBI action came after a five-year-long inquiry conducted by it. The inquiry was initiated on the basis of a complaint from the defence ministry that had received a letter about the engagement of Patni and his company by Rolls Royce.

The ED will probe if these alleged corrupt practices led to the generation of slush funds which were laundered to create personal assets, the officials said.

It will also investigate if the integrity pact was violated and kick backs were generated, they said.

Rollys Royce, after registration of the CBI case, had said it will not tolerate business misconduct of any sort and it is committed to maintain high ethical standards.

""No one currently working for Rolls-Royce in India played any part in these energy deals.

""India is an important market for Rolls-Royce and the company has a valued workforce of skilled people in the country,"" a company spokesperson had said.

The CBI has charged that Patni was also engaged in direct contracts of Rolls Royce with ONGC and GAIL for the supply of spare parts.

Although contracts with ONGC and GAIL allowed services of an agent but it was mandatory to declare the name at the time of bidding, a condition violated by Rolls Royce, it said.

The company declared the name of its agent to the oil and gas sector behemoths in 2013, CBI alleged.

It is alleged that Roll Royce paid Rs 29.81 crore in 73 purchase orders from 2007 to 2011 for procurement of material and spare parts pertaining to the engines for ONGC, but the company declared it in 2013, it said.

Roll Royce also paid one million British pounds with regard to 68 purchase orders from GAIL for spare parts from 2007 to 2010, it said.

The company entered in an arrangement with Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd and another company, Infinity, also owned by Patni, to which extra commission was paid, but not declared to GAIL, the CBI said.

The total commission paid by Rolls Royce comes to the tune of Rs 28.09 crore during the period 2007-10 for supplies to GAIL, it alleged.

There was an alleged conspiracy by Rolls Royce Plc and its subsidiary Rolls Royce India Pvt Ltd to misrepresent the facts before HAL regarding the engagement of the agent in order to win contracts with the public sector unit with ""deception"", it said.

The Indian Marine Gas Turbine unit of the HAL provides support in areas of inspection, spare parts, maintenance, equipment overhaul and assembly for industrial and marine gas turbines under licence from reputed manufactures.

The unit provides overhaul and repair of Avon and Allison engines for ONGC and GAIL for which spare parts are supplied by the energy division of Rolls Royce, it said.

The contract between Rolls Royce Power Engineering Plc and HAL was signed in June 2007, which was valid till December 2011, to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services for units owned by the GAIL and ONGC under above licence from Rolls Royce.

""The purchase order condition specifically mentioned that Rolls Royce is not supposed to appoint any agent in India to promote this contract and no commission is payable to such agent,"" the CBI FIR has alleged.

It is alleged that Rolls Royce violated the condition of purchase order and integrity pact by engaging Patni and his company as commercial advisor from 2007 to 2011, and paid a commission ranging from 10 per cent to 11.3 per cent for supply of spare parts for the Avon and Allison engines.

The commission amount comes to the tune of Rs 18.32 crore during the period from 2007 to 2011 for the 100 purchase order, the CBI FIR alleged."

19,2019-09-11,GAIL,"In 30 years, I have not seen so much of pessimism and capitulation in a lot of midcaps. The midcaps can rally two, three, four times in the next two years, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice-President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


We are expecting a little bit of momentum to continue after about four days of gains but I am not sure if one should read too deeply into that. It could just be a momentary momentum. How are you reading into the markets right now?We have been contrarian and we tried to explain to investors to use these 12 weeks of volatility to add to the portfolio and not let the underlying fear or rhetoric deter you from continuing your SIPs. We think the worst of the storm may be over. The 5% headline GDP this is being priced in. We know the slowdown effects of it but we think the government’s measures in transmission of lower cost of money is going to be the silver lining over the next few months. We are very positive on the festive season, we think the return of the consumer is imminent and globally we think that risk on trade is back. US bond yields have spurted sharply which tells you that risk-on trade is back globally. Sticking my neck out, I would say this Diwali closer to 12,000 would be my key, which means almost a 1,000-point rally in the next two months.


Which sector do you think would be the leader, taking us to those fresh highs?Banks first. Look at the news around you, look at the pessimism, look at the yields. There was too much negative pessimism on the mergers also. So banks, industrials, select energy, select construction and consumption stocks all will be adding. But IT would be a market performer. Even the rupee may be stronger in the next two months. Midcaps, which have been the missing link, should start to see a huge uptick in the next two-three months. In fact. 2020 will actually belong to midcaps given the decimation and the sheer market cap discount to largecaps.


Anything from the broader arena that has caught your eye of late?If I stick my neck out, I would say the CPSE ETF is looking extremely good for a longer term view. The select PSU stocks I could name would be REC, PFC, IGL, BEL, MGL, GAIL, NBCC. These are looking extremely positive with a three to five year view and hence the CPSE ETF actually captures them all. 

Insurance is a theme which we spotted out six-nine months back and that has played out brilliantly. 

On the largecaps, it would be UltraTech, Reliance, IndusInd Bank, Axis and Sun Pharma along with L&T which could stand out and on midcaps, cement would be one of the better beneficiaries with Ambuja Cement, Ashok Leyland, Federal Bank, IDFC First and Lupin looking very good on a slightly longer term. 

Again my recommendation in the last 12 weeks would be that a SIP should be in place. We are six to seven weeks away from that and we have four-five weeks to go. As a disclosure, these SIPs will play out very well over the next five weeks where volatility again will be your friend, if you are invested in it.


Why is there a renewed optimism on MCX? Is there a fundamental reason attached to it?In 30 years, I have not seen so much of pessimism and capitulation in a lot of midcaps. The midcaps can rally two, three, four times in the next two years. We have your conviction but stay put with those ideas and do not get deterred by the market rhetoric. The same is the case with MCX. The next five, seven, 10 years look to be very positive on equity asset or a SIP or investing and owning shares which means the underlying fundamental providers will definitely do well. 

Same could be the case with MCX. 


What is your take on NBCC and NCC which have seen a fair amount of beating in the last three months? Do you think these stocks can be bought after the recent decline?A disclosure, we own both those stocks. We still have conviction that these are not three-month or six-month view stocks. Rather these are two, three, five-year stocks. You are seeing the type of order inflow which NBCC as a whole has from tier one, tier two, tier three cities; it is a debt-free company and the only problem has been the execution and the change of guard. 

All rail land bank monetisation, all errand builders monetisation add up to that 8% to 12% PMS fees which they get. You cannot go wrong in this stock. In select PSUs, there has been total decimation and NBCC is one of those, But both NBCC and NCC are very good proxy playsto a revival in GDP. As a lot of monetisation of private road banks and land banks start, you cannot miss making money in these two stocks.


How dire is it going to remain for the auto pack?The headline will always be more murkier than it is made to be and on the ground level, I am definitely seeing a large release of inventory for the likes of Maruti. We know that the commercial vehicles are the ones which are the worst hit but recovery is just around the corner. This season could be a trendsetter. Fundamentals may take another two quarters for balance sheets to get start showing on the numbers but we think that going into 2020, this could be the best sector to be. 

We own three crore vehicles in a population of 130 -- less than 3%. In case of China, it is close to 11%. Tthere is a whole host of upsides which can come not regarding the reasons and the causes which are always there. Aspirations drive this and we think the aspiration level will soon return as is evident in the case of MG Motors and Kia where subscriptions far outstrip the demand. It is just a matter of time prices for once are in your favour as a disclosure Ashok Leyland, Maruti, M&M and TVS Motors are four stocks which are under our coverage on a SIP. We think 2020 could surprise with autos actually being one of the leading sectors.


Coming to banks, the recent move to link rates to repo rates is coming. How do you see that impacting NIMs if at all! More and more banks now falling in line post the RBI mandate. How do you see things shaping up on that front?May be there is a small decline for a quarter or so. The liability rate is going to be hurt also. State Bank has cut the rate on the fixed deposit which is telling you that the liability rates are also headed lower, which again is a silver lining given that debt money is now going to definitely see equity as a better option.

In the short run, there is going to be a marginal disruption because the borrowing rate will also be lower but that actually should be a further impetus to be passed on to the end consumers and the missing link or the mistrust of NBFCs is getting over. I would be very positive given lower rates are here to stay and because the end consumer will be a large beneficiary which will spur lending and credit growth in the next few months.


 Can the brief festive season dispel the economic doom?Well markets tend to price that in. I have been in it for 30 years. I have never seen $18 trillion hide in negative yield assets and gold at Rs 40,000 with no buyers in the Indian context. People are happier selling, which is why you are seeing a lot of job losses. It tells me that the risk-off game has been played out fully. If anything, risk-on should be the game which was evident in the rumour of Fintech buying the Yes Bank’s stake.

I am very positive that in the next few months risk-on will be back and you would not expect 5% becoming 7% growth overnight but the measures will see a lot of the return of the consumption market along with infrastructure growth, which means more jobs could be created. 

The overall despondency may have been overdone we are saying this is the cusp of a turn which in the next three-six months can bring forth very good news and 2020 would actually be one of the best years for equity markets as returns are back ended in most parts of earnings and macros.


Is it a relief at all that Blackstone is now looking to buy the rest of Indiabulls Real Estate assets?Correct. Nobody is highlighting the positives. Indiabulls is trying to disseminate the negative news flow and see that their merger with LVB goes through. They are trying to sell whatever they can to reduce their outstanding. DHFL has also been able to get a lifeline to start its existing book. GE is almost 50% paid back in the excesses which it had done and a whole host of other things are getting solved. 

So you know along with the pessimism these bright spots are getting missed out, the rhetoric will be little bit unnerving given that the market is at a cusp. But I am extremely positive with the two- month view where the market can surprise on the upside."

Cement stocks rallied on the FM’s pledge to frontload infrastructure spends, trying to get the engines of growth buzzing.

YES Bank hogged limelight amid reports that promoter Rana Kapoor was in talks with Paytm promoter Vijay Shekhar Sharma to sell a stake. ICICI Lombard tanked amid reports that 2.70 per cent equity changed hands in a block deal.

“With global cues turning favourable, buying interest emerged in the broader market across underperforming sectors such as auto, metals and others. The government’s plan to front-load capital investment in infrastructure development to support the economy boosted sentiments,” said Gaurav Dua, Senior VP and Head of Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.


We walk you through the key highlights of Wednesday’s session:

YES Bank rallies over 13%Shares of YES Bank soared over 13 per cent to Rs 71.60. Denying media reports, the lender said news related to a stake sale in the bank were speculative.

Nifty50 opened positive and headed towards the 11,080 mark in Thursday’s trade but failed to hold the gains and drifted towards 10,965 mark. It negated the formation of higher lows of last four sessions and formed an Outside Bar. It recently witnessed a 330-point recovery from 10,750 level to 11,080 level in six sessions but needs to surpass multiple hurdles at 11,111 and 11,141 levels to witness a bullish momentum. Else, the index may again get stuck in a broader trading range.

Now, the index has to cross and hold above the 11,000-11,050 zone to witness an upward move towards 11,111 and then 11,141 levels while a failure to move above it can cause it to drift below 10,950 and take it to the 10,880-10,850 zone.

27,2019-09-13,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: After a day’s breather, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty returned to winning ways on Friday led by a rally in bank, IT and energy stocks.

After meandering between gains and losses for most part of the session, indices looked up amid hopes of another rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India while signs of a thaw in US-China trade war lent further support.

Oil's decline to below the $60-mark was another factor that propped sentiment back home. The government mulling to sell a stake in BPCL to a foreign firm also boosted oil stocks.

The 30-pack Sensex jumped 281 points, or 0.76 per cent, to 37,385 with 24 of 30 constituents in the green. Nifty settled at 11,076, up 93 points or 0.85 per cent.

Global markets were already rejoicing, trading at a six-week high level, amid signs of progress in the US-China trade talks and another powerful slug of stimulus from the European Central Bank.

The US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was potentially open to an interim trade deal with China, although he stressed an ""easy"" agreement would not be possible.

RBI is expected to go for a further rate cut in the next month's monetary policy review as inflation is expected to pan out in line with the central bank's projections, experts say.

Among Sensex stocks, ICICI Bank followed by Vedanta, ONGC, Kotak Bank, SBI and Axis Bank were among the best-performing stocks while Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, HDFC Bank, YES Bank and ITC declined the most.

The BSE Smallcap index rose in line with Sensex, up 0.82 per cent while BSE Midcap gained 0.41 per cent.

BSE Oil & Gas gained the most in the sectoral space with 2.73 per cent, led by BPCL, IOC, HPCL and GAIL. Telecom and healthcare were the only sectors that ended on a weak note.

The advance-decline ratio on BSE stood at 5:3, meaning for every five stocks that traded on BSE, three advanced.

45,2019-09-16,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: India, the world's third-largest oil consumer, will not face any supply disruption after a reduction in production at its No. 2 supplier Saudi Arabia, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.

""Following the attacks on the oil stablization centres of @Saudi_Aramco, top executives of Aramco have been contacted,"" he tweeted. ""We have reviewed our overall crude oil supplies for the month of September with our OMCs. We are confident there would be no supply disruption to India. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation.""

OMCs are oil marketing companies.

A massive drone strike on the world's largest crude-processing facility operated by Saudi Arabia's Aramco has driven oil prices to their highest level in nearly four months.

The attack has knocked out over half of Saudi Arabia's production as it cut 5.7 million barrels per day or over 5 per cent of the world's supply.

India imports 83 per cent of its oil needs. Saudi Arabia is its second-biggest supplier after Iraq. It sold 40.33 million tonnes of crude oil to India in 2018-19 fiscal, when the country had imported 207.3 million tonnes of oil.

Oil prices surged the most on record on Monday, with Brent crude rising by as much as 19.5 per cent to USD 71.95 per barrel - the biggest gain in dollar terms since futures started trading in 1988.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures climbed 15.5 per cent to USD 63.34, the biggest intra-day percentage gain since June 1998.

Earlier in the day, Oil Ministry in a statement said: ""Yesterday (September 15), Saudi Aramco officials informed the Indian refiners that there would be no shortage of supplies to them. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is closely monitoring the situation in consultation with Indian refiners and Saudi Aramco.""

Officials at state-owned oil refiners said Saudi Aramco has informed that there would not be any major disruption, but has sought flexibility for switching to different grades for continuing supplies.

Wood Mackenzie VP for Refining, Chemicals an Oil Markets, Alan Gelder said, ""This attack has material implications for the oil market, as a loss of 5 million barrels per day of supplies from Saudi Arabia cannot be met for long by existing inventories and the limited spare capacity of the other OPEC+ group members. A geopolitical risk premium will return to the oil price.""

Commenting on the situation, Kotak Institutional Equities said the largest-ever disruption of crude production in Saudi Arabia may keep oil prices elevated in the near term.

""Global oil supplies may be adequately met through large inventories and strategic reserves; however, moderation in oil prices will depend on full restoration of Saudi's production, which may at least take a few weeks,"" it said, adding that any further escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East region may add to the woes.

Spike in crude prices, even if temporary, will be negative for Indian oil marketing companies and positive for upstream PSUs and GAIL, it said.

""Any further escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East region, which cannot be ruled out for now, may add to the woes of global oil supplies for now given lack of buffer from Saudi's significant spare production capacity,"" Kotak said.

Crude supplies from Iran and Venezuela have already been curtailed significantly amid sanctions from the US, it added.

Wood Mackenzie research director Vima Jayabalan said Abqaiq and Khurais are main processing centres for Saudi Arabia's Arab Extra Light and Arab Light crude oil.

""China, South Korea, Japan and India are the biggest takers in Asia, with China and Japan leading the pack at an average of 900 – 1,100 kilo barrels per day each. India could be most exposed as its reserves are the least,"" Jayabalan said.

""The impact and the next course of action will depend on the duration of the outage. Saudi Arabia has enough reserves to cover the shortfall over the next week, but if the outage extends, then filling the gap with the right type of crude quality could be a challenge. Moreover, OPEC+ output cut predominantly consists of medium and heavy sour crudes."""

42,2019-09-16,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: If drone strikes at Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities snowball into a geopolitical crisis between the US and Iran, the rally in crude oil prices may not halt anytime soon.

And that will be bad news for a host of Indian industries that use crude derivatives as inputs, from aviation to paints, tyre, oil & gas (OMCs) and auto ancillary firms, say analysts. 

On Monday, Brent futures jumped nearly 19.5 per cent to trade at $71 a barrel in Asia, clocking their biggest gains in percentage terms since 1991.

A sudden spike in oil prices is negative for oil marketeers IndianOil, BPCL and HPCL. But GAIL could see a positive impact, said Emkay Global, which added that a $65-70 a barrel range is ideal for ONGC and Oil India.

“Saudi oil facilities are now vulnerable to attacks by rebels, which would increase the geopolitical risk premium on oil prices. Saudi Arabia and its allies may also retaliate, leading to more tensions and a broader clash with Iran can be severe. The US may toughen its stance on Iran, contrary to the belief that the Iran-US standoff may have subsided after the recent resignation of US National Security Advisor John Bolton,” Emkay Global said.

Of the two facilities hit over the weekend, Abqaiq is important as it processes 7 million barrels of hard crude per day into light crude, as majority of refineries can only refine light crude and are dependent on it, said Sameer Kalra of Target Investing. 

The two facilities account for over half of Saudi production and 5 per cent of global crude supplies. Saudi officials said the fire has been controlled and production will be resumed in 48 hours, but video and satellite footages depicted a grim picture.

News that Saudi Arabia is planning to shut down about half of its output after the strike also had an impact on oil prices, said Pritam Kumar Patnaik, Head of Reliance Commodities.

In the domestic stock market, weakness was visible on oil-linked stocks; aviation firms SpiceJet and InterGlobe Aviation fell up to 5 per cent; paints stocks Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac lost up to 3 per cent and oil marketeers BPCL and HPCL tanked 5 per cent each while IOC fell 3 per cent.

""OMC and aviation stocks may come under pressure in the short term if oil prices sustain at higher levels, but sectors such as paints and tyre, which use crude derivatives, may get impacted only if the situation escalates substantially. One can wait to see if it is a one-off spike in crude oil prices,” said Sunil Jain, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Securities.

Since there is lack of oil buffer from Saudi’s significant spare production capacity, geopolitical tensions may add to global oil supply woes, said Kotak Securities. It noted that crude supplies from Iran and Venezuela have already been curtailed significantly amid sanctions from the US, while supplies from Libya and Nigeria have also shown vulnerability to disruptions in recent times.

""The spike in global crude prices, even though temporary, will be negative for downstream OMCs (BPCL, HPCL and IOCL) and Castrol. We do not rule out the possibility of moderation in marketing margins on auto fuels: a $10 a barrel rise in global crude prices may require OMCs to increase retail prices of diesel and petrol by Rs 5-6 litre in the following fortnight. A sharp jump in global crude prices may put pressure on refining margins. On the other hand, higher crude prices may be positive for upstream PSUs and GAIL,"" the brokerage said.

“The immediate range for Nymex crude will be $56 to $63 a barrel, but with the US accusing Iran of orchestrating the attack and Iran in turn threatening war, oil prices are expected to remain firm,"" Patnaik said.

For a country like India which meets 80 per cent of its oil demand through imports, any further rise in crude prices may have an impact on government finances.

Every $10 a barrel rise in crude oil prices expands India’s current account deficit (CAD) by 0.4 per cent of GDP. Every 10 per cent increase in crude oil prices can push up the inflation rate by 20 basis points.

Besides, a rise in crude oil prices can increase dollar demand, hurting the rupee-dollar exchange rate. A fall in the rupee lowers dollar returns for foreign investors, and makes their India investment unattractive.

""The government does not have too much room on the fiscal rise to really do something to jumpstart the economy. In case oil continues to remain at higher levels, I think that flexibility will go down further,” said Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO for Equity at Kotak AMC."

Analysts said the spike in crude oil is likely to affect the fiscal position of net energy importers such as India in the medium term as uncertainties will keep market sentiment volatile.

The attacks reportedly shut down 6 per cent of the global oil supply. Brent crude was trading over 9 per cent up at $65.88 per barrel, while WTI crude was trading 8.77 per cent higher at $59.66.

Following the global developments, the rupee was trading nearly 61 paise down at 71.53 against the US dollar.

Analysts said that market participants are now looking ahead to the decision on interest rates and the statement from the US Federal Reserve chief after FOMC's two-day meet later this week for further cues on the direction of the market.

51,2019-09-17,GAIL,"KOLKATA: Talcher Fertilizers Ltd (TFL) has awarded its project on a lump sum term key (LSTK) contract basis to Wuhuan Engineering Co. Ltd of China. The Chinese company will will implement coal gasification and ammonia/urea packages for the project. The project is expected to be commissioned by the third quarter of 2023.

In order to augment domestic urea capacity, the government had taken up revival of closed fertilizer units of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. Accordingly, the centre mandated TFL, a joint venture company of nominated PSUs RCF, CIL, FCIL and GAIL, to revive the Talcher unit of FCIL.

With an estimated investment of Rs 13,277 crore the project will have a production capacity of 1.27 MMTPA of Neem coated urea through gasification of a mixed feedstock comprising of high ash Indian coal and petcoke.

TFL has been allotted northern part of North Arkhapal mine as the captive mine for meeting its coal requirements and petcoke shall be sourced from Paradip refinery of IOCL.

TFL has been executing many of the pre project activities at site which are essential before actual project work commences. Activities like site development, provision of construction water and power and guest house are currently underway at the Talcher site and shall be completed soon.

Tendering process for other major packages is also underway and it is expected that majority of the tenders shall be awarded before end of this fiscal.

This project is expected to improve India's self-sufficiency in urea and promote agriculture growth thereby reducing the import of urea in the country which shall in turn is expected to have a significant effect on the LNG imports besides providing employment opportunities to the local populace and also flipping the ancillary industries in the region.

Further success of this technology shall open up new areas in the Indian energy context leading to alternative use of high ash Indian coal in the areas other than conventional thermal power production."

The domestic stock market on Thursday looked set to start on a weak note as SGX Nifty were flat while Asian markets traded lower Fed Chairman Jerome Powell took a cautious approach to any further reductions in borrowing costs

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

1. Emkay Global has a hold rating on 
HDFC Life Insurance with a target price of Rs 515. HDFC Life intends to maintain a balanced product mix and has an exit run-rate of non-par savings segment at 25-30 per cent in FY20 versus 55-56 per cent of the mix in first quarter of FY20, said Emkay. The brokerage expects margins to normalise to 27 per cent in FY20 from 29.8 per cent in the first quarter of FY20, with the scale-up of other businesses in the subsequent quarters. The stock ended up 1.6 per cent at Rs 539.10 on Wednesday.

2. Kotak Securities has a buy rating on 
JK Paper with a target price of Rs 170. The company sounded positive from the demand perspective and price stability in copier segment but the brokerage foresees near term risk in terms of margin due to sequential fall in prices by Rs 0.5-1/kg, said Kotak Securities. Earnings for the next two years, likely to remain flat and higher than expected contribution from Sirpur, will be an upside risk, it added. The stock ended up 2.6 per cent at Rs 129 on Wednesday.

3. CLSA has maintained buy rating on 
GAIL India with a target price of Rs 165. The government’s reported plan to approve a gas-trading hub in less than a month should pave the way for inclusion of natural gas in GST and implementation of a unified gas transmission tariff regime will benefit GAIL, said CLSA. A combination of higher crude price, LPG and LNG prices along with lower domestic gas prices should make second half much better, it added. The stock ended up 2.3 per cent at Rs 134.90 on Wednesday.

4. Citigroup has a neutral rating on 
Mindtree with a target price of Rs 755. MindTree continues to focus on improving FY20 revenue growth and margins despite weak performance in the first quarter, said Citi. Valuations are at around 16 times one-year forward consensus EPS which is not cheap in the context of global macro concerns and client concentration, said Citi. The stock ended up 2.86 per cent at Rs 699.95 on Wednesday.

5. IIFL has reiterated reduce rating on 
Bharat Forge with a target price of Rs 340. Demand for commercial vehicles has worsened both in India and the US, said IIFL. The India downcycle would hurt Bharat Forge's FY20 revenue while the US down-cycle would hurt in FY21, the brokerage said. Non-auto segments in India and exports are also likely to see revenue decline versus the FY19 peak, as lumpy defence order and up-stocking by oil and gas customers may not repeat in FY20, said IIFL. Although the stock has corrected around 50 per cent from the peak, IIFL sees further downside in the stock. The stock ended up 0.7 per cent at Rs 399.85 on Wednesday."

59,2019-09-23,GAIL,"A major drone attack on two Saudi Arabian oil facilities last week spooked markets across the globe. The attack set off huge fires that disrupted over half of the kingdom’s oil supply. It became the single biggest oil supply disruption in history, topping the production hit caused by the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. With oil supplies taking a hit and tensions escalating in the region, repercussions are going to be felt in India too.


Prices to soar
Global crude oil prices had been benign for the past few weeks, weighed down by surplus inventory in the face of weak demand. But the production halt in one of the world’s major oil producing nations is likely to send crude prices soaring in the near term. The attacks have impacted around 5.7 million barrels per day of crude production— translating into a significant 6% hit on global oil supplies. The country’s surplus capacity of around 2 million BPD has also been affected significantly. It will take a few weeks to get the facilities operational and restore production. It is hoped that activation of US strategic oil reserves and other OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) economies stepping in to raise production would alleviate the supply conditions to some extent.

Even if supplies resume partially, the threat of further attacks will keep oil prices artificially higher going ahead. “The concern that important Saudi oil facilities are now vulnerable to attacks would increase the geopolitical risk premium on oil prices,” argues Sabri Hazarika, research analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services. The unprecedented attack also raises the spectre of a full-blown war between Saudi ally US and Iran, which is blamed for the attack. If this pans out, oil supplies will take a hit. “Any further escalation in geopolitical tensions may add to global oil supply woes given the lack of buffer in Saudi’s significant spare production capacity,” say analysts Tarun Lakhotia and Hemang Khanna of Kotak Securities. “With the US accusing the Iranian government of orchestrating the attack and Iran in turn threatening war, further destabilising the region at large and impacting future supplies, oil prices are expected to remain firm,” says Pritam Kumar Patnaik, Head, Commodities, Reliance Commodities. 


Attacks on the Saudi oil facilities have topped the biggest oil disruptions in history

Equities
The disruption in oil supply and uptick in oil prices have immediate ramifications for India. Considering India imports more than 80% of its oil requirements, any rise in price will hurt our finances. India is already trying to replace the loss of supply from Iran, owing to US sanctions. According to a report by CARE Ratings, this has led to a decline in crude processing by domestic refiners by 2.3% and increase in import of petrol and diesel by 298% and 363.5% respectively. After Iraq, Saudi Arabia is the second largest supplier of crude oil to India.


High crude prices will push up oil bill...

Threat of further attacks will keep oil prices artificially higher going ahead.
 
The immediate impact of the Saudi attack would be downward pressure on Indian equities. Historically, crude oil prices have had a negative correlation with domestic equities. Investor sentiment is already fragile over the crippling slowdown in the economy. A spurt in oil imports will create fiscal imbalances and weigh heavily on the local currency. Increased risk aversion and weaker rupee will make foreign portfolio investors wary, keeping flows into domestic equities muted in the near term. 

The extent of impact will depend on how long oil prices remain elevated. HDFC Securities in a note points out that it should not be taken as a trend that will persist over several months. “Further action on crude prices will be a function of how quickly the full capacity is restored and how coordinated the global effort is to release strategic reserves,” the note says.

The spike in crude oil prices, even if temporary, will be negative for downstream oil marketing companies (OMC) like HPCL, BPCL and IOC. “We do not rule out a possibility of moderation in marketing margins on auto fuels—a $10/bbl rise in global crude and product prices may require OMCs to increase retail price of diesel and gasoline by Rs 5-6 per litre in the following fortnight,” say Kotak Securities analysts.

Automobile manufacturers, reeling under severe volume decline, may face further squeeze as higher fuel prices push up car ownership costs. The impact may also be felt by companies using crude oil as raw material. Airlines may face higher air turbine fuel price while paint and battery makers may see input costs rise. On the other hand, higher crude prices may be positive for upstream PSUs such as ONGC, Oil India and GAIL. These will see higher realisations on every litre of crude oil they produce. Every $1 increase in Brent crude price results in up to 3% increase in earnings for these firms.


Gold
The attack on Saudi oil assets is likely to spur a shift to safe haven assets as risk appetite wanes. Any escalation in tension in the Middle East will keep the yellow metal in high demand. Chirag Mehta, Fund Manager – Alternative Investments, Quantum Mutual Fund, says, “Any flareup in geopolitical tensions is likely to keep gold price buoyant as investors tend to shun risky assets.”


... and uncertainty will be good for gold...

Escalation in tension in the Middle East will keep demand for gold high.


In the immediate aftermath of the event, international gold price surged above $1,500/oz. Domestic price of gold is hovering around Rs 38,000 per 10 gram. Any spillover effect of rising oil price on the rupee may also push local gold prices further north. Gold prices have been on the uptick for a while now, as tensions over the US-China trade war, spread of negative bond yields and slowing growth have turned investors risk averse.


Debt
The likely spike in oil prices has negative implications for the bond markets as well. Bond markets have been buoyant in anticipation of RBI cutting rates in the near future on the back of benign inflation and slowing growth. However, rising oil prices are likely to upset the fiscal math and possibly create inflationary pressures in the economy. This may prevent the RBI from cutting rates immediately or to the extent anticipated, which will affect bond prices and keep yields elevated.


...but rising inflation will hit bond prices
RBI may not cut rates immediately, leading to yields remaining elevated.

Data compiled by ETIG database

“While a rate cut was widely expected by the RBI at their next meeting in early October, crude now throws a bit of a monkey wrench into that calculus,” says Sunil Sharma, Chief Investment Officer, Sanctum Wealth Management. The yield on 10-year government bond inched up to 6.75% initially and is now hovering around 6.7%. With rise in bond yields, experts caution against betting heavily on longer duration strategy. Sharma indicates that a diversified portfolio of highest quality AAA rated, corporate bonds, banking and PSU bond funds, low to moderate duration remains his preferred positioning."

66,2019-09-23,GAIL,"By broadening the scope of the mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending, the government has effectively facilitated the concept of CSR to be turned into corporate innovation responsibility (CIR). The move essentially provides a nudge to companies to spend up to 2% of their profits on supporting research and innovation.

To be sure, companies were allowed to grant money from the CSR kitty to tech-incubators located within academic institutions approved by the Centre. The government has now expanded the scope of spending CSR budget on incubators funded by central or state governments, or any agency or public sector undertaking of central or state governments, and making contributions to public funded universities, IITs, national laboratories and autonomous bodies (established under the auspices of ICAR, ICMR, CSIR, DAE, DRDO, DST, ministry of electronics and information technology) engaged in conducting research in science, technology, engineering and medicine aimed at promoting sustainable development goals.

This has the potential to give rise to more public-private partnerships in scientific discovery, innovation and technical education, a tradition that is well developed and followed in the West but not so in India. It will encourage Indian companies to support research in the areas of their expertise or interest.

Indian companies largely have a poor record of investing in research, development and innovation. Data from Bloomberg shows that only 34 of the 50 Nifty companies invested in research and development (R&D) in 2018-19. Their cumulative expenditure stood at Rs 20,890 crore. Incidentally, ten of these companies spent more on CSR than on R&D. Five public sector undertakings – IOCL, BPCL, NTPC, Power Grid Corporation and GAIL – spent more on CSR than research.

Against this, the 50 Nifty companies spent a total of Rs 7,093 crore on CSR. With research funding allowed to be made from the CSR kitty, companies that had been hesitant on spending on CSR would now be more willing to support innovation that may potentially help their business. Pharmaceutical companies are a case in point. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, for instance, spent Rs 1,977 crore on R&D in FY19 but only Rs 3.9 crore on CSR. Such companies can now easily marry the two objectives of supporting research and drug discovery as well as doing social good in the process.

Banks and financial service institutions, which do not report any expenditure on R&D, can look at investing part of their CSR budget in research on financial inclusion, digital banking and new technologies in digital banking.

The government has pushed the ball in India Inc’s court. The moot question is – will it deliver?"

After becoming finance minister and presenting a second-rate Budget, you have seemed a timid tinkerer, making dozens of marginal changes to try and revive a sagging economy, in vain. Your image has changed completely with your bold, courageous slashing of corporate tax last week, from an effective 35% (with surcharges and cesses) to an effective 25.17%.

You have grasped that India’s structural failures are more important than the current cyclical downswing in GDP. Keynesians would have advocated a cut in indirect taxes and rise in government spending to give an anti-cyclical boost to a slowing economy. But that would have been a one-off effort, to be reversed soon. By contrast, the cut in corporate tax is a structural reform with long-term effects.


Dice Well Thrown
It will boost corporate incomes, which critics will castigate as pro-rich. It is not the best way of immediately boosting demand. But structurally, India will become more globally competitive, inducing more domestic and foreign investment and boosting exports.

With a lag, this will hopefully boost GDP (and revenue) growth more permanently. It is a gamble, but a worthwhile one. Your tax system remains flawed. You should simplify and make uniform many tax rates in the next Budget or two.

You have shown guts in sacrificing a whopping Rs 1,45,000 crore (0.7% of GDP) of tax revenue to make India’s corporate tax rate competitive with that of Asian neighbours. Five years ago, former finance minister Arun Jaitley pledged to phase in a 25% corporate tax rate, which with surcharge and cesses meant an effective 28%. Since his announcement, our competitors have cut their rates further. You have cut corporate tax down to 22% for companies that do not avail of other tax breaks. Well done.

But you have also cut the rate on new corporations that start production by 2023 to just to 15%. That is a mistake. You need more uniformity and stability in tax rates. Why create yet another tax break when your aim is to eliminate existing ones? Focus on improving the climate for investment rather than tax breaks for a few.

Your July Budget levied a big surcharge on high incomes taking the top effective income-tax rate to 42%. You did not realise that this would apply to many foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) who are organised as trusts by law in their own countries. Hence, FPIs withdrew billions of dollars from Indian stock markets, causing a major slump.

To assuage FPIs, you have exempted capital gains from the top surcharge. And, for uniformity, you have extended this tax break to Indian entities.

This is an improvement, but not good enough. You should simply have abolished the top rate of 42% that makes India totally uncompetitive. Your logic of making corporate tax competitive should apply to income tax too. Thousands of rich Indians have been migrating to Dubai and Singapore to reduce their tax liability, and your high rate will accelerate their exit, reducing, rather than gaining, revenue for you.

Every finance minister should know the hazards of creating a large gap between the corporate and top income tax rate. A large gap induces individuals to corporatise, or find other ways to channel individual income into their corporations, reducing tax revenue. Your sharp cut in corporate tax, welcome for other reasons, has increased an already large gap. That is why you should abolish new surcharges.


Vitaminising the Structure
You should also stop raising the income-tax exemption limit to woo middleclass voters. Relative to per-capita income, India has one of the highest tax exemption rates in the world.

Critics say you have abandoned fiscal prudence altogether through tax cuts for the rich. Yes, you have made a fiscal sacrifice, but not for populist spending.

Structural change will ultimately induce faster growth, which is the best recipe for raising incomes for all.

Besides, the quality of fiscal deficits matters. Deficits for increasing productive investment are entirely defensible.

That higher investment will, in due course, translate into higher growth that recoups the immediate revenue loss. Many countries with lower tax rates and collection rates than India have lower fiscal deficits too.

Your actual tax sacrifice could be much less than estimated. First, a big chunk of corporate tax is paid by public sector undertakings (PSUs) like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Gail, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), State Bank of India (SBI), NTPC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), HindustanPetroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC).

They will now have higher profits that can be returned to you as dividends. Second, many companies, especially multinational corporations (MNCs), pay a high proportion of profits as dividends. The new tax rate will boost dividends and, hence, boost your collections of dividend distribution tax (DDT) and income tax.

Third, by boosting stock market prices, you have boosted capital gains, and will collect proportionately higher capital gains tax.

Your gamble of cutting corporate tax to accelerate growth will succeed only as part of an overall strategy to make India more competitive. You must convince your Cabinet colleagues to make other inputs like land, labour, railway freight rates & electricity as cheap in India as in neighbouring Asian competitors. Cutting taxes rates alone will not suffice."

67,2019-09-24,GAIL,"New Delhi: Petronet LNG launched a damage-control exercise after its proposed $2.5 billion US gas purchase deal led to a slide in its stock on Monday, saying the agreement signed in Houston over the weekend was “non-binding” and would be pursued only if it made “commercial sense”.

Shares in Petronet, valued at Rs 37,900 crore or $5.35 billion, closed 5.28 per cent down from the previous close on the BSE on Monday, when the benchmark Sensex ended 2.83 per cent higher. The decline was fuelled by fears that the company was assuming unreasonable risks by entering a mega liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal worth half its market value, and also exposing itself to the upstream segment where it has no competence whatsoever, analysts said.

Petronet had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Tellurian in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, wherein the company and its affiliates plan to explore the possibility of purchase of up to 5 million tonnes per annum of LNG and pick up equity stake in the US firm’s Driftwood project. Petronet will spend $2.5 billion for an 18 per cent equity stake and purchase of 5 million tonnes of gas per annum, as per Bloomberg.


After the stock was hammered on Monday, Petronet called an analysts’ conference to say that the MoU was non-binding and would be pursued purely on merit.

“It’s not a firm contract. The contract will be signed only if the due diligence shows merit in it. We are appointing a consultant to evaluate the proposal,” a senior Petronet executive said.

“Only if our affiliates, which is our promoters or offtakers, come along that we would sign a 5 million tonnes deal. Else, we might go for just a one or two million tonnes per year agreement.”

K Ravichandran, analyst at credit rating agency ICRA, said, “GAIL’s experience has taught us that buying LNG from the US comes with a bouquet of risks and so investors develop jitters when any Indian gas buyer wants to do that.”

GAIL has been struggling to find domestic buyers for its longterm US LNG, which is linked to Henry Hub rates and incurs high shipment cost. It didn’t close back-to-back deals with domestic customers, as is the practice in LNG market.

The Petronet executive said the deal wouldn’t be closed “until we have back-to-back contract with offtakers”. The deal wouldn’t involve “much exposure to the upstream segment”, he said but did not elaborate."
69,2019-09-24,GAIL,"In the Nifty, only about 15 odd stocks would be trading above the historical averages. The entire BSE mid and small cap are trading well below the historic levels, says Abhiram Eleswarapu, Head of India Equity Research, BNP Paribas. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

We have moved 8.5% on the Nifty since the corporate tax cuts were announced. The EPS upgrades which have come in for Nifty earnings are in the 7-8% range. Is the best already in the price or do you think the prices can move much higher than what the upgrades are?The first-order impact of these tax cuts are pretty much in the price in the last two days. For example, in our coverage area, the effective tax rates earlier were about 29% odd and that will fall to maybe about 23%. That leads to about 8% odd potential earnings upside and the Nifty move in the last two days has been about 8.5%...


It captures it all.It practically captured all of that. What is more interesting is that apart from just this move, there are a couple of first-order effects. One, equity investors have got an immediate benefit compared to just about anybody else and the second point is that the government has probably given a strong message that they are willing to do what it takes to pull the economy out of the current situation and that is what most investors will probably take away. 

It is interesting to note that in the Nifty, only about 15 odd stocks would be trading above the historical averages. The entire BSE mid and small cap are trading well below the historic levels, probably one standard deviation below and therefore this move could broaden the number of stocks that investors could look at. 

So far, we have had a very narrow sort of a move. That will be the first-order impact. The second order impact is more interesting and that is the impact on the real economy. It is much more difficult to quantify. It may not happen in the next few days, probably in the next few months or years also. The tax cuts should boost infrastructure spending, setting up new capacity, etc. 


Does that not happen overnight?It does not happen overnight. That is the reason why the horizon provided is until 2023 and the option to allow foreign companies to come in and set up shop in India. Also, it is timed well, along with the China-US trade war. So it is just possible that we attract some of that investment. That is the interesting part on the investment side. 

It is a bit more complicated in consumption sector. The hope obviously is that when you cut tax rates, companies will reduce product prices and boost demand. But if you do the calculations, that is more possible on the consumer staple side, if at all and possibly on select products. The price cuts could be measured as well leading to a slight improvement in demand in products where the demand is elastic. 

However on the consumer discretionary side, small cuts in prices do not usually change volume and we just calculated in our work today that at best, auto companies could cut between 0% to 1% on prices and they may not do that at all! So the impact on the consumer is a lot more measured.


Given that we have seen the government step up on all fronts, there is still a call that until we see divestment or some impetus to government spending, we would not see a complete 360 degree turnaround. But at least some of these measures are expected to boost lending. What can we expect over the next couple of quarters?Let us look at some of the positives for the second half. First is of course what we just had on the tax cut. You have to acknowledge that in the last 2-3 months, the government has announced several measures around lending, for improving liquidity and money is being handed out to the consumer on the rural side through the PM Kisan scheme. Only a part of that money is being paid out. That could happen in the second half of the year. The monsoons were reasonably good. 

I would say there have been quite a few growing positives for the second half. You cannot avoid the negatives of course. Some of them could be a little more structural in nature. For example, on the rural side wages are quite poor, unemployment is rising in the urban side and all that leads to lower savings rates. Transmission of rate cuts has not really happened. RBI has cut interest rates by quite a bit, about 110 bps this year. But the lending rates are practically stable there or even have increased in some cases. 

There is no doubt that there are several negatives as well. What one needs to bear in mind is that last week around this time, there was extreme pessimism in the market. Globally, growth is slowing everywhere but it is very possible that central banks across the world act on monetary policy and that could probably help a market like India. So I would say we have to be kind of balanced on this, take the positives, take the negatives and go back to the homework.


Do you think companies will pass on the tax benefit to the consumers?As I mentioned to you earlier on the discretionary side, I doubt whether they will pass on that benefit.


In terms of new investments?New investments absolutely. There are many areas, especially in autos, where several companies are running well above their usual utilisation levels. For the economy as a whole, the utilisation levels are above 75%. It is obviously a requirement that the company set up a new capacity, but these decisions do not happen overnight. They happen over time.


What if they are content to wait and watch?If they are already on the fence and the tax cut only helps their costs, they will probably do it quicker than we expect.


For an investor, what does it mean? Have you missed the bus already in the last two days? If you were not fully invested, if you were sitting on cash, have you missed the ride already? Do you think there are midcap and smallcap stocks where the catch-up has just begun? If you have missed the rally over the last two days, you have to be kind on yourself. You cannot expect announcements like this on a daily basis. It is okay if you missed it. But going forward, as I said, the best of the earnings upgrade is in the price. We follow a very systematic pattern for creating portfolios and we call them quality less. We have two variants -- one of growth and one of value. We are looking at intersection of companies that satisfy quality requirements for reasonable earnings growth and have decent valuation at the same time. 

It is impossible to find a company that satisfies all these requirements but we are trying to find the best fit and today the stocks that dominate those lists are in the financial services space and insurance. We have several companies on consumer staples which are probably likely to benefit more than discretionary.


Let’s start with the financial services list first. Where do you find a congregation of all these parameters that you talked about?It is available mostly in private banks and not just now, but over the last 10 years or so, if there was one space which benefited from all the themes in India starting from premiumisation, penetration and digitisation, that was private banks. The next could potentially be insurance and that is why these are the two sectors that we are most positive on.


The consumption trend is pretty clear. What about Power Grid, GAIL among largecaps? What are you looking at when it comes to that segment?I would not be able to comment on individual companies but we follow a systematic approach. Some stocks have moved a lot in the last few months or days and therefore they have become expensive and dropped out of the list and there are others which are less expensive and would get into the list. That is the most common reason for stocks moving in and out on a short term basis."
74,2019-09-25,GAIL,"We want to play the real beta in midcaps and the whole broader market. That is where you will make real money, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice-President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Looking at the price action today, it seems like all the good news in the interim is baked in the prices?Yes, that is the typical reaction of people who have missed this rally. But I have been sticking my neck out since the last one-and-a-half-month that this market is the best buy you have ever had and the opportunity is the fear. So after a 1000 points rise, a 200 point selloff is in course. But do not miss the wood for the trees. This is just the beginning. This type of reform and under-ownership is telling me that we are in for the best of times in the next 18 months. 

So yes, there will be volatility till the middle of October but I would say after October, you will see the best equity rally you have ever seen. The broader market will definitely outperform in 2020. We are just starting the show. This is just a one day of selloff. I would again say this is the time to start picking up what you have missed out and to try and put your money back to work.


What about IT getting mixed calls? Some prefer other opportunities currently and some are still saying that it is one of the best places to be invested in in the Indian markets. What is your view?Last to last week, at 10,700 I told you a 1,000 point rally is coming around Diwali, it has happened much before that. On IT, I would be neutral to underweight because the real money will be in industrials, corporate banks, capex, construction stocks. IT can be bellwether in the shape of HCL Tech. That is one stock which we own and we are overweight on. But on IT, we would be neutral. We want to play the real beta in midcaps and the whole broader market. That is where you will make real money.


What is your take on the news of the partial stake sale of Axis Bank by SUUTI via the Bharat 22 ETF in October? They are also considering the stake sale in ITC to help shore up the government coffers. How does this bode for both these entities?By holding this stake at a time when there was chaos in UTI, they made SUUTI. These investments are up over eight times. Axis may be up 10 times. So you can imagine the return in the last 18 years or 20 years these stocks have given! 

ITC may definitely get a premium if it is going to be sold. I think it is a win-win situation for the government which is exiting stocks or sectors where they need not be and these have been holdings which have turned out to be jewels in the crown. Aside from that, it tells you the government’s intent that they are now ready to go whole-hog on reforms for growth. Strategic disinvestment would actually set the cat amongst the pigeons. The government is ticking all the right boxes. You cannot go wrong and hence we think the India overweight for the next three years is here to stay. 


What would you recommend for those who have missed out on the last two days rally to pick up if they are sitting on any amount of cash?Consumption stocks are hitting new highs and that is where the real money is going to be made -- whether it is Nestle, Titan, HUL and ITC. 

ITC has underperformed Godrej Consumer and some of the private banks are extremely positive. Among the capex stocks, L&T and Siemens are the ones to look at. Even in midcaps, I have seen maximum capitulation and this one-day selloff should again be used to buy because midcaps can really give you a run for the money but it depends on your time horizon.

 I am looking at 2020 being the year of midcaps hence midcaps will not only give you 50% but they will give you 100, 200, 300% return depending on what sector, stock and where you have conviction.


What is your outlook is on the energy basket? That is our top play. A disclosure, we have had buy positions in BPCL, HPCL, IOC and Reliance and all the gas utilities, GAIL, IGL, MGL. But energy is where you will really make money and this move of the government for strategic disinvestment should be the changing point for energy sector’s underperformance. I still think that these stocks are going to give you a huge run for the money. 

Reliance is leading from the front, HP, BP have joined in and energy is going to be a very sweet spot. We know you have seen all the volatility play out on the Saudi side. Now you are talking of an Aramco IPO, the Reliance leverage and this is one space where you cannot go wrong. After almost one year of underperformance, PSU energy and gas utilities are just starting to move. PSU stocks, particularly this basket, will outperform in the next one year."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits” for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India. The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list” of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries to smaller names including Manappuram Finance , Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.

“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,” he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.”



India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.

Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9 per cent while small cap names gained 7 per cent. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3 per cent in the last three sessions.

The gains show that the “first round impact” of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.

Here are the key insights from the report



Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6 per cent above Tuesday’s close
Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75 per cent of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

Out of the 161 stocks that trade in the F&O segment, over 40 surged in double digits in cash market while as many as 117 ended with gains. 

IDBI Bank was the biggest gainer in the pack, jumping 41 per cent in the September series. Bharat Petroleum (up 31 per cent), Page Industries (up 25 per cent), Siemens (up 23 per cent) and Kajaria Ceramics (up 21 per cent) were among the top five gainers for this period, AceEquity data showed. 

The September F&O series was marked by some big steps from the government to boost the economy, including a corporate tax rate cut bonanza, plans to merge PSU banks and setting up of a panel to identify projects for a Rs 100 lakh crore infrastructure plan. 

The corporate tax cut gave a fillip to market sentiments and propelled Sensex 3,000 points in just two sessions, while Nifty climbed 1,000 points. 

During the series, weak macro-economic numbers and global geopolitical tensions capped the gains in a volatile market. Overall, Nifty climbed 490 points, or 4.5 per cent, while Sensex grew 1,500 points, or 4.2 per cent. Nifty Bank climbed 2,280 points, or 8.3 per cent, during the September series. 

Analysts are positive about market prospects going forward. “Under-ownership of stocks is telling me that we are in for the best time in next 18 months. Yes, there will be volatility till the middle of October. After October, you will see the best equity rally ever,” Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities told ETNow. 

Bhasin’s top picks include PNB, Bank of Baroda, IDFC First Bank and Federal Bank from the banking sector and Ambuja Cement and UltraTech from the infrastructure segment. He is also bullish on GAIL and IGL from the energy sector. 

Analysts also expect a jump in earnings. “The corporate tax cut is a welcome move. Going forward, we may see a jump in earnings for Q3 and Q4. We are very positive after looking at the things that happened in last one week,” said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. 


Biggest losers in Sept series
Debt-ridden Zee Entertainment was the biggest loser in the September series, falling 25 per cent. Canara Bank (down 13 per cent), Dish TV (down 12 per cent) and Strides Pharma (down 10.5 per cent) were other stocks that dived in double digits. 

Over 40 stocks ended in the red during the series. Most of them are from sectors like IT, realty, pharma and infrastructure. Analysts have advised investors to look at IT stocks, as the delta shifted to capex-driven businesses. 

“Foreign and domestic mutual funds held IT as bellwether to ride the tide when we were at 10,700 (on Nifty). At 11,700, the equation has changed. We are ‘underweight’ IT now. You will see smart money move out of the sector to segments where there is more delta,” said Bhasin.

Global brokerage UBS has also turned ‘underweight’ on the IT sector."

80,2019-09-27,GAIL,"New Delhi: The government will launch fourth tranche of Bharat-22 ETF on October 3, which will help garner up to Rs 8,000 crore from investors, sources said.

They added that the issue will open for anchor investors on October 3 and for other institutional and retail investors, the next day.

The investors would get a 3 per cent discount over the issue price.

""The offer is likely to have a base issue size of Rs 2,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain another Rs 6,000 crore, taking the total amount to Rs 8,000 crore,"" a source privy to the development said.

The decision has been taken after receiving robust response for earlier stake sale by the government in the product.

The government has so far raised around Rs 35,900 crore through the Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund -- Rs 14,500 crore was garnered in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was mopped up in June 2018 and Rs 13,000 crore in February this year.

Proceeds from the ETF will help the government meet its disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore for the current financial year.

The Central Public Sector Enterprises that are part of the Bharat-22 ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Other constituents are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL, NLC India, Axis Bank, ITC and L&T.

Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

Earlier this month, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, which manages the ETF, had filed the draft papers regarding the issue with capital markets regulator Sebi."
79,2019-09-27,GAIL,"The next one to two months should give us a lot more clarity because a lot of numbers will come, companies will talk, analysts meet and thatwill give us a deeper understanding of what stocks to bet on for the next move, says Atul Suri, Founder, Marathon Trends – PMS. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Are bulls getting ready for the next big move that we saw last Friday and is this week behind us now?It will be consolidated, it will take time. We are going to head much higher, around 13,500 on the intermediate timeframe.


 13,500 which means a new high and substantially over time. But the fact is that one must remember that we moved 10% in two days. We could go in for a bit of consolidation -- a few hundred points. There are two things: a) global markets seem to be pausing and there is a lot of commentary and chatter. How much it fructifies I do not know but even they will eventually move higher. 

b)We have corporate earnings coming up next month and that will be very important. We are not expecting anything spectacular from there, but I am very interested in the commentary that comes from companies because they have had a very big benefit on direct taxes. We have to see how they are going to use it and whether it is going to be straight profit after tax or there would be some sort of capex plans. 

The next one month will be very interesting and it will not be just across the board. We have had a 10% short covering kind of rally. It will be a little more differentiated. Banking as a sector has done well, but what the PSU banks are doing vis-à-vis what some of the private sector banks or corporates are doing, is very differentiated. So the 10% move has been across the board in most. An index short covering rally really happened and there were lots of shorts in the system, but going ahead, it will be a little more differentiated here.


Ever since last Friday, one has seen that the PSUs are back in focus. From NTPC to BPCL to GAIL, the entire energy sector is charged up because now the expectation is that after corporate taxes, next is going to be divestment. Is it risky going long on these charts or is this a big directional move in PSU names and particularly in OMCs?
I personally think that it is a punt. There is a feeling and a buzz on the street that it is going to be massive PSU divestment. That is a punt. It is a faith rally. However, I do not think they are compounding stories or they are backed by earnings. If it does not happen within the timeframe, they also tend to fizzle out. We have seen this repeatedly -- be it in PSU banks or even OMCs.

It is a bit of a punt that is there on expectation that something will happen. It is likely to happen but if it does not, I do not think that it can be a part of your portfolio in the long term because ultimately in your portfolio you are looking for compounders and one cannot play this. They are great for an individual trader but I do not think as a portfolio you put it in the hope that a divestment will come about. Yes, if you see value, if you see a great price and great trends, then it is great, but I would not just play it for one event which may or may not happen.


The next 2,000-point up move that you are expecting, is it going to be primarily led by domestic buying? Are you seeing a move from FIIs also in terms of sentiment? FIIs continue to be on and off. One expected that the number would be blue all days but that has not happened. I personally think that they will look for numbers, for corporate performances and that is still some time to go. What has really changed exactly a week ago at this time, it is Friday and it is almost like a weekly sort of expiry for us. What really changed is the sentiment. Last week the mood was bad.

Now we are optimistic and we are invested in this market. Our stocks held on very well, they were doing well but what was lost from budget to this month till last week was the faith, the hope. We always heard that in Modi 2.0, there is going to be some big bang stuff together with this $5-trillion economy. It all seems like a pack of marketing gimmick. What really happened was the size and magnanimity of the move really brings that faith back and that is what gives the market another three-six months. 

We have been working on this. The numbers are going to improve and we have been hearing it for years till about a week ago when the sentiment had gone bad.


But you saw the magic play out only last Friday.Yes, I mean and it was something which no one could anticipate.


Then you see that point move to the new levels that you are talking about. Assuming that even further conviction comes after we see it reflected in earnings. what is the time line you are looking at for that new high?It will take a year-year and a half. As I said, it will take time and it will have to be backed by numbers. You cannot keep on having a hope rally. The kind of statements you hear in the Prime Minister’s speech to the corporate bigwigs in the US in the last couple of days, you understand that it is not the end and now you know you have to believe that this government has got its mind set on that $5 trillion number. 

How they do it, whether it happens or not, only time will tell but yes the attempts are going to be there and then you do not want to mess around. As I said, you do not fight the Fed, I do not think you want to fight Modi at the moment.


Where does leadership come from for peak 13,500?It is going to be quality again. Most people are trying to say midcap, largecap etc. I think it is quality. The pain I have seen in people’s portfolios is so tremendous in that junk space where they are down 50, 60, 70% and I do not think money is going to come into that. 

You will see pullback rallies or you will see oversold rallies or little bit of game but money is going to move to quality whether it is largecap or is midcap. Quality is what is really going to pan out and you are already seeing that when the fall happened. Portfolios are holding out because you are in quality and as and when the market reversed, the leadership that you found in this space was fantastic. So I personally think it is going to be quality driven.


I know you are looking at the private banks as is the rest of the market.What would be next in the pecking order?No, there are lots of other sectors. We have been overweight on specialty chemicals for the last two years. Insurance is another very interesting sector which, even when the market was falling, continued to make new highs. Even when the market is getting reversed, they still continue with their march.


So are you finding those value picks out there?I do not think it is value, I think it is growth.


You had made money by going short, but now has the rule changed?The question is the size. If you are trying to play short for a massive move, I do not think that is there. If you are playing for 50-100 points those guys will continue to play, it is their bread and butter, that is their job, that will keep happening and that is very important because for a market, it gives that liquidity. So if you are playing for a 100-200 points yes, I think it may make sense any of these days.


That could happen while we are speaking. That could happen tomorrow morning, we do not know.Exactly. For that group-- and mind you there is a big number, there are a lot of guys who are playing these option strategies and things like that. Last Friday was difficult for many but there are a lot of guys who have a lot of systems and they are a major part of the volume actually and they provide liquidity, so no complaints. If you are playing with that and you are really fast and you are quant based, it is great, but if you think that you can take a strategic short call, I would a little wary.


I am asking you these basic questions; a) Should one not go short? ; b) Do you expect markets to move slow and steady but gradually higher or do you expect markets to be choppy as they climb higher? On Wednesday, we saw a crack and on Thursday, a big uptick. It is impossible to predict. I personally think that the next rally or this number that I gave you will be on the basis of some numbers that will come through. These do not come as a surprise. They get built in and there is a process to it. The insiders, then the brokers and then the public, that cycle always happens. 

The only joker in the pack is the government announcements. Theoretically assuming they decide to divest 100% in BPCL, yes that will lead to a trigger. That could be the jumpy points we do not have any control on. So stick to quality, stick to numbers, keep with compounders and stay with the trend. If you are lucky, like we were last week, when it all worked out fine, sometimes maybe I do not have a BPCL or HPCL in my portfolio and I may miss out, but everyday of the season, you cannot be be happy!


For those who missed the bus, how does one catch the bus -- jump now or wait for a decline? The decline could come when quarterly numbers come out? Is that a better strategy?Every day people wait for corrections but nobody invests in corrections. I am receiving top ups in my PMS from clients who first transfer the money and then let me know. They call you and say have you deployed the money? So we top more. A week ago, if I was meeting clients, they loved you, they loved your product, they loved everything about you and then they say yes, we will consider it. They may say thoda abhi liquidity ka tight hai (liquidity is a little tight now). Suddenly where is the liquidity coming from?

My observation is we wait for so-called corrections but money is deployed in breakouts and at some stage, you have to have the faith, you have to bite the bullet. You are not going to get a market correction. You are going to buy and the next day the market is going to go up? No, it is never going to be a perfect entry. You have to look at the larger picture.


So you are saying one should jump in whenever?Whether you invest now or 200-300 points lower, nobody can time it to perfection.


From a return perspective, you may be closer to a 10% upmove. Do you think we are going to see that come back?
I do not think so you are going to get these 10% pop ups in a day or two. No, no, I do not think so.


Over the growth scenario that you are painting?
Yes, that is there but you have to be more gradual and it will be more differentiated like it is going to be about numbers. I am very interested in the kind of commentary that managements come out with, the savings that they are going to make in taxation, direct taxes, how are they going to use it, is it going to be profit after tax, is it going to be for promotion, brand building, technology and things like that. We have all pencilled in a number that this was the tax rate, why so much so should benefit etc. But what is going to happen with that money? 

The next one to two months should give us a lot more clarity because a lot of numbers will come, companies will talk, analysts meet and that will give us a deeper understanding of what stocks to bet on for the next move.


Since you have already pencilled in that 13500 mark, what is going to push the Nifty to that mark? Will it be a cluster of ICICI Bank, Nestle, the usual suspects, HDFC Bank or would newer names L&T could contribute to the move?It will be much more broad-based and since a certain segment of the market has done well, a)it will broaden. b)The theme that I stand by is quality. Look for quality. Let us take real estate as a sector. The moment I tell you real estate, stocks are down 90-90%.


But you always liked the quality within real estate?Yes, exactly, but even in real estate you will find a few stocks nudging towards lifetime highs. What I am trying to tell you is that in small and midcaps, you are not going to see those levels. However, where there is quality of management, quality of earnings, you will feel that those levels are already getting taken out and real estate is a case in point. There are so many stocks which in spite of the biggest pain point in our industries, are touching lifetime highs! How is that happening? What is the differentiator? 

And that is happening in sector after sector, you look at cement, you look at bearings, you will find that this theme is really playing out.


What happens when markets come back and when we sit at an all time high? Risk comes back and risk cannot be played by buying a Nestle. You cannot buy risk by buying consumer names. For a trader who says I do not care about quality, I care about trend and I care about making money when the trend is higher, will risk come back?Yes, definitely it will come back. There are cycles. You always find leadership in larger players, the quality are the safer bets. At some point that catch up will happen but when will that catch up happen because at the moment even in the larger ones that we are talking about, there is a hope trade. They are holding out but you want to see a broad-based revival coming into the economy and a catch up will happen. 

So it will happen, everything has its time, the question is how much time we may get and again as I said, it is not going to be across the board. Just because you have a smallcap stock and it is in your list of 150 stocks, which most retail guys have in their portfolio, there is no guarantee that it is going to work. 


Markets are headed higher. Stick to quality, you will make money by going long, do not go short. But I wish markets behave the way we want.
No, no it does not, it never does.


What will pour cold water on your thesis? What is the sacrosanct level beyond which you would say you were wrong and would rather be a seller now?Looking at the price levels, I feel the market has made a higher bottom. The last major bottom we made was in 2018 October. The Nifty was around 10,000. Now we have made a higher bottom at 10,600 or thereabouts which was last week. I am giving out these numbers because I feel the market has made a higher bottom in space. So if that bottom gets violated, I would be worried.


Roughly market bottom at 10,500 right?No, it went to 10,000 October of last year. Where your thing starts, that is a bottom, one circle there. The second is where you have drawn it.


So you would say this really is below the water mark?Right. That would be almost like what you will call last week’s lows. That level of 10,600 would be a very important level because the markets made a higher bottom. If that gets violated, I will be really worried.


You track the global markets as well closely. Is the risk for US yield still there because that is the big global fear which could challenge everything that we are talking about here in India. It would stabilise at these levels. There is a feeling that it is going to collapse and things like that. I feel it is at historical levels and it could bounce around and so it may spend some time here and not dominate headlines which I think is good enough. 

The If that cracks, remember, it is the mother of all asset classes or charts in the world. So if that happens, a lot of things change. But I personally think that it would stabilise or spend some time here where it is like the dollar also, the DXY. If it is not in headlines, it is good because the moment it makes headlines, then a lot of things go out of whack. If it even goes for a multi-year sideways, it is even with us, with our currency and bond yields. As long as they do not hit headlines, they are good news. The moment they make headlines you got a bit of a problem.


But you are overall reassured that we are on the right track now?I hope so. That is how I am positioned…


7-8%...Yes but even while the markets were going down, I was 95% invested. From that point of view, one goes through the ups and downs and pains. You have to ultimately live with the faith. It is beyond numbers beyond a point in time. I am one of those who believes that Indian markets will be substantially higher. Sometimes you go underweight, overweight but more or less you are in and you get rewarded. On a day like last week if you are were not in, there was no chance. So if you were sitting on cash, you missed the whole bus. So, it is about being invested and keeping a longer term faith on the trend."

2,2019-10-02,GAIL,"State-owned GAIL India Ltd and its affiliates have set a target to provide 11.44 lakh piped cooking gas connections in the current fiscal as they chase what now looks like a highly improbable target of connecting one crore households with environment-friendly fuel by next year. GAIL and its joint ventures such as the ones that retail CNG and piped cooking gas in Delhi and Mumbai had achieved just 60 per cent of the target to give 11.25 lakh connections in the 2018-19 fiscal year, according to company's target document reviewed by . 

 In March 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pledged to provide piped natural gas connections to one crore households ""in the next four years"". India had about 26 lakh households using gas received from a pipeline in the kitchen in 2015 and the government was keen for a massive expansion of piped cooking gas to help cut down the usage of subsidised LPG. 

 LPG thus freed can be used to replace kerosene and forest wood for cooking in rural and remote areas. 

 Later, the one crore deadline was pushed back by a year to 2020. But even this delayed deadline now looks improbable to achieve. 

 Together with other private city gas distribution firms, piped cooking gas users in India rose from 42.65 lakh in March 2018 to over 52 lakh a year later. This has risen to 54.17 lakh as on September 1, according to the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). 

 Industry officials said the biggest push for piped cooking gas use would come when entities that have been authorised by Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) in two bid rounds in the last one-year start work. When they come on stream, such users will jump many fold, they said. 

 With a licence to retail CNG and piped gas to household kitchens given out for 136 geographical areas or GAs in last one year, the coverage of city gas network would be 70 per cent of country's population, they said, adding household kitchens getting piped cooking gas would reach 5 crore by 2030 once full rollout is achieved in all the cities licensed. 

 To achieve Prime Minister's target of 1 crore piped natural gas users by 2020, a massive 45 lakh connections will have to be given in one year. 

 But the biggest city gas distribution group GAIL is only targeting 11.44 lakh in year to March 31, 2020, according to the company document. 

 This target comprises 3.4 lakh new connections each in the national capital region and Mumbai and adjoining towns, and another 1.43 lakh in Pune. 

 This target compares to 11.02 lakh piped natural gas users in the national capital region and 12.77 lakh in Mumbai and adjoining cities, according to the GAIL document. 

 In 2018-19, GAIL and its affiliates had targeted 3 lakh connections in the national capital region (NCR) and Mumbai and adjoining cities. Against this, Indraprastha Gas Ltd issued a record 2.1 lakh connections while Mahanagar Gas Ltd enrolled 1.68 lakh new users. 

 Pune currently has 1.68 lakh users getting piped natural gas in their kitchens. 

 Other cities where GAIL and its affiliates are targeting new users include Kanpur, Agra and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, Indore and Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Kakinada, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad in Telangana."
3,2019-10-03,GAIL,"The cut in prices of domestically produced gas augurs well for companies such as GAIL as well as natural gas end-users including power, fertilisers and sponge iron companies, as it decreases the cost of manufacturing of urea, petrochemicals and power, which use natural gas as a feedstock, said analysts.

However, they said, the impact on city gas distributing (CGD) companies is neutral since they will lower prices 3-4 per cent to pass on the benefit to consumers and negative for companies such as ONGC and Oil India.

The government has reduced the domestic natural gas price, APM and high pressure, 12.5 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively, applicable for the October 2019-March 2020 period.

“We see 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent reduction in FY20 and FY21 earnings for ONGC and Oil India and an increase of 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent for GAIL,” said Harshvardhan Dole, analyst, IIFL Securities. “Separately, gas-based independent power producers such as NTPC should witness 5-6 per cent decrease in their overall cost of generation.”

The gas price for locally produced fields has been revised to $3.23 per mmBtu from $3.69 per mmBtu, resulting in a 12.5 per cent decrease, and the ceiling price for gas to be produced from difficult fields has fallen to $8.43 per mmBtu from $9.32 per mmBtu, resulting in a 9.5 per cent decrease.



“A 12.5 per cent fall in natural gas prices augurs well for natural gas endusers as it decreases the cost of manufacturing of urea and petrochemicals where natural gas is used as a feedstock,” said Urvisha Jagasheth, research analyst, CARE Ratings. “Decrease in price of natural gas will also be beneficial for the margins of the power sector and sponge iron industry where it is used for the generation of energy.”

Out of the 31 urea plants in India, 28 use natural gas as a feedstock, which accounts for 80 per cent of the raw material cost for urea manufacturing.

“As per our estimates, a 12.5 per cent fall in natural gas prices could potentially lead to a 6 per cent decrease in the cost of production of urea, thus decreasing the working capital intensity of fertiliser manufacturers,” said Jagasheth of CARE Ratings.

India is heavily dependent on coal-fired power plants for power. Natural gas accounts for only 3-4 per cent of the total power generated. Thus the decrease in price will not provide a major relief to the power sector, according to analysts. The power sector is grappling with inadequate availability of natural gas."

5,2019-10-03,GAIL,"Gradually some of the PSUs will get rerated because of the combination of divestment related triggers. There might also be some positive announcement in terms of the deadline, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What led to the mayhem in RBL, Yes Bank and Indiabulls on Tuesday? The price action is reminiscent of what we saw in 2008 and 2009 when everyone had lost faith in the system. We are nowhere close to that kind of a scenario but the way stocks are melting is nothing short of scary?It is a combination of news flow and factors around it which has led to this weakness. In case of Indiabulls Finance, we all know the PIL and the possibility of a detailed investigation into the financial irregularities. Also the fact that the merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank could be in the back burner would lead to some kind of a negative sentiment. 

More importantly, there is a bit of uncertainty around the kind of exposure some of these entities have -- be it in terms of PMC Bank or some of the entities where people are not sure whether there will be any kind of continuity of operations. That again is leading to some kind of a knee-jerk reaction. 

Also, I have come across news that there was a good amount of selling in the pledged shares because of that, there is an uncertainty around this entire saga which is leading to the weakness across these companies.


Should one believe in these rumours which are substantiated or respect the market action which is telling you that bad news or collateral damage is here to stay? Typically what we have seen is that whenever any company loses more than 75-80% of the market cap, then there has to be something seriously wrong with it. I am going by the ballpark. We have to just deal with this situation. One can hope that the stock has corrected and there should be some kind of a revival. The other thing is there is something that we do not know of. Sometimes, this factor plays a far more important role, particularly for retail investors. If you do not know and if you just rely on these kind of statements and clarifications, you may have to pay a very heavy price for it. 

There may be some value in companies like RBL Bank or to some extent Yes Bank also. But we do not know at what point this will stabilise. The sensible way to approach is to let it stabilise. Let the worst get out of the way and then probably try and take a view on buying the stock rather than buying just because it has corrected.


GAIL management seems to be indicating that they are going to go along with the government’s plans for divestment. If required, they can spin off the pipelines and transmission businesses separately. Where within the PSU bank do you find opportunity? Or would you stay clear of it?Post the divestment announcements for three companies, definitely there is a sense that the government is seriously looking at divesting some of the valuable PSUs and which was absolutely required to meet that revenue shortfall because of the corporate tax cut proposal. Gradually you will see rerating of certain PSUs because of combination of divestment related triggers or because the government is seriously looking at doing it. You might be able to see some positive announcement in terms of the deadlines and the kind of operational numbers we are really looking at. BPCL definitely stands out. 

Also, CONCOR looks to be a strategic sale, there may be substantially higher value once the government decides to move out of it. You will see that trigger playing out. In case of ETF, if they are able to do it for a basket of companies, that would also merit a relook at the valuations at which some of the PSU companies are quoting at."
6,2019-10-03,GAIL,"New Delhi: The fourth tranche of Bharat-22 exchange traded fund received an overwhelming response from institutional players on Thursday with the portion reserved for anchor investors garnering bids worth Rs 13,500 crore, around 27 times of the size.

The ETF issue that opened on Thursday received subscriptions from investors like mutual funds, foreign portfolio investors, and insurance funds.

The follow-on fund offer will open for subscription for retail and other institutional investors on Friday. The investors would get a 3 per cent discount over the issue price.

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund is managing the Bharat-22 ETF's fund offer, through which the government aims to raise an initial amount of Rs 2,000 crore with a green-shoe option to retain over-subscription.

The government has not taken a final call on the amount that will be retained from the over-subscription but sources privy to the development said that the government may retain an over-subscription of Rs 6,000 crore, which will take the total size to Rs 8,000 crore.

As much as 25 per cent of the issue size, or Rs 500 crore was reserved for anchor investors who put in bids worth about Rs 13,569 crore. This translates into 27 times over the initial amount allocated to this category, ICICI Prudential MF said in a statement.

""We are happy to see the continued support received from anchor investors towards the FFO 2 of Bharat-22 ETF. Now, we look forward to active participation from non-anchor investor category tomorrow, whereby one has the opportunity to own some of the jewels of corporate India at a discounted price,"" said Nimesh Shah, MD and CEO, at ICICI Prudential MF.

The decision to come out with another tranche of the ETF has been taken after receiving robust response for earlier stake sale by the government in the product.

The government has so far raised around Rs 35,900 crore through Bharat-22 ETF -- Rs 14,500 crore was garnered in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was mopped up in June 2018 and Rs 13,000 crore in February this year.

Proceeds from the ETF will help the government meet its disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore for the current financial year.

18,2019-10-10,GAIL,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries has put off bidding for the new gas it plans to produce from eastern offshore KG-D6 block to next month following a request from potential bidders, sources said.

Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK, last month had put out Notice Inviting Offer (NIO) seeking bids from potential users for the 5 million standard cubic meters per day of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from the second quarter of 2020.

The bidding was to happen on October 11, according to the bid document.

However, the bidding has been postponed based on requests of some bidders given the holiday/festival period during October, sources said adding that bidding will now happen on November 6.

Bidders have been asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.

Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.

Reliance set a floor or minimum quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price -- which means bidders would have to quote 9 or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.

At USD 60 per barrel price, the gas price comes to USD 5.4 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).

The rate sought compares to the government-mandated USD 3.23 price that its currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in KG-D6 block get.

The government gas pricing policy, however, provides for a higher cap price for future gas produced from difficult fields like those in deepsea. This cap currently is fixed at USD 8.43 per mmBtu.

Reliance-BP is developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites and MJ -- by 2022 that can produce a peak of 30 mmscmd of gas.

The quantity offered for bidding in the NIO is 5 mmscmd from R-Series fields which will start production in mid-2020.

Sources said, peak output from R-Series is 12 mmscmd, while Satellites will produce another 7 mmscmd beginning mid-2021. MJ field, which will start production in the second half of 2022, also has a planned peak output of 12 mmscmd.

The NIO said the gas price would be lower of the quoted rate or the government-mandated ceiling for the difficult fields.

The formula Reliance is using to price gas for R-Series fields is different from its last price discovery it made for the coal seam gas (CBM) from its Sohagpur coal-bed methane blocks in Madhya Pradesh.

For Sohagpur CBM, it had in 2012 sought bids at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.

The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.

At USD 60 per barrel oil price, CBM from its Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 7.8. That formula was, however, rejected by the oil ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.

In 2017, it changed the formula by seeking bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document of CBM pricing.

Reliance ended up buying the CBM gas from its block after it bid deducting USD 1.836 per mmBtu, lower than USD 3.156 bid by rival Piramal Glass and USD 3.495 bid by state-owned GAIL."

16,2019-10-10,GAIL,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, went shopping for select PSU as well as private banks and infrastructure stocks in September when the benchmark BSE Sensex advanced nearly 4 per cent following a major corporate tax cut.

The fund house bought more than 1 crore shares each of the country’s biggest lender by assets, State Bank of India, and India's largest hydropower producer NHPC ahead of the September quarter earnings season that kicks off on October 10.

Shares of these PSUs have declined over 10 per cent since January, 2019.

Big bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala earlier this week said he sees a good opportunity in the PSU stocks. In an interaction with ETNOW, he said, “There is a very good opportunity in PSU stocks across the board. The biggest beneficiary of the tax cut would be the PSU firms.”

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other top buys in September included Axis Bank, Coal India, ITC, Bharat Electronics, BPCL, HPCL, Ashoka Buildcon, Federal Bank, ICICI Bank, L&T, GAIL, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharma, Kirloskar Ferrous and eClerx Services, among others.

Bharat Petroleum’s (BPCL) share price has risen nearly 40 per cent since September after the government announced a plan to sell its 53 per cent stake in the company. Edelweiss Securities sees more upside in the stock given its material gap in valuations vis-à-vis top global refineries.

The brokerage recently came out with a ‘buy’ rating on BPCL with a revised price target of Rs 632 per share (earlier: Rs 442).

Reliance Securities is positive on the pharmaceutical sector and has advised investors to stay stock-specific.

Ace Mutual Fund database showed HDFC AMC held 5.44 crore shares of Axis Bank as of September 30 against 4.96 crore a month earlier. Likewise, it also bought over 10 lakh shares each in ICICI Bank and Federal Bank, indicating that the fund house has developed a liking for select private sector lenders.

Sunil Subramaniam, MD & CEO, Sundaram Mutual said NBFCs and public sector banks are going to be fairly less active and private sector banks would be a safe play as they have a healthy mix of retail and corporate books. “Year-on-year, their earnings should still show decent growth,” he said.

HDFC AMC also added shares of hotel firms Chalet Hotels (9 lakh shares) and Indian Hotels (5 lakh shares). Besides, it bought Mishra Dhatu Nigam (9.49 lakh shares), JSW Steel (9.06 lakh shares), ONGC (8.17 lakh shares), Neyveli Lignite (8 lakh shares), REC (7.46 lakh shares), Greenply Industries (7.30 lakh shares) and Aster DM Healthcare (7.18 lakh shares), Garden Reach (6.94 lakh shares) and HDFC (6.82 lakh shares).

The fund house appeared to have found a contra bet in auto stocks, as the sector continued to reel under pressure due to weak demand for more than a year now. The fund house added some shares of Tata Motors (16,892 shares), Hero MotoCorp (27,933), M&M (21,358) and Maruti Suzuki (1,561), but sold 15,302 shares of Bajaj Auto during the month.

Maruti Suzuki cut production by 17.48 per cent in September, making it the eighth straight month of lower output.

From among major blue chip firms, the fund house added 4 lakh shares of the oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries (RIL) and 3.71 lakh shares of HDFC Bank. IT companies Tech Mahindra, Sonata Software, NIIT Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services also drew interest of the AMC.

JM Financial has a ‘buy’ rating on RIL with an immediate target price of Rs 1,346 and thereafter Rs 1,365.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 98 companies and offloaded shares in 53 others from across sectors. With an asset under management of Rs 3.46 lakh crore, it held 308 stocks as of September 30, 2019.

Among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month included over 10 lakh shares each in Infosys, Edelweiss Financial, YES Bank, Ashok Leyland, BHEL, S Chand, Shriram Transport, Rites and Tata Chemicals.

It also sold over 1 lakh shares of select midcap and largecap firms such as Divi’s Lab, Dabur India, Titan, Cipla, Wipro, Adani Ports and Petronet LNG, among others.

Titan shares declined as much as 6 per cent in intraday trade on October 9 after the company reported a 2 per cent decline in jewellery business revenue for September quarter of 2019-20 despite a 7 per cent growth in retail sales.

“Retail sales (secondary sales) grew 7 per cent in Q2 FY20 but revenues declined 2 per cent year-on-year in Q2FY220, due to the adverse impact of hedges matured during the quarter,” the company said in a BSE filing."

21,2019-10-11,GAIL,"All through September, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company went around shopping FMCG, PSU, financials, insurance, power and pharma stocks as the broader market witnessed big ups and downs following a major corporate tax cut.

BSE benchmark Sensex ended the month 4 per cent higher.

India’s second biggest fund house by asset under management bought over 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and PSU hydropower producer NHPC. Shares of these companies are down over 10 per cent each on a year-to-date (YTD) basis till October 9.

The money manager also bought more than 20 lakh shares each of Axis Bank, Equitas Holdings, Cipla, ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, GAIL (India), NTPC, BHEL, Power Grid and Kalpataru Power Transmission.

Barring ICICI Bank (up 20 per cent YTD), Kalpataru Power Transmission (up 16 per cent YTD) and Axis Bank (up 9 per cent YTD), other stocks are down 41 per cent YTD.

Financial stocks are drawing interest again following the recent debt and credit crisis in the market.

 “We are positive on select private banks and insurance counters, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Lombard,” said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Power stocks, which have taken a huge beating for several months, too are buzzing again.

“Traction in power demand could be a tad softer in the ensuing quarters. We look ahead to the new Electricity Act, which is expected to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament. We maintain our preference for NTPC, CESC and Tata Power,” Edelweiss Securities said.



ICICI Prudential also bought additional shares of IT majors HCL Technologies (18 lakh), Wipro (5.88 lakh) and Tata Consultancy Services (4.64 lakh).

Country’s largest IT services firm TCS on Thursday reported a 1.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 8,042 crore for September quarter, which was below Street expectations.

Haitong Securities has cut the target price for TCS to Rs 1,925 (Rs 2,170 earlier) post Q2 numbers. “We were surprised by the quantum of the miss on both revenue and operating profit margin in Q2,” the brokerage said.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added Bank of Baroda (16 lakh shares), Punjab National Bank (15.43 lakh shares), LIC Housing Finance (11.50 lakh shares), YES Bank (7.80 lakh shares), Kotak Mahindra Bank (5.28 lakh shares) and HDFC Bank (4.01 lakh shares) in the financial space.

On the other hand, it added Bharti Airtel (11 lakh shares) and Vodafone Idea (4.77 lakh shares) from the telecom space. Telecom stocks got a lift on Wednesday after Reliance Jio announced plans to levy a call connect charge on customers, easing the price pressure on its rivals.

Swiss brokerage UBS said Jio’s move is “a positive development for the sector, with a potential revenue and Ebitda upside of 10-12 per cent and 35-40 per cent,” since it will result in a higher outgo from the customer.

“If all operators start charging 6 paise per minute for all outgoing calls, the annual sector revenue and Ebitda can increase by Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 13,000 crore, respectively, although these numbers would trend downwards with gradually balancing (voice) traffic patterns,” UBS said.

The positive impact on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), it said, could be 13-15 per cent for Airtel, 55-60 per cent for Vodafone idea, and 32-36 per cent for Jio.

The fund house has also raised bets on the insurers, including SBI Life Insurance, General Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI Lombard General Insurance. These stocks have continued to outperform the broader indices amid the NBFC crisis this year.

Emkay Global Financial Services is overweight on ICICI Prudential (IPRU) and SBI Life Insurance (SBIL). “The volatility in equity markets and higher surrenders are the key downside risks for IPRU. For SBIL, the reduction in promoter stake to meet the minimum public shareholding (MPS) guidelines (needs 2.1 per cent stake sale by September 2020) is a key concern,” it added.

In the auto and auto ancillary sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 9.77 lakh shares of Ashok Leyland, followed by Motherson Sumi (6.19 lakh shares), Minda Industries ( 5.49 lakh shares) and Maruti Suzuki (1.34 lakh shares).

The fund house also checked into Balrampur Chini Mills, Dalmia Bharat, Polycab India, Rail Vikas Nigam and Wheels India. On the other hand, it completely exited Asahi India, Hatsun Agro, Jet Airways, Monsanto, Shalby, Tata Communications and Techno Electric.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 431 companies, and sold in 89 across sectors. It held 550 stocks as of September 30.

Tata Power, SAIL, Larsen & Toubro, SJVN, Hexaware Tech, ONGC, Spice Jet, JSW Energy, Container Corporation, Infosys, Asian Paints, CESC, Avenue Supermarts, MCX, Coal India, Engineers India and Gujarat State Petronet were among the top stocks the fund house offloaded during the month."

Nifty50 opened positive and extended its gains towards the 11,360 level on Friday, but remained highly volatile throughout the session as it traded in a broader trading range of 180 points.

The index formed a bullish candle on the daily as well as weekly charts forming long upper and lower shadows which implied that every dip got bought into. At the same time, supplies remined intact at higher levels.

Now, it needs to hold above 11,250 level to witness a bounce towards 11,400 and then 11,500 level, while on the downside major support is seen at 11,100 level.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,200 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 12,000 levels. Marginal Put writing was seen at 11,000 and then 11,300 while there was Call unwinding at all immediate strike prices. The options data suggested a wider trading range between 11,000 and 11,600 levels.

India VIX fell 0.52 per cent to 17.14.

Bank Nifty remained highly volatile and continued to trade in a wider range between 27,500 and 28,600 levels. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and a small-bodied candle on the weekly scale with a long upper shadow which suggested selling pressure at higher levels. The index has been stuck in a broader trading range between 27,600 and 28,800 levels from last six sessions. Volatile swings are likely to continue in this wide range.

Now, the index needs to hold and sustain above 28,250 level to witness a bounce towards the 28,550-28,800 zone while on the downside major support is seen at 27,500 level.

Nifty futures closed positive at 11,318 level with a gain of 0.57 per cent. There was long buildup in Biocon, Indiabulls Housing, Tata Global, PVR and Cipla while shorts were seen in RBL Bank, GAIL, TCS and IndiGo.

25,2019-10-15,GAIL,"In the past six months, movement of key benchmark indices has been range-bound. This situation is likely to persist for some time. Experts point out that it has become difficult to predict demand across key segments in the present economic situation. Scattered and erratic buying trends imply that consumers have funds but they would spend only if a deal suits their cost arithmetic. Such times merit investments in a basic theme which works in almost all cycles of markets — multi-cap schemes.

The very structure of multi-cap schemes allows investments in companies of all sizes is an attractive proposition in present market conditions. Among multi-cap schemes, Kotak Standard Multicap is a distinguished performer. Three factors work in the scheme’s favour: In comparison with its peers, it has a low expense ratio. Second, it is the scheme’s performance which stands out. In the past five-year and 10-year periods, the scheme has given 12.1% and 13% returns respectively, while the average returns of its peers over the same periods are 9% and 11% respectively.

Third, in terms of composition, the scheme is welldiversified in large and midsized companies. Close to 77% of the scheme’s portfolio is in large-sized companies, which helps mitigate volatility in the scheme’s returns.

Expert Take

Harshvardhan Roongta, CFP, Roongta Securities
This is one of the few schemes which has been a consistent performer across market cycles. The investment style is growth-oriented. Being a multi-cap fund, the fund manager has the liberty to invest in quality companies irrespective of size. A major portion of the portfolio is in largecaps which provides relative stability from volatility. Investors looking for a quality multicap fund can choose this scheme without hesitation."
28,2019-10-15,GAIL,"SBI Mutual Fund, the largest investor in equities among mutual fund houses, went shopping for power, energy and banking & financial stocks in September, a month that saw the government announce a major corporate tax cut to boost growth.

The fund house bought over two crore shares of Axis Bank in September amid buzz that the government may offload a part of its stake in the lender held via Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI). The stock climbed over 3 per cent in the month.

Analysts have been largely bullish on the private lenders, including Axis Bank lately. “If I want to play safely, I will buy HDFC Bank. If I want to play re-rating, I will buy ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. If at all I want a risk-on trade, I will go for IndusInd Bank. These are the three-four names that I would stick to in the banking space,” said Gautam Shroff, Co-Head for Institutional Equities at Edelweiss.

SBI Mutual Fund bought a number of stocks from the financial services sector, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Chola Investment and Finance and City Union Bank. The last name was a new addition to its portfolio.



City Union Bank has been delivering steady returns to investors through these tumultuous times. At a time when a whole host of bank stocks — YES Bank, IDBI Bank, The Federal Bank, State Bank of India — have disappointed, City Union Bank shares have rallied 13 per cent on a year-to-date basis. The scrip has delivered 1,100 per cent return in last 10 years.

Apollo Tyres, Ipca Laboratories and Prestige Estate were among other stocks SBI MF added to its portfolio during the month. Meanwhile, it completely exited Eris Lifesciences, IndiaMART Intermesh, Eveready Industries, Indian Energy Exchange, Mayur Uniquoters, NBCC and Raymond.

Among the asset manager’s top 30 buys in September, power and energy stocks featured prominently. They included BPCL, Power Grid, GAIL India, JSW Energy, Indian Oil, ONGC, GE T&D India and Power Finance.

In September, BSE Power index climbed 2.5 per cent. This jump came on the back of a 10 per cent drop in the index in the previous two months. BSE Energy index, on the other hand, surged over 8 per cent during the month. 

The fund house sold more than 3.5 crore shares of Tata Power in September, followed by Indiabulls Housing (39 lakh) and SBI (35 lakh). It also shed shares of capital goods and IT companies like Bharat Electronics, BHEL, Wipro and Infosys.

IT companies have lost favour on Dalal Street lately. UBS and IIFL both are underweight on the IT sector. Nifty IT index has been flat on a year-to-date basis.

SBI MF is the largest equity investor among asset management companies in India with total equity exposure of Rs 1,47,422 crore. Overall, its assets under management stood Rs 3,17,627 crore at the end of September, making it the third largest fund housing in the country."

26,2019-10-15,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet may by next month consider a proposal to hive off state-run gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd's pipeline business into a separate entity but its sale to a strategic investor may not happen before 2022, sources privy to the development said.

GAIL is India's biggest natural gas marketing and trading firm and owns more than two-thirds of the country's 16,234-km pipeline network, giving it a stranglehold on the market.

Users of natural gas have often complained about not getting access to GAIL's 11,551-km pipeline network to transport their fuel.

Sources said to resolve the conflict arising out of the same entity owning the two jobs, bifurcating GAIL is being considered.

A proposal is likely to be moved before the Union Cabinet for transferring the pipeline business into a 100 per cent subsidiary, they said adding the proposal may be considered and approved by the Cabinet this month or latest by November.

After the Cabinet approval, a consultant will be appointed to transfer the pipeline business into a separate subsidiary. This would take 8-10 months to accomplish, they said.

However, selling off the pipeline subsidiary to a strategic investor is not likely before 2022 as the thinking in the government is that the gas market will not be mature before that and state support would be needed for GAIL to accomplish building a national gas pipeline grid.

GAIL will continue to own the marketing business as also the stakes in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.

Previously, the government was considering transferring marketing business into a separate subsidiary for a sell-off at a later date but now a hive off of pipeline business is being considered.

GAIL has multiple long-term contracts to import gas in its liquid form (LNG) from countries such as the US and no strategic buyer would like to take the responsibility of those, particularly when the fuel is available at a cheaper price in the spot or current market, the sources said.

They said it is now being considered that GAIL continues with the marketing business that would include all the sale contracts as also city gas retailing.

Post-2022, the pipeline business can be sold to a strategic investor such as Canadian asset management company Brookfield that recently bought a 1,480-km pipeline owned by Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL).

The sources said the strategic partner will operate the pipelines and give access on a non-discriminatory basis to any entity wanting to transport gas either from a natural gas field or an LNG import terminal to consumers.

GAIL already keeps separate accounts for its gas pipeline and marketing businesses, making it easier to split them into two entities.

By unbundling GAIL and opening the sector, the government hopes to increase gas use to 15 per cent of the energy mix by 2030 from current 6.2 per cent.

When talk of splitting first started in January last year, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had stated that GAIL should focus on laying pipelines, suggesting hiving of the marketing business.

Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off the gas business of ONGC, GAIL owns and operates over 11,500-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country.

The sources said the oil ministry has not been very happy with GAIL's performance in building the pipeline network. Besides, there is a possible conflict of interest in its role as an infrastructure provider and carrier.

GAIL did not start executing the Rs 12,940 crore Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra pipeline until the government agreed to give 40 per cent of the project cost as a grant from the budget. The pipeline takes the gas to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency, Varanasi.

Plans to split the company had been discussed more than a decade back too but these did not materialise.

The sources said refiners Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) had in 2017 evinced interest in acquiring GAIL to expand their gas marketing business.

GAIL also owns a petrochemical plant at Pata in Uttar Pradesh, which too could be sold to either IOC or BPCL.

The company had in the past resisted the split on grounds that it's gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm's length and hence do not need to be separated.

GAIL's marketing business formed 76 per cent of its 2018-19 total sales and about 30 per cent pre-tax profit.

The government has a 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL India."

32,2019-10-16,GAIL,"The skills development ministry, on Wednesday, said that state governments and industry has together committed to train 7 lakh apprentices in the current fiscal at the just concluded 15-day apprenticeship pakhwada organised by the skills development ministry.

“The industry has committed to engage 4.5 lakh more apprentices with States committing another 2.5 lakh apprentices,” skills development ministry said. MSDE has pledged Rs 560 crore to state governments to promote demand-driven and industry-linked skill development and signed 22 MoUs with various states through third party aggregators (TPAs).

The number of apprentices has almost doubled after the 15-day Pakhwada. In 2016, government had introduced comprehensive reforms to the Apprenticeship Act, 1961, a move that saw about 7.5 lakh apprentices engaged in a span of two-and-a-half years.

As many as 8 PSUs including Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL), Cochin Shipyard, Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL), Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), International Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) committed to train about 35,000 apprentices. Additionally, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) signed an MoU with NSTI Mumbai to train solar technicians for sustainable energy sector.

“It is important to understand and map the demand for skilling programs in SME cluster associations in growth areas and industries, especially in the rural, agricultural and tribal areas of the country. In fact, we need to reduce our dependence on imports and move towards growing skills in traditional skills that will inch us closer to realizing the ambition of creating a five-trillion dollar economy,” MSME minister Nitin Gadkari said.

“Apprenticeship can provide hands-on training to candidates and provide a better industry exposure to help them gain confidence in a working environment. New job roles will need new skill sets and it is therefore important to inspire the youth to equip themselves with industry-relevant skill sets,” skills development minister Mahendra Nath Pandey said."
33,2019-10-16,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is likely to provide Rs 5,500 crore viability gap funding (VGF) to North-East gas grid.

The Prime Minister’s Office has agreed to the oil ministry’s proposal of extending 60% budgetary support to the Rs 9,200-crore North-East gas grid project, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the proposal would soon be sent to the Cabinet.

The Modi government wants to turn India into a gasbased economy and is encouraging massive investments in gas production, transportation and import terminals to have increased countrywide access to the fossil fuel. The government plans to raise the share of natural gas in country’s primary energy mix to 15% by 2030 from 6% now.

The 1,600-km North-East gas grid will help connect the region to the proposed national grid at Guwahati. Indradhanush Gas Grid (IGGL), a joint venture of Indian Oil, ONGC, GAIL, Oil India and Numaligarh Refinery, plans to lay the North-East gas grid, which is unlikely to be viable without central funding. This project needs support as was extended in 2016 to Gail’s Jagdishpur-Haidia and Bokaro-Dhamra Gas Pipeline project, company executives said.

Capital grant of Rs 5,176 crore, or 40% of the project cost, for the 2,500 km pipeline project of GAIL, has been given. Lack of state financial support so far has delayed the launch of the North-East gas grid project by almost a year.

Indradhanush Gas Grid, set up in August 2018, had hoped to receive the Cabinet’s approval on funding ahead of the general election but the process got delayed."

36,2019-10-18,GAIL,"Many state-run oil companies are unlikely to switch to the lower corporate tax regime this year as it would lead to a loss of accumulated tax credit worth thousands of crores and hurt their annual profits.

The government had in September announced a steep 10-12-percentage-point reduction in corporate tax rate to 25.17 per cent to push investments and, in turn, lift the sagging economy. Switch to the new tax regime would require the companies to give up all current tax incentives and exemptions and forego all unused Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credits.

Executives at ONGC, Indian Oil
, GAIL and HPCL said they are yet to take a call but there is a high possibility that they would switch to the new format only after most of their MAT credit is exhausted. MAT credit is similar to paid advance taxes that could be set off against future tax liabilities.

“It doesn’t make sense to give up so much of accumulated tax credit, incentives and exemptions,” said an executive at ONGC, which has MAT credit of around ₹5,000 crore. “We would seek transition once we have exhausted this credit.”

Indian Oil Corporation has a MAT credit of ₹2,700 crore and GAIL about ₹2,000 crore. “It will be hard to exhaust so much in just a year. We will have to see how fast we can switch,” an IOC executive said.

Companies have the flexibility to adopt new rates next year, but they can’t revert to the old rates once they have switched.

Accelerated depreciation is another factor driving some firms to defer a transition. “It is beneficial to high-capex firms like ours. This will also have to be foregone,” said the IOC executive. Indian Oilplans to spend ₹25,000 crore, while ONGC has a capex of ₹33,000 crore for 2019-20. The combined capex target of all the oil PSUs for FY2020 is ₹94,000 crore.

Some companies are waiting for the direct tax code which is expected next year. “It would bring more clarity on tax issues. There is little sense in adopting a new tax regime now and then again figure out a new code next year,” said the ONGC executive.

According to a survey by ratings agency CRISIL, released earlier this week, a third of the companies from the capex-heavy sectors like power and oil and gas wants to continue with the current tax regime. But, most of the companies from sectors like auto, chemicals, textiles, gems and jewellery, and retail are in favour of an immediate switch."
37,2019-10-18,GAIL,"India’s largest domestic institutional investor used the market slump in July-August to do portfolio overhaul by dumping many midcap and smallcap stocks, even as it did some value picking on select private sector banks, pharma, oil & gas, jewellery and non-banking finance counters.

Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the public sector insurance giant, offloaded shares, mainly midcaps and smallcaps, across sectors – from cement and construction, real estate, engineering, gas transmission, generation to textiles.

Equity benchmark Sensex tumbled nearly 2 per cent during the period.

Latest shareholding data showed LIC increased stakes in several Sensex stocks, including the country’s major lenders HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.

LIC’s stake in HDFC Bank increased to 2.75 per cent at the end of September quarter from 2.52 per cent in the previous quarter ended June 30. Likewise, its stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank rose to 2.28 per cent from 1.95 per cent, shareholding data from corporate database Ace Equity showed.

Shares of HDFC Bank have rallied 14 per cent year to date till October 16, while those of Kotak Mahindra Bank risen 28 per cent. Sensex is up nearly 7 per cent in the same period.

IIFL Securities is positive on Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) with a price target of Rs 1,850. “KMB is well positioned versus its peers due to higher market capitalisation, a strong liability franchise and benign asset quality, which will allow it to gain further market share,” the brokerage said.

IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and mortgage major Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) were among other Sensex companies in which LIC increased stake during the quarter gone by.

TCS last week reported a 1.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 8,042 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. ICICI Securities has a ‘reduce’ rating on the IT major with a price target of Rs 1,855.



Among the companies that have reported their shareholding data so far, LIC held a stake in 150. That number will be much bigger once more shareholding data is made available. The DII had 310 stock in its portfolio at the end of June quarter.

In pharma, LIC raised stakes in Pfizer, Granules India and Cadila Healthcare, but cut holdings in Glaxosmithkline Pharmaceuticals. In gems & jewellery, it increased its stake in Rajesh Exports.

The domestic equity market was under severe selling pressure through much of September quarter amid sustained outflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), geopolitical tensions and a crippling slowdown in the domestic economy. FIIs offloaded more than Rs 22,000 crore worth in Indian stocks through July-September.

From other sectors, LIC increased stake in consumer good firms Voltas and Havells India, two-wheeler major TVS Motor and cement giant ACC.

TVS Motor Company on October 17 reported a 20.68 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 255 crore compared with Rs 211.30 crore reported for the same quarter last year. The numbers included an exceptional gain of Rs 76 crore from reversal of NCCD provision for a Himachal plant pertaining to earlier years in pursuant of a favourable order from CESTAT.

In the NBFC space, LIC raised stake in HDFC to 4.05 per cent from 3.73 per cent at the end of June. It also hiked stake in Edelweiss Financial Services to 2.08 per cent from 1.14 per cent.

Among others, Indraprastha Gas, GAIL (India) and Hindustan Zinc also saw a rise in LIC holdings.

On the other hand, the insurance behemoth brought down its stake in Axis Bank to 9.44 per cent at the end of September from 10.37 per cent at the end of June. It also reduced stake in JK Lakshmi Cement (from 2.46 per cent to 2.43 per cent), MTNL (14.56 per cent to 13.62 per cent), Lakshmi Machine Works (7.34 per cent to 7.24 per cent) and Binny (2.03 per cent to 1.98 per cent).

Other companies where LIC sold shares during the quarter included Arvind Smartspaces, Simplex Realty, Crompton Greaves, Zydus Wellness, ABB India, GMR Infra, BHEL, Empire Industries and Tamil Nadu Newsprint."
38,2019-10-22,GAIL,"New Delhi: The country’s largest lender, State Bank of India, has sought immediate government intervention to salvage gas-based power plants with total capacity of nearly 25,000 megawatts and worth about Rs 1 lakh crore from becoming non-performing assets.

A senior government official said the ministries of finance and power were looking into the matter and a revival scheme was under discussion. Senior officials of the two ministries are likely to meet on Thursday to further discuss the issue.

In a letter to the finance ministry, SBI has sought a long-term policy intervention to revive gas-based plants, people in the know said. It has asked for financial support from collections of coal energy through the national clean energy and environment fund. It has sought also a ‘must-run’ status to gas-power stations, similar to renewable energy plants, and reimbursement of fixed costs from the clean-energy fund to power distribution companies that enter into long-term power purchase contracts with these gas-based facilities. The bank has also sought bringing natural gas under the ambit of goods and services tax. It said despite the full support from lenders to the projects, those were still in stress due to lack of locally produced fuel.





The power ministry is working on a scheme proposing to run the gas-based power plants on imported LNG, to be made affordable through haircuts by central and state governments, power companies and gas transporters.

The proposed revival scheme is an extension of the previous rounds of subsidised gas auction schemes to power plants. However, this time, the ministry plans to aggregate power from these plants through reverse online auction and do away with the subsidy component. A gas aggregator is likely to be assigned and the subsidy component will arise only if the price of imported fuel increases. Giving power plants an option to sell power on power bourses is also being explored.

The proposed haircuts include waiver of state and central taxes on imported LNG, waiver of GST on re-gasification and transportation of the fuel, reduction of pipeline tariff charges and marketing margin by state-run gas transporter Gail. Electricity transmission charges for stranded gas-based projects are also proposed to be sacrificed. Power companies will not make any return on equity.

The government had launched the first e-regasified liquid natural gas (e-RLNG) scheme in March 2015 for two years. The scheme was discontinued after two bidding rounds where the power ministry received aggressive bids from companies. Power companies have been demanding the government restart the scheme as about 8,000 mw capacity is completely stranded while the rest is stressed."

Nifty50 opened positive on Friday but oscillated in a wide trading range between 11,500 and 11,650 levels. It formed a Hammer pattern on the daily scale and a small-bodied candle on the weekly chart, as buying emerged at lower levels while the hurdles remains intact.

The index has been stuck between 11,500 and 11,700 levels for last five sessions and now needs to hold its support to aim for the upper band of the trading range at 11,700, while a decisive hold below 11,550 can negate the current short-term bullish setup and take Nifty to its downside support in the 11,480 – 11,450 zone.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,700 levels. There was Call writing at 11,600 and then 11,550 levels, while Put writing was seen at 11,500 and then 11,550 level. Options data suggested a trading range between 11,450 and 11,750 levels.

India VIX fell 5.70% to 15.31.

Bank Nifty remained volatile and traded in a broad range of 500 points for most part of the session. It formed a Hammer pattern on daily scale, as dips got bought into while a long-legged Doji on the weekly scale suggested a tug of war between the bulls and the bears.

The index is finding multiple supports near 28,800 mark, while supply pressure remained intact at higher levels. Nifty has to hold above 29,200 to witness a bounce towards 29,700 level, while a hold below the same level may make it drift towards 29,000 and then 28,800 levels.

Nifty futures closed flat at 11,604 level. There was long buildup in Star, Glenmark, UBL, Sun TV and Cipla while shorts were seen in Cummins, Torrent Power, Bharti Infratel, GAIL and Marico.

47,2019-10-27,GAIL,"Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty lost more than half a per cent during the week ended October 25 as the market witnessed some selling pressure, mainly due to weakness on the IT counter amid mixed earnings and the Infosys whistleblower crisis.

The 30-share Sensex lost 240 points to settle the week at 39,058 against 39,298 on October 18, while the 50-share Nifty fell 78 points to 11,583.

“The market remained volatile in the holiday-shortened week. The Q2 earnings numbers showed hits and misses but expectation for an earnings improvement from next quarter based on corporate tax cuts held investor nerves steady. Concerns over the Infosys whistleblower crisis impacted the stock and the overall IT sector,” Geojit Financial Services said in a note.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the week.


State Bank of India
Shares of State Bank of India shares climbed 7.19 per cent on Friday after the company reported a nearly six-fold jump in consolidated net profit for September quarter.

Telecom index tanked
Sector-wise, BSE Telecom index retreated the most at 7 per cent during the week. It was followed by Teck (down 5.93 per cent), IT (down 5.69 per cent) and Metal (down 2 per cent) indices. However, BSE Healthcare index, Bankex and Consumer Durables and Realty indices gained between 0.88 and 2.08 per cent. The telecom counter took a hit after the Supreme Court allowed the Centre’s plea to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about Rs 92,000 crore from the telecom service providers.


Infy, Bharti Infra Nifty top losers
Bharti Infratel and Infosys tanked nearly 17 per cent each during the week. It was followed by Tata Motors (down 7.3 per cent), Adani Ports (down 5.36 per cent), IndusInd Bank (down 5.26 per cent) and GAIL (down 5 per cent). Infosys took a hit after a letter by anonymous employees surfaced, accusing Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salil Parekh and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Nilanjan Roy of unethical practices for several quarters.


Ujjivan Small Bank IPO okayed
Ujjivan Small Finance Bank has received markets regulator Sebi’s go ahead to raise Rs 1,200 crore through an initial public offer (IPO).

48,2019-10-28,GAIL,"SAMEET CHAVAN

Chief Analyst -- Technical derivativesm Angel Broking

Where are We?
Market participants had to undergo a lot of stress as we didn’t see any respite in the market, if we keep aside last one month. The pain is still not out of the system as we can see some indecisive swings thereafter. In the midst of it all, the market is at a very interesting juncture.


What is in Store? This week, the benchmark index did nothing as we witnessed the Nifty moving in a 150–180 points range to conclude the week with marginal cuts. As per our recent ‘Time Retracement’ analysis, the Nifty has reversed exactly in September and is now well above the recent lows. But the question remains: Are we going to see sustained rally from here or not? This would probably be the toughest question to answer. But, we are still hopeful as we can see the bulls trying to flex their muscles a bit and hence expect some good days to come. On the daily chart, we can see a breakout happening during last week from an ‘Inverse Head and Shoulders’ pattern.


What Should Investors Do?
Although the follow-up move is lacking, one should remain upbeat as long as the recent swing low of 11090 is intact. Meanwhile, 11450–11350 can be seen as immediate support. On the higher side, we could see the rally extending towards 11850–11900 first, or may be beyond 12000 once the Nifty manages to sustain above 11700. The banking index has been a laggard of late, which needs to step up and we expect it to happen soon. From the automobile sector, we continue to like Maruti, Bajaj Auto and Bharat Forge. Banking giant SBI posted stellar numbers on Friday which has lit up the entire PSU banking basket. In the F&O mid-cap space, we have been persistently advising Sun TV, MGL and Tata Elxsi, they are likely to extend their bull run. In the paint space, Kansai Nerolac is poised for some catch-up rally to its larger peers.

ANDEEP PORWAL

Technical analyst, Ashika Stock Broking

Where are We? The festive mood and state election verdicts failed to cheer up the market. The index traded on a subdued note since the beginning of the week gone by. Quarterly earnings acted as a trigger for stock-specific volatility. On the sectoral front, the IT index remains a major underperformer with a drop of 3% while bargain hunting trades were being observed in PSU banks in the week gone by.


What is in Store? Trend exhaustion is being observed in the benchmark index as price remains below the overhead resistance post the reversal from the key Fibonacci ratio of 61.80% (reference range of 10670-11695).The formation of indecisive and reversal candlesticks near the trendline of a downward sloping channel on the daily chart confirms that price remains near the point of exhaustion. We are likely to see selling pressure mounting till the time the index trades below the intermediate high of 11715. The bearish view negates in the event of a breakout above the overhead resistance. In the short-term, key support remains at the level of 11300.


What Should Investors Do? Traders and investors should remain on the edge given the swift turn of the tide because of a lack of follow-up in both the scenarios of long and short. However, swing trading certainly is a good strategy/approach to make most out of the prevailing phase. Stock specific, we recommend longs in Mindtree, TCS and SBI and expect a short-term rally; while Bajaj Finserv and CESC are likely to trade with a negative bias.

 BHAVIN MEHTA
VP-Derivatives Strategist, Dolat Capital

Where are We? The recent recovery in the Nifty was seen post FM’s bigbang corporate tax cut announcement, that saw the index moving from levels of ~10700 to 11700 in just two trading sessions, after which we have seen about 21 sessions of consolidation. In this period, we saw the Nifty unable to manage to close above 11600 despite multiple attempts. The ongoing earnings season seems to be decent so far with very few misses for Nifty50.


What is in Store?
Two sectors where we believe institutional investors are most focussed are private sector banks (financials continue to hold high weights) as well as FMCG companies. Both these sectors continue to witness good amount of accumulation as well as long build-up.


What Should Investors Do? 
For the Nifty, we will advise to go long in case of mean reversion to short-term averages that lie in the range of 11300-11400 or in case of sustainable close above 11650 (at least two trading sessions). A breakout on the upside will lead to the Nifty moving towards 11950-12000. We remain positive on private banks (Axis, ICICI & HDFC Bank); FMCG (HUL and Dabur) auto (Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto and Eicher). Contra traders can look at an opportunity to buy into select stocks from metals (Tata Steel), PSUs (SBI, GAIL, SAIL and PFC). On other hand, we are concerned with IT (Infy and Mindtree) and NBFCs. Participants may also look at shorting strangles for the next month specifically in names where earnings have been out and momentum seems to have subsided: TCS, Hero MotoCorp, L&T, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Bank and ACC."

61,2019-10-31,GAIL,"If the government unlocks value from non-strategic assets, there is big money to be made in PSUs. But if the government takes the easy path and is not willing to back tough decisions, be mentally prepared that market may be flat or even down from here, says Rahul Chadha, Co-CIO, Mirae Asset Global Investments. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Last time we spoke, you said you were very bullish on India. Given the rally from the recent lows -- about 10% on the index and 15-20-25% in mid and smallcap stocks, are markets fairly priced and will the next move come if the economic recovery becomes clear?The pessimism was so pervasive that one realised there was an opportunity in terms of mispricing in markets. If the policy response came from government, obviously one would make money over there, risk reward was favourable. Before we talk about India, let me talk about what is happening globally. We have seen an ECB kind of expanding of the balance sheets. Fed is expanding the balance sheets. Ahead of the US elections, we have seen a temporary truce between US and China. So all the concerns in the mind of global investors, are kind of abating. 

This year, $200-230 billion moved out of global equity funds. Globally, resurgence is very low. Risk reward in terms of investing in EMs Asia is favourable. With that as a backdrop, one remains constructive on markets. But coming to India specifically, there are parts of markets -- consumer names -- which are expensive. We are seeing earnings rollover from these names. As these are great companies, they will correct 5-10% over the next 12 months. But there are pockets of opportunity in financials. So, well managed corporate banks, insurance companies despite the good runup, there could be pullbacks. 

Utilities and some of the PSUs have not participated in the rally. If the government gets its act right on unlocking value from these non-strategic assets, there is big money to be made in PSUs. 


My experience of tracking some of the global funds is that global investors normally love to hate Indian PSUs but you are making a case that at the current level, if BPCL or SCI disinvestment happens, you will be open to buying PSUs?There are great companies but those great companies may not be good stocks when you are buying them 45-50 times earnings 18 months out and in a period where nominal GDP is not going to grow at 15%. This is something we have said time and again. We are in a slower for longer world. Growth rates have to get realigned. India which used to grow at 7-8% real GDP, nominal going to 14-15%, will probably do a 5-6% best case and nominal GDP is going to 9-10%. Within this paradigm, you got to find businesses which should be relevant 5-7 years from now. You have to see where risk rewards are favourable and that is where some of these reasonably well run PSUs within added optionality of government looking to divest become attractive.


You have always said that you buy Indian companies because of great corporate governance standards. The return on equity, the return on capital is one of the highest in the world. But given how levered many of their personal balance sheets are, would this corporate governance premium that Indian stocks have historically commanded will get challenged?It works on a stock specific basis. We have seen certain private sector banks get re-rated as they have managed the NPA cycle well. The governance levels have improved over the years. At the same time, we have seen certain entities where the governance issues have come to the forefront and those names have got re-rated. The market is discerning enough to act on this in a case by case basis.


Reliance is one of the names in your basket. They are hiving off Jio and taking the debts on the books of a holding company. Today they have come out with a tirade against some of the incumbent telcos and that ongoing tussle is continuing there. There’s still a question mark on the Aramco deal. How are you perceiving them?A couple of points. What they have done over the last two-three years is commendable. The way they have built the telecom business, the way they have built the retail business and there is huge headroom for growth in both these businesses over the next three to five years. They also benefit from IMO coming through and better refining margins over the next 12 to 18 months. These are the positives.

The negatives obviously come from the stressed balance sheet which is where you would want deleveraging either through some stake sale to a strategic partner. So, one is watching that space closely. The stocks have done well. It is highly likely that it will take a breather for a couple of quarters before market gets more clarity on these growth businesses which is digital and retail.


How you are looking at the overall telecom space given the news flow. It is nothing but dues and debt repayment from some of the players despite the consolidation. What is the way ahead? What should shareholders do with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea that has been reduced to a Rs 4 stock?What is positive is that the government has acted very quickly after the Supreme Court judgment because monopolies never help a country from a longer term perspective. They are not beneficial for a consumer from a medium-term perspective and that is what the government realises. The committee of secretaries being formed is looking into the fact as to how to revive the sector and make sure that it remains more than a one or two players sector. A three-player market is a fairly consolidated market and one is hopeful that in due course, fair pricing comes to the market and the overall revenue pipe grows basically.


In last 10 to 20 years, one trade that has really worked in India is private sector banks as PSU banks lost market share. For the next 5-10 years, what do you think that secular trade could be? The private sector bank trades continue although mean valuations of stocks which are expensive may compound at a slower pace. GDP growth rates may be slower than what we saw in the last 10 years. At the same time, there are banks which have had management changes and these are putting best practices in place. Some of the private banks will be rerated and that is where you make money in the space. 

Insurance looks promising. We have just seen the beginning of an affinity for term insurance and it is extremely profitable. We are still in year one or two of this cycle and that stays for five-seven years. Plus, there are pockets of consumption. Consumer staples were expensive in India, they had huge market caps but some of the discretionary consumption names are still small and we have not really seen demand pick up or benefits of GST gains for these names. They can play out.

Finally, one is hopeful on the investment demand front also. For 10 years, we have not seen any significant investments in the economy post the go-no go areas which happened in 2012-2013. Today, the Indian tax rate for new investments at 17% is the lowest in the region and with manufacturing looking to diversify away from China, India suddenly comes across as a very attractive base. If we get our act on the investment cycle right, there is money to be made there.


Auto is the only sector with a little bit of export potential but I do not see India as a Mecca of manufacturing at all?Look at the electronic exports. Even we were surprised when we saw the number pick up by close to 60% last year. If I am not mistaken, Foxconn would have close to 40,000-50,000 employees in India. Who thought three years back that an iPhone would be produced in India? Very often we underestimate the huge lever of a captive domestic market and when you juxtapose that with attractive tax rate, suddenly it becomes a very attractive proposition for businesses which till now were sourcing close to 60-70% of their global production from China to put up an alternate manufacturing base if the US-China trade war continues.


Where do you think the HULs, the Nestles and the Britannias of the world are headed? Are the shareholders in for single digit returns in next 5-10 years. Are we reaching the decade of no return or single digit return for some of these staple names now?Absolutely. In that sector, smaller players have already fallen by the side and investor interest has converged in two-three stocks that you are talking about. But these guys are also struggling to beat the estimates. Most of the beats which happened this quarter is because of tax cuts and the base is high and the margins are five-year high. 

Very often the big mistake market participants do is we extrapolate what has happened in the past in a very linear way. When you sit down with a business owner you realise that life is a lot more tougher. It is highly likely that these companies, which are the best in the sector, for the next five years may compound at 4-5%. The valuations get reasonable and then they move on to the next level of growth.


 I do not see cyclicals in your basket as of now. Would that be an area of the market you would start looking at these levels? With an eye to the macro picture, how are we expecting growth to pan out?There would be two things which would move cyclicals -- one is China’s FAI (fixed investment spends). We have seen some pick up in that but PBOC, which is the central bank in China is reluctant to throw large scale stimulus in the economy because they are very constrained and mindful of the fact that debt to GDP is fairly high in the economy. 

On the other hand, globally we have not seen any signs of investment cycle picking up. Germany’s looking to do a $400-billion stimulus in Eurozone or the next government in the US is looking to do a large scale stimulus to an infrastructure boost. Till that time, it is going to be more of local cyclicals -- cement doing well if housing and the investment cycle in India pick up.


Nifty has given good returns in the last one year. How tough is it for you to now beat the benchmark? What can we expect in the next 2-4 years?This is something we discuss internally in the team. The key thing is not to suffer from the multiple derating as and when it happens in the stocks because that can be very painful. So, stay disciplined in terms of the businesses you are choosing. Keep your discipline on valuations and that is the simple mantra for active funds to beat the benchmarks. If you go with the expensive well-loved names, you could underperform the benchmark.


Your view on active versus passive investing?There is always room for active investing. The way we have navigated, the big challenge we get from passive is by running relatively concentrated funds. Our country funds would be no more than 40 stocks; our regional funds would be 50 stocks. You will see huge deviations, like in the Asia fund that I manage, India would be overweight by close to 15% but we will not have much of the expensive Indian consumers. We are looking at some of the Indian utilities which are cheap businesses which are going to be relevant 5-7 years from now. 

For active to survive, one has to be disciplined on the business models you are backing. Be disciplined on the valuations you are paying and eventually market will take cognisance of that.


One important feature which has helped the market, has stemmed the fall is interest rates. We may see another 25-50 bps rate cut. If one works with an assumption that three months or six months from now, we will near the end of the rate cut cycle in India, what would that do to valuations and especially for sectors like utilities which have managed to outperform because of rate cuts?When we are talking of utilities, we are not really buying them for rate cuts. NTPC or GAIL earnings growth are still going to be 10-15% for the next three to five years. And unlike the regional or global utilities which would be up 40-50%, these names are down 30% because of this overhang of government stake sale. If the government privatises the non-core public sector units that reduces the pressure of this un-abating stake sale in these utilities. That should see a positive rerating for the stock.


How confident are you that things can only get better from here on? The next big trigger is the budget but it is still a few months away. It clearly seems like the worst is behind us though the pace of the recovery would be contingent on a couple of things. If you ask me for the risk factor, clearly the fiscal space with the government is limited. We have seen some cuts here and there but I do not think they have got room to do much beyond that. You need these privatisations to fill in the gap. 

The second issue is really the confidence in the financial system. If we want a recovery over the next three to four quarters, it may not be a bad idea to have a mini-top and buy the assets from all these questionable, vulnerable entities. The system is confident and they can go back to lending again. The financial system confidence is really one of the key factors which is going to determine the pace of this recovery.


Do you think we are in for more unwinding pain at promoter level given that the infrastructure and the real estate sectors in India are in doldrums and more skeletons can be expected to tumble out of the cupboard?You have raised an absolutely great point and this is something we discuss with all promoters and entrepreneurs when we are looking to invest in these businesses. In India, the meter runs at 12-13% so if your projects are late by two, three years, your entire equity contribution is almost wiped off. If you do not get the utilisations you have baked in in your initial estimates, it can play havoc with your P&L. It is really important and which is where the assumptions which were running for a 15% nominal GDP growth will get moderated and some of the weaker hands will fall by the side. But if the businesses are good we have seen that look market participants -- be it private equity, be it the listed universe -- they are willing to fund those good businesses. 

But most promoters have to keep in mind that the cost of capital remains fairly high in India and which is one’s assumptions need to be reasonable. You have got to build in reasonable margin of safety in case your sales do not materialise the way you expected in the first place.


Net-net, next one year, will it be reasonable to expect that we are in for a 10-15% return both for the Nifty and mid and smallcap stocks?You will see the market leadership change and that 10-15% is contingent on new set of stocks coming and taking this market further. So apart from this big quality bubble we have seen for over seven, eight years, if we see a new set of stocks emerging, which is a function of the investment cycle picking up and a function of the government choosing the right path to handle this fiscal deficit - -which is bite the bullet and do privatisation of public sector units -- and you will make money in the market. 

But if the government takes the easy path and is not willing to back tough decisions, one should be mentally prepared that market may be flat or even down from here."

1,2019-11-03,GAIL,"New Delhi: The finance ministry is likely to come out with the next tranches of CPSE and Bharat-22 exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the previous quarter of the current financial year in its efforts to meet ambitious disinvestment target of over Rs 1 lakh crore.

Based on the realisation of the disinvestment process in the three quarters, the decision on the next tranches of the ETFs would be taken during the January-March quarter, sources said.

Accordingly, the quantum will be fixed as to how much to raise through the ETF mode to meet the target set for the current financial year, the sources added.

The CPSE ETF was launched for the first time in March 2014. Thereafter, five tranches were offered in January 2017, March 2017, November 2018, March 2019, and July 2019.

The ETF invests in 11 public sector companies, including ONGC, Coal India, Indian Oil Corporation, Oil India, GAIL, Engineers India Ltd and Container Corporation of India.

The government raised Rs 11,500 crore from the last tranche of CPSE ETF floated in July.

Another ETF, Bharat-22, introduced in 2017, has helped the government mop up about Rs 40,000 crore from this.

The fourth tranche of this ETF floated in October was oversubscribed 12 times over base issue size of Rs 2,000 crore. However, the government decided to retain Rs 4,368 crore from the offer.

The central public sector enterprises that are part of the Bharat-22 ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL, NLC India, Axis Bank, ITC, REC, PFC, Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank and L&T are other constituents.

Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

The government has set a target of mobilising Rs 1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment proceeds and achieving this has become more critical after it doled out Rs 1.45 lakh crore stimulus by way of a cut in corporate tax in September.

The proceeds from disinvestment will be critical for the government to stick to its target of keeping fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of the gross domestic product in the current financial year.

Last month, the Cabinet approved a new process of strategic disinvestment with a view to expediting privatisation of select public sector undertakings.

The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave nod for sale of 53.29 per cent government stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and its 63.75 per cent stake in Shipping Corporation of India, 30 per cent in Container Corporation of India, 100 per cent NEEPCO and 75 per cent in THDC."

6,2019-11-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Stocks with little say in benchmark Nifty saw strong buying interest from mutual funds (MFs) in September quarter, as the hunt for value intensified on Dalal Street.

These DIIs hiked stakes in 17 Nifty companies by at least 100 basis points this past quarter, even when 14 of these stocks have failed to match the index’s 10 per cent return so far in Calendar 2019. These stocks mostly included Nifty non-heavyweights. 

This suggests fund managers are expecting non-performing largecaps to play catchup from here on as index heavyweights become crowded trades.

As many as 21 Nifty stocks are down so far this year. And data shows 20 of them have not much say in Nifty movement. In contrast, only three index heavyweights – RIL, TCS and HDFC Bank – have added half of the rise in Nifty market capitalisation this year. This might have made the non-performers look attractive.

“If you exclude the top 10 Nifty heavyweights, other index constituents have been a drag this year. Post corporate tax cuts, a lot of funds are looking to create alpha by investing in index non-heavyweights and non-index stocks,” said Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Domestic fund managers looked less sanguine about the basket of next-50 stocks (Nifty Next 50). Midcaps, too, failed to attract much mutual fund buying during the quarter.

Sunil Jain of Nirmal Bang Securities said MF money has been chasing only a few largecap stocks that are deemed safe bets. “But initial signs suggest risk appetite is coming back. If it sustains for the next couple of months, we may see fresh money going into index non-heavyweights and even into select midcaps,” Jain said.

Data showed MFs increased stake in Ultratech Cement by 400 basis points in Q2 to 8.1 per cent from 4.1 per cent even while the stock has risen just 4 per cent year to date.

The stock is not among the Nifty heavyweights that comprised HDFC Bank (11.25 per cent), Reliance Industries (9.68 per cent), HDFC (7.23 per cent), Infosys (6.26 per cent) and ICICI Bank (5.94 per cent). Top 10 Nifty stocks accounted for 61 per cent of Nifty weight as of September 30.

In IndusInd Bank, another minnow in Nifty, mutual fund holding jumped to 12.6 per cent at the end of second quarter from 9.2 per cent at the end of first. This stock is down 17 per cent for so far in Calendar 2019.

YES Bank saw MF stake rise to 9.3 per cent from 6.6 per cent, sequentially. This stock is down 61 per cent year to date. Coal India, NTPC, Cipla, Eicher Motors, GAIL and Dr Reddy’s Labs are a few other stocks which have delivered negative returns and yet mutual funds have raised their stakes in it by 100-200 basis points.

Meanwhile, BPCL has seen an increase in MF holdings by 250 basis points and Axis Bank by 240 basis points. The two stocks are up 45 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, so far this year.

In the case of Nifty Next 50, which comprises the next 50 largecaps after Nifty constituents, only five stocks saw MF holding go up by more than 100 basis points during the quarter.

The stocks included ICICI Lombard General Insurance (up 410 bps QoQ), HPCL (200 bps), Power Finance Corporation (170 bps), Motherson Sumi Systems (160 bps) and Avenue Supermarts (100 bps).

In the case of 100 Nifty Midcap stocks, only 14 saw over 1 percentage points rise in MF holding.

Mahanagar Gas, LIC Housing Finance, Alkem Laboratories, The Federal Bank, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, TVS Motor Company, Oil India and Jubilant FoodWorks were a few of them that saw MF holding rise by 180-420 bps during the quarter gone by."
4,2019-11-05,GAIL,"Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, has a buy on Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Hero and Bajaj Auto among the two-wheelers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Markets maybe going higher but institutional investors want to sell. What is happening?It is a perfect storm. The largest selling was by the foreign institutions at 10,700. We are at new highs and now they have turned buyers and it is routine that mutual funds will go for occasional profit, but the real money is that you had to bell the cat when fear was at its highest and generally the adage holds. FIIs generally sell low and buy high. That is the nature of the beast. So, flows will only get stronger. There is some consolidation at 12,000 but I am very optimistic now on the broader market. It is just a matter of time that we get to new highs today or tomorrow and we start to overcome the hump of 12,000. 

Let us talk of 2020 and that is where the real impetus lies. Midcaps will be the star, like in 2017. Flows is a matter of just one or two days’ aberration. Like I said, the largest selling took place close to 10,700 and now the largest buying will come closer to 11,700 and beyond. 


Why do you say that FIIs always sell low and buy high? In last 15-20 years, FIIs have only been buying and large part of the free floating blue chip stocks is actually owned by foreign institutional investors. Best performing stocks like Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Infosys, HDFC Limited have been owned by FIIs.Yes, that's the way it works. What about the likes of YES Bank and DHFL and Indiabulls? They are also very well owned by FIIs. I am not challenging the nature of the animal. It is the way the fund flows flow. Take out the data and you will see FII selling is maximum at a time when the markets have bottomed and generally at a high they are buying. I am not challenging their consistency. 

ETF flows are generally traders of an uptick and downtick. So all I am saying is that the smart money has made money but we were one of the few who were recommending and now at 12,000 there will be some occasional profit booking by mutual funds but the undertone remains, equities are in a very-very strong bull market and that is now global case. I am extremely positive with an 18-month view. Short term, the earnings and some development on macros will play a little bit of a dampener over here. 


M&M is recalling a batch of XUV300 units to fix faulty suspension components. Sales figures were anyway not encouraging. In any case, with the transition going forward to BS-VI, etc, diesel is going to be phased out. We have had some positive commentary coming in from the management.I would trust the management, one of the oldest automakers which has kept its identity right from the original Sensex. In M&M, all declines are buying opportunity. Their tractor sale numbers have beaten estimate and there is no BS-IV to BS-VI in tractors. 

So, this small recall will give you an opportunity to buy the stock. I think it is just an aberration. We are very optimistic on M&M and select autos now. The best thing is that the worst performing sector in the last two months has seen the best gains. Maruti from Rs 5,500 has touched Rs 7,700 and Eicher has risen from Rs 16,000 to Rs 23,000. Let the diehard pessimists wait for declines. We still think autos will see a huge uptick in 2020 and we are not investing with a three-month view. I have a buy on Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Maruti, Eicher Motors and among the two-wheelers it is Hero and Bajaj Auto.


A lot of market men now seem to be sounding off warning signals and how some of these high PE quality names may not give you as much return in the next decade or so. Would you say there is reason to worry about the high PE multiple stocks, that what they have done in the last five years may not be replicated going forward?

You have a positive view on auto going forward in 2020, while rating agencies are mostly behind the curb. Moody’s has cut Motherson Sumi outlook to negative. How would you position yourself amongst auto ancillaries?We have been positive on Motherson when it was in that double digit and around 100 levels. We still think they will garner more market share in the European business. Their China foray will do well but it would be Exide, Motherson and Apollo Tyre. Now as a caveat, these stocks have moved 25% from where we have been calling to buy these stocks. So take it with a pinch of salt. They have already moved up. You will look for decline but please do a SIP for the next three months. You will be handsomely rewarded in early 2020. 

As for Motherson Sumi, we think credit is going to expand stronger and they do not seem to have too much leverage. It is a very pertinent brand and they have reduced their overall dependence on the Volkswagen model and spread their basket well. This should relatively be a much better performer in the near future.


YES Bank has got binding bids of $1.2 billion and some more interest has come from a clutch of investors and family offices.It appears the risk of survival for YES Bank is over. Would you chance your arm and would you buy YES Bank at current levels of 65-66?Well it is definitely a contrarian trade. The who’s who of foreign institutional investors owned this stock at Rs 300 plus and now the who’s who is bearish at Rs 50. There is a fair chance that by January, you could see at least triple digit on this stock. The worst seems to be over. How fast they raise money is a matter of time. 

They have got a binding bid till the end of this month, but I can see five other banks. Earlier, I had suggested five midcap banks where I see a lot of value the likes of Federal, DCB, IDFC First, PNB and Bank of Baroda. If you took those five, there is more visibility, there is more transparency and there are no issues of backlog. I would suggest make a basket of stocks and include YES Bank if you are a little bit of risk taker. But please include the other five banks where the risk reward is very favourable for at least a 30% to 40% upside by next Diwali.


What is the size of the universe you are bullish on?I mentioned those five banks. Largecaps like GAIL, ITC, IndusInd, Hero MotoCorp and L&T seem very well poised. I am also extremely positive on both Lupin and Sun in the pharma space. I think that is a dark horse. And if I want to put my money on some riskier assets, it is going to be the award of the L1 contracts now, there is a 7.5 lakh infrastructure contracts which are going to go, out of which 1.5 lakh goes onstream now which will include the likes of Dilip Buildcon, NBCC, NCC where inherently order inflows will start now. Execution will be a matter of time and we know the past because of the elections and so on there has been a hiatus on government order inflows and so on so that should be a very good traction play where valuations are extremely comforting over here."
3,2019-11-05,GAIL,"ET Intelligence Group: The performance of the state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on bourses has typically followed a similar trajectory since the deregulation of petrol and diesel prices some four years ago.

However, the trend seems to have changed recently. Over the past three months, the stocks of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) have increased by 51 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has gained just over 5 per cent reflecting the weakness in its operating parameters such as gross refining margin (GRM) and rising refining capacity in the region. The stock is also under pressure due to the divestment talks of other oil majors such as BPCL and GAIL. Investors envisage a possibility that IOC may end up biding for the government’s stakes in BPCL or GAIL, similar to the past deal between ONGC and HPCL.

IOC’s GRM, which represents the company earnings from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuels, was below the regional benchmark GRM at Singapore in the September 2019 quarter. Singapore’s GRM sequentially improved by $3.1 per barrel while that of IOC fell by $0.5 a barrel after adjusting for the inventory loss. The difference shows that the company paid higher for the crude oil following rising premium for the Middle East oil supplies. The share of the company’s operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA) from the refining segment dropped to 15 per cent in the September quarter compared with the average of 37 per cent in the previous 10 quarters.

The regional GRM, which was boosted due to a higher realisation on gasoline in the previous quarter, is gradually moderating in the current quarter. In October, it fell to $4.1 per barrel compared with $6.5 in the previous quarter. This means pressure on IOC’s GRM is likely to continue in the current quarter. In addition, the global refining capacity is expected to increase by 3.5 million barrels in the next 12-15 months, which may further impact the GRMs. As a results, analysts have reduced the IOC’s estimated earnings per share (EPS) by 3.5 per cent for the next 12 months.

IOC’s domestic fuel volume fell by 1 per cent year-on-year to 20.2 million tonnes and the growth in diesel and petrol volumes was slower than industry, an indication of market share loss. Besides, the company has guided for the capital expenditure of Rs 25,000 crore for the current fiscal in an investor conference after September quarter results. This is likely to keep the debt elevated. The gross debt of the company rose to Rs 80,380 crore at the end of September 2019 compared with Rs 72,230 crore in the previous quarter, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.

Investors are also concerned about the possibility that IOC may bid for the government’s stake in BPCL or Gas Authority of India (GAIL) as a part of the strategic divestment exercise, a deal similar to one where ONGC purchased the government’s stake in HPCL in January 2018.

Such a development would be perceived negatively by Dalal Street as it could further aggravate IOC’s debt burden and lower synergy benefit. At the Monday’s closing price of . Rs 138.7, the IOCs stock was traded at 1.2 times the book value compared with 1.6 for HPCL and 2.5 for BPCL."

8,2019-11-06,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries has for the second time in a month put off bidding to sell natural gas it plans to produce from newer fields in the flagging eastern offshore KG-D6 block, sources said.

The sources said potential bidders sought more time to evaluate the terms of the offer and so the bidding deadline was pushed back to November 15.

Originally bidding for 5 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas planned to be produced from R-Cluster fields in the KG-D6 block from mid-2020 was to happen on October 11 but was put off to November 6 as bidders cited festival season in October.

Now, they have sought more time and the bid has been put off to November 15, they said.

Reliance and its partner BP plc of UK are in the market to sell the gas they plan to produce from three set of newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block. The partners are not just seeking volume bids but also price quotes and those offering the best price would walk away with the gas.

Bidders have been asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.

Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.

Reliance set a floor or minimum quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price -- which means bidders would have to quote 9 or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.

At USD 60 per barrel price, the gas price comes to USD 5.4 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).

The rate sought compares to the government-mandated USD 3.23 price that its currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in KG-D6 block get.

The government gas pricing policy, however, provides for a higher cap price for future gas produced from difficult fields like those in deep-sea. This cap currently is fixed at USD 8.43 per mmBtu.

Reliance-BP is developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites and MJ -- by 2022 that can produce a peak of 30 mmscmd of gas.

The quantity offered for bidding in the NIO is 5 mmscmd from R-Series fields which will start production in mid-2020.

The sources said peak output from R-Series is 12 mmscmd, while Satellites will produce another 7 mmscmd beginning mid-2021. MJ field, which will start production in the second half of 2022, also has a planned peak output of 12 mmscmd.

The NIO said the gas price would be lower of the quoted rate or the government-mandated ceiling for the difficult fields.

The formula Reliance is using to price gas for R-Series fields is different from its last price discovery it made for the coal seam gas (CBM) from its Sohagpur coal-bed methane blocks in Madhya Pradesh.

For Sohagpur CBM, it had in 2012 sought bids at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.

The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.

At USD 60 per barrel oil price, CBM from its Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 7.8. That formula was, however, rejected by the oil ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.

In 2017, it changed the formula by seeking bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document of CBM pricing.

Reliance ended up buying the CBM gas from its block after it bid deducting USD 1.836 per mmBtu, lower than USD 3.156 bid by rival Piramal Glass and USD 3.495 bid by state-owned GAIL."

12,2019-11-08,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks looked set for a gap-down opening after Moody’s changed India’s outlook to negative and MSCI increased weightage for mainland China shares in its widely-tracked emerging market index.Here’s breaking down the pre-market actions.

TRADE SETUP

Singapore trading sets stage for gap-down startNifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded 52 points, or 0.43 per cent, lower at 12,006.50, indicating a gap-down start for Dalal Street.


Tech view: Nifty forms Dragonfly Doji candleNifty50 on Thursday broke above the psychologically important 12,000 mark on a closing basis. But the index formed a Dragonfly Doji candle on the daily chart and a close below 11,946 level can bring the bears back into the game. The index has more or less witnessed indecisive formations for the last six sessions.


Moody’s cuts India’s outlook to negative
Moody's changed India's outlook to negative from stable while affirming India’s Baa2 ratings. Moody's says decision to change India's outlook partly reflects lower government, policy effectiveness at addressing economic, institutional weaknesses. Moody's says expects Indian government will face very significant constraints in narrowing general government budget deficit, preventing a rise in debt burden.


MSCI ups China A shares weight in MSCI EM index
Global index provider MSCI said mainland Chinese stocks, or A shares, will rise to a weight of 4.1% in the MSCI Emerging Market Index, up from 2.55% currently, as it implements the final step of the weight increase of Chinese shares in its widely-followed emerging markets benchmark.


Asian markets near record high levelsMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose slightly to stand at 543.70, just a hair off the record high of 550.63 reached in January 2018.

Oil prices drop in early tradeUS crude oil futures fell on Friday amid fading hopes that a deal to end the lingering trade war between Washington and Beijing would be signed any time soon, the gloom compounded by rising crude inventories in the United States. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 15 cents, or 0.2%, at $57 a barrel by 0032 GMT. The contract rose 1.4% on Thursday.


M&M, Nestle to announce Q2 resultsNestle India, Mahindra & Mahindra, GAIL, Eicher Motors, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, MRF, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge, Tata Power and Ashok Leyland are among some of the firms that will declare Q2 earnings later in the day.

MONEY MARKETS
Rupee: The rupee pared its initial losses to settle flat at 70.97 against the US dollar on Thursday after the US-China trade deal hopes enthused investor sentiments.

Funding for single housing project cappedFunding from the Rs 25,000-crore special window for stalled housing will be capped at Rs 400 crore for a single project, the government said on Thursday, urging home buyers to pay their remaining dues to enable early completion. The government clarified the “positive net worth” condition for projects to be eligible for support from the alternate investment debt fund in a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that it issued on Thursday. The fund won’t provide assistance to projects that are in the Supreme Court and high courts but will take up those being heard by NCLT, it said.


US, China agree on Phase I tariff rollbackChina and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others’ goods in a “phase one” trade deal if it is completed, officials from both sides said on Thursday, sparking division among some advisers to President Donald Trump. The Chinese commerce ministry, without laying out a timetable, said the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the rollback would be part of the first phase of a trade agreement that is still being put to paper for Trump and President Xi Jinping to sign.


AGR dues may rise 10%, delay spectrum saleIndia’s mobile phone companies may be liable to pay around 10% more in dues to the government than previously estimated, following the Supreme Court verdict on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), said government officials with knowledge of the matter. The total dues, pegged at Rs 1.3 lakh crore by the telecom department, could rise further on account of changes to the definition of AGR and the levies having to be calculated for the entire period till date. That could delay auctions of spectrum even further, considering the precarious financial situation of the sector,


Window for NBFCs likely under insolvency lawThe government is mulling a special window to address debt woes of stressed non-banking financial companies under the insolvency law, reports PTI. Persisting liquidity issues in the NBFC space as well as the financial woes of some groups in this sector have raised concerns about the health of the overall financial system. Troubles at DHFL and scam perpetrated at PMC Bank have added to the woes. Currently, resolution of stressed financial institutions cannot be taken up under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).


Stop predatory pricing: Goyal tells e-comm cosCommerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has warned ecommerce companies of strict action if they don’t halt predatory pricing on their platforms, flouting foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, said officials with knowledge of the matter. The issue figured in a discussion Goyal had with Amazon India head Amit Agarwal on November 5, they said.


CBDT notifies PAN-Aadhaar interchangeabilityThe apex body for direct taxes has amended over 100 forms and returns to provide for interchangeability between permanent account number (PAN) and Aadhaar number.A notification to this effect was issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes on Thursday. The Union Budget presented in July had amended Section 139A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 to provide for interchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar number. However, an amendment to give effect to this change in various forms or returns and statements prescribed was pending.


Anti-subsidy duty on copper wire rods likelyIndia may impose anti-subsidy duty for a period of five years on copper wire rods from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam after concluding a probe that these imports have impacted domestic players. The commerce ministry's investigating arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in September last year started a probe into an alleged subsidisation of exports of 'continuous cast copper wire rods' by these four countries.


Farm Ministry aims for ‘zero edible oil import’The commerce ministry has asked the agriculture ministry to prepare a road map for India to attain self-sufficiency in edible oil production. The need for a “zero edible oil import” plan was discussed by commerce minister Piyush Goyal at an inter-ministerial meeting on Tuesday. India spends over Rs 70,000 crore to import about 15 MT edible oil to meet its annual requirement of 25 MT, making it one of the biggest buyers of the cooking medium."

17,2019-11-08,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: After downgrading India’s sovereign outlook, Moody’s Investors Service on Friday downgraded its view to 'negative' from 'stable' on many top Indian companies, including SBI, HDFC Bank, TCS, Infosys, BPCL, NTPC, NHAI and GAIL. 

Moody’s has downgraded outlook on companies belonging to information technology, infrastructure as well as oil and gas sectors. In total, the rating agency on Friday cut outlook on 21 Indian firms.

Other financial institutions that have seen a downgrade are Exim Bank, Hero FinCorp, Hudco and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC).

However, the agency kept rating and outlook unchanged on Bank of India, Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank and Union Bank of India.

Ratings of the above-mentioned financial institutions are unlikely to be upgraded in the next 12-18 months, Moody’s said.

The agency also downgraded the outlook on eight non-financial corporates to negative from stable. They are BPCL, HPCL, Indian Oil, ONGC, Oil India, Petronet LNG, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. 

It also downgraded outlook on a number of sovereign-linked infrastructure companies. They include NTPC, NHPC, NHAI, GAIL, Power Grid, Adani Green and Adani Transmission.

In case of Exim Bank, Hudco, IRFC and SBI, Moody’s Investors Service said close links between these four companies and the government is the key reason for their downgrade. Moody’s believes that these companies will receive government support in times of need.

For HDFC Bank, it reasoned that due to the “strong linkages between a bank's business and the sovereign credit profile, including by way of large direct exposure to government debt and exposure to common underlying operating conditions, the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of a bank is capped at the sovereign rating of the country that it operates in”.

“Moody's does not have any particular governance concern for all the issuers impacted by today's rating action. Moody's does not apply any corporate behavior adjustment to the banks and views their risk management framework as consistent and commensurate with their risk appetite,” the New York-based rating agency said in a release.

""Ratings for Infosys and TCS are constrained to no more than two notches above the sovereign rating. Therefore a sovereign rating downgrade will also result in downgrade of the A3 ratings of Infosys and TCS,"" says Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's Vice President -- Senior Credit Officer.

Moody’s earlier downgraded India’s outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘negative’. The rating agency said its outlook partly reflects lower effectiveness of the government and policy in addressing long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses than it had previously estimated. This is leading to a gradual rise in debt burden from already high levels.

Meanwhile, Moody's has also upgraded the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of GAIL to ‘baa2’ from ‘baa3’, based on its expectation that the company will maintain strong financial metrics over the next 2-3 years; a situation which is more consistent with a baa2 standalone profile."
20,2019-11-09,GAIL,"Kolkata: Moody's Investors Service on Friday downgraded its rating outlook to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ for a number of leading Indian financiers and utilities, such as State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and NTPC, after having lowered the sovereign rating.

The global rating firm cited the close links of these companies with the government as the reason behind the rating outlook. The revision in outlook was for six financial institutions and some other firms operating in the infrastructure and power sectors.

In the financial institutional space, rating outlook on Exim India, Hero FinCorp, Hudco and IRFC were revised to negative while it kept the outlook unchanged for Bank of India, Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate and Union Bank of India.

“Lowering the outlook of companies has nothing to do with their business prospects. Investors need not worry,” said VK Vijaykumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

Moody's said that it “does not have any particular governance concern for all the issuers impacted by today's (Friday’s) rating action.”


It does not apply any corporate behaviour adjustment to the banks and views their risk management framework as consistent and commensurate with their risk appetite.

“The close link between the four companies (Exim India, Hudco, IRFC, SBI) and the government of India is the key reason Moody’s has changed the outlook for these companies to negative from stable,” the rating firm said.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank has strong linkages between its business prospects and the sovereign rating profile. For Hero Fincorp, Moody’s expects India’s economic slowdown may negatively impact the financial strength of its parent Hero Moto-Corp, and thereby its ability to support its group company.

“Given the negative outlook on the sovereign and bank ratings, SBI, HDFC Bank and Exim India's ratings are unlikely to be upgraded over the next 12-18 months,” Moody’s said. But it could upgrade the baseline credit assessment (BCA) of SBI and Exim India, if these banks demonstrate improvement in their asset quality, supported by recovery in profitability and capital levels, as well as maintaining stable funding and liquidity.

“An upgrade of HDFC Bank's BCA is unlikely, because the BCA is already at the same level as the sovereign rating,” it said.

Meanwhile, Moody's said it expects BoI, Canara, OBC, Syndicate and Union Bank would continue to enjoy a very high level of support from the government.

“Under these support assumptions, even if the sovereign rating is downgraded by one notch to Baa3, the support uplift should be sufficient to keep the final ratings unchanged at Baa3,” said Moody's. This situation is the key driver of Moody's affirmation of the five banks’ ratings.

But the ratings of these financial institutions are unlikely to be upgraded over the next 12-18 months while their BCAs can be revised on better asset quality and funding profile.

In parallel, the rating firm has downgraded the outlook on a number of sovereign-linked infrastructure companies, such as NTPC, NHPC, NHAI, GAIL and Power Grid. Outlook on private sector companies Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission was also revised to negative."

24,2019-11-11,GAIL,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, bought select FMCG, public sector companies and pharma players with both hands in October as September quarter earnings season peaked.

The fund house purchased more than 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and India's largest hydropower producer NHPC.

ITC last month posted a 37.06 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,173.72 crore for September quarter, while NHPC is scheduled to announce its number later on Monday.

Stock brokers are positive on ITC. Anand Rathi Financial Services in a November 6 report said: “With strong operating cash flows, continuous capacity expansions across businesses and a healthy balance sheet, we continue to remain positive on ITC over medium to longer term perspective. We maintain a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 352 per share.”

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other top buys in October included SBI, Coal India, REC, Bajaj Corp, Bharti Infratel, Neyveli Lignite, Cipla, Ambuja Cement, Federal Bank, Texmaco Rail, Tata Steel, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, Firstsource Solutions and J Kumar Infraprojects, among others.

The fund house added 2.50 to 95 lakh additional shares of these companies last month.

SBI, the country’s biggest lender by assets, reported a nearly six-fold rise in Q2 profit at Rs 3,375.40 crore, supported by a partial stake sale in life insurance venture.

HDFC Securities earlier in November gave a ‘buy’ call to SBI with a target price of Rs 312.

HDFC AMC also added shares of infra players IRB Infra (18 lakh shares), Larsen and Toubro (11 lakh shares), Dilip Buildcon (6.51 lakh shares) and PNC Infratech (3.89 lakh shares). Besides, it further bought Sun Pharma (23 lakh shares), Grasim Industries (21 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (20 lakh shares), GAIL (19 lakh shares), Indian Hotels (19 lakh shares), Delta Corp (17 lakh shares), Kirloskar Ferrous (16 lakh shares) and Mishra Dhatu Nigam (16 lakh shares).

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore. The company had posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore in the same period last financial year.

From among large cap firms, the fund house added nearly 6 lakh shares of the InusInd Bank and 3.87 lakh shares of Bajaj Electricals. Financial firms including HDFC, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and YES Bank also drew some interest of the AMC.

It further increased its exposure in Bajaj Finance, UltraTech Cement, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Dr Reddy’s Labs, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, M&M, Titan, HCL Technology and Adani Ports.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced 3.78 per cent, or 1,461 points to 40,129 in October amid robust inflows by foreign institutional investors during the month. On the other hand, BSE Midcap and Smallcap index gained 5.39 per cent and 2.94 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month included over 1 crore shares each in Infosys, ICICI Bank, and BHEL.

It also sold over 10 lakh shares each in Edelweiss Financial, Reliance Industries, SAIL, Ashok Leyland, Adani Power, HPCL, BPCL and Vedanta during the month gone by, according to data available with Ace Mutual Fund.

Commenting on general market trend, Kashyap Pujara, head of research at Axis Capital in an interaction with ETNow said, “What we are seeing as a trend is that not only have midcap valuations have become extremely supportive but also we have seen participation of institutions on midcaps go down by 600 bps. It is going to be a U-shaped recovery for the midcaps. They tend to do well when GDP growth surprises and we will see GDP recovery going forward. As the recovery gets a bit broad-based, we will definitely see midcaps outperforming the largecaps over the next two to three years.”"
25,2019-11-13,GAIL,"Mumbai: Is investor money finally moving out of the top-10 Nifty stocks, which have been drivers of the rally in the benchmark index to near record levels? If the decline in weights of these stocks in the Nifty are anything to go by, investors may have started shifting money from the recent winners to other stocks in the index, said analysts.

For the first time since January 2018, the weight of the top-10 stocks in the Nifty has dropped from 62 per cent to 58 per cent over the last two months. Brokers said this could be because the incremental allocation of mutual funds and foreign portfolio investors over last few months could be happening in stocks that have lower weights, according to Elara Capital. A drop in stock prices is a factor that contributes to a stock’s weight in the index “Finally, we are seeing some early signs of markets entering into depolarisation mode” said Sunil Jain, analyst, Elara Capital. “The process of depolarisation could also indicate that market participants have slowly started gaining back the confidence after remaining concerned on growth over the last 18-months.”



Mutual funds’ allocation to the top-10 Nifty stocks has declined from 60 per cent in Aug’19 to 57 per cent October. Similarly, FPIs too have reduced their allocations to top-10 Nifty weights after hitting a peak of 59-61 per cent.

Fund managers chased the top-10 stocks such as such as HDFC, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever and Reliance Industries among others between December 2018 and August 2019 because a downturn and further drop in broader corporate earnings growth resulted in investors opting for companies with higher profitability. But, their outperformance resulted in their valuations shooting through the roof.

“The extreme narrow rally since January 2018 due to investors’ risk aversion seems to be receding with incremental money moving into wider set of stocks,” said Ajay Bodke, CEO (PMS), Prabhudas Lilladher. “Investors are now getting confidence after the valuation gap between the mega large-cap stocks and others widened tremendously.”

In the September quarter, mutual funds have increased stake in Ultra-Tech IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank and BPCL between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent. Coal India, NTPC, Cipla, Eicher Motors, TechM and GAIL are among the other stocks in which funds have raised their stakes by 100 to 200 basis points.

“Post corporate rate tax cut, large investors are expecting underperforming large-caps to outperform and money may move out from index heavyweights to other stocks,” said Kush Katakia, chief executive officer, Beanstalk Advisory.

Nifty gained 5.63 per cent between January 2018 and August 2019 while Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap 100 declined 15 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. Since 1 September, Nifty, Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midacp 100 gained about 8 per cent each."

32,2019-11-15,GAIL,"MUMBAI: A PSU-stock rally, which began after New Delhi announced it would divest stakes in sector leaders such as BPCL and Concor, could continue as several of the state-run companies still trade below their five-year average book values.

The Nifty PSE index, which declined 11 per cent between January and August 2019 against the Nifty’s 1 per cent rise, has reversed the losing trend and climbed 9 per cent since September 1. ONGC, MOIL, Hindustan Aeronautics, Cochin Shipyard, NMDC, BEML, SAIL and BPCL are among the stocks gaining between 15 per cent and 40 per cent in the period, although they still trade below their five-year average price to book values.

With several stocks are trading at depressed valuations, analysts believe privatisation initiatives could drive re-rating in the overall asset class.

“The rally in PSU stocks would continue as they will get re-rated soon, with the government making it clear that it would not be interested in running these businesses,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, director at IIFL Securities. “Big risk capital would be invested in PSUs the moment there is a strategic divestment.”



Undervalued state-owned companies, such as Gujarat Mineral Dev Corp, ONGC, Oil India, MOIL, Hindustan Aeronautics, Gail India, Indian Oil, Engineers India, NTPC, Cochin Shipyard and NMDC could rally between 20 per cent and 40 per cent in the next one year, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimates.

“Currently, there is a sense of optimism around PSUs over the divestment announcements,” said Pankaj Pandey, head of research, ICICI Securities.

“Many of the stocks that are reasonably valued could be re-rated once the government announces the details of divestment candidates.”

New Delhi has been on a divestment spree and is considering reduction in stake in a number of companies. Indian Oil is the third oil company in which it may reduce ownership from 51.5 per cent apart from BPCL, of which the Centre now owns 53 per cent.

“While we await the government’s announcement on the actual divestment candidates, among the non-strategic listed PSUs, quality companies with high and consistent ROCEs, high operating spreads, negative financial leverage, healthy and consistent operating margins and positive free cash flow yields will find favour with strategic investors,” said Pradeep Kumar Kesavan, senior VP-equity strategy, Elara Capital."

34,2019-11-15,GAIL,"The turnaround in the economy will happen much more quickly than what the Street expects, says Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder, Complete Circle Consultants. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


On PSUsWe are looking at PSUs through two approaches; one is taking the fund route. We have identified some mutual funds and a couple of ETFs, one of which is the CPSE ETF which has a basket where we have a combination of the names you pointed out which will be up for divestment. We should remember that there are good success stories whether it is Hindustan Zinc or Axis becoming UTI and Maruti there are a lot of value unlocking stories where strategic divestment has led to win-win. So that is one approach of doing it. 

We have also made a portfolio which we call it as a special situation portfolio, which allows a small exposure for clients who can take high levels of risk. Here we have built a portfolio of beaten down pharma names, beaten down banking names, Bharti Airtel, some of the PSUs which are up for divestment, a lot of utilities which you are getting them t 6-7-8 PE and the dividend yield is also 7-8 PE, giving you some kind of a margin of safety. I think that could outperform. There are a couple of PSU equity funds which have a basket of them and they add some good names like IRCTC and SBI Life, GAIL and Gujarat Gas. 

So, we are taking two approaches here. We are avoiding giving individual stock calls because we do not know what will go first and probably tactical and exit would be even more important. We are preferring the fund route and a basket route rather than playing them individually. 


On financial spaceI would not really chase the tier II, tier III PSU banks. As I said, there are enough opportunities still with the top run private banks. They will be steady. One can even look at Axis Bank right now after the fund raise. At Rs 700 level, it is a good price point to accumulate it over a long period. The retail business is shaping up well. Their focus on fee income is very encouraging and as far as asset quality is concerned, the worst is behind us. 

Some of the financials look very good. Some NBFCs, where there is more perception risk rather than actual risk, look good. Something like Chola, an NBFC with good parentage like L&T Finance or some of the others look good. Even Edelweiss at sub Rs 100, has already had a sharp run up and the financials look good. I am still positive on the life insurance theme. That is a multi-year growth story with the private players continuing to gain market share. 

The focus on non-participative and guaranteed income plans, continues to see a lot of traction. The bank assurance tie-ups are really doing very well for both HDFC and SBI. We continue to see the number of policies as well as the average ticket size going up. Also the quality of profit is a lesser share of investment income, lesser share of surrender value and the core profit picking up is a very healthy sign. Insurance is a very long gestation business. One should start getting into the green and you can sustain double digit growth in premiums. 

There is a long road to profits scaling up 3x, 4x, 5x over the medium term. That looks good. Other than that, I like the city gas distribution space. That is another very long-term secular theme to look at.


On earnings seasonOne should not look at PAT and EPS numbers right now because of the corporate tax impact both ways. The banks have actually written off some of the due benefits in future and there are some places where profitability has got a boost. I think PBT is a better measure. 

Our assessment is that the turnaround in the economy will happen much quickly than what the Street expects and markets are never wrong. One lesson I have learnt is that if markets are going up, obviously there is global liquidity and there is a risk on trade on EM which has been an enabler. I do not dispute that but the rebound in growth will happen a little more quickly. I am probably a lone voice here but it will much more quickly than what the Street expects. 

Liquidity will be favourable and reform announcements will be made to keep the markets steady in the near term.-Gurmeet Chadha

So it is going to be a steady grind and not a very slow grind because in consumption space, the sentiment plays a big role and there is a lot of deferment which happens and we saw that in the Diwali season when you get a good price points there is some bit of positive filters, you see a bit of a rebound, we saw that with auto numbers in October in that part. 

You will see a lot of reforms being announced over the next two, three months. The government is really running out of fiscal space. You will see tinkering with taxation and I am including the Budget. I am giving a three-month view. You will see big ticket divestments and the Emerging Market liquidity will remain and within EMs, we are seeing money moving out from the LatAm. The Argentina Peso, Brazilian Peso, the Brazilian yield are all under pressure. Mind you, we are growing low but we are still growing. So the liquidity will be favourable and reform announcements will be made to keep the markets steady in the near term. 


On telecom stocks
I am positive on Bharti and I have been maintaining some position on Bharti at a personal level as well with added disclosure. My premise is that we would not see a monopoly or duopoly kind of scenario. If you look at Bharti numbers in particular and if you remove the one-off due to AGR dues, the quarter was quite impressive. 

The Indian mobility business showed 5% improvement. Bharti has a good spectrum bank in terms of the areas and circles it caters to. It had defended market share much better than Voda-Idea and BSNL. 

My sense is if the government can fix up a floor on pricing and competitive intensity comes down, the impact on ARPU would be humongous. We in fact did a maths that if per GB, the prices go up by 10 to 20 bps, the profitability of industry can go up by Rs 600-1200 crore. Over the next three years, if the ARPU can improve by 20-30-40% in a two-three player industry, then you are looking at value growth after volume growth comes back. 

I think it will evolve into a much bigger play. Obviously Reliance will have the upper hand because it will be a combination of content, commerce and communication and not just pure data and voice play. But at sub Rs 400, Bharti makes a good case for high risk high return trade off.


On market triggers
My sense is that fiscal response is due. It can come any time. It is very difficult to place whether it is going to come every Friday evening. It is very difficult to second guess the government on that, but if you look at the broad macro numbers, your food inflation is up and your core manufacturing inflation is down and if you do more cuts, you probably can feed into food inflation. If some of it can feed into currency, then you can get into some amount of trouble. 

My view is that monetary policy will continue to be accommodative and a rate cut can still happen. The heavy lifting has to be done on the fiscal front. I do not think there is a choice there. So, I expect a fiscal side response pretty soon. It could be through some tinkering of taxes, it could be some motor scrappage policy and sector specific response. You will see a lot of them. I cannot a put a needle on when it will happen. 

Secondly, the best way to meet the fiscal stress is through the capital market route and that makes me think that maybe some tinkering with LTCG and DDT can happen. A lot of reforms will come in and we should watch out for China because China has not really reflated. In the emerging markets basket, if you can get a bit of liquidity chasing China and China reflates, that could be good news for the EM pack as a whole."
35,2019-11-17,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL have bought majority of natural gas from Reliance Industries' newer fields in the KG-D6 block at an indicative price of USD 5.04 - 5.16 per unit, industry sources said.

Essar Steel picked up 2.25 million standard cubic meters per day or about half of the available volumes in the day long auction conducted on November 15.

Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and GAIL bought 0.3 mmscmd each, sources said.

Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) bought 0.35 mmscmd and the remaining 0.10 mmscmd went to GSFC/GNFC.

Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK had sought bids from potential users for the 5 mmsmcd of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from mid-2020.

Bidders were asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.

Sources said Reliance had set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.

In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.4 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translates into a price of between USD 5.04 per million British termal unit and USD 5.16 per mmBtu rate at Brent oil price of USD 60 per barrel.

Sources said while bankruptcy-hit Essar bought gas to feed its steel plants, other buyers including Adani Group picked up the volumes for their city gas operations of retailing CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.

The volumes are mostly planned for usage in western India particularly in Gujarat where the gas can be delivered through a single pipeline - East-West pipeline. The delivered price in Gujarat is likely to be around USD 6.50 per mmBtu, they said.

Initially, Reliance had set a floor of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of USD 5.4 per mmBtu at USD 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around USD 4 per mmBtu rate currently.

To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.

The company did not immediately respond to an email sent for comments.

According to the bid document, the gas price will be subject to the ceiling price mandated by the government. The ceiling price for gas from difficult fields such as those in deep-sea currently is USD 8.43 per mmBtu.

The government-mandated rate for other fields currently is $3.23 per mmBtu.

Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022.

R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from mid-2021, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in second half of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.

Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.

While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.68 mmscmd in the July-September.

Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.

Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake in the block."

GAIL: Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL have bought majority of natural gas from Reliance Industries' newer fields in the KG-D6 block at an indicative price of USD 5.04 - 5.16 per unit, industry sources said."
36,2019-11-18,GAIL,"New Delhi: Essar Steel and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) won two-thirds of the natural gas Reliance Industries offered in an auction, where winning bids were $5.3-5.4 a unit, people familiar with the matter said.

Reliance-BP offered 5 million metric standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) it plans to produce from April next year at its R-cluster field in KG-D6 block. About half a dozen companies participated in the e-auction on Friday. Reliance did not respond to ET’s emailed query.

Essar Steel is learnt to have won 2.25 mmscmd, while GSPC got 1.2 mmscmd. State-run Hindustan Petroleum is believed to have won 0.35 mmscmd, while Adani, Mahanagar Gas and GAIL won 0.3 mmscmd each, according to the people. Gujarat State Fertilizer Corp is also said to have won 0.10 mmscmd.

Essar Steel, which has been in news lately for its bankruptcy, will likely use the gas in its plant, while Adani and Mahanagar may feed it into their city gas network.

RIL-BP sold all the gas offered. The duration of supply could not be ascertained. Buyers had the option to bid for a supply period of two to six years.

Bidders were expected to quote a price as a percentage of dated Brent crude. The minimum they could quote was 8.4%. Bidders ended up quoting between 8.4% and 8.6%, the people said.

This translates into a price range of $5.29 to $5.41 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) at the current rate of $63 per barrel for dated Brent. Prices will vary during the period of supply as the dated Brent is defined as the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract months in which the gas supply is made.

After including the pipeline tariff, the delivered cost of gas would be about $6.5 for buyers, most of which are in Gujarat. Reliance-BP have the marketing and pricing freedom for all the gas they produce from the Rcluster field. The prices, however, cannot exceed the government-set ceiling for the gas from difficult fields, which is currently $8.43 per unit.

Prices during the RIL-BP’s gas auction were influenced by a collapse in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market and an expected rise in supply from domestic sources over the next few years.

This meant the auction ended up with rates that were close to the floor price set by the producer. ONGC is also auctioning 0.75 mmscmd on November 19."

42,2019-11-18,GAIL,"State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and GAIL India will pay Adani Group 5 per cent more in hiring charges for using the private firm's upcoming LNG import facility at Dhamra in Odisha than their own similar terminal, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.

India's largest oil firm IOC, which recently commissioned a 5 million tonne liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Ennore in Tamil Nadu, as well as gas utility GAIL have ""both technical and financial capability to develop their own LNG terminal,"" he told the Lok Sabha.

The two firms have, however, hired capacity in Adani's under-construction LNG import terminal at Dhamra.

IOC had in 2015 signed to use up to 60 per cent of the terminal's capacity for importing gas for its refineries at Haldia in West Bengal and Paradip in Odisha. GAIL too had signed up for 1.5 million tonne of the terminal's regasification capacity.

""GAIL and IOC have agreed to pay the tolling charge of Rs 60.18 per million British thermal unit for the regasification facility at Dhamra LNG terminal with annual escalations in line with their respective contractual provisions,"" he said in a written reply to a question.

This charge compares to Rs 57.38 per mmBtu regasification charges for Ennore LNG terminal, he said.

GAIL's own Dhabhol LNG terminal in Maharashtra levies Rs 49.28 per mmBtu regasification charge. In addition, there are other charges such as terminal charges, vessel-related charges and port charges for utilization of the Dabhol LNG terminal.

""The regasification charges for Ennore and Dhamra terminals are inclusive of terminal charges, vessel-related charges, port charges, and any other port-related charges,"" Pradhan said.

Originally, IOC and GAIL had on September 21, 2016, signed a 'non-binding' agreement to buy 50 per cent stake in Adani Group's Rs 5,500-crore Dhamra LNG project in Odisha. But that agreement expired on September 20, 2018, without being translated into a firm pact apparently because of differences over valuation.

""It has been informed that the regasification charge for Dhamra terminal is Rs 60.18 per mmBtu for the first contract year (year of commissioning) which is likely to be in FY 2021-22,"" Pradhan said.

""GAIL has executed a Tolling Agreement in line with its procedures to meet the supply commitments of customers located in the eastern parts of the country along JagdishpurHaldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline (JHBDPL) project. IOC has also booked capacity at Dhamra Terminal after considering its captive requirement of Paradip, Haldia and Barauni refineries.""

He said the booking of regas capacity is being done after ""protracted techno-commercial discussions with the promoters of Dhamra LNG Terminal and after considering the location of the terminal, availability of gas evacuation pipelines, affordability of regasification charges and capturable demand in the catchment area.""

The September 21, 2016 ""non-binding MoU"" followed GAIL dropping plans in March 2015 to set up a floating LNG import terminal at Paradip. IOC too had in 2012 signed an MoU with Dhamra LNG Port Corp Ltd (DPCL) to develop an LNG terminal at the port.

Also, Petronet LNG - a firm in which GAIL and IOC are promoters, had shelved plans to set up a 5 million tonne a year LNG import facility at Gangavaram in Andhra Pradesh.

After shelving their respective plans, IOC and GAIL signed a pact with Dhamra LNG Terminal, a firm owned by Adani Group.

""GAIL and IOC have both technical and financial capability to develop their own LNG terminal,"" Pradhan said. ""GAIL has an equity stake in Konkan LNG Pvt Ltd and is the owner's engineer as well as the operator of this terminal at Dabhol. IOC has recently commissioned a 5 million tonne LNG terminal through a joint venture at Ennore in March 2019.""

The two firms also have an equity stake in Petronet LNG which operates two LNG regas terminals, one at Dahej in Gujarat and the other at Kochi in Kerala, he added."
43,2019-11-19,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is seeking legal opinion on the wider impact of the Supreme Court’s order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), including whether it is applicable on a larger group of non-telecom companies holding telecom licences, and if so, the process to be adopted to raise demands from them for its dues.

“We are taking a legal opinion on the order’s wider ambit… we will actively work on the matter as legally advised after the telcos’ issue is addressed,” an official said.

Lawyers say that several companies — including GAIL, Power Grid Corporation, Delhi Metro, RailTel, among others — that are non-telcos but hold telecom licences to provide a range of offering such as internet services, national and international long-distance services and VSAT services, could fall under the DoT’s wider licence fee ambit. This, after the Supreme Court, in its order, equated gross revenue — for arriving at AGR — with “total revenue of licensee company”. Further, the court held that revenue arising out of non-telecom activities, with certain exceptions, will have to be included in gross revenue.

The official added that clarity is needed since there is ambiguity on the wider impact of the judgment. “Some companies likely to have been impacted by the judgment might not even know that DoT may raise demands and issue notices,” he said.

A second official said the government is dealing with a peculiar situation where even public sector units with telecom licences could be staring at huge liabilities. “This could be a case of revenue going from one pocket of the government to another,” he said and added that individual companies were assessing the situation and would work with their administrative ministries to resolve this matter. One particular option would be to take cabinet exemptions for such cases.

The DoT last week issued notices to mobile companies and internet service providers (ISPs) to compute and pay the amount that they now owe the government on account of the Supreme Court verdict.



The apex court has mandated that the dues be paid up within three months of the October 24 order. Telcos are staring at licence fee, penalty and interest dues of nearly Rs 93,000 crore, as per DoT’s submissions to the apex court, but are seeking relief. Including spectrum usage charges, the dues go up to over Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

Industry estimates similar dues on non-telecom companies may amount to nearly ?2.28 lakh crore, if calculated since the time of getting their respective licences. These companies till now have been paying miniscule amounts as licence fee, if at all, to the DoT.

Government officials expect the non-telecom companies too to seek a clarification on the SC order’s ambit. The DoT has already ordered its nodal bodies to issue notices to ISPs, along with telcos and virtual network operators.

A senior official of association representing ISPs in India, warned that if the ambit of the judgment were to be widened, the impact could run into a much higher figure. “If it includes everyone, then there’s no end to who may be asked to pay and how much. Many of the licence holders under ISP category were not legally obliged to pay any licence fee before 2014, but now they may have to,” he added."
44,2019-11-19,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is well within its rights to waive penalty and interest on dues that telecom companies owe following the Supreme Court ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), senior advocate Harish Salve said in a legal opinion to Bharti Airtel.

If the government is of the view that burdening the telcos with immediate recovery of arrears will result in impairing their operations and that a larger public interest will be served by revisiting the imposition of penalty and high interest rates, “there is nothing in the judgment of the Supreme Court that would prevent the government from acting appropriately”, Salve said in his legal opinion which has been annexed in an Airtel letter to communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, also marked to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

He said the government could also allow more time for payment of the principal amount of the shortfall.

Salve’s legal opinion on the SC order that backed the government stand on including non-core items of revenue while computing AGR, were cited by Bharti Airtel in the November 18 letter, a copy of which was also marked to principal secretary to the PM, PK Mishra, and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba. Gauba is heading a panel of top officials set up to suggest ways to restore the sector’s health.

Salve added that Bharti Airtel would be “well advised” to approach the government to make out a case to revisit the imposition of penalty in the larger grounds of public interest.

Referring to the inclusion of components such as trade discounts, discounts on prepaid tariffs and forex fluctuations in the computation of AGR, Salve in his legal opinion said that in the past, the telecom tribunal headed by a retired judge had held that the demands of the government were “illegal”. He added that the tribunal examined 13 heads of income and held that most of them could not be included in AGR.

The legal opinion of retired Supreme Court judge, Justice AK Sikri, were also annexed in Airtel’s letter to the government.



Sikri backed Salve’s legal opinion and was cited in the letter as saying, “This would demonstrate that the dispute raised by the TSPs (telecom service providers) was not frivolous. It cannot be said that the view of the Supreme Court in this case is the only possible view or that the view of the tribunal is totally absurd. In my view, no case for penalty was made out.”

Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the telcos worst affected by the order, are expected to file review petitions this week. They have appealed to the government for relief.

Airtel faces licence fee, spectrum usage charge, interest and penalty dues of over Rs 41,000 crore and has sought a waiver of penalty and interest, which together contribute to almost 75% of its estimated liabilities.

Airtel also wants interest to be levied only from the date of the AGR judgment and a 16-year payment period for the dues after a moratorium of two years. It said if interest must be levied, it must be at rates of government securities plus a small spread, say 1%, to compensate the government for notional loss of interest. It has even proposed keeping SUC outside the ambit of the demands because it was not part of the SC order.

It said companies such as Power Grid Corporation of India, GAIL and RailTel, which possess telecom licences to offer internet and national long-distance services, should be treated at par with telcos. According to Airtel’s estimates, these non-telecom companies would be liable to pay the government close to Rs2.27 lakh crore in dues after the SC’s order.

The company said failure to provide relief would allow for a “possible bankruptcy” of licensee companies and the loss of millions of direct and indirect jobs. It also predicted there would be bad loans for Indian banks running into a few lakh crore rupees and a ripple effect on vendors, retailers, kirana shops and related services like advertising and transportation, which could again lead to the collapse of more companies."

46,2019-11-20,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: GAIL and the downstream regulator are headed for a clash after the latter cancelled the state-run firm’s sole bid to lay a Rs 1,500-crore pipeline in Rajasthan citing unviably high tariff, and launched in its place the bidding process for another pipeline with altered route, according to people familiar with the matter.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) said on November 6 that it had cancelled the bid process for Langtala-Jodhpur-Bhilwara pipeline “as the tariff quoted by GAIL (India) Ltd (as a sole bidder) was found to be excessively high, impacting the viability of the gas itself.” That very day, the board also invited bids for laying a new gas pipeline on altered route from Langtala to Pali via Jodhpur.

This has upset GAIL, which feels the ‘excessively high tariff ’ and ‘viability of the gas’ are subjective considerations and can’t become ground for cancellation of bid under the current regulatory framework, according to sources close to the company. GAIL may soon request PNGRB to review the decision that it considers unfair, sources said.

But sources close to PNGRB have rejected the charge, saying the regulator has acted as per the law and GAIL was free to challenge it in court. PNGRB can’t allow GAIL to ‘squeeze the market’ and hurt the development of domestic gas market, sources close to the regulator said.

GAIL defends the high tariff, saying it was due to higher risk perception in the project, sources close to the company said. The pipeline was supposed to evacuate gas only from Focus Energy’s block in Langtala, Rajasthan and if the actual production from this were to fall short of expectation, as has happened in some upstream gas projects in the past, the proposed pipeline would end up with much less business than anticipated, they said, adding that higher tariff could have let company recover cost quickly.



Yet if the PNGRB felt that the proposed tariff was too high, it should have formally approached GAIL and discussed the possibility of cutting it to acceptable levels, they said. However, sources close to PNGRB said the regulator had held discussions with some senior GAIL executives before cancelling the bid.

PNGRB’s suo motu move to seek bids for a pipeline with altered route without holding public consultation as is necessary under the regulations is questionable, sources close to GAIL said.

The new pipeline will connect at Pali with the proposed Mehsana-Bhatinda pipeline, being built by a joint venture led by Gujarat State Petronet Ltd, a subsidiary of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC). Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL are other shareholders in the joint venture. Mehsana-Bhatinda pipeline, authorised by PNGRB in 2011, has been delayed for years.

GAIL and PNGRB didn’t respond to ET’s request for comment. A GSPC official said the first phase of Mehsana-Bhatinda pipeline has been completed and the second phase of 950 km will be completed by October 2020. He further said the pipeline is interconnected with GSPC’s Gujarat pipeline network at Palanpur in Gujarat. Sources close to GAIL say the project would take more time.

By proposing to connect a new pipeline with one that has not been completed many years after the project was awarded, the regulator is introducing uncertainty, which would help neither the producer nor consumers, sources close to GAIL said.

The cancelled-pipeline proposed to connect to GAIL’s operational Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline, connecting the producer with a very wide base of consumers from all sectors, sources close to GAIL said."
49,2019-11-20,GAIL,"Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday said it has assigned a 'Baa1' rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Oil and Natural Gas Corp under its $2 billion medium-term note program. The outlook on the rating is negative, Moody's said in a statement. 

 ""The notes' rating is in line with ONGC's Baa1 issuer rating, which is in turn primarily driven by its standalone credit profile as captured by the company's baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA),"" says Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President. 

 The rating reflects ONGC's position as the largest integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity as also its substantial operating cash flow generation capacity. 

 It also factors the firm's solid credit metrics that have improved but remain constrained by volatile - although range-bound - oil prices and high shareholder returns. 

 At the same time, Moody's expected that ONGC will not be asked to share fuel subsidies, as long as oil prices stay below $70 per barrel. 

 ""ONGC's issuer rating also incorporates the company's high likelihood of extraordinary support from and very high dependence on the Government of India, in times of need. However, this assumption of government support has not resulted in any rating uplift, as the sovereign's rating is below ONGC's BCA,"" it said. 

 Given ONGC's strong credit metrics and status as a government-owned company, it enjoys strong access to debt capital markets and has substantial financial flexibility through equity stakes in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL India, which together were valued at about Rs 21,000 crore as on November 14, 2019. 

 Moody's ratings for ONGC are based on the full consolidation of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) which includes the full consolidation of HPCL's 49 per cent-owned joint venture, HPCL-Mittal Energy. 

 The government owns 62.98 per cent of ONGC's equity and has the ability to appoint all of its board of directors. 

 ""The negative outlook on ONGC is in line with the negative outlook on the Government of India's rating and reflects Moody's view that ONGC's ratings will be downgraded if India's sovereign rating is downgraded to Baa3 from Baa2,"" Moody's said. 

 ""Given the negative outlook, an upgrade is unlikely. The outlook will return to stable if the outlook on the sovereign rating moves to stable."" 

 ONGC's ratings may experience downward pressure if the sovereign rating is downgraded, ONGC increases its pace of acquisitions such that it results in higher business risk and a deterioration in its credit metrics, or oil prices decline on a sustained basis resulting in weak cash flow generation and a deterioration in ONGC's credit metrics, it added."

53,2019-11-21,GAIL,"In the broader market slowdown that began in early 2018, a number of ‘multibaggers’ of the past decade faltered and lost more than half their values in just two years. 

In all, there are 45 stocks in the BSE500 index that more than doubled in the first seven years of the decade, but could not continue their pace, and eroded shareholders’ wealth thereafter.

YES Bank, of course, tops the list. Others included Somany Ceramics, La Opala RG, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Graphite India, CEAR, Rain Industries, Blue Dart, eClerx, Wockhardt, Bombay Dyeing and Force Motors, among others., 

Glass manufacturer La Opala RG surged 4,100 per cent in the first seven years of the decade from 2011 to 2017, but crashed 52 per cent from that point in next two years. Similarly, Somany Ceramics gave 1,500 per cent return in that bull run but is now down 80 per cent from its December 2017 level.

Out of the 45 names, nine are trading even below their 2010-end levels. They are Eveready Industries, DHFL, Sadbhav Engineering, eClerx, Bombay Dyeing, Deepak Fertilisers, Wockhardt, Magma Corp, Gateway Distriparks and Gujarat State Fertilizers.



Most of the names belong to midcap and smallcap segments, which have been battered badly in last two years.

But fortunes could be changing for them soon.

Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamentals Research at Kotak Securities, believes the ground for rally in midcaps and smallcaps is getting ready, as these stocks have seen some traction lately. In last three months, BSE Midcap index has risen 9 per cent and BSE Smallcap index 6 per cent, though both remain in the red on a year-to-date basis.

“We need two things to come together: activity on the ground i.e., demand, etc. should pick up and midcap and smallcap companies need to show some earnings visibility. These two factors are not there right now. Maybe, the sentiments have turned positive, but earnings are not visible. Probably, closer to the Budget, midcaps and smallcaps would become the flavour. If the Budget gives some impetus to investors and taxpayers, then it will be an icing on the cake for midcaps and smallcaps,” said Oza.

Some of these stocks are also down because of company-specific issues while some have fallen out of favour due to sector-wide slowdown. For instance, YES Bank gave 404 per cent return in the first seven years but today trades at a fraction of those prices because of very high exposure to stressed assets.

Traders punished Wadhawan Group’s DHFL on corporate governance issues and tightening of liquidity in the system. The company is now facing insolvency. The stock has crashed 96 per cent from the levels it was trading at in 2017-end.

Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking thinks the market is in a better place than it was six months ago, thanks to the optimism over a possible US-China trade deal and improved domestic sentiment. “The up-move will be gradual. Investors would await more data on economic recovery. Nonetheless, those with a 2-3 years’ time horizon should use a buy-on-dips strategy to buy the fundamentally-sound stocks,” he said.

Oza sees themes like rural consumption, gas companies like GAIL, Mahanagar Gas, Petronet LNG and some smallcaps to bloom next year. He said companies playing the financialisation theme in India -- life insurance, AMCs and private banks -- could gain. As many as 16 of these 45 stocks fall in these categories."

57,2019-11-21,GAIL,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday hinted that public sector firms such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) may not be allowed to bid for buying government stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), for which a buyer may have to shell out as much as Rs 90,000 crore.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had on Wednesday decided to sell the government's entire stake in the country's second-largest state refiner BPCL and India's largest shipping company Shipping Corporation of India (SCI). It also approved privatisation of Container Corporation of India while also giving nod to paring stake below 51 per cent in select public sector undertakings but without losing control.

""Since 2014, we have a clear vision that the government has no business to be in business,"" Pradhan told reporters here. ""We have examples of 2-3 sectors such as telecom and aviation where ushering in private participation has led to customers benefiting from price cuts, efficiency, and better service. And yesterday (on Wednesday), several reformist decisions were taken.""

BPCL will give buyers ready access to 14 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and about one-fourth of the fuel marketing infrastructure in the world's fastest-growing energy market.

It, however, will be sold after carving out Numaligarh Refinery from its portfolio and given to a pubic sector unit.

""Numaligarh refinery was set up as per Assam Accord and it will remain a public sector unit. Assam Chief Minister had requested Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) to retain public sector character of Numaligarh Refinery and that has been accepted,"" he said.

Pradhan, however, did not say if IOC or Oil India Ltd, which already has a stake in the refinery and also supplies crude oil to it, will take over the unit.

""The details have to be worked out,"" he said. ""Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) has stated that the privatisation of BPCL will happen this fiscal and we hope to adhere to the timeline.""

Asked if public sector units will be allowed to bid for the government's 53.29 per cent stake, he said: ""Nitty gritty and details of the disinvestment process will have to be worked out but when I say the government has no business to be in business, it is indicative of possible future course of action.""

At the current trading price of BPCL, the government's 53.29 per cent stake is valued at a shade less than Rs 62,000 crore. On top of this, the acquirer will have to make an open offer to buy an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders for about Rs 30,000 crore.

Last year, the government had sold its entire stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for Rs 36,915 crore.

Pradhan said the privatisation of BPCL was following the policy of ushering in greater competition in sectors that can sustain on their own.

Greater private participation, like in the telecom and aviation sector, will bring about efficiencies and better service to consumers, he said.

The CCEA had on Wednesday also approved the sale of an entire 63.75 per cent government holding in SCI and 30.8 per cent out of the government's 54.80 per cent stake in Container Corp of India (Concor).

Besides, the government will sell its entire holding in THDC India Ltd (THDCIL) and North Eastern Electric Power Corp Ltd (NEEPCO) to state-owned power generator NTPC Ltd, the finance minister has said.

The government holds 74.23 per cent in THDCIL and 100 per cent NEEPCO.

Parallelly, the Cabinet had also approved reducing government stake in select PSUs such as IOC to below 51 per cent while continuing to retain management control.

The management control will continue to be retained with the government after considering equity held by other state-owned companies in the divested firm.

The government, currently, holds 51.5 per cent in IOC and another 25.9 per cent through state-owned Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC), and explorers ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL), and the government can potentially sell 26.4 per cent for about Rs 33,000 crore.

A similar formula can also apply to ONGC and gas utility GAIL India Ltd.

The stake sales are critical for the government to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore set for the current financial year.

At current prices, the government's 30.8 per cent stake in Concor is worth about Rs 10,800 crore, while stake sale in SCI will fetch just over Rs 2,000 crore.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai, Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes. After removing three million tonnes capacity of the Numaligarh refinery, the new buyer will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.

It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants. The company distributes 21 per cent of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country.

The government is keen to get international energy majors such as Saudi Aramco, Total SA of France and ExxonMobil to operate in the downstream fuel marketing business so as to bring in greater competition.

Currently, 95 per cent of retail petrol and diesel sales and near 100 per cent of cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene sales are controlled by the public sector units.

As on March 31, BPCL reported cash and cash equivalents of around Rs 5,300 crore, against Rs 10,900 crore of debt maturing over the next 15 months."

• JM Financial has maintained its buy rating on 
Bandhan Bank with a target price of Rs 710. The brokerage continues to like Bandhan for its strong track record on profitability, asset quality and efficiency.

NHPC with a target price of Rs 25. The construction of lower Subansiri project has restarted from October, which is a positive for the company.

• Edelweiss Securities has maintained its Buy rating on 
Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services with a target price of Rs 397. The company’s earnings for September quarter remained mixed with softer growth, lower net interest margins and steady asset quality. Edelweiss expects disbursements to witness to improve in the second half of FY20.

Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services closed at Rs 330, up 0.7 per cent on Wednesday.

• Reliance Securities has maintained a Buy rating on 
Gail (India) with a target price of Rs 154. Gail posted improved volume performance in quarter ending September with natural gas transmission growing 7 per cent year-on-year.

59,2019-11-25,GAIL,"New Delhi: The Committee of Secretaries (CoS) set up to suggest relief measures for the telecom sector has been ‘disbanded’, a top government official said, indicating that the two-year moratorium on spectrum payments is possibly all that the sector will get for now.

“They (telcos) have been given a two-year moratorium (from spectrum payment), they’ve got relief of Rs 42,000 crore,” the official said, adding that nothing more should be expected. When asked specifically if the CoS had been disbanded, the official said “yes”.

On whether a new inter-ministerial panel could be constituted to provide relief for the Rs 1.47 lakh crore adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues, the official said, “No, it is a SC-defined matter”.

This official also appeared to rule out any relief for non-telecom companies including staterun units such as Power Grid, Gail and RailTel that have been affected by the AGR order.

“...why didn’t they (non-telcos) fight (in court), who asked them not to do it? Elementary accounting procedure is that if there are pending dues, then contingent provision should have been kept in books of accounting. It is their statutory obligation,” he said.




COAI Still Hopeful
The government, on the recommendations of the CoS, last week cleared a two-year moratorium on payments for spectrum bought in auctions, a move aimed at providing cash flow relief to carriers such as Vodafone idea ( Rs23,920 crore) and Bharti Airtel (Rs 11,746 crore).

But the government didn’t reduce the 8% AGR that the telcos pay as licence fees, as was widely expected. Neither did the panel nor the government provide any relief on the AGR-based dues that mobile phone companies face after a recent Supreme Court order. Carriers need to pay the dues in less than three months.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who face combined AGR dues of over Rs 89,000 crore to be paid in less than three months, have filed review petitions seeking a review of penalties and interest on the dues, and questioning some components of the non-core items that the court said should be included while computing AGR of telcos. If forced to pay the whole amounts, the telcos say they have doubts over continuing as going concerns.

“We trust this does not mean the government has ceased to look at the long-term relief and sustainability of the industry. We hope these issues will continue to be looked at and decided upon by DoT through existing channels of decision making,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). COAI represents all private telecom operators.

Analysts last week said the sector needs more measures.

“While deferment of spectrum auction payment is in line with our expectations, no decision on licence fees reduction is clearly negative…We note that if the Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel face challenges in paying the annual spectrum payment of Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 6,000 crore, respectively, then it will be more challenging for them to pay AGR dues of Rs 53,000 crore and Rs 35,600 crore immediately,” Credit Suisse said in a report.

Telecom companies have also asked the government to reduce their total incidence of tax and levies from the present levels of 33%, and reduce spectrum usage charge to 1%, respectively. ET had reported previously that the DoT may ask the finance ministry to refer the pending issue of refunding input tax credits of telecom companies worth Rs 36,000 crore to the GST Council, which the telcos have been asking for as well."

Nifty50 opened positive on back of favourable cues from global bourses and made a new lifetime high of 12,132 in the early hours of the session. However, the index turned highly volatile in the latter part of the session, as it traded in wide range between 12,006 and 12,130 levels.

The index formed a Small Bearish Candle on the daily scale, as it closed below the opening level. But the overall trend remains positive, and thus, we continue our buy-on-dips strategy. Now, Nifty has to sustain above the 11,980 – 12,000 zone to witness an up-move towards the 12,132 and 12,200 levels, while supports remained intact at 11,920 and 11,850 levels on the downside.

India VIX fell 1.08 per cent to 14.83 level. Now VIX needs to hold below 15 mark to surpass the recent high and extend the fresh high territory.

Bank Nifty opened with a gap up and extended its gains to make a new lifetime high at 31,850 level. It relatively outperformed the benchmark index and managed to close above 31,700. However, it formed a Doji candle on the daily scale, as it closed near its opening mark.

The overall trend remains positive and it now needs to hold above 31,500 level to witness an up-move towards 31,850 and then make a fresh rally towards 32,000 level. On the downside, support is placed at 31,500 and then 31,200 levels.

Nifty futures closed flattish at 12,098 level. Long buildup was seen in Just Dial, Motherson Sumi, Biocon, GAIL and Bharat Forge while shorts were seen in Zeel, BHEL, Castrol, RBL Bank and Glenmark.

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 21 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Geojit Finance Services has upgraded 
Minda Industries to ‘Accumulate’ with a target price of Rs 388. The brokerage said product diversification of Minda along with increasing growth from new products gives better visibility to the company on revenue front.

Shares of Minda Industries closed at Rs 348, down 0.7 per cent.

• Kotak Securities has maintained its Buy rating on 
KNR Constructions with a target price of Rs 305. The brokerage said KNR continues to focus selectively on bidding for projects in the southern region where it has competitive edge due to availability of own source of raw material and better geographical understanding. The company is expected to have strong cash flows and a deal with Cube Highways along with monetization of build operate transfer assets will help the company in meeting upfront equity commitments. Shares of KNR Constructions closed at Rs 232, down 1.6 per cent.


• Motilal Oswal Securities has maintained its Buy rating on
 Colgate with a target price of Rs 1,815. The brokerage said revival in both premium and mass segments augurs well for Colgate.

• Emkay Securities has maintained its Buy rating on 
IPCA Lab with a target price of Rs 1,200. Despite the difficult situations, IPCA has navigated challenges by focusing on cost reduction, the brokerage said.

69,2019-11-28,GAIL,"India has been striving to become a gas-based economy. While the current share of gas in India’s energy mix is 6%, the central government has set an ambitious target of increasing it to 15% by 2030. Since natural gas is also used in households as piped natural gas (PNG), increasing the user base for this cooking fuel is one of the ways to effectively move towards our natural gas targets. Similarly, the rising use of CNG-powered vehicles can also help drive India’s gas transition. (CNG, or compressed natural gas, is a low-emission fuel used to power automobiles.) 
In 2018-19 alone, 11.25 lakh connections for CNG and PNG were made in the two cities of Mumbai and Delhi. 

While the government’s targets and ambitions have motivated energy companies to supply natural gas to a wider base, what are the benefits that motivate people to opt for piped gas lines? We spoke to 5 people from different walks of life, who have one thing in common - they all use PNG. Here’s what they had to say about the switch from gas cylinders to piped gas lines:


Samin Sayeda, Writer, Resident of Delhi

Using PNG for 3 years

ET Spotlight
I have been living alone for the past 4 years. Cooking was once a chore because I had to keep a tab on the date of the cylinder refill, whether it has been connected properly, and other such things. However, I recently switched to piped gas line and it has made my life very easy. I can curb my midnight hunger pangs with some quick recipes without worrying about running out of gas. The convenience of piped gas lines is what makes it my preferred choice. The bills can easily be kept on auto-pay mode and the constant reminders on messages are also helpful.


Ranjana Nijhawan, Homemaker, Resident of Gurugram 

Using PNG for 4 years

ET Spotlight
 I have been using a piped gas line since we shifted to Gurugram 4 years ago. Having used gas cylinders for a long time, the shift to a piped gas line was comfortable. PNG is better on every front. It is very convenient to use, economical and, most importantly, it is not space-consuming. It is always good to have some extra storage space in the kitchen. In the past, there have been situations when guests had come in unannounced and we ran out of gas midway. The struggle to find a spare cylinder in such situations was real. However, with PNG, this hassle is a thing of the past. All things considered, I would always prefer using a piped gas line, for it’s very beneficial from a practical standpoint. 


Eric Lobo, Media Professional, Resident of Mumbai

Using PNG for 5 years

ET Spotlight
I had been using PNG for the last 5 years and it is very easy to use. I have a 3-year-old at home, and could never imagine him playing around gas cylinders. But I recently relocated and have had to rely on gas cylinders for the past two months. In this time, we have already run out of gas and survived on food deliveries for 2 days while we waited for the replacement. Having a mischievous toddler who keeps playing with stove knobs is one of the most terrifying things. Now I realize the comfort and safety PNG had given me. With its two-knob security, I am always sure that my kid is safe. I don’t have to deal with the constant fear that accompanies the use of gas cylinders. Also, the added convenience of never falling short of gas, or never having to double-check if the regulator is fitted properly or if it is actually turned off, makes PNG my most preferred option. My new place will be getting a PNG connection by the end of this month, and I cannot wait to return to this trusted source. 


Siddharth Sridhar, Advertising Professional, Resident of Mumbai

Using PNG for 6+ years

ET Spotlight
 I opted for a PNG connection as soon as it was introduced, and it has really been a boon for working professionals like me. Earlier, there have been times when I’ve had to leave from work early to collect gas cylinders, since it was impossible to find a suitable time to get the spare cylinders delivered home. Thanks to the sheer convenience of using PNG, cooking cylinders have become a thing of the past for me. The safety and comfort that PNG provides has made my life a lot easier. 


R. Sakuntala, Retired Teacher, Resident of Mumbai

Using PNG for 2 years

ET Spotlight
 I have used gas cylinders for decades but recently shifted to PNG. One big challenge that I no longer have to face is changing the cylinders. I dreaded lifting and transporting heavy gas cylinders. With a piped gas line, there is no heavy-lifting involved, and I don’t need to rely on anything or anyone for continuous and timely gas supply. In the past, there have been times when we had to borrow cylinders from neighbours or order in because we ran out of gas. Now I can easily enjoy cooking without worrying owing to the continuous gas supply. The bills are also easily payable online, making my life easier. 

All these stories emphatically establish that PNG is a widely preferred form of cooking gas. Another big benefit of using PNG is that natural gas has a lower environmental footprint compared to conventional fuels. But the question that needs to be asked is: what will it take for a wider switch to this safe, secure and reliable form of fuel? India is ramping up investment in the city gas sector to massively expand the reach of CNG and PNG. And its need for natural gas seems to be quenchable with energy leaders like ExxonMobil looking for innovative ways to expand India’s natural gas access. 

Earlier this year, ExxonMobil announced collaborations with India’s leading gas provider GAIL and local energy major Indian Oil. ExxonMobil, a leading innovator in the field of cleaner energy solutions, has been helping India expand access to gas-based energy for two decades. Rise in PNG consumption will be a major step, among others, towards increasing the share of natural gas in India’s energy market and lowering the country’s carbon emissions. 

 With energy players like ExxonMobil looking to boost this environment-friendly fuel, the rise of PNG is expected. And considering how satisfied people are with this source, it seems to be a win-win for all. As the user testimonies reveal, choosing PNG over gas cylinders not only increases convenience, reduces costs and strengthens safety, but also provides users with a pro-environment choice that needs to be made on a wider scale. 


Exxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates; for convenience and simplicity in this article, the term “ExxonMobil” is used as an abbreviated reference to one or more of these subsidiaries or affiliates."

73,2019-11-30,GAIL,"Mumbai: The government will likely need sizable privatisation income over the next five years given the fiscal pressures, with BHEL, GAIL India, Hindustan Zinc and NALCO likely to be the possible candidates, according to foreign brokerage CLSA.

PSU stocks with limited scope for privatisation such as ONGC, NTPC, Power Grid, Indian Oil Corporation, and Coal India, may continue to face selling pressures.

“The government has earned $12 billion via PSU stock sales through ETFs in the last three years and fear of more such sales will put supply pressure in the market on non-disinvestment candidates,” said CLSA.

However, the chances of the government concluding the BPCL privatisation before the end of the current financial year is challenging, the brokerage said.

“The experience of three previous successful cases back in 2001-2002 shows that privatisation is a time-consuming process and takes 6-16 months between global tender and deal consummation, thus, concluding the BPCL privatisation before Mar’20 is challenging,” said CLSA.

CLSA said weak tax collection growth and stimulatory measures by the government have created a fiscal shortfall of over ₹2 lakh crore in the current financial year. The government has set a fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of the GDP for the current financial year.

The brokerage believes that the disinvestment target may only grow going forward especially if more tax cuts happen and as other potential non-tax revenue sources are already constrained.

“Even assuming a 50-70 bps (basis points) relaxation, the current year’s record $15bn (billion) disinvestment target may only grow, especially if more tax cuts happen,” said CLSA.

The brokerage said the government’s total holding in listed PSUs is $174 billion of which financials account for $61 billion and those are unlikely to be disinvested in the near future.

Sale of SUUTI holdings is an easier option, but the government only has about $4.8 billion in the two stocks – Axis Bank and ITC – which can be easily sold, said CLSA."

2,2019-12-03,GAIL,"Pledging of client’s shares by Hyderabad-based Karvy Stock Broking to raise money to fund its real estate business has dented investors' confidence in stock brokers. Investors are shifting to larger brokers, says Jaideep Hansraj, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities in an interview with ETMarkets.com. Hansraj, who deals with 13.59 lakh customers, denied that it was a systemic failure and termed it as an isolated incident. Edited excerpts:


The mess at Karvy Stock Broking has actually dented stock investor confidence on brokers. What led to this? Was it a systemic failure?
Indeed, investor confidence has been shaken and several investors are shifting their demat accounts to larger, established players. While confidence in smaller, younger players may be impacted, there is a flight to safety to larger, established and regulated players. 

These cases happen where businesses hold their own interests higher than clients’. It is not a systemic failure, but an isolated instance of breaking norms of prudent business behaviour.

We believe that the financial services industry is all about trust, and any player taking this lightly impacts the entire industry. The broking industry is unique in itself that it is made up of a milieu of long-serving smaller players, start-ups, and some trusted large banking companies. 


Stockbrokers often crib about being over-regulated. But this kind of crisis keeps happening. Is the average investor safe with her broker?
Regulations are meant to safeguard the interest of the investors. In this case, it wasn’t strictly about regulation, but the interpretation of trust. The Depository Participant has a simple underlying principle that clients’ shares -- while under Power of Attorney (POA) for administrative purposes -- are held solely for them. They cannot and will not be used for anything else. 

You don’t need regulation for this, but a culture of ethical behaviour. The investor must know that in financial services, he has to trust the intermediary. Trust is built over the years of keeping client interest paramount. There is a value to this. There is safety in this.


What should investors do to protect themselves in such a situation?
Be smart, follow basics. Investors must choose carefully whom they want to do business with. One must not open an account with anyone just because the office is close to home, a friend has recommended, or it has a fancy website. The critical question to ask is – can I trust the institution and the people behind it? It is, after all, your hard-earned money. 


Let’s talk about the market. The indices have hit record highs while economic growth has slowed to a multi-quarter low. Isn’t that an aberration? What’s driving this rally? Is it sustainable?
There has been a disconnect between the macro-economic environment and markets, which could continue for some time. The Street seems to be factoring in a swift recovery in the economy, going by the rich valuations of the Nifty50. But we are not sure when the convergence between the economy and the market will take place. There is a mixed bag of factors in play here. 


Trust is built over the years of keeping client interest paramount. There is a value to this. There is safety in this.-Jaideep Hansraj
High-frequency indicators are not showing signs of macro improvement. But the broader Indices are close to near-highs. This is because of a faster recovery in earnings led by the corporate tax rate cut and lower loan-loss provisions for banks. 

After the reduction in corporate tax rate, earnings have picked up in Q2FY20, and foreing portfolio investors (FPIs) have turned positive on India. Sentiment and flows are also driving markets higher as there have been some positive developments on the US-China trade war. The series of intervention by the Finance Ministry in the last two months has also changed the mood of the market. 

There has been a remarkable difference in the performance of the top 20 stocks of the Nifty and the rest of the market. Most high-quality largecap stocks have benefited from the lower tax rate, and to that extent and their performance has further contributed to the Nifty’s up move. 


Midcaps and smallcaps are the talk of the town. But since the last time we saw a rally in midcaps, the equation has changed with market regulator Sebi’s reclassification of funds. Can one expect midcaps to rebound like in the past?
If you look at the valuations, both the midcap and smallcap indices are trading at a discount to the Nifty50. The midcap index forward PE is at a 12% discount to the Nifty’s forward PE. (In the middle of this year, the discount of the midcap index vis-à-vis the Nifty50 had fallen to 20%). 

Meanwhile, the underperformance of the smallcap index vis-a-vis the Nifty50 is closer to the three previous instances seen in the last 15 years. This portrays a good upside potential in the smallcaps against the largecaps. The midcap index too has broken the 200-week moving average on the upside and that could be a positive sign for the space.

For the mid and smallcaps to outperform the largecaps, we need a broad recovery in the economy with improved credit offtake along with better print of IIP and GDP growth. If the forthcoming Union Budget provides some incentives to taxpayers and investors, then we could see a broader rally in the market which could revive interest in the mid & smallcap space. 

A base for future outperformance of mid and smallcap has been set in this calendar year which could fructify in next calendar year as and when there is a broader economic recovery. One can increase exposure in mid and smallcaps vis-à-vis largecaps with a two to three-year view. 


Investors looking for value buys are facing a crucial question: which of the beaten-down stocks will rebound and which will probably never return to their previous highs again?
Investors need to be careful while evaluating value stocks and ascertaining whether they will recover or remain a value trap. Companies having deep value but lacking the ability to show revenue and earnings growth in future could be value traps and hence worth avoiding. Companies which are trading below their 10-year average valuations and can show revenue and earnings growth with recovery in their sector or economy, deserve to be evaluated and invested. 

Investors should have a specific checklist or parameters like quality of management, promoter holding and pledged shares, margins, return ratios, cash flows, working capital, etc. before taking the final decision to invest in any value stock. 

Excellent quality mid and smallcaps that have been beaten down due to the down cycle of the sector or economy and are available way below their RoE and RoCE, should be the preferred choice. Poorly governed companies with weak balance sheets and return ratios should be avoided as they may not be on investors’ and portfolio managers’ radar. 


How do you read the outcome from the just-concluded Q2 earnings season? Some say the numbers were good for select stocks mostly because of the corporate tax cut?
The September quarter results were optically healthy on earnings but weak on revenue growth. EBITDA looks very high due to the adoption of Ind-AS 116. Net Profit figures for many companies are not comparable on a YoY basis as many of them have moved to lower corporate tax rate and reduced their deferred tax liabilities or assets to account for the lower tax rate. Adjusted net profit of Nifty 50 declined by 3.2% YoY. 

Private sector banks reported weak earnings due to adjustment towards deferred tax assets, while SBI reported a significantly higher net profit as it continued with the earlier tax regime. Hence, if we see Nifty50 adjusted earnings growth excluding banks, then it has fallen by 10.5% in Q2FY20 on YoY basis. 

Nifty50 companies that outperformed our estimates on PBT basis include Cipla, Dr Reddy’s, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC and Tata Motors. Similarly, Nifty 50 companies that underperformed our estimates are: GAIL, Hindustan Unilever, IndianOil Corp, Tata Steel, UPL and Ultratech Cement. 

Sector-wise, banks, diversified financials, healthcare services, media and transportation delivered strong growth in net profit YoY while automobiles and components, gas utilities, metals and mining, oil & gas and telecom sectors declined YoY."

5,2019-12-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government said the Supreme Court order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) will be applicable to all telecom licensees, which includes companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and others, even though they were not party to the dispute between phone companies and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). This implies that companies with even minor telecom businesses may have to pay dues based on their entire revenue with retrospective effect.

“While most of the licensees of DoT were not direct party to the dispute, the ratio of the judgement will be applicable on all the licensees,” said communications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, answering a question in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. This is the first time the government has confirmed that the apex court’s ruling on the definition of AGR will also impact non-telecom companies, which may leave the firms that have telecom licences having to pay in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore, according to one estimate.

According to the DoT website, there are 3,468 telecom licensees across the country, including Power Grid, GAIL, Airports Authority of India, the National Stock Exchange, Ministry of Home Affairs, Cabinet Secretariat, Delhi Metro Rail Corp, NTPC, ONGC and Rail-Tel, among others. Many companies hold multiple types of licences under the same name. The minister did not specify the amount due on this account, while giving a list of licence holders in Karnataka.

On October 24, the Supreme Court decided in favour of the government’s contention that all revenue, including from non-core sources, would count as gross revenue for calculating AGR. The court mandated compliance with the order in three months or January end.

Licence holders have to pay about 8% of AGR to the DoT as fees. While the telecom companies that were directly party to the case owe the government about Rs 1.47 lakh crore — most of it owed by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea — the industry estimates that non-telecom companies may have to pay about Rs 2.28 lakh crore, calculated since the time they got their respective licences.

These licences that non-telecom companies have are for services such as internet access, national long distance calls, international long distance calls, V-Sat and captive services among others. Until now, they have been paying little by way of licence fees since revenue from telecom services was marginal.

For instance, state-run Power Grid gets 2% of its revenue from telecom services while power transmission accounts for nearly 95%. The company made Rs 742 crore in FY19 from its telecom business, putting its licence fee payment at Rs 59 crore. But under the expanded definition as per the October verdict, AGR would include all of its FY19 revenue, which is Rs 35,661 crore.

DoT on its part has already issued notices to all licence holders for their own fee assessment following the verdict and asked them to pay the amount within the stipulated time frame, even as it has sought legal opinion on how to deal with non-telecom companies.

Bharti Airtel has told DoT that all telecom licence holders, even if they were non-telecom companies, should be treated at par with the mobile phone companies while seeking additional licence fees. Bharti Airtel has estimated that PGCIL could be liable to pay an additional Rs 43,544 crore in licence fees, interest, penalty and interest on penalty.

A lobby group representing internet service providers (ISPs) has already written to the Prime Minister’s Office seeking its urgent intervention as any move to seek dues would have “serious financial implications” on oil and gas companies, power producers, the railways, data centres and others that have obtained telecom licences but were not part of the litigation involving telcos. This will lead to a “financial crisis in many small and medium ISPs that have operations in rural areas,” it has said. The Internet Service Providers Association of India has also sought a legal opinion on the applicability of the Supreme Court order on ISPs."
6,2019-12-05,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government is working on a scheme to salvage 24,000 MW of stressed gas-based power plants, built at an investment of over Rs 1 lakh crore, by importing natural gas and bundling the output with cheaper solar energy.

The power and petroleum ministries are working on the new proposal. The earlier scheme entailing subsidy has been shelved. The proposed new scheme will offer no subsidy and hopes to help operate the power stations at 90% capacity by selling the bundled power.

A senior government official said the earlier proposed e-regasified liquid natural gas scheme (e-RLNG), which involved an e-auction, was successful when there was electricity shortage in the country. He also said that in the later tranches, the scheme did not garner much interest from the developers.

He said bundling of solar power with an equal amount of gas-based power is expected to result in lower cost of production than blending domestic and imported gas-based power.

Power Trading Corp of India (PTC India) has been asked to work on the proposal, an official said. The gas is proposed to be imported by GAIL India with concessions and haircuts by central and state governments, power companies and gas transporters to make it affordable.

GAIL has indicated to the power ministry that it can import LNG for about $6 per unit, and deliver it to power plants for $8 a unit, which includes re-gasification, transit and taxes, sources said. With this, power can be generated at about Rs 4 per unit. The power ministry’ plan is to blend this with the assumed average renewable energy cost of Rs 2.75 per unit, expecting the blended rate will find enough takers among distribution companies under the merit order despatch rule, according to sources.

LNG prices are under immense pressure this year due to oversupply. Spot LNG rates for delivery to Asia are between $5 and $6 per unit. Indiadelivered LNG rates had fallen to less than $4 a few months ago but has now risen due to winter demand.

ET had earlier reported that the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India, has sought immediate government intervention to salvage the gas-based power plants from becoming non-performing assets.

SBI sought a long-term policy intervention to revive gas-based plants, and has asked for financial support from collections of coal energy through the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund. It has also sought a ‘must-run’ status to gas-power stations, similar to renewable energy plants, and reimbursement of fixed costs from the clean-energy fund to power distribution companies that enter into long-term power purchase contracts with these gas-based facilities.

The bank has also sought bringing natural gas under the ambit of goods and services tax.

The previous revival scheme, an extension of the previous rounds of subsidised gas auction schemes to power plants, was recommended by a high-level empowered committee on stressed assets. The government had planned to aggregate power from these plants through reverse online auction and do away with the subsidy component.

The proposed concessions include waiver of state and central taxes on imported LNG, waiver of GST on regasification and transportation of the fuel, reduction of pipeline tariff charges and marketing margin by GAIL. Electricity transmission charges for stranded gas-based projects are also proposed to be sacrificed. Power companies will not make any return on equity.

Power companies have been demanding government intervention as about 8,000 MW capacity is stranded while the rest is stressed. According to data available with the Central Electricity Authority, gasbased power stations in India operated at 23.27% of their capacity till October this year."

16,2019-12-09,GAIL,"Skip pricey onions for a week, you might just be able to make some quick bucks.

After the recent spike in prices, onion (per kg) is now more expensive than the current market price of 67 per cent of BSE-listed stocks.

Onion prices have hit Rs 140 a kg in some cities even when sellers are finding fewer takers for the vegetable. In Bengaluru, the prices hit the Rs 200 mark on Monday. Stocks at similar or lower prices on Dalal Street, too, have fewer takers as investors tread cautiously in their value hunt following the massive battering of stocks across sectors.

Pinching hard on consumer pockets, retail onion prices have surpassed the Rs 100 per kg mark in most cities across the country and are ruling at Rs 140 per kg in some places, PTI reported on Friday quoting official data maintained by the Consumer Affairs Ministry.

Of the 2,213 actively-traded stocks on BSE, as many as 1,488 now trade below Rs 140.

They include penny stocks like Garv Industries, which rallied 394 per cent to Rs 27.50 on December 5 from Rs 5.60 on January 1, 2019, as well as well-known names such as Adani Green Energy, A&M Febcon, Kavit Industries, Sonal Mercantile, CHD Chemicals, Krishna Ventures, Refex Industries and Sanmit Infra, BIL Energy, Delton Cables, Jump Network, Kapashi Commercial and Tanla Solution.

These stocks have more than doubled investor wealth so far in 2019.

The BSE500 basket covers roughly 95 per cent of BSE’s total market capitalisation.

Analysts are bullish on some of these stocks. For instance, Axis Securities has ‘Buy’ call on Federal Bank with a price target of Rs 100. The stock traded at Rs 84 on December 9.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a ‘Buy’ rating on Ashok Leyland with a price target of Rs 95. The stock traded at Rs 78 on Monday.

Emkay Global Financial Services is bullish on NTPC with a price target of Rs 146 against Monday’s trading price of Rs 112.

There are expectations that vegetable prices will remain volatile and may driving the consumer price inflation higher in the near term. “Onions, in particular, would see prices at elevated levels for 1-2 months till imports arrive and exports slow down.

The 30-share pack lost 348 points, or 0.85 per cent, to end at 40,445 for the week ended December 6. Nifty snapped a two-week gaining streak to settle 134 points down at 11,921.

After five successive rate cuts this year, the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), of RBI unanimously voted to hold the repo rate at 5.15 per cent. The central bank also cut its GDP growth forecast for FY20 to 5 per cent from 6.1 per cent estimated earlier.

That set the stage for plenty of action across top stocks and sectors.

Nifty opened with marginal gains on Tuesday, but started correcting from the word go and ended the session forming a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the daily chart. The index faced resistance around the 20 DEMA and continued to make lower lows throughout the day.

It formed lower highs and lows for the third consecutive session and closed below its immediate support at 11,888 level, which doesn’t bode well for the bulls. Now, we may see the continuation of the ongoing corrective move towards its next support at 11,800 and then 11,700 levels. On the upside, resistance shifted lower towards 11,950 and 12,050 levels.

In monthly options, maximum Put open interest was seen at strike price 11,500 followed by 12,000, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200 level. Some Call writing was seen at strike prices 11,900, 12,000 and 12,200, while there was marginal Put writing at strike prices 11,900 and 11,500, followed by unwinding at strike prices 12,000 and 12,100. Options data suggested a trading range between 11,700 and 12,100 levels.

India VIX fell 2.12 per cent to 14.29 level.

In line with the benchmark indices, Bank Nifty started correcting from initial trades and formed a Red Body Candle on the daily chart. The banking index moved within Monday’s trading range and thus formed an Inside Bar pattern on the daily chart. It closed below the 20 EMA on the daily chart. As long as it sustains below its resistance zone between 31,500 and 31,600 levels, a corrective move towards the 31,000 – 30,800 range cannot be ruled out.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,903 with a 0.53 per cent loss. There was long buildup in Hindustan Unilever, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance, while shorts were seen in Apollo Tyre, RBL Bank, GAIL, NBCC and ZEEL.

20,2019-12-10,GAIL,"A grouping of public sector officers’ associations wants the government to drop the idea of privatising Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) but said it would not go for a strike to press its cause as it was faced with a “mighty” government.

Representatives of officers’ associations from several state-run companies such as BPCL, Indian Oil, ONGC, GAIL, NTPC, SAIL and BHEL said at a press conference on Monday that BPCL’s proposed privatisation was like killing the golden goose and would hurt the economy, government’s social welfare programme and energy security.

Selling BPCL at current market price of about Rs 1.06 lakh crore would fetch the government just Rs 74,000 crore, including control premium of 30%, much less than the real value of the company, they said. On replacement cost value basis, the company should be valued at Rs 9 lakh crore, including Rs 22,700 crore of its brand value, they said.

“Government is very mighty. We are not going for any strike,” said Mukul Kumar, the convener of Federation of Oil PSU Officers (FOPO) and Confederation of Maharatna Officers’ Association (COMCO), on whether the federation was planning a strike.

Executives and workers at BPCL have been opposing the government’s decision to sell its entire majority stake in the company. The government plans to conclude the deal in this financial year and has already appointed legal, financial and valuation advisors.

Last month, BPCL workers’ union held a day-long strike but executives have refrained from going on strike, although they have been writing to the government against privatisation. BPCL’s employees, numbering about 12,500, are almost equally split between executives and workers, and therefore, a day-long strike by workers barely impacts the functioning of refinery or fuel supply. Further, the increasing proportion of temporary workers at plants dilutes the impact of a strike by permanent workers.

In recent decades, the power of employees’ unions has greatly eroded and industries have seen far fewer strikes.

If the government’s only aim behind privatisation was to bridge the fiscal deficit, employees of all public sector companies could offer to buy shares of BPCL and help raise funds, Mukul Kumar said, without giving any financial estimate on this.

Private players only seek profitable space in the economy and shun social responsibilities unlike public sector companies and therefore privatising BPCL would hurt the country, said Anil Medhe of BPCL’s officers’ association.

“We are not against privatisation. But private players should come and build their own infrastructure. They should not be handed everything on a platter,” said Kumar."
19,2019-12-10,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The government has warned all telecom licence holders against any delays in the payment of dues related to adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and has asked them to seek clarifications by December 13 on any doubts that may not have been covered in the recent Supreme Court judgment.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) asked all telecom licence holders, including non-telecom companies, to speed up the process of self-assessment of AGR-based dues and their payments in a letter written last week. Some 15 telcos need to pay over Rs 1.47 lakh crore, which could rise further, the government has said. Industry estimates peg the money owed by nontelecom companies, which hold nearly 3,500 licences, at around Rs 2.28 lakh crore.

The top court had given companies three months to make the payments in its October 24 order.

“Any issues should be pointed out in the comprehensive representation to be submitted, but in no case the self-assessment and payment of dues are to be delayed,” said the December 5 DoT letter, which ET has seen.

“The comprehensive representation shall be submitted within a week (latest by December 13),” the letter said.

The Supreme Court decided in favour of the government’s contention that all revenue, including that from non-core sources, would be counted in calculating AGR. Licence holders have to pay about 8% of AGR to the DoT as fees. Telcos also pay about 3-4% of AGR as spectrum usage charges (SUC).

Soon after the ruling, the DoT had asked all telecom licence holders to self-assess and submit their dues to the government within the stipulated three months.

The government recently made it clear that the AGR order will be applicable to all telecom licensees, which includes companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and others. These companies, which may have minor telecom businesses, may have to pay dues based on their entire revenue with retrospective effect. Non-telcos, including internet service providers (ISPs), have urged the intervention of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to resolve this issue.

“In this regard, it is pointed out that over a course of time, multiple representations related to LF (licence fee) assessments were received from various licensees for consideration by the department,” the DoT said in the letter. “After the judgment, most of these have been settled and for any remaining issues, a comprehensive representation needs to be submitted to the department.”

Further, the DoT has sought comprehensive year-wise and circlewise representations, but not on issues decided by the court order.



Last month, Bharti Airtel, facing dues of over Rs 35,500 crore, Vodafone Idea (over Rs 53,000 crore) and Tata Teleservices (nearly Rs 14,000 crore) filed for a limited review of the judgment. While Airtel has sought a review of the interest, penalty and interest on penalty, Vodafone Idea’s petition has further urged the Supreme Court to have a “relook at the amounts attributed to notional revenue”. Later, Bharti Airtel appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the telco and the government to agree on the quantum of AGRbased dues that need to be paid and the timeline for payments.

To prepare for the payments, Bharti Airtel’s board approved a proposal for the company to raise up to $4 billion, out of which it plans to raise $3 billion initially through a combination of equity and debt."
18,2019-12-10,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: South Korean state owned power utility Kowepo has begun international arbitration proceedings against India in Singapore for not honouring a fuel supply commitment to its Maharashtra power plant.

The development comes about a year after the company issued notices to the government seeking gas supplies within six months. It also comes on the back of the Centre seeking to end the impasse over executed contracts between renewable energy companies and the Andhra Pradesh government in order to safeguard clean energy investments.

Korea Western Power Co (Kowepo) owns a majority stake in Pioneer Gas Power Plant Ltd (PGPL), which operates a 388 MW project in Maharashtra’s Raigad district. It’s covered by the India-South Korea bilateral investment treaty (BIT) and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). Kowepo has sought about $400 million in compensation for loss and damages, a government official said. PGPL didn’t respond to queries.

After the arbitration notice was issued by the South Korean firm, the Centre set up an interministerial group. The Cabinet secretariat had in July asked the panel to seek resolution of the matter. The 42
nd standing parliamentary committee, in its report on gas-based plants, had also recommended allocation of fuel to the project. “However, Kowepo filed for international arbitration on November 29 after the government could not reach any consensus on project revival,” the official said.

The South Korean government, through various communications to the Indian side, had sought resolution of the issue to restore investor confidence. As per South Korea’s carbon-reduction programme, power generation companies such as Kowepo are obligated to cut emissions by investing in renewable projects in the country and in carbon-neutralisation projects of developing nations.

In its arbitration notice, Kowepo said the plant’s commissioning had initially been delayed due to lack of gas allocation, and that it could not participate in the government’s scheme for stranded gas-based plants as GAIL did not complete its pipeline in time.

The notice of arbitration has been sent to the Prime Minister’s Office and cabinet secretariat besides the ministries of finance, commerce, oil and gas and power.

Kowepo has said its 2012 India investment decision had been based on the legal and policy framework at the time as well as statements and notifications made by the Centre and Maharashtra government, apart from entities such as the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, power and petroleum ministries, Central Electricity Authority, Gas Authority of India, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board and standing parliamentary committee reports that painted a healthy picture of the Indian natural gas sector and called for investments through public statements.

An empowered group of ministers on natural gas had identified gas-based power generation as one of the priorities for domestic gas utilisation. This was substantiated by the 12th Five Year Plan."

50,2019-12-12,GAIL,"At a time the telecom sector is undergoing its biggest ever crisis, Bharti Enterprises Chairman and the pioneer of India’s telecom sector, Sunil Bharti Mittal speaks to ET’s Anandita Singh Mankotia about how the Supreme Court and the government needs to take a sympathetic view towards the sector on matters of AGR and multiple levies and why the country needs to ensure Vodafone Idea survives. 
Edited excerpts:


Telcos including Airtel have recently hiked tariffs, will that make the sector viable?
Tariffs have risen to some extent but the sector is still under stress. It is a rare situation where we have written to the Trai saying please regulate us, because the industry is killing itself.


Ho much more will the tariffs go up?
Tariffs on an average have to eventually reach Rs 300 per person month which means customers at low end pay about Rs 100 and at high end pay between Rs 450-500 , ie when they are consuming a lot. However, before that we should get to an ARPU of about Rs 200, a 70% jump from today’s Rs 128 so that at the lower end the Arpu is about 75. There are people who can easily afford Rs 500 but they are being forced to pay Rs 250, as telecom operators are fighting like cats and dogs in the market.


Will telcos soon go through another round of tariff hikes?
You cannot get to Rs 200 and then Rs 300 without the intervention of the Trai. We have been killing each other for three and a half years. Floor for tariffs is the only way to get sanity in the market. Also, the fact that the three of us have written to the regulator says something. First time COAI has an agreement on what to write.


Vodafone Idea has said the company could be headed to insolvency, what does that mean for the sector?
Nick Read and Kumar Mangalam Birla both have made that statement and it is in that backdrop I am saying that we need three plus one operator (three private and one public sector). It will be very self-serving for me to say that 2 plus one operators (two private and one public sector) is fine. I was the first private sector guy in telecom, and from my perspective I think India needs 3 plus one model. It is the 2nd largest market in the world. China has three operators, America has four operators. There is massive need of telecom for PM’s Digital India vision. Telecom has seen a brutal price war in the last three years and the result is broken balance sheets, 8 companies collapsed, went bankrupt or were sold for nothing. What we have now must be protected and for that the government must do whatever it can to support in whichever way they can. The govt must have a sympathetic view towards the industry.


 Govt has given a moratorium and tariffs have also risen, would you still call the situation dire?
Situation is dire. It is a matter of survival for everyone. Vodafone is in losses, Airtel is in losses, BSNL is in losses. There is one competitor who has unlimited access to finances, I wouldn’t comment on that but the situation is bad. Moratorium of two years can only help Vodafone Idea if there is an AGR relief. Otherwise, it is just deferment with interest. Lower the taxes, and find ways and means to support the sector in one form or the other and most importantly, the honourable SC needs to look at our review petition from the point of view that there are unintended consequences and lots of other companies including public sector are coming into this unreasonable AGR definition which could have never been the intention. So, have we failed to explain to properly? We should take some part of the blame on our legal team. My view is DoT was equally unaware of the ramifications it could have had.


Is the situation dire for Airtel as well?
We are holding out, fighting it out in the market place. I would say we are in a better situation, we are in the middle of raising funds. However, network expansion, investment in newer technologies, bidding for 5G spectrum and then building 5G ecosystem which India deserves, need the industry to become viable. Tariffs need to go up.


What support are you seeking from the government?
Levies. I have repeatedly said, you can’t tax telecom services like sin tax ! 30% of revenues are going in one or the other form of government levies, that must come down. Our hope was that the committee of secretaries would have recommended some reduction in levies. That has not happened. We urge the govt to take it up in a separate forum.

I mentioned to the secretary telecom that the Licence Fee, spectrum usage charge need to go down. Input tax credit is with the finance ministry. I believe that it will be taken up by the GST council, but given the situation of finances, I really doubt anything will happen there. Even if they cannot refund it, they can at least offset it. Rs 36,000 crore, this is sizeable sum of money, we get no interest on it but we pay interest on it.


Airtel filed a review petition in the AGR matter, have you had any discussions with the government?
AGR has been a bolt from the blue. It is a big bolt or jolt to the industry when already the chips were down and this has come on top of that. Our legal team were not able to persuade the Honourable Supreme court on the unreasonableness of DoTs AGR interpretation but equally, I think DoT didn’t realise the unintended consequences on the larger ecosystem. I mean Gail, Railtel, PGCIL, DMRC everyone is impacted. Now you will charge licence fee of telecom services on sale of gas ? Ramifications were huge and we hope the honourable SC will consider this issue.


Is this the toughest period the industry has undergone so far ?
We have gone through several crisis but this is the most difficult time for the industry. This is a time when digital ecosystem is most required in the country. It is an odd situation, We need a digital ecosystem to support new age industries and the telecom industry which was to play a crucial role in that is in the crisis."
49,2019-12-12,GAIL,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, did brisk shopping in November, buying select pharma, largecap and midcap IT stocks, besides a few PSUs, FMCG and metal & mining stocks.

Nifty advanced 1.50 per cent during the month.

The fund house also offloaded shares of some of the performing stocks in the largecap space, including ICICI Bank (2.50 crore shares) and Reliance Industries (43.79 lakh) as they hovered around record high levels. The fund sold nearly 25 lakh shares each TCS and SBI and 5 lakh shares in ONGC during the month.

The AMC bought 40 lakh to 1.50 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC, government-owned GAIL India and Coal India and drug major Sun Pharmaceuticals.

Sun Pharma turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore against a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore reported for the same period last financial year.

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other major buys in November included Aurobindo Pharma, REC, NTPC, NHPC, Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel, Lupin, Tata Steel, PNC Infratech, Neyveli Lignite, Infosys and Adani Ports, Delta Corp, Rites, Indian Hotel, J Kumar Infraproject and Persistent Systems, among others.

The fund house added 10 to 42 lakh additional shares of these companies during the month.


Watch | Smallcaps don't necessarily grow faster: Prashant Jain


In his recent interaction with ETMarkets.com, Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC AMC, said the entire market is reasonably valued, except for the consumer pack, which is trading above their long-term averages.

“Profit growth is recovering and the interest rate is low, which are good for valuations. The government has taken some good steps by cutting corporate tax rates, which would drive profit growth and encourage the manufacturing supply chain to be set up in India,” Jain said.

He also though the strategic divestment route for offloading government stake is very positive for PSUs, and this would encourage foreign inflows and lift valuations of public sector companies,” he said.

The fund house also added shares of several IT players during the month, including Tech Mahindra (4.19 lakh shares), Firstsource Solution (3.87 lakh shares), eClerx (0.64 lakh shares), L&T Technology (0.50 lakh shares), HCL Technologies (3,040 shares) and Newgen Software Tech (6,200 shares).

Elsewhere, it bought InterGlobe Aviation (4.84 lakh shares), Mishra Dhatu Nigam (8.15 lakh shares), JSPL (6.53 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (7 lakh shares), Power Grid (6.12 lakh shares), Tata Global Beverages (3.75 lakh shares), Bajaj Electronics (7 lakh shares) and LIC Housing Finance (2.95 lakh shares).

Other largecaps and midcaps HDFC AMC accumulated during the month included JMC Projects (34,600 shares) and Dr Reddy’s Labs (32,102 shares). YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and M&M Financial Services drew interest of the AMC in the financial space.

Last week, there were reports that the AMC was keen on participating in the capital infusion of YES Bank.

“Any business with reasonable quality, a sustainable business model and fair value or below-fair value is a reasonable investment. Smallcaps and midcaps vastly outperformed the largecaps for four years since 2014. That outperformance led to higher valuations. The correction seen in last two years, those excessive valuations have gone. Going forward, as valuations converge, we are not going to see a significant difference in the performance of largecaps, midcaps and smallcaps,” Jain said.

In the broader market, the BSE500 index gained 1.17 per cent last month, while BSE Midcap index rose 1.48 per cent and the Smallcap index 0.02 per cent, suggesting a widening of the market momentum, which had moved only a couple of largecaps till the previous month.

On the sell side, HDFC AMC sold over 5 lakh shares each in BPCL, HPCL, Federal Bank, Punjab National Bank, Voltas, McLeod Russel, Avenue Supermarts, Adani Power, ICICI Prudential, Repco Home and Tata Power, during the month.

It completely exited Ashok Leyland, Biocon, Info Edge, Ircon International, Lemon Tree and SAIL.

Godrej Consumer Products, Muthoot Finance and Sun TV Network were among the stocks the fund house entered afresh."

46,2019-12-12,GAIL,"ET Intelligence Group: The Supreme Court’s directive to telecom service providers to pay the pending dues pertaining to the underpaid licence fees and associated penalties and interest could adversely impact the non-telecom companies including GAIL, Oil India, and Power Grid Corporation.

This is because a small portion of revenues (under 2 per cent) of these companies comes from the optical fibre cable (OFC), which these companies have laid across their gas and power distribution networks. However, according to the Supreme Court’s decision regarding the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) does not distinguish between telecom and non-telecom companies and considers entire revenue of the companies for the calculation of the penalties.

The total pending payment related to AGR dues for non-telecom companies is around Rs 2.3 lakh crore and more than 90 per cent of this is from the thee three listed companies.

The AGR liability is the highest for GAIL at around Rs 1.2 lakh crore, followed by Rs 40,000 crore for Oil India, according to Emkay Global, a domestic brokerage house. For Power Grid, the liability is estimated to be around Rs 22,000-25,000 crore. In case of GAIL, gas transmission, gas marketing, LPG and petrochemicals segment form a major chunk of the revenue. GAILTEL, the company’s telecom arm has an OFC network of 12,000 kilometres.

Bloomberg
A senior official at Power Grid told ET that at the time of signing the licence agreement with the telecom ministry, it was made clear that only telecom revenue would be considered for the purpose of the licence fees. “It has therefore surprised us to know that core earnings are used to calculated AGR dues,” he added.

Power Grid’s telecom revenue increased by 9.3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 663.3 crore in FY19. Its total telecom network increased by about 27 per cent to over 60,900 km. These non-telecom companies are in the process of filing their responses in the next few days to the AGR demand.

The uncertainty surrounding the final outcome and any prolonged arbitration may keep the upside limited for their stocks until clarity emerges about the treatment of AGR for non-telecom companies."
45,2019-12-12,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal called on the government to ensure that the Indian telecom market continues to have three private carriers. He also urged the Centre and the judiciary to give “sympathetic consideration” to the industry’s appeal for relief after the Supreme Court’s order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) left companies struggling.

Mittal also said the telecom regulator needs to urgently intervene to fix a floor price for tariffs. This, he said, is required for the average revenue per user (ARPU) to rise to Rs 200 initially, and to Rs 300 over time, for the industry to be healthy and sustainable.

“The situation is dire — it is a matter of survival for everyone. Vodafone (Idea) is in losses, Airtel is in losses, (state-owned) BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd) is in losses,” Mittal said.


‘We’ve been Killing Each Other’
“There is one competitor who has unlimited access to finances — I wouldn’t comment on that but the situation is bad,” he said soon after a meeting with Department of Telecommunications (DoT) secretary Anshu Prakash on Wednesday.



“We have gone through several crises but this is the most difficult time for the industry,” Mittal added.

The presence of more companies is key to consumers being well served by competition.

“It is absolutely essential that we have three (private players) plus one (state-run) players,” he said. “Lower the taxes and find ways and means to support the sector in one form or the other.”

He urged the Supreme Court to consider Bharti’s review petition with understanding.

“The honourable SC needs to look at our review petition from the point of view that there are unintended consequences and lots of other companies, including public sector, are coming into this unreasonable AGR definition, which could have never been the intention,” he said.

He was referring to the government’s recent clarification that the AGR order will be applicable to all telecom licensees, which includes companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and others. These companies, which may have minor telecom businesses, may have to pay dues based on their entire revenue with retrospective effect.

“Our legal team were perhaps not able to persuade the honourable Supreme Court on the unreasonableness of DoT’s AGR interpretation but equally, I think DoT didn’t realise the unintended consequences on the larger ecosystem,” said Mittal, adding that the government should have a “sympathetic view” towards the industry.

Mittal said his comments were in the context of statements made by both Vodafone Group CEO Nick Read and Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, both of whom have said in the recent past that the Indian telco will have to shut if it doesn’t get any relief on AGR dues.

“It will be very self-serving for me to say that two plus one is fine. I, as a person who has watched this industry from scratch — I was the first private sector guy in telecom — so, from that point of view I think India needs three plus one,” Mittal said, referring to analysts who have said that Bharti Airtel stands to gain if Vodafone Idea collapses. He pointed out China, the world’s largest market, has three and the US has four operators.


MORATORIUM NOT ENOUGH
The recent two-year moratorium on spectrum payments won’t do much to help Vodafone Idea unless there is relief on the AGR dues. “Otherwise, it is just deferment with interest,” Mittal said.

Vodafone Idea was left facing statutory dues of over Rs 53,000 crore, as per the telecom department’s calculations, following the October 24 Supreme Court verdict that broadened the definition of AGR to include non-core items. The amount could go up, the government has said. Bharti Airtel faces over Rs 35,500 crore in additional dues comprising licence fees, spectrum usage charges (SUC), interest and penalties.

Both telcos, which have filed separate review petitions, reported record losses of over Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 23,000 crore in the July-September quarter, respectively, owing to provisions for the AGR dues. The government has previously said it can’t give AGR relief, unless directed to do so by the court.

Licence holders have to pay about 8% of AGR to DoT as fees. Telcos also need to pay 3-4% of AGR as SUC.

Fifteen telecom companies that were directly party to the case owe the government about Rs 1.47 lakh crore. The industry estimates that non-telecom companies that have telecom licences may have to pay about Rs 2.28 lakh crore, calculated from the time they got their respective permits.

Mittal said that non-telecom companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and Delhi Metro will now be charged licence fees even for the sale of gas or train tickets as per the wider interpretation of the apex court ruling, which shouldn’t be the case.

“Ramifications were huge and therefore the review petition is in front of the honourable SC and we hope they will look into this whole thing,” he added. He said the AGR dues have added to the woes of the industry, which has been swamped by “unprecedented competition” for over three years—since the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016—which has hurt balance sheets and caused financial stress, triggering the exit of eight operators.

“In the quest for being in the market, we have been killing each other for three and a half years,” Mittal said. “It is an odd situation — we need a digital ecosystem to support new age industries but equally, the industry is in a crisis”.


RARE SITUATION
He added that setting a floor for tariffs was essential.

“It is a rare situation where we have written to the Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), saying please regulate us, because the industry is killing itself. Tariff needs to go up, industry needs to become viable,” said Mittal. “Also, the fact that the three of us (Airtel, Reliance Jio Infocomm and Vodafone Idea) have written to the regulator says something. First time, the COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India) has an agreement to write something.”

Last week, all three carriers, through COAI, asked the sector regulator to establish floor pricing for data services soon. Due to fierce rivalry, tariff correction was not possible voluntarily by any carrier, it said.

“My own view is India needs to be eventually at Rs 300 (ARPU), per month which means customers at low end need to pay about Rs 100 and higher end need to pay Rs 450-500, where they are consuming a lot,” he said.

The government needs to lower levies to help the industry.

“You can’t have telecom services being taxed like the sin tax! 30% of revenues are going in one form or the other—that must come down,” said Mittal.

He urged the telecom ministry to take up issues such as lowering licence fees and SUC in some forum, given that the panel of secretaries set up to provide relief to the industry didn’t take decisions on those matters.

Mittal wasn’t hopeful of a refund of the Rs 36,000 crore input tax credit lying with the finance ministry, given the government’s finances.

“It is our money sitting with the government and even if they cannot refund it, can they at least offset it? Rs 36,000 crore, this is sizeable sum of money, we get no interest on this but we pay interest,” said Mittal.

He said however that Bharti Airtel was fighting it out in the market place.

“We are in a better situation—we have now decided to raise funds,” Mittal said. “However, if you have to go in for network expansion, invest in newer technologies, bid for 5G spectrum and then build a 5G ecosystem which India deserves, then industry needs to be viable.”

Referring to the Bharti Airtel statement in the fiscal second quarter regarding concerns about viability if it couldn’t raise money on its terms in the face of the AGR dues, Mittal said, “That is an accounting standard… They (auditor Deloitte) called it out. It isn’t my interpretation or view of the company… It is a standard and that is why we are in the market to raise money.”"

58,2019-12-16,GAIL,"MUMBAI: Telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that he didn't appreciate Vodafone Group’s comments about pulling out from India unless given relief on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, saying no one can 'dictate terms' to India.

“I don’t appreciate this kind of statement. Very firmly and very clearly. We have given all the opening for doing business but no one should dictate terms on us. India is a sovereign country...,” said Prasad at the Times Network India Economic Conclave 2019 on Monday . 

In November, Vodafone Group’s CEO Nick Read had highlighted the stress in the sector post Supreme Court’s verdict on AGR dues and said that the UK arm will not infuse any further equity and may eject without relief. He had later said he was misquoted. But in another event earlier this month, Vodafone Idea’s chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said that without sufficient relief, the telco will have to shut down .

The telecom minister assured on Monday that a monopoly was not on agenda and state-run BSNL and MTNL were important assets as well.

“We don’t countenance any monopoly nor we will. BSNL and MTNL are strategic assets...Therefore we owe it...For a fair competition a strategic PSU must remain in the field,” Prasad said . 

The government so far has given a two year spectrum moratorium and will await the call of the top court on review petitions filed by players like VIL and Bharti Airtel on the AGR verdict. The apex court had in October widened the definition of AGR to include non-core items, leaving the two telcos facing dues of over Rs 89,000 crore which needs to be paid by January end.

“We have done our best for the private sector. They wanted two things which we have done namely- from 10 installment from spectrum charge we have extended to 16 and all the spectrum installment from 2021-22 and other two years have been now completely put on hold giving them a cool benefit of Rs 42,000 crores,” added Prasad. 

The minister said PSUs who are impacted by AGR verdict have submitted a representation, which is being examined by the government.

In another session during the event, Piyush Goyal too commented on the telecom sector that is reeling under a debt of Rs 7 lakh crore and has stoked the fear of further shrinking from a three private player market to a two player only. 

“Government also acquired stress. Railtel will have to shell out some 80 odd crores, BSNL has a stress, I am told GAIL has a big problem. These will have to be sorted out in consultation with the honourable supreme court. Government proactively or suo moto cannot take an action on this but I assure you we are in continuous dialogue,” said Goyal. 

The telecom and IT minister also fielded questions on data privacy. “ The SC has held privacy to be a fundamental right but they have also stated that a terrorist or a corrupt person do not have any privacy,” said Prasad .

The government said it needs to maintain the balance between privacy and security where both are of paramount importance . 

“I am trying to highlight is that the rights/privacy of individual is paramount and also of the government’s obligation to maintain safety, security and fair investigation,” he added . 

The minister noted that data must be available for policymaker to frame the policy but that data must be anonymised data.

When asked about justice B N Srikrishna‘s comments that the data protection bill tabled in Parliament, that exempts its agencies from some or all provisions into an “Orwellian State”; Prasad defended saying he will discuss fine prints with one of the key drafters of the bill. “He will be able to understand that we have followed in principal what he had recommended,” said Prasad , but added “ freedom of speech is subject to reasonable restriction for the safety, security of India. The most pristine freedom is not unlimited”. 

The telecom minister highlighted the controversy around global digital firms and their tussle with the government on data security and localisation . 

“I don’t want to prejudice their case except to gently remind these global companies, India has the biggest global presence of Facebook, welcome, India has the biggest global presence of Whatsapp, welcome, Twitter etc. All welcome. India is a free democratic country, you all are welcome to do business in India but do it fairly in accordance with law,” he said."
57,2019-12-16,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal Monday ruled out any suo motu or proactive support to the ailing telecom sector but said that the government is in continuous discussions with the industry.

“Government proactively or suo motu cannot take an action on this (AGR) but I assure you that we are in continuous dialogue,” Goyal said, and added that the revenue issue pertains between the top court and the industry. 

In October, the Supreme Court settled a decade-and-a-half long dispute between the incumbent telecom companies and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on AGR, leaving telcos facing as much as Rs 1.47 lakh crore worth of dues to the government. 

“Government has also acquired stress. RailTel will have to shell out some Rs 80 crores. BSNL too has a stress. I am told GAIL has a big problem. These will have to be sorted out in consultation with the Supreme Court,” Goyal said.

Public sector firms too have been impacted by the apex court’s decision. Several non telecom firms with telecom licenses such as Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), PowerGrid, Oil India and GAIL that together owe more than Rs 2 lakh crore as AGR dues are also expected to file a review petition since telecom is not their core business. 

Following the top court’s verdict, ailing telecom carriers already sitting under a cumulative debt of more than Rs 7.5 lakh and plagued with falling revenue further stressed and demanded Centre’s immediate intervention.

The government on the back of recommendation from a group of secretaries, allowed a two-year moratorium on spectrum payments to incumbent telecom players.

Earlier, Vodafone Idea and met government officials, and according to Goyal, the executives demanded to defer the two years’ dues without affecting the net present value, which the Centre accepted.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have a maximum exposure in the wake of AGR ruling, and have been asked to pay nearly Rs 53,000 crore and Rs 35,000 crore respectively.

“So I think when the government wants to help, it will also need the sector willing to take some proactive measures,” he said.

Goyal also said that the telecom sector is finally investing in technology to upgrade their systems and make them relevant to market demands which according to him, is a good sign, and added that it was something they should have done five years ago.

With upcoming spectrum sale including 3300 Mhz - 3600 Mhz frequency range for next generation networks is around the corner, the stressed sector is finding it hard to bid for new airwaves owing to high price."

59,2019-12-17,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL) has asked the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to waive the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of Rs 4,990 crore, said its chairman Pravin Kumar Purwar.

“The AGR impact on BSNL is minimal. We have asked the DoT to waive the amount payable,” Purwar told ET, adding that an equity infusion could also be considered.

BSNL has to pay a licence fee of Rs 2,099 crore and spectrum usage charge (SUC) of Rs 2,890 crore to the DoT, following the Supreme Court verdict in October asking mobile service providers as well as other entities having a telecom licence to pay dues on account of AGR calculated on overall business.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have the maximum liabilities of nearly Rs 53,000 crore and more than Rs 35,500 crore respectively, while newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm has the lowest liability of around Rs 60 crore.

On December 13, BSNL sent a letter to the telecom secretary, seeking a reprieve on account of AGR outgo, but the DoT has yet to take any decision. BSNL, the fourth-largest telecom operator in the country, posted a net loss of Rs 13,804 crore in 2018-19.

The top court has asked the companies to pay their dues within three months from the October 24 order. Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices have filed a review petition seeking waivers on interest and penalty as well as interest on penalty. Other state-owned firms such as DMRC, PowerGrid, Oil India and GAIL, which together owe more than Rs 2 lakh crore as AGR dues, as per the SC’s ruling, are also expected to file review petitions, arguing that they shouldn’t be liable for licence fees since telecom is not their core business."

79,2019-12-22,GAIL,"NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications has sought Rs 1.72 lakh crore in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's ruling on revenues that need to be taken into consideration for payment of government dues. Sources with direct knowledge of the development said DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking Rs 1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence. 

 In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government. 

 The firm told DoT that it had obtained ISP licence in 2002 for a period of 15 years, which expired in 2017. But GAIL never did any business under the licence and since no revenue was generated it cannot pay any amount. 

 On IP-1 and IP-2 licences, GAIL has told DoT that it generated Rs 35 crore of revenue since 2001-02 and not Rs 2,49,788 crore that has been considered for levying past dues, they said. 

 Sources said the dues being sought are more than three times the networth of GAIL and several times the actual revenue earned. 

 The Supreme Court had on October 24 ruled that non-telecom revenues earned by firms using spectrum or airwaves allocated by the government will be considered for calculating statutory dues. 

 While telcos such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea may have had non-telecom revenues generated from using the government licence and spectrum, firms such as GAIL had no such revenue. 

 DoT is seeking Rs 1.47 lakh crore from all telcos in past statutory dues. 

 Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking Rs 1.25 lakh crore from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence. 

 PowerGrid says it has an adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of Rs 3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to Rs 22,168 crore. 

 Infrastructure provider category- I (IP-I) are those infrastructure providers who provide assets such as dark fibre, right of way, duct space and towers to the licensees of telecom services. 

 GAIL has a vast network of gas pipelines and it laid optic fibre along it to provide bandwidth to third parties. 

 Issuance of IP-II licence was discontinued in December 2005. 

 Sources said DoT estimates that the telecom operators owe Rs 55,054.51 crore as spectrum usage charges (SUC) as on October 31, 2019, while the figure for licence fees stands at Rs 92,642 crore."

85,2019-12-23,GAIL,"YES Bank has said one of the European entities is interested in deploying near $1 billion. If it materialises, then it will be a little bit of a breather for them, says Yogesh Mehta, Founder, Yield Maximiser. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Let’s talk about YES Bank. Time is really ticking on its fund-raising plans because Ravneet Gill in his last interaction was very confident that he would be able to close in on the fund raising by the end of the calendar year.In my opinion, YES Bank has got a shortage of the tier I and tier II capital and working capital is the biggest hurdle right now. They are desperately in need of funds. The first round of fundraise was successful. The second round was in a dilemma; as for the third one, today again the announcement has come that one of the European entities is interested in deploying near $1 billion. If it materialises, then it will be a little bit of a breather for them on the downside fall of the stock and the business may be on back on track partially, not fully.

This kind of refuelling is necessary for them and if this happens, then at around Rs 40-45, the stock will have some support. If they are getting some more funding after the fourth or fifth round, then it would be a good opportunity for YES Bank to flare back to normalisation and the business can be consolidated further. But till then, even if the fund raising plans materialise, the stock should see some support at Rs 40-50.


There is a little bit of pressure on Reliance. While the markets not too worried as there is no immediate liability, nonetheless any hiccup in the Aramco deal could lead to further pressure on the stock. What is your take?The recent news flow on Reliance is a little bit of dampener right now. It is too early to predict right now but the government seems determined enough to have this preliminary warning situation persist further and it may continue in the second hearing. Then, it will be really worrisome. Any which way, 20% stake buy by Aramco is not being looked at positively by the government for the Indian economy. Reliance will have some uphill task if they are not able to get the deal past the government. 

Till the next hearing, there will be a question mark on the appreciation in Reliance stock price. But Rs 1,500-1,580 or Rs 1,500-1,600 would be the range for Reliance because this is the major outcome they were betting on and it has come to halt.


What could potentially happen to the telecom stocks? Thanks to the AGR mess, the overall balance sheet has come under renewed pressure. Most of the managements have been asking for some sort of reprieve. How are you assessing the situation?Since the AGR issue, the incumbent telecom companies had to do a major write-off in Q2 numbers. This may continue and apart from that, the debt situation is such that they are not able to repay at this point in time. I do not think they will be able to repay over next four-five years at least. Even if 5G spectrum licence auction happens sometime in CY2020, again that has been priced four to five times higher. So, that is another hanging sword over the telecom companies, deteriorating their balance sheet further.

It is too difficult for them unless and until the profitability improvises further in the second half of this financial year even after taking this price hike. They are in a situation where they are not able to raise funds and they are not able to make handsome. The 5G spectrum auction is going to be a major expense. 

Voda Idea and Bharti, after a price hike, are having a breather but next hike is not possible even in the next one year. That will be something which we need to watch out for and will not be viewed so positively. 

If there is any relaxation into the 5G spectrum charges and license fees, then we may see some uptick into that, but even the downside for these companies is also right now limited. But Jio and Bharti will have some immunity on the downside as well.


What is happening with GAIL? The Department of Telecom (DoT) has slapped a Rs 1,72,000-crore odd due on them. Would you say that it is fair considering GAIL is not a pure play telecom company to seek such hefty dues?Yes, I do believe that it would not be fair on the government’s part to impose such large sum on GAIL where it is not even a pure play telecom. Maybe if it would be a demerged entity, then it would be fair enough but I do not foresee that. GAIL’s preliminary reaction showed on the stock prices but it should not be considered that way and tge probability is much higher that it will get revoked sooner or later because GAIL was never been considered into any of the telecom businesses as far as 100% business is concerned. It was more into pipeline and demerged entity is not there and hence it should be revoked sooner or later.


Do you believe PSU stocks are in a position to see strong returns going ahead?The way the government has approached the new divestment regime and raising funds to curtail fiscal deficit to offtake into various PSU companies, it is a positive and welcome move provided there are enough bidders for that at reasonable prices and till then it will be too early to say. 

The government plans to divest partially or 100% in say BPCL or Shipping Corporation or any other entity like BEML and the talk is on. It would be logical for the government to encash those and if there are any private bidders, one would be the most welcome first and then the foreign entity. In order to curtail fiscal deficit, it would be very helpful but it should be done by March 2020. Otherwise, it would be too difficult to get interested bidders after that.


Among banks and other financials, what are you focussing on? I am avoiding PSU banks because the stock prices have run up, particularly in SBI. I will wait for a correction. But right now, among NBFCs, I like Muthoot Finance, as the gold lending business is much more secure and seems to be very safe because the gold prices have soared higher and seem steady, considering the global concern over the economy footsteps.

Gold would be safe and secure one at this point in time for the next six to nine or 10 months. The gold lending business would be stable and secure and they can continue growing by 15-17% CAGR at least for FY20 to FY21 and the ROCE and ROEs stand very strong. The margins also are reasonable to high range. That is giving some comfort to the new buyers and attracting new buyers at the current prices. Mannapuram Finance is at an all-time high but Muthoot is also near all-time high levels. 


What is your outlook for 2020?Difficult to say because 2019 was a tough year. Though we have seen a good rally of about 12-13% in largecaps and the Bank Nifty is more than that and midcaps are still struggling with 5-6% negative returns in the calendar year 2019. 

In 2020, once the US-China trade war gets settled, we may see a good earning revival because of the tax rate cut. So, the second half should have a better scenario than the first half and that should give some more positivity to the equity markets. 

In November 2020, elections will be held in the US and that will be a trend decider. But till then, the earning revival would be a trajectory where we can bet heavily -- not a 20-22% growth rate but rather 17-18% growth rate in EPS for Nifty companies. Also, we may see a good uptick in the second line stocks. 

In 2019, we have seen a polarisation where sectoral leaders in selective sectors like private sector banks, oil and gas and the FMCG companies have done well, but the rest of the companies have not participated. Overall, on the economical revival scenario, the NBFC companies partially, the PSU banks very partially, the pharmaceutical space and with the scrappage policy and BS-VI norms, auto would be another sector to bet on in 2020."
88,2019-12-24,GAIL,"Going forward, we have asked for a redefinition of the AGR based on TDSAT ruling and then reducing the licence fee and spectrum usage charge, says Rajan Mathews, DG, COAI. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


With cries of help from the telecom sector veterans and corporates, do you think this kind of a cut in the licence fee will do precious little or would it be a step in the right direction?First of all, it is more than a cry, it is a scream at this point, in terms of what the industry is looking for. There is a combination of factors that the industry was really looking to pull itself up out of this situation. One, clearly concerns the AGR issue. Going forward, we had asked for a redefinition of the AGR based on the TDSAT ruling and then basically reducing the licence fee and spectrum usage charge. 

If the government is considering that and we did pitch it to the finance minister last week when she was holding open house meetings vis-à-vis inputs into the budget. She had indicated that the government was considering this and that the DoT should continue to push for that. Any relief that comes from 2-3% or more reduction in licence fees, spectrum and usage charges would be a great boost to the industry in terms of cash flow.

Tariffs will have to continue to increase because that is the industry’s responsibility. It is a combination of factors that is going to address the financial distress the industry finds itself in.


Is the AGR issue so precarious that only some sort of aid from the government is likely to solve things?Very clearly yes, because when you look at the revenue stream for operators, 30% of every rupee of the top of our revenue stream goes to the government. That is why we have requested the government to address the situation. You cannot continue to extract that type of revenue from the industry and ask to just rely on tariff increases because at some point, consumers will have a problem. 

It is a combination of factors -- the government being able to address the reduction in its stake from the revenue stream which is AGR and in addition to that, the discipline from the industry in terms of having to raise tariffs. The combination again is there. There is no one silver bullet either from the government or the tariff itself that is going to address the issue. 

On AGR, we have had conversations with DOT and they have indicated that they are waiting for the review petitions to be finalised with the Supreme Court and once the Supreme Court makes its determination on the two review petitions that are up there, then they will be in a situation to determine the way forward. 

One additional factor on the AGR now is the larger impact vis-à-vis other companies like GAIL and elsewhere. The issue of AGR seems to be spreading beyond just the telecom operators. This is going to be an additional factor that the government will have to consider in terms of addressing AGR now.


What do you make of the developments that are happening in the telecom space right now? When I talk about the developments, I am talking about the price hikes that have happened. Yesterday, a new offer was announced and it does not seem to be disruptive by one of the top players. Do you think the industry is getting to a rational mode? Can prices go up further from here on?Yes, we have been saying that tariffs will have to be raised in the short term by at least Rs 200 ARPU and we are trying to get that discipline embedded in the industry. 

There is a concerted understanding that unless tariffs move in the right direction, no amount of relief from the government itself is going to be adequate. We are hoping that these will be done in a reasonable, rational and appropriate manner. 

We are hoping to see how that takes. There is a 35-40 day lag as the old plans that are already embedded in the industry move out and the new plans take effect. We are waiting to see how the new tariffs impact consumers."

100,2019-12-29,GAIL,"After sending out notices to firms such as gas utility GAIL for crores of rupees in past dues, the Department of Telecommunications has said that any relief to non-telecom companies from payment of enhanced levies can come only from the Supreme Court.

The Telecom Department is current ""examining"" the replies given by the state-owned non-telecom corporations on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues, a senior official said.

""They have sent their replies, which we are examining. We believe that they will have to go to Supreme Court to seek notification or clarification on whether they are included or not included in this (Supreme Court order). That is for them to seek,"" the Telecom Department official told PTI.

There are certain cases where players were parties in the court and in those cases the companies are bound by the court order. Some parties have also filed review petition, the official noted.

""Then there were others who were not parties, they will have to take a call because our assessment is that it will be applicable...we are examining the issue but in our assessment they will probably have to go to SC to seek a clarification,"" the official added.

As it is, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies owe the government nearly Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past statutory dues. These AGR liabilities arose after the Supreme Court in October this year upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses for calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fees to the exchequer.

The apex court allowed three months to the affected companies to cough up the amounts due to the government.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has meanwhile made it clear that the AGR order will apply to all licencees, including companies such as GAIL, RailTel, and Power Grid.

As things stand today, such players, despite a smaller telecom exposure, may have to pay liabilities computed on their entire revenue.

Non-telcos, such as internet service providers (ISPs), had argued that DoT has unnecessarily imposed the order on internet service providers, many of which are run by entrepreneurs in smaller cities and towns. It had also sought intervention of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to resolve this issue.

The DoT has sought Rs 1.72 lakh crore in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's AGR ruling.

DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking Rs 1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence. In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government.

Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking Rs 1.25 lakh crore from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence. PowerGrid says it has an AGR of Rs 3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to Rs 22,168 crore."
