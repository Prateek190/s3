8,2018-01-04,Phosphorus Limited,"Name of the Company: Farmss Name of Founder(s): Mayur Tambe and Shraddha M Bagwe

City: Nashik

Revenues: NA

Headcount: 3

Industry: Agriculture

Despite the advances in technology, the agrarian sector of the country seems to have been completely bypassed on the road to modernization and automation. Green shoots of change are, however, now visible. 

Ask any farmer, and he would unequivocally state that the soil is the most important asset to carry out any form of cultivation. The fertility of the soil and the amount of essential nutrients he needs to add, plays the biggest part in what he is finally able to produce. This is where understanding the condition of the soil becomes very important for the farmer. 

Currently, soil tests are done in a laboratory setup in India, which faces a lot of problems in terms of lack of adequate quality infrastructure and skill sets. Farmers often fail to receive the results on time, and even if they do, there is a high chance of the result being fudged. In the end, farmers end up making approximate decisions on the condition of their soil. ""Our attempt is to provide a new way for these farmers on how soil testing service can be availed near field while also getting reliable results,"" says Shraddha M Bagwe, co-founder, Farmss.

To get around this problem, Farmss is building a mobile based near-field soil testing and fertilizer recommendation platform for small and marginal farmers to enable informed decisions about fertilizer usage. A compact solution to provide quick, but reliable soil testing service that can be taken around anywhere in the country, with the help of village level entrepreneurs, is what the startup wants to achieve. 

""We believe the last person in the value chain i.e. the village level entrepreneur, is the most important person in the whole implementation and therefore our product's four key attributes are - easy to reach/scale, easy to use, accurate and reliable, low cost,"" says Bagwe, 23. 


Soil Mechanics
The solution that Bagwe and her co-founder Mayur Tambe have come up is simple for the farmer to follow and consists of three parts. The first part involves sample collection where a person on-field collects the soil sample in a bag and tags the bag. The information of the farmer, such as name, geo location, land area and crop is recorded in a mobile application. 

The sample then needs to be taken to the village of the Farmer Producers Organization (FPO) where tests can be run using Farmss kit, which consists of a chemical colorimetric kit that extracts the nutrient from the soil and develops a colored complex. The intensity of solution coloration is a measure of the nutrient concentration. The Farmss mobile based color detection system that consists of a phone and an add-on considers the solution as an input and reads the color to give a quantitative nutrient concentration value. 

""The existing colorimetric kits are not practically used in the field as the color detection by the human eye is very difficult and due to interference of natural light. This gap is addressed by Farmss mobile based color detection system to get appropriate quantitative concentration value,"" says Bagwe.

Lastly, based on the nutrient concentration, the same testing app further calculates the appropriate fertilizer recommendation for a specific farmer. The testing app is linked to the sample collection application, which provides the farmer necessary information to calculate the fertilizer needed. This report can also be sent electronically sent to the farmer's phone. The nutrient status and fertilizer recommendation report helps the farmer make informed decisions and ensure optimum fertilizer usage

Farmss Soil testing process.


Getting the mix rightTambe and Bagwe met at a workshop organized by Digital Impact Square, a social innovation center and an initiative by TCS Foundation in Nashik. Shared interest to do something innovative around agriculture meant that the duo ended up collaborating for what was to be innovators working on a ""challenge"" for a period of six months. 

""The complexity of the challenge inspired us to find a solution. Throughout the first six months, we validated the problem statement in the field, attempted a couple of solutions, failed and reattempted. At the end of six months we had version one of our solution prototype which was reviewed by DISQ panel and we were given a go ahead for our further journey,"" says Bagwe.

But the end of six months proved to be a tipping point for both the co-founders. ""We had other plans in place, but we knew we could not stop what we had started to work on. This was fading as an internship and becoming more of our own venture. We knew addressing this challenge was as much socially impactful as it was a sustainable business idea. We saw that as a perfect social business opportunity and decided to pursue it. I took a year off from Welingkar Institute, where I was doing my PGDM and then the two of us were completely dedicated to Farmss,"" says Bagwe. 


Impact
For small and marginal farmers who are 80% of the total (about 110 million), saving on the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) or NPK fertilizers can also add a lot of value to decrease their cost of production. The wide ratio of one soil testing lab for 2.09 lakh farmers in India (with the capacity of a lab being 3000 samples per year) and the lack of skilled lab personnel puts a question mark on the quality and reliability of lab results leave alone the timeliness of the same.


ET Online
Co-founders Mayur Tambe and Shraddha M Bagwe.
According to the Census of India 2011, District Census Handbook Nashik, almost 60% of the farmers (about 5 lakh) are such, who want to do the soil testing, but cannot, and have ended up taking approximate decisions.

""We want to impact the lives of these small and marginal farmers and bring them the scientific way of making decisions while creating awareness among those who were till now not able to experience the benefits of soil testing due to lack of facilities,"" says Bagwe.

The service would essentially be charged on a per test basis, which would be somewhere ranging between Rs. 50-100 for five parameters (NPK, pH, EC) and recommendation. ""We are currently in the development and calibration stage, where we calibrate the results against a standard certified laboratory and we look forward to starting our pilot tests early this year,"" says Bagwe. 

The young co-founders initially used their stipend to fund the project, but have found support from the ecosystem along the way. For instance, the National Agro Foundation (Tamil Nadu) has come on board as the research partner for this project. ""They also have an NABL certified soil testing lab in Chennai and supported us with the lab research and testing, which means we did not have to bear that cost. Currently we are also working with another lab in Nashik which is supporting us by providing their already tested samples and results, which we recheck to validate our solution. This is how we have managed to lower our research expense by finding like-minded people and people who believe in our vision,"" says Bagwe. 

Sahyadri Farms with over more than 8000 marginal farmers, on the other hand, being a Farmer's Producer Company is also helping the startup implement and validate the model with the farmers associated with them.

32,2018-01-17,Phosphorus Limited,"Select smallcap and midcap stocks created huge wealth for investors over the past five years. While largecaps delivered up to 1,500 per cent return during this period, some smallcaps gave up to 8,000 per cent. 

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex spurted 75 per cent during this period, with TVS Motor soaring 1,486 per cent to Rs 768 on January 10, 2018 from Rs 48 on the same day in 2013. 

It was followed by non-banking finance company Bajaj Finance, which rose 1,223 per cent to Rs 1,800 from Rs 136. Vakrangee advanced over 1,200 per cent in the same period.

Other stocks that advanced over 5 times in last five years included Eicher Motors (up 906 per cent), Britannia Industries (up 842 per cent), Aurobindo Pharma (up 606 per cent), Motherson Sumi (up 539 per cent).

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher are positive on Britannia and Aurobindo Pharma with price targets of Rs 5,226 and Rs 877, respectively.

Market experts believe Britannia is on the cusp of significant profit growth thanks to a gradual recovery in volume growth, strong tailwinds from the decline in sugar prices and SMP even as wheat and palm oil prices remained stable and competitive advantage after higher GST rate prompted Parle to increase prices. Sustained gains from cost efficiency programmes in the coming quarters will also boost bottom lines. The company’s product portfolio remained robust and re-launch of Treat has been received well in the market. 

Brokerage Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Motherson Sumi with a target price of Rs 459. The scrip traded at Rs 379 on January 17.

“Motherson Sumi offers strong earnings visibility along with improving capital efficiencies. We estimate the company’s consolidated revenues, Ebitda and PAT to grow 22 per cent, 30 per cent and 33.5 per cent CAGR, respectively, during FY17-20E,” the brokerage said.

Shares of Maruti Suzuki, HPCL, Bharat Forge, UPL, Bajaj Finserv and MRF jumped between 430 per cent and 500 per cent between January 2013 and January 2018.

Motilal Oswal is also positive on the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 11,026. Nirmal Bang Securities has a ‘sell’ rating on HPCL with a target price of Rs 321.

Most of the largecaps on the list have been reporting a rise in bottomline numbers year after year. For instance, Maruti Suzuki’s profit grew from Rs 2,469 crore in FY13 to Rs 7,511 crore in FY17. It posted profit numbers of Rs 2,852 crore, Rs 3,807 crore and Rs 5,497 crore for FY14, FY15 and FY16, respectively.

Motherson Sumi, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Eicher Motors, Vakrangee, Aurobindo Pharma, TVS Motor and Bajaj Finserv have also reported sustainable PAT growth during this period.

The BSE Smallcap and Midcap indices climbed 163 per cent and 149 per cent, respectively, during this period. With 7,980 per cent and 5,925 per cent returns, Avanti Feeds and Fiberweb (India) stood among the top gainers in the smallcap space.

At present, BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are hovering at levels never seen before. Market experts are bullish about further movement in these stocks. 

“We expect volatility to increase in the Indian stock market in 2018, as corporate earnings growth expectations seem to have built in some optimism. On the contrary, with market valuation at around 17 times FY19E consensus earnings, the downside is expected to be limited. We expect Sensex and Nifty to be closer to 37,500 and 11,500, respectively, in 2018,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Securities."

But momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence, or MACD, signalled bearish crossovers in as many as 45 stocks on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). 

Among the stocks that witnessed the bearish signal were Bharat Heavy Electricals, UPL, Allahabad Bank, LIC Housing Finance, Indian Hotels, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Indian Overseas Bank, Indiabulls Ventures, Future Retail, EIH, IIFL Holdings and Som Distilleries.

Some of these counters also witnessed strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Other stocks that witnessed bearish crossovers included Welspun Corporation, KEI Industries, Polaris Consulting, Deepak Nitrite, Alembic, LIC Housing Finance, Nesco and Colgate Palmolive.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downturn, and vice-versa.



However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

Traders should make use other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm such trends.

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

Meanwhile, the MACD charts also showed that 12 stocks witnessed bullish crossovers on NSE, potentially giving a ‘buy’ signal. They included Petronet LNG, Coal India, Mirc Electronics, VRL Logistics, Alembic Pharma and Zee Entertainment.

74,2018-01-30,Phosphorus Limited,"Mumbai: Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan Company are likely to replace Bosch, Ambuja Cement and Aurobindo Pharma in the Nifty50 index soon, said analysts at Edelweiss Securities and IDBI Capital Markets & Securities.

These changes are likely to be made in the upcoming semi-annual review of the Nifty index, the brokerages said. The index is reviewed on a half-yearly basis and a fourweek notice is given to the market before making changes to the index. Edelweiss expects the index changes to be announced by the third week of February and the same to be effective on March 30.

The inclusion of Grasim, Bajaj Finserv and Titan will lead to buying of 59.8 lakh shares, 9.2 lakh shares and 63.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

At current prices, it would mean buying of Rs 707.2 crore in Grasim, Rs 451.8 crore in Bajaj Finserv and Rs 567.9 crore in Titan.

Conversely, the exclusion of Bosch, Ambuja and Aurobindo Pharma will lead to selling of 1.4 lakh, 1.13 crore and 43.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

There are certain criteria that determine the inclusion and exclusion of a stock from the Nifty index, including liquidity, float adjusted market capitalisation, domicile and trading frequency.

For inclusion in the index, a security should have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less during the last six months, for 90 per cent of the observations for portfolio of Rs 10 crore. Impact cost is a measure of liquidity of a stock and reflects the costs faced when actually trading an index.

Companies will be included if free-float market capitalisation is 1.50 times the freefloat market capitalisation of the smallest constituent in respective index. These stocks must be available for trade in the futures and options segment and the company must be domiciled in India.

The company’s trading frequency should be 100 per cent in the last six months.

Following these changes, the weightage of sectors in the Nifty is also likely to change. The weightage of financial services will increase to 35.9 per cent from 35.5 per cent and that of cement and cement products will rise to 2.3 per cent from 1.6 per cent, said IDBI Capital in its report.

The weightage of consumer goods will rise to 10.1 per cent from 9.4 per cent, while that of pharmaceutical sector will come down to 3.5 per cent from 4 per cent, the brokerage added.

The last revision in index constituents took place on September 29, 2017, when ACC, Bank of Baroda, Tata Power and Tata Motors DVR shares were excluded. They were replaced by Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and UPL."

1,2018-02-01,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Shares of agri-linked sectors such as farm equipment, two-wheeler, agri-chemicals and fertiliser came alive on Thursday after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley unveiled a raft of schemes to mitigate rural distress.

Yogesh Mehta of Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the hike in minimum support price (MSP) to a minimum of 1.5 times of the cost is likely to push up agri-chemical stocks.

2,2018-02-01,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: After a sharp jump in volatility as a knee-jerk reaction to Budget proposals, sanity came back to the market. Market watchers though were left disappointed with the reintroduction of long-term capital gains tax and fiscal slippages.

After cracking over 400 points immediately after the LTCG announcement, Sensex recovered most of the losses to end marginally lower by 58 points.

Market pundits called the Budget balanced and advised investors to look out for stars emerging out of Budget proposals.

“All Is Well,” tweeted smallcap czar Poriju Veliyath. The market expert added that one should forget the Budget and start focusing on stock picking.

“There was no major disappointment in the Budget proposals. On overall basis, long-term capital gains tax doesn’t look that dampening and revenue growth assumptions are looking realistic. Investors should focus on sectors/stocks having agri or rural theme,"" said Hemang Jani, Head Equity Sales & Advisory at Sharekhan.

Jani said the Budget announcements will be positive for companies such as Escorts, Ashok Leyland, M&M, PI Industries and UPL.

In an interview to ET Now, Pawan Goenka of Mahindra & Mahindra said the rural focus could lead to higher demand that we have for both equipment as well as on the agri input side.

The expert said that Apollo Tyre could gain on raising of custom duty on truck bus radial tyres from 10 to 15 percent to benefit the company. No bad news is a good news for cigarette company like ITC.

B Gopkumar, Executive Director & CEO at Reliance Securities said that Budget 2018 had a strong focus on infrastructure development, which is in line with the expectations.

FM has allocated an extra budgetary support of Rs 5.97 lakh crore against Rs 3.96 lakh crore in last Budget for infrastructure sector. However, road construction for FY19E pegged at 9,000 km was a tad lower than the earlier guidance given by the road ministry.

""We understand higher allocation in infrastructure segment will essentially expedite infrastructure development in the country, which in turn will aid many industries i.e. metals, cement, building materials, "" Gopkumar said.

Insurance sector is seen gaining from the introduction of universal health insurance that includes Rs 5 lakh cover for 10 crore vulnerable families or 50 crore Indians.

Crucial rural impetus along with continued allocation to infra and a heavy focus on health care,"" Devam Modi, Director of Equirus Securities.

Sanjeev Jain, Associate Vice President of Ashika Stock Broking said, “In this Budget government tried to create structural and sustained demand. We are positive on companies like ICICI Prudential given the world's largest health insurance scheme the government has announced.”

“Major focus of the Budget was on rural economy that may benefit companies which have strong presence in hinterland like ITC, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra and Grasim Industries. JK Tyre is looking good in tyre sector, while L&T is looking attractive in the infrastructure space,” Jain added.

The Budget has not addressed the proposal for reducing GST rates on electric vehicles. This may not be good for Tata Motors and other car makers looking create mass e-vehicles market.

Analysts noted that budget has proposed creation of affordable housing fund under NHB. This will benefit all affordable housing players like Mahindra Lifespace, Ashiana Housing etc. It will also have positive impact on affordable housing financiers like Gruh Finance, DHFL and Can Fin Homes, says Reliance Securities. KNR Construction, J Kumar, NCC are major plays play on infrastructure theme, it said. The move on healthcare is also expected to benefit hospital chains like Apollo Hospitals and Narayana Hrudyalay. Besides, it will have positive rub off impact on companies like Thyrocare and Dr. Lal Path Labs. Insurance companies will also benefit because of insurance premium received towards coverage of families.

We understand higher allocation in infrastructure segment will essentially expedite infrastructure development in the country, which in turn will aid many industries i.e. metals, cement, building materials, Reliance Securities said. The brokerage believes that construction companies such as KNR Construction, J Kumar and NCC are a majo infra play. The brokerage also expect cement companies such as JK Cement and Sagar Cement to benefit from infra push..

Auto component makers are likely to gain as custom duty on select parts has been raised from 7.5-10 per cent to 15 per cent. 

A higher 20 per cent custom duty has been imposed compared with 10 per cent earlier. Custom duty on footwear parts too has been raised to 15 per cent from 10 per cent."

The conference, which will have around 300 participants, has been called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who himself will attend the meeting on the second day.

Participants include farmers, scientists, economists, policy makers, representatives of farmers and trade associations, corporates and officials from Centre as well as state governments. NITI Aayog and related union ministeries would also attend the meet.

""We are organising a national conference 'Agriculture 2022-- Doubling Farmers Income' on February 19-20 at Pusa,"" Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak told reporters here.

""In the conference, we will discuss what are the issues confronting agriculture sector and what should be done in near, medium and long term. We are looking for practical solutions that can be implemented in the field across the country,"" he said.

The conference is being organised at a time when farmers in several parts of the country are said to be in distress due to low price realisations from their produce in view of bumper production in 2016-17 crop year (July-June).

To address this issue, the government in Budget announced that it would fix the minimum support price of Kharif crops at least 1.5 times over the cost of production. The Centre would also consult States to find a fool-proof mechanism to ensure that farmers get the MSP.

Stating that the conference would focus on seven broad themes centred around farmers welfare, the secretary said that there would be a dedicated group for each theme that would come out with recommendations.

The groups for each theme would make presentation in presence of the Prime Minister.

""Wisdom of farmers will come to the fore. Suggestions will be heard by the Prime Minister,"" Pattanayak said.

At the end of the conference, the government aims to formulate a proper roadmap with timelines to achieve the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022.

13,2018-02-16,Phosphorus Limited,"The Indian agrochemical industry expects an uptick in export revenue next fiscal after suffering slowdown in two successive fiscals caused by lower usage of agrochemicals by farmers in key export markets like Latin America on the back of unremunerative prices for agri produce.

Latin American nations, which account for large exports from Indian agrochemical firms, reported a fall in growth rate to 4% against 10% growth reported earlier. This has led to higher inventory levels of agrochemicals in those markets.

With agro-commodity prices looking up in Latin American markets, coupled with fall in exports from China, sectoral analysts now expect a growth of 10-14% in export revenues for Indian agrochemical sector next fiscal. Further, new product launches could help in improved business volumes. India is the fourth largest global producer of agrochemicals after the US, Japan and China with an industry size of around $4.9 billion in FY17 with exports accounting for nearly half of it, says rating agency Icra. Latin American markets, which account for nearly a third of Indian agrochemical exports, suffered slowdown in both the last fiscal and ongoing fiscal, said Rahul Veera, assistant vice-president, Elara Capital. This, he said, was mainly due to low agro-commodity prices arising out of a deflationary trend in the global markets.

“Also, rupee appreciation from ₹70 in FY17 to ₹64-65 currently to a dollar also contributed to subdued export revenue growth.”

United Phosphorous (UPL), one of India’s largest agrochemical companies with nearly 80% exposure to exports, saw its growth in Latin America slowdown to 5% in nine months of the current fiscal, down from 31% growth reported during the same period in the last fiscal. It began to see improvement from third quarter onwards and anticipates improved exports to these markets next fiscal.

“We have recently acquired a company in Brazil for over ₹500 crore and have partnered with the biggest farmer cooperative to jointly market our products. We are also setting up a big unit in the United States,” said Rajju Shroff, promoter of UPL, which has a market of ₹5,000 crore in Brazil alone.

UPL had reported total sales of over ₹17,000 crore last fiscal. “We are also looking to increase our product launches with improving market scenario and greater demand for generic products in export markets,” said Shroff.

Apart from Latin America, other export markets are also showing signs of revival, said sectoral analysts.

K Ravichandran, senior vicepresident at Icra said, “Major exports regions like Asia, North America and Europe have also witnessed moderate improvement over last year’s growth.”"

2,2018-03-01,Phosphorus Limited,"Mumbai: Agro-chemicals company UPL (United Phosphorus Ltd) has raised $300 million by selling dollardenominated bonds to overseas investors, seeking to use the proceeds to refinance high-cost debt.

“About three-fourths of the proceeds would be used to refinance long-term, expensive overseas loans, while the rest will help extinguish high-cost, short-term debt,” one of the two executives associated with the fund-raising told ET.

The securities offer 4.5 per cent, with the pricing fixed at 173 basis points above the benchmark US Treasury yields with a 10-year maturity. The issuance was oversubscribed nearly six times, signaling robust demand for debt papers of companies invested in India, which has regained the tag of the world’s fastest-expanding major economy.

The company has raised the money through its Mauritius-based subsidiary UPL Corporation, which takes care of the group’s global businesses. Overseas arms contribute significantly to UPL’s revenues.

Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), Credit Suisse, ANZ (Australia and New Zealand banking group), DBS Bank, and JPMorgan were some of the global lenders helping raise the cash.

The company could not be immediately reached for comments.

Initial pricing guidance was about 200 bps above the US benchmark yields. Robust investor demand brought it down by 27 bps, with investors bidding for about $1.8-billion worth of debt paper. UPL rejected the excess subscription beyond the proposed size.

The bond-sale, known as Regulation S in market parlance, was available to investors outside the US. The securities are rated as BBB-, the lowest in investment grade."

3,2018-03-05,Phosphorus Limited,"Shares of a company may not be the most glamorous presents, but they will prove to be thoughtful and valuable gifts for your grandchildren in the future. Bluechips—the biggest listed companies—would be considered sound bets for such a long term, but may not deliver the desired wealth creation given their size. 

Instead, consider opting for nascent large caps, which have achieved scale, but still offer a large runway for growth. These would make for better long-term investments. We have identified seven such companies that could help accumulate a sizeable kitty for your grandkid to dip into to fund his or her education. These stocks fall in the Rs 25,000-75,000 crore market capitalisation band, boast a return on equity higher than 15% for the past three years and are trading at less than 25 times trailing earnings.


Aurobindo Pharma
Originally an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturer, Aurobindo has grown into an integrated pharmaceuticals company, scaling up its formulation business manifold over the past 10 years. Its API-to-formulations ratio has improved from 43:57 in 2012-13 to 20:80 in 2016-17, allowing better margins. 

Pricing pressure in the US market and a growing debt pile are causes for concern. But higher capacity utilisation is likely to bring operating leverage benefits, sustaining the margin improvement trend. “We expect APL to report good performance, driven by good growth in the US market from injectable business, new drug approvals and volume growth in existing products,” says Ranjit Kapadia, analyst, Centrum Broking.

Bharat Electronics
State-run electronic components and defence equipment manufacturer Bharat Electronics offers a direct play on India’s defence capex. The firm also takes contracts as a systems integrator, boosting its order inflows and revenues. The order pipeline is expected to remain strong over the next few years. 

It has also forayed into new arenas like homeland security and smart cities. It has a strong balance sheet, near-zero debt and large cash pile, as well as competitive advantages, given its tieups with foreign majors. Amit Mahawar, analyst at Edelweiss, believes improving revenue visibility and BEL’s focus on capacity building will drive much higher profitability growth over next two to three years.

InterGlobe Aviation
Interglobe aviation, operator of low-cost carrier Indigo, offers a structural play on the underpenetrated domestic aviation market. With its cost leadership in the industry, the operator maintains best-in-class return ratios and boasts highest profitability among its peers. However, margins are likely to come under pressure going forward with sustained higher crude oil prices. 

The airline is looking to fly to key European cities from October this year. Its low-cost model should give it an edge in the international flights as well, say experts. “We like Indigo for its efficient operations, lean cost structure, higher profitability and strong balance sheet which would support higher than market growth,” says Joseph George, Analyst, IIFL.

Larsen & Toubro Infotech
L&T Infotech has consistently delivered industry leading revenue growth for past few years, aided by better account mining and healthy addition of high-ticket size clients. Its banking and financial services (BFSI) vertical has large clients and continues to see high growth.

 Over the past 1-2 years, the company has strengthened its portfolio by making inroads into digital and automation space, with digital now accounting for a third of the firm’s revenue. Large deals won last year should accelerate growth in 2018-19. “We are very confident of LTI’s ability to drive a 36% CAGR over 2017-20 in digital solutions. We believe this would enable it to grow faster than the industry and at a revenue CAGR of 14.2%,” say analysts at IDBI Capital.

Petronet LNG
Petronet LNG has emerged a key beneficiary of the increasing demand for gas in the country. It has seen high volume growth and is setting up additional capacity at its Dahej terminal—70% completed.

It also plans to venture into retail LNG business and it is likely to test run LNG-fuelled buses in Gujarat and Kerala.

UPL
Crop protection, chemicals and seeds company UPL is a dominant player in a mature industry with high entry barriers. It has transformed from being a productdriven company to a full-service player, emerging as a one-stop solution for all agrirelated needs of farmers. UPL has outperformed the global crop protection chemicals industry for five consecutive years. 

Its tie-up with Bayer in Brazil, which gives it access to the latter’s robust distribution network, has started delivering results and will drive volume growth. “UPL’s long term prospects remain positive, led by focus on branding, new product launches, increasing share in global agrichemical market,” says Basanth Patil, analyst HDFC Securities.

It is also strengthening its retail presence in its loan book, which shows robust growth. “Amid the noise on asset quality, the bank’s strengths—loan underwriting and structuring and long-term business momentum (retailisation)—will aid it clock best-in-class return ratios,” says Kunal Shah, Analyst, Edelweiss Securities.

5,2018-03-05,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Continued selling by foreign investors amid global trade war fears hit domestic stock market, as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty50 fell for the fourth straight day on Monday.

Global cues soured after the US President Donald Trump proposed hefty duties on import of aluminium and steel last week.

Market sentiment also took a hit after India’s Service activity contracted in February for the first time since November, as rising price pressures led to a decline in new businesses orders, a private survey showed on Monday. 

The seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index fell from 51.7 in January to 47.8 in February, its lowest level since August, PTI reported.

On Monday, the 30-share Sensex closed 300 points, or 0.88 per cent, down at 33,747, while the Nifty50 index shed 100 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 10,359.

Only eight out of 50 stocks in the Nifty50 index managed to settle in the green. 

“Market traded under pressure after the gap-down start. However, marginal bounce in the latter half pared some losses. It was the fear of possible trade war, after the US President announced to impose new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, rattled global markets, including ours. Besides, the report that FPIs have pulled out more than 11,000 crore from the equity market in February further weighed on sentiment,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.

Broader too traded weak. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell more than the benchmark Sensex, closing 0.95 per cent and 1.09 per cent down, respectively.

Metal stocks were the top drag. NMDC, Nalco, Hindalco, Jindal Steel & Power and JSW Steel plunged the most among metal stocks. The Nifty Metal index closed 3 per cent lower, with all the components in the red.

Tata Motors, Aurobindo Pharma, Tata Steel remained among the top losers in the Nifty50 index.

Shares of Aurobindo Pharma cracked on media reports that the USFDA had issued Form 483 with nine observations to the drug maker's Hyderabad unit, citing deficiencies in maintaining manufacturing standards.

IT stocks showed some resilience on Monday. Shares of MindTree, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, KPIT Technologies and Tata Elxsi closed the day in the green, keeping the Nifty IT index up on Monday.

Sun Pharma, NTPC, UPL and Mahindra & Mahindra too stood among the gainers of the day.

Besides IT, PSU bank index also managed to close the day slightly up, backed by gains in IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda and State Bank of India.

All other sectoral indices on NSE closed in the negative territory.

Telecom biggies Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel also settled in the red on Monday. Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular have challenged the telecom regulator's recent tariff order on predatory pricing in the telecom tribunal, setting the stage for another legal battle between India's older carriers and the sectoral watchdog.

8,2018-03-09,Phosphorus Limited,"Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned wary about the prospects of the Indian equity market since February following the introduction of long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on equity in Union Budget 2018, a Rs 12,700 crore scam in Punjab National Bank (PNB) and repeated signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates rapidly.

Several global financial services firms, including CLSA and Morgan Stanley, have since cut India’s weightage in their scheme of things.

FIIs have been offloading stocks in the cash market in the recent past. They offloaded shares worth a net of around Rs 12,000 crore between February 1 and March 7 after having pumped in Rs 13,781 crore in January and Rs 49,729 crore in the whole of last year. 

With clear signs of FIIs losing their conviction on India and the global liquidity squeeze posing a clear threat of capital outflow from emerging markets, including India, some analysts say FII-heavy stocks are likely to witness freaky fortunes in the coming months.

“There is a little concern for the FII-heavy stocks in the short term, as they have been selling Indian equities continuously and there are no positive triggers right now for them to change their outlook,” says G Chokkalingam, Head of Research at Equinomics Research and Advisory.

Domestic equity benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are already down about 9 per cent from their respective all-time high levels hit on January 29, 2018. 

On Friday, the benchmark indices traded with gains after staging a solid rebound in Thursday’s trade, when the Sensex leapt nearly 318 points, or 1 per cent.

FIIs hold huge clout in the domestic market, holding around 18 per cent of India’s total market capitalisation.

Within the BSE200 basket, they held more than 25 per cent stake at the end of December in as many as 58 companies, whose stocks appear to be at the maximum risk should the FII outflow becomes rapid.




Going by shareholding data available with Ace Equity, some of the top NBFCs face the biggest risk.

FPIs held substantial stakes in non-banking financial companies such as HDFC (74.76 per cent), Bharat Financial Inclusion (60.71 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (55.34 per cent) and Shriram Transport Finance (49.73 per cent) as on December 31, 2017.

In the banking pack, FIIs held 48.06 per cent, 47.34 per cent, 43.20 per cent and 40.57 per cent in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, YES Bank and HDFC Bank, respectively, at the end of 2017.

“FIIs are reacting to the news and developments happening on both global as well as domestic fronts. For India, both domestic and global news have not been too conducive. These are short-term disruptions, but they would not continue for a long time. However, it will continue at least for the coming few months,” said Himanshu Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst, Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

Amid the global sell-off, there has been risk aversion among the FIIs, which raising the risk of their pulling money out of emerging markets like India.

“Investors should understand that India is just one segment for FIIs. So if the country is not attractive for them, they can invest somewhere else,” Srivastava said in a chat with ETNow.

Stocks like Apollo Hospital, Hero MotoCorp, Zee Entertainment, Bharti Infratel, Mindtree, UPL, The Federal Bank, Crompton Greaves and Infosys have high levels of shareholding among foreign investors.

From across sectors, stocks where FIIs hold over 15 per cent stakes have risen up to 600 per cent over the past one year.

The list includes Indiabulls Venture (up 586 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (up 144 per cent), Edelweiss Financial Services (up 91 per cent), Tata Global Beverages (up 88 per cent), Jubilant FoodWorks (up 87 per cent) and Jindal Steel and Power (up 86 per cent), among others.

Nitasha Shankar, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities, said post the Union Budget, the Indian stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. In recent times, it has been hovering in the negative territory.

“This is largely related to the PSU banking stocks which have been ruffled with news flows and developments related to one of the largest PSU banks. This has had a negative impact on the headline indices, considering that banking stocks in general and PSU bank scrips in particular hold a substantial weightage in the benchmark indices,” she said.

NSE’s Nifty index is down 1,017 points to 10,154 as of March 7 from its all-time peak of 11,171 hit on January 29. The 30-pack BSE Sensex has pulled back over 3,410 points to 33,033 from 36,443 during this period.

Milan Sharma, Director, Rivergate Capital, says a trend reversal in FII flows is imminent.

India is not looking as attractive, as it was few months back. Going forward, there will be a reversal in the trend along with a fresh flow of inflows from domestic institutional investors, he said.

“Considering the Rs 12,000-13,000 crore inflow to the equity market through the SIP route, we do not think one needs to be too cautious. We will also see some reversal in FII flows soon,” Sharma said."

26,2018-03-30,Phosphorus Limited,"MUMBAI: The new financial year is likely to see continuation of volatility due to risks such as state elections which are due in the next few months and policy tightening by global central banks, among other factors. ET spoke to five analysts for their stock picks, which are likely to outperform in FY19, and their return expectations from these stocks.


AK Prabhakar,Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets & Securities

NBCC (India): CMP (in Rs): 190.35 | 1-Year Return (%): 11.41
Prabhakar said NBCC’s valuations are attractive. The company has a strong order book and the government’s focus on infrastructure and low cost housing is likely to benefit NBCC, he said. Prabhakar expects the stock to double by 2020.


Repco Home Finance: CMP (In Rs): 546.20 | 1-Year Return (%): -18.65
Prabhakar said the company is a unique play because of its presence in the rural markets and lower ticket size. IDBI Capital has a target price of Rs 745 on Repco, implying 36.4% upside from current levels.


Amit Khurana, Head of Research, Dolat Capital
Persistent Systems"" CMP (In Rs): 690.70 | 1-Year Return (%): 15.26
The stock fell on Wednesday on earnings warning but Khurana expects the situation to normalize and sees Persistent growing 12-13% in FY19. Khurana sees it as a defensive in a volatile market which can deliver double digit return in FY19.


UPL: CMP (In Rs): 728.05 1-Year Return (%): 1.13
UPL’s overall portfolio will return to growth trajectory, said Khurana, adding that the stock is trading at a discount to peers such as Rallis and PI Industries. He sees it as a good defensive in a volatile market.


G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research & Advisory

Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation: CMP (In Rs): 1,168.95 | 1-Year Return (%): 37.95
Chokkalingam said Bombay Burmah trades at around 73% discount to current market value of its investments in Britannia and Bombay Dyeing whereas average discount of a holding company is 50-55%. This discount will come down in the future and we expect 40-50% return from the stock in a year, said Chokkalingam.


MOIL:  CMP (In Rs): 195.75 I 1-Year Return (%): 26.11
Given its strong business model backed by low cost operations, robust balance sheet and improvement in demand backed by rising steel production, MOIL is well poised to capitalize on the opportunity, said Chokkalingam. He sees the stock rising to ₹320 in a year.


Gautam Duggad: Head of Research-Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Securities
Titan Company: CMP (In Rs ): 941.20 | 1-Year Return (%): 106.90
The stock is a play on value migration f rom unorganised to organised segment, said Duggad. He expects the stock to deliver 25% earnings CAGR over FY18-FY20. “It has been out long standing top idea and we continue to remain bullish,” said Duggad. The stock should give 15-20% CAGR returns going forward, he added.


Shriram Transport Finance Co: CMP (In Rs ): 1,440.55 | 1-Year Return (%): 35.80
The commercial vehicle cycle is recovering strongly, which bodes well for Shriram Transport, and the cost of funds is still benign for them versus other NBFCs said Duggad. Motilal Oswal has a one year forward target price of ₹1,750 on the stock.


Pankaj Pandey, Head of research, ICICIdirect
KEC International: CMP (In Rs ): 390.35 | 1-Year Return (%): 102.73

Indian Hotels: CMP (In Rs ): 127.35 I 1-Year Return (%): 8.82
Uptick in average room rates and occupancy rates should help the company deliver decent earnings growth, said Pandey. International business, which was bleeding, should also do better, he added. Indian Hotels should also give about 20% return in a year, said Pandey."
27,2018-03-30,Phosphorus Limited,"On 29 acres of government land in Kannahalli, a tiny village located off the busy Magadi Road-NICE Road junction, is the second largest waste processing unit in Bengaluru. This plant, built at a cost of Rs 70 crore more than two years ago, has the capacity to handle 500 tonnes of waste per day.

For the past three weeks, the processing machines have been motionless. There has been no trace of trucks that bring waste. Workers come only to play cricket in the yard. The plant is non-functional.

Kannahalli is just a sixth of the city’s waste processing problem. Five other waste processing plants — located at Seegehalli, Lingadheeranahalli, Subbarayanapalya, Doddabidirakallu and Chikkanagamangala — too have come to a standstill in the past six months.

These six waste processing plants were established more than two years ago as a result of a crisis. Village after village on the outskirts of Bengaluru rose up to protest the dumping of Bengaluru’s garbage into landfills there. When there was a six-month deadline to find a solution within the city, chief minister Siddaramaiah tasked the BBMP with finding alternatives.


A CASE OF QUICK FIX?
Darpan Jain, an IAS officer who was then the special commissioner for BBMP’s solid waste management, was given a mandate to solve the problem within six months. In a rush to find locations, the BBMP decided to convert its smaller landfills in six areas into waste processing plants.

“The government then earmarked ?440 crore for the establishment, operation and maintenance of these plants. The project was to be implemented through the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation of which Darpan Jain was the managing director,” says Venkatesh Murthy, CEO (O&M) of SWM plants.

Soon the BBMP issued contracts to three companies — IL&FS, Morgan Solid Waste Company Holdings and UPL. While IL&FS was given the O&M of three plants, the other two were to handle the remaining three plants. The BBMP in its contract, replaced input-based tipping fee with outputbased tipping fee. “The idea was to pay the companies based on the quantity of compost they generate. This was to avoid the firms from resorting to irregularities to get the payments,” Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner for SWM, says.

Accordingly, the companies were to get around ?1,600 per tonne from the Agriculture Department for the compost sold and an additional Rs 550 per tonne from the BBMP.


A BAD MIX-UP
But that is where the issue started. Right from the beginning, the waste processing units, which were supposed to receive only wet waste, received huge quantities of mixed waste. It led to the piling up of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and the compost remained unsold due its poor quality. The companies failed to get any returns, observes Sandhya Narayan from Solid Waste Management Round Table.

It was only a year after these units were set up that the BBMP made it mandatory for all of these plants to accept only the wet waste. And that led to a decrease in the quantity of incoming waste.

A person who has watched the developments closely points at three factors which resulted in the collapse of the system: “First, the contract terms were not in favour of the companies because the payment quoted was really low. Second, the BBMP was not paying the companies on time for the compost sold. Third, the quality of compost produced was bad and it was not finding a market.”

Of the three companies which were part of the system, only IL&FS stayed on. C Basavaiah, consultant to IL&FS and a member of BBMP’s expert committee on solid waste management, sees it as a chain reaction. “Unable to sell the compost, the companies were finding it difficult to get returns for their expenditure on O&M. It is only in the recent past that IL&FS has managed to sell the compost,” he says. This is said to be because of the Agriculture Department’s intervention.



BLAME IT ON VILLAGERS
For every tonne of compost sold to Raitha Samparka Kendras, the company gets ?1,600 from the Agriculture Department, ?550 from the BBMP and additional ?1,500 as market development assistance under the Swachh Bharat Mission. Basavaiah claims that the company has sold 10,000 tonne of compost since October and the company has a stock of 6,000 tonne waiting to be sold.

Apart from compost, the RDF generated in plants are given to cement manufacturing factories for free. It is mandatory for cement companies to use 5% of solid waste in their manufacturing process.

“Ideally, these processing plants should accept only the wet waste. While the compost is sold to farmers, the minimum RDF generated is to be given to cement factories. But mixed waste as input has damaged the entire process,” says Shekar Prabhakar, cofounder and managing director of Hasiru Dala.

BBMP’s Sarfaraz Khan blames villagers for the non-functioning of the plants. “There has been a protest every time the intake and processing of waste was huge. This has prevented us from accepting waste in a large quantity. The plants will resume functioning after elections. It is definitely not a death of the project,” he says.

Till then, Bengaluru’s waste — wet, dry and mixed — approximately 2,000 tonne per day, is dumped in Bellahalli quarry, 20 km from the city.

“But Bellahalli is a time bomb waiting to explode,” says Shekar.

With the BBMP now deciding to convert the existing Doddabidirakallu and Chikkanagamangala waste processing units into waste-to-energy plants, the issue is now back to square one. According to sources, even IL&FS has expressed interest to convert its units into WtE plants.

“The plan to accept mixed waste for WtE is not the solution. While the rules and court orders have made waste segregation mandatory and Bengaluru making some achievement in this direction, it now appears like we are moving backwards from waste segregation to mixing the waste and the BBMP is facilitating it,” Sandhya notes."

As a new financial year dawns, ETMarkets.com spoke to top market analysts and collated a list of stocks that can potentially double investor wealth if the bulls take charge from here on.

Recommendations by: Rusmik Oza, Head-midcaps, Kotak Securities

Tata Motors: As forex hedges reduce, this company can potentially double net profit between FY18E and FY20E. If this materialises, then return on equity (RoE) – which now stands at 12-13 per cent – can move up to 18-20 per cent. On potential FY20E, the stock is trading cheap at less than 7 times FY20E PE and around 3 times FY20E EV/Ebitda. The stock is suppressed on account of weak numbers. As the numbers improve in future, the stock should deliver good gains.


Federal Bank: Once NPA issues get resolved, this bank is expected to report earnings growth at a CAGR of 25 per cent over next two to three years. The stock trades cheap at around 1.1 times FY20E book value. At its peak, the stock traded at 2 times forward price/BV. “Better valuation and a rise in earnings could provide the necessary push for the stock to double over the next three years,” said Oza.


Jindal Stainless (Hisar): After GST rollout and imposition of 18.95 per cent countervailing duty (CVD) on Chinese imports, Kotak expects Jindal Stainless (Hisar) to garner higher market share in the coming years. “We expect revenue and PAT to grow at a CAGR of 15 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, during the FY17-FY20E period with a return ratio in the range of over 20 per cent. The stock trades at less than 4 times FY20E EV/Ebitda. On SOTP basis, the stock is expected to trade at 7 times forward EV/Ebitda in future and derive value from its 36.6 per cent stake in Jindal Stainless,” Oza said.


UPL: This company has the potential to grow earnings at a CAGR of 17-18 per cent over next three years. It is the best diversified play in the agro-chemicals space. “UPL deserves to trade at higher multiples then the sectoral average. The company’s FY18E net profit is likely to be 5 times higher than its second biggest competitor, but still it trades at 15 times forward PE when the sectoral average is around 20 times forward PE. At 20 times forward earnings and assuming earnings growth at 18 per cent CAGR, the stock can double 
in three years,” said Oza.


Recommendations by: Gaurav Dua, head of research, Sharekhan

Jubilant Foodworks: This company should be one of the key beneficiaries of the improvement in the consumer discretionary environment in the domestic market. Jubilant Foodworks’ management is confident of maintaining the double-digit same-store sales growth (SSSG) on the back of sustained focus on product innovation and digitisation. Further reduction of losses in Dunkin Donuts and sustained operating efficiencies will drive its profitability going ahead.


Sundram Fasteners: Sundram Fasteners (SFL) is moving up the value chain and has successfully introduced new products, viz. engine components, pump assemblies, powder metal parts andshafts, which enabled it to diversify its product portfolio and increase content per vehicle, thus reducing dependence on fasteners. The company recently gained foothold to the fast emerging electric vehicles space with orders from Tesla. With the introduction of high-margin value-added products and improvement in subsidiary performance, Sharekhan expects SFL to outgrow the industry with a strong 16 per cent earnings CAGR over FY2018-2020


Bajaj Finserv: The company is an attractive play on our long-term structural theme of financialisation of savings in the economy. It is the holding company for Bajaj group’s life insurance (Bajaj Allianz) and lending (Bajaj Finance) businesses. Bajaj Finance is the leader in its segment and has revolutionised the retail lending business in India, whereas the life insurance segment is progressing well to emerge out of the investment phase and has already become an industry-leading player. Both businesses have excellent operating metrics in their respective segments and are likely to continue the growth trend going forward.


Recommendation by: Prateek Jain, Director, Hem Securities

ITC: ITC is among the preferred picks of Hem Securities given 17 per cent rise in bottomline in Q3 of FY18. “The FMCG market in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.6 per cent and should reach $103.7 billion by 2020 from $49 billion in 2016 which provides ample opportunity for this company,” said Jain.

14,2018-04-15,Phosphorus Limited,"BEED: Hundreds of people from 15 villages in Maharashtra's Beed district are braving blazing Sun to wage a war on perennial water crisis in Marathwada, one of the most arid regions of the state.

They are part of the 45-day ""Shramdaan Abhiyan"" (Voluntary labour campaign), launched on April 8 by an NGO under former AAP leader Mayank Gandhi, who has adopted these villages for water conservation and preservation.

The villagers are digging trenches, farm ponds, watershed structures, check dams to preserve the rain water.

Dozens of excavators and earth-movers, funded by various corporates, are deepening and widening the tributaries of the ""Paapnashi"" river which passes through six of the selected villages.

The 15 villages have collective population of 30,590.

Gandhi, previously associated with the India Against Corruption movement, said he chose the particular area in Parli taluka of the district because it has the lowest irrigation.

""Only 1.72 per cent of land here is under irrigation as against 16.57 per cent in Maharashtra and 40 per cent in the country. I want to empower these villages with the 360-degree development including water security, agriculture, education, sanitation and community building,"" he told reporters at Mamdapur.

Gandhi said the ""Global Parli project"" launched by him in 2016 has been acting as a catalyst.

Local social worker Dr Harishchandra Wange and his team of doctors are raising awareness and motivating the villagers about the importance of storing water.

""The Paani Foundation is providing technical and practical training to the villagers while corporates like Borosil, UPL, Alkem are assisting us through their CSR initiatives,"" Gandhi said.

Ten out of these 15 villages have been selected to participate in the Satyamev Jayatee Water Cup competition.

The activist said he had fixed a target for all the villagers to complete the work before the arrival of the monsoon.
""Every village has its own maps with watershed structures, contour trenches, compartment bounds, check dams, farm ponds etc,"" he said.

Huda Kaudgaon village Sarpanch G R Rathod said the villagers are motivated and are hopeful that their struggle for water would end soon.

Marathwada region has been experiencing a spate of droughts since 2012.

Most of the villagers face the daunting challenge of walking long distances up to two to four kms, just to fetch few litres of water.

In 2016, the Railways had dispatched a special 'water train' with 10 wagons for parched Latur in Marathwada region.

The region has also seen suicides by a number of distressed farmers."
15,2018-04-16,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Then Skymet and now, IMD. India is going to have a normal monsoon this year. And that's official. 

In its forecast released today, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it expects monsoon rains to hit Kerala coast by May 15 and projected a normal monsoon for the third year in a row. The weather department sees monsoon at 97 per cent of long-term average and is expected to update its forecast by June.

The monsoon forecast is a positive for Street, said marketmen, who believe a host of agri-consumption sectors would make news on Tuesday. The list may include companies from FMCG, farm equipment, consumer durables and two-wheeler players. 

""It's a good news. It should mean that agri-commodities will not have inflationary impact, which should augur well for the market as the RBI may not raise interest rates. It would also boost consumption-led demand,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL.

Earlier this month, private forecaster Skymet had said India was expected to receive normal rainfall in the June-September monsoon season this year although parts of southern and northeastern India were at risk of deficient rain. 

Bhasin is upbeat on fertiliser and agrochemical stocks such as Chambal Fertilisers, Rallis India and UPL. Analysts noted that dealers have so far kept inventory of fertilisers and pesticides low, which should support volume growth in FY19. 

As far as farm equipment sector goes, only 40-45 per cent of agriculture is mechanised in India. And this is where experts see huge potential for higher tractor penetration, and by extension, this is good news for tractor makers, said analysts. M&M is a big listed player in this segment. 

Other than this, the monsoon forecast would be taken very positively by companies from FMCG, rural financing and consumer staples, said Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager at Angel Broking. 

""We are lucky for having two consecutive normal monsoons. If this happens again in the third year, it will be a very strong and positive factor for all rural consumption or two wheeler segments or NBFC companies... because they are more dependent on the rural sector to be on a discretionary spending, where it will have a better delta on earnings,"" Yogesh Mehta of Motilal Oswal Securities told ET Now.

JM Financial in a note suggested that despite the declining share of farm income in rural India, agriculture continues to be one of the major drivers as farming still employs 50 per cent of the country’s labour force.

""Farm income is of critical importance for any recovery in rural spending. Our recent visits across rural India point to a modest improvement in farm income after the current rabi harvest,"" it noted.

The brokerage said a likely normal monsoon in 2018, an increase in MSP prices, improvement in crop procurement mechanisms and stable – if not increasing – global agri-commodity prices could support a modest acceleration in farm income growth.

""We should have a healthy monsoon also this year, rural consumption is poised to show a very strong recovery. I think that automobile as a segment and sector in spite of the rich valuations would continue to do well. Ancillary companies should also have good margin expansion because they have had a quarter on quarter pressure on raw material costs, which they have effectively seamlessly passed on because of the pricing power,"" said Sanchita Mukherji at Blue Edge.

Higher acreage and yield on the back of improved farmers’ sentiment coupled with recovery in farm income are likely to bolster growth in the agrochemicals business for FY19, Elara Capital said in a note. Emkay Global has a positive view on Deepak Fertilisers and Coromandel in the fertiliser segment. In the agrochemical space, it bets on Insecticides India, PI Industries and UPL."
18,2018-04-17,Phosphorus Limited,"The Met department's forecast of a normal monsoon this year has come as manna from heaven for farmers as well as the government. 

From the market viewpoint, a normal monsoon is seen as a feel-good. “Foodgrain production in FY18 is likely to have grown by 1 per cent and another season of favourable monsoon is likely to be positive for rural sentiment,” said Antique Stock Broking in a report.

Rains play a critical role in the scheme of things for the economy and fortunes of many sectors are linked to how it pans out across the country. 

In its first-stage forecast on Monday, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) talked about a normal South-West monsoon for June-September. If it does come true, this will be the third straight year of normal rainfall.

The prediction matches private player Skymet's forecast too, suggesting that rains won't let India down this time around. The monsoon is expected in Kerala between May-end or June first week and is likely to cover the country in the next 45 days.

Global brokerage firm CLSA expects wages to pick up as a normal monsoon aids rural recovery. We drew up a list of stocks that may make a splash if rains follow the script.


Mahindra & MahindraCLSA raised its target price for Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) to Rs 960, from Rs 910 earlier. The global brokerage firm added that rural demand outlook has improved with the normal monsoon forecast. “Big hike in government support prices for agri commodities on the anvil and launch of new MPV would boost utility vehicle segment volumes,” CLSA added.


EscortsJagannadham Thunuguntla of Centrum Broking in an interaction with ETNow said, “Escorts can be one of the ideas that can benefit from a normal monsoon. Already, the stock is a stellar performer and a lot of wealth has been created in the past. We believe that a lot of steam is still left in the company. If there is any correction at any point of time, probably Escorts can be a good idea one can keep on the radar.” 

Escorts deals in agricultural tractors and construction equipment.


Chambal Fert, Rallis India, UPLSanjiv Bhasin of IIFL is upbeat on fertiliser and agrochemical stocks such as Chambal Fertilisers, Rallis India and UPL. Other market experts also noted that dealers have so far kept inventory of fertilisers and pesticides low, which should support volume growth in FY19. Chambal Fertilisers offers urea and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) whereas UPL provides crop protection solutions. Rallis India is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of agri inputs.


Nagarjuna Fertilizers and ChemicalsG Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory, expects that Nagarjuna Fertilizers as well as Mahindra & Mahindra would get a leg-up from normal rains. The company is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of urea.


ITC, PNB Housing Finance, Godrej Agrovet and Hero MotoCorpSanjeev Jain, AVP, Ashika Stock Broking, is swearing by two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp, ITC from FMCG, NBFC firm PNB Housing Finance and agribusiness player Godrej Agrovet. He believes that consumption demand as well as discretionary spendings will get a push if monsoon stays on its predicted path."

Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session:


Agri-linked stocks: In its forecast released on Monday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it expects monsoon rains to hit Kerala coast by May 15 and projected a normal monsoon for the third year in a row. The monsoon forecast is a positive for Street, said marketmen, who believe a host of agri-consumption sectors would make news on Tuesday. The list may include companies from FMCG, farm equipment, consumer durables and two-wheeler players. Fertiliser and agrochemical stocks such as Chambal Fertilisers, Deepak Fertilisers, Coromandel, Insecticides India, Rallis India, PI Industries and UPL may hog limelight today.


Infosys: Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has begun a preliminary examination of the allegations made by a whistleblower over inconsistency of Infosys board in Panaya acquisition. The markets regulator also has accepted a consent plea to settle charges of disclosure lapses by Infosys over the severance package paid to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal.


Cipla: According to some news reports, the USFDA has issued form 483 with three observations for Indore formulations plant. The stock on Monday closed 5.22 per cent higher at Rs 583.55 apiece on BSE. 


Earnings today: Tata Sponge, Crisil and FAG Bearings are some of the notable names that are slated to release their March quarter results today.

Sobha: Realty firm Sobha on Monday said it has forayed into Gujarat property market and will invest Rs 500 crore to develop a housing project in GIFT City. The Bengaluru-based firm will develop nearly 1,000 apartments in this project. ""The company will make an investment of over INR 500 crore towards residential development in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City),"" Sobha said in a statement.

The fund bought the stake at Rs 2,150 per share. The stock on Monday closed nearly 2 per cent lower at Rs 2,168.35 apiece."
19,2018-04-22,Phosphorus Limited,"Friday’s session continued to witness consolidation, as the NSE benchmark Nifty50 oscillated in a capped range and ended with a nominal loss of 1.25 points or 0.01 per cent.

The market continued to show resilience, as it recovered significantly from the low point of the day before ending flat.

It is not yet the time to throw caution to the wind, as we enter expiry week. The market on the daily chart remains a little overstretched. Though buoyancy will continue to persist, investors still need to protect profits with each upmove. 

Monday’s opening is likely to be quiet. The levels of 10,580 and 10,625 will act as immediate resistance for the market. Supports will come in at 10,530 and 10,480 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 62.6975, and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. A spinning top that occurred on the candles signalled indecisiveness setup on part of the market participants.

Pattern analysis shows market continuing to resist pattern resistance area. This is the upper range of the broad rectangle formation that the Nifty has formed. Though market is expected to move past these levels, it may not happen without some consolidation happening.

Overall, despite buoyant undercurrent, there are certain factors, which we cannot ignore.

The Nifty PCR (put to call ratio) still continues to remain at elevated levels. Also, the sharp decline in volatility (India VIX), signals calmness. This calmness may become complacency, and may itself become cause of return of some volatility. 

We will also see expiry happening this week as well. If we take a cumulative view of all of these factors, though it may not be a time to start shorting the market, but it is certainly a time where we continue to protect our profits vigilantly at higher levels. A cautiously positive view is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Resilient technical set up is observed in stocks like CG Power, Hindustan Zinc, Godrej Properties, Hindalco, Ashok Leyland, Cyient, BEL, Tech Mahindra, Bata India and UPL.

20,2018-04-23,Phosphorus Limited,"India Meteorological Department (IMD) as well as private sector weather forecaster Skymet have predicted normal monsoon this year, making it the third consecutive year of good rains. This is good news for the markets.

The stock market usually reacts positively to normal monsoon as it’s a sentiment booster. Though dependency on monsoon has fallen over the decades, a normal monsoon is good news for the entire economy as it leads to increased farm production and increased demand from rural areas. 

“You also need to factor in the upcoming elections and increased spending in rural areas by the government as well as the political parties. This spending combined with a good monsoon will have a bigger impact on the rural economy,” says Jaspreet Singh Arora, Head, Research, Systematix Shares & Stocks.

The positive impact of normal monsoon on the country’s fiscal situation will also prop up market sentiments. “The Prime Minister has talked about the need to support agriculture. A good monsoon will reduce the need for government support,” says Amar Ambani, Head, Research, IIFL. Worries about rising inflation and resultant interest rate hikes by the RBI will also abate due to a good monsoon. Though there might be a small spike in inflation in the coming months—till June due to unfavourable base effect—inflation is expected to come down in the later part of the year due to a good monsoon.


Falling behind

The rural index has underperformed the Sensex over the past one year.
 

Sectors that will gain
Industries that are directly related to agriculture—fertiliser, pesticide, seed, etc.—stand to benefit the most. Companies such as UPL, Rallis India and Bayer Cropscience will be among the lead beneficiaries. Tractor companies and those with large exposure to tractors such as Mahindra and Mahindra will also benefit from the monsoon-driven growth in the rural economy.

Increased farm production and higher disposable income will have a positive impact for all retail-consumer-oriented industries. Since most fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies such as Hindustan Unilever and ITC get a majority of their revenue from rural India, increased rural income will boost their growth. “FMCG companies such as Marico will also benefit from the reduced input costs (due to increased farm production),” says Amar Ambani, Head, Research, IIFL.


These firms will gain from good monsoon

Agri, auto and FMCG stocks with rural exposure stand to gain the most.
 
Besides consumer staples, demand for low-ticket consumer discretionary items—brown goods—will also rise benefitting their manufacturers. “The impact of increased rural income will be felt more on brown goods than on white goods,” says Arora. Since the summer this time is likely to be harsh—a precursor to good monsoon—makers of room coolers and air conditioners will do well.

Select auto companies too will benefit from increased rural income. “The third year of normal monsoon with increased government spending is good news for auto companies, such as Hero Motocorp, with large rural market share,” says Rakesh Tarway, Head, Research, Reliance Securities. Among passenger vehicles, Maruti Suzuki is best placed.

Banks and financial institutions with large rural networks will also be among the beneficiaries. However, we need to avoid lenders with structural issues. For example, while SBI with its large network will benefit from its rural exposure, it still faces asset quality concerns due to its huge corporate loan book. 

This is why experts are betting only on retail-focused lenders. “Increased rural income is good for micro finance institutions because their collections will improve. Select NBFCs that give low-ticket loans will also be among the beneficiaries,” says Arora. Here again, M&M Financial Services will be a significantly benefit because of its high exposure to tractor financing.

Pipe companies such as Finolex Industries will benefit due to increased irrigation and housing construction needs. Micro irrigation companies such as Jain Irrigation, on the other hand, may be adversely impacted because water conservation-related products and services see limited demand during a good monsoon."

The Nifty50 index formed a higher wave Doji candle as it traded in a wider range between 10,514 and 10,638 levels all through Monday after moving in a narrow range move for last four sessions.

The index witnessed buying interest in morning dips, but saw selling pressure at higher levels, as it failed to hold above the immediate hurdle of 10,630 in the last hour of trade.

The index got stuck in the grip of option writers ahead of the expiry of April series derivative contracts. Now, as long as it holds above the 10,480-10,500 zone, the immediate trend could continue for a potential upward move towards 10,630 and then 10,700 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,400 while maximum Call OI is at 10,700, followed by 10,600. There was Put writing at strike prices 10,600 and 10,550 while minor Call unwinding was seen at all strike prices, which are creating scope for further upside.

The option band suggests an immediate trading range between 10,500 and 10,700 levels.

India VIX moved up 1.15 per cent to 13.08. Overall lower volatility is supporting the major bullish bias of the market.

Bank Nifty opened flat and then corrected towards the 24,470 level. It has been making lower highs and lower lows from last four sessions. It formed a ‘Hammer’ candle on the daily chart, which implies that the decline got bought into and it recovered sharply from low.

As long as Nifty holds below 25,250, it can extend losses towards 24,750 and then 24,500 levels, while on the upside, major hurdles are seen at 25,250 and then 25,500 levels.

Nifty50 futures closed flat at 10,585. Long buildup was seen in NIIT Tech, Mindtree, Shriram Transort Finance, HCL Tech, LIC Housing Finance, Bharat Financial and Aurobindo Pharma while shorts were seen in Cummins India, Indiabulls Housing Finance, UPL, Tata Motors DVR, Hindalco and Bharti Infratel.

10,2018-05-08,Phosphorus Limited,"ET Intelligence Group: Commentary by company managements on future demand has started to sound positive after several quarters of lacklustre outlook.

Companies such as Adani Ports & SEZ, Dabur, Godrej Properties, Hero MotoCorp, Interglobe Aviation, Oberoi Realty, UPL, UltraTech, and Varun Beverages hinted at brighter prospects during their March 2018 quarter post-earnings interaction with investors.

Most of these companies have guided for a double-digit volume growth in the current fiscal following less than 5 per cent annual growth in the previous two fiscals. The commentary by Dabur India, which is known for its conservative approach when it comes to guidance, was positive for FY19. After reporting around 5 per cent growth in each of the past two fiscals, it now expects 8-10 per cent volume growth in the first two quarters and a double-digit growth in the second-half of the fiscal.

Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest twowheeler company, also anticipates doubledigit growth for the sector in the current fiscal. It is confident to outperform the sector growth thanks to market share gain due to the launch of new models in the 125 cc scooter and premium motorcycle segments. Company’s volume grew 6.3 per cent annually between FY14 and FY18.

Adani Ports, a multi-port operator, has guided for an 11 per cent increase in cargo volume with 100 basis point margin expansion. It expects cargo volume and container volume to grow 1.5 and two times higher than the sector growth.

India’s largest cement maker UltraTech has guided for 8-10 per cent sector volume growth for FY19 due to increased spending on roads and housing. It reported an average capacity utilisation of 80 per cent across its plants, higher than the sector average of 73 per cent. Interglobe Aviation, which owns and operates Indigo Airlines, has guided for 25 per cent growth in the available seat kilometre — a measure of a flight’s passenger carrying capacity -- for FY19 compared with 16 per cent in the previous fiscal as it looks to add more widebodied aircraft. At the end of March 2018, the company’s fleet size was 159.


Companies Forecast Return of Growth
Agrochemical company UPL expects a pickup in the domestic market in FY19 given the forecasts of a normal monsoon. For the current fiscal, UPL has guided for 10-12 per cent constant currency revenue growth and EBITDA growth of 12-15 per cent. Varun Beverages, a contract manufacturer for Pepsi, is optimistic about the peak summer season which contributes more than 45 per cent of volume. The March quarter revenue of the company rose 25 per cent year-on-year with a volume growth of 20 per cent.

The listed realty players including Oberoi and Godrej properties have planned several new launches in FY19 despite a subdued sector trend. Oberoi Realty’s pre-sales rose 40 per cent year-on-year to Rs 220 crore, which is the second best in eight quarters. Godrej Properties expects to launch 10 new projects in FY19 compared with five in FY18 with Bengaluru and NCR being the major markets. Its FY18 pre-sales crossed ?5,000 crore, a growth of 153 per cent YoY, one of the best in many years."

14,2018-05-12,Phosphorus Limited,"By Dr Aruna Kalra

 Aches and pains during pregnancy is part and parcel of joy of pregnancy. Our body is changing and adapting to accommodate the growing foetus by relaxing our muscles and ligaments. The stretching of ligaments creates more space between pelvic bones and spine, and loosely held bones are difficult to move over/with each other, which makes movements clumsy and painful.

 Starting from 1st trimester till last trimester, pregnant women experience different kinds of pains, bloating, cramps and numbness.

 Headaches are one of the most common pregnancy complaints. Try to get plenty of rest, and practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing.

 Cramping typically occurs when the uterus expands, causing the ligaments and muscles that support it to stretch. One should not be worried about the minor cramps that happen every now and then. Stretching can be due to round ligament pull caused by growing uterus, and gives sharp piercing or dull pulling feeling. Some women experience sharp, piercing pain in the vagina. Try relaxation exercises. Place a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel on the ache. Make sure you get plenty of fluids. Take warm water bath. All the above measures will reduce these pains. However, consult doctor if you still don't get the desired relief or pains occur in moderate intensity along with other symptoms.


ThinkStock PhotosWomen frequently experience hip pain as the connective tissue loosens and stretches.
Leg cramping and restless-leg syndrome is common in the third trimester. Cramping can occur as a result of too much phosphorus and too little calcium in the body. Restless-leg syndrome, also known as the overwhelming need to constantly move your leg, can be a symptom of an iron or folic acid deficiency. An uncomfortable sensation in the legs, a strong urge to move one or both legs or night-time leg twitching are frequent symptoms of restless-leg syndrome.

 If you feel tingling or numbness in your hands during pregnancy, it could be carpal-tunnel syndrome. This condition is normally associated with repetitive hand movements, but extra fluid and swelling during pregnancy can also cause these symptoms.

 Pregnancy rib pain can be the result of your baby physically kicking you in the ribs, stretching out under the ribs, or just moving by your ribs. The pain can also be caused by the muscles stretching out. In rare cases, it might be caused by a medical complication.

 Many women experience sciatica during pregnancy because the enlarged uterus presses down on the sciatic nerve. This increased-pressure causes pain, tingling or numbness in the lower back, buttocks and thighs.

 Belly-button pain may occur on-and-off throughout pregnancy as you experience stages of rapid growth. Some women may get used to the pressure and stretching early on. For others, the pain is worse during the final weeks when your belly is the biggest.

 Taking pressure off your belly may help. Try sleeping on your side or supporting your belly with pillows to take the load off. A maternity support belt may help alleviate back and abdominal soreness while standing.

 Women frequently experience hip pain as the connective tissue loosens and stretches. Lower back pain can also occur along with hip pain, as posture changes may cause you to lean more toward one side or another. Sleeping on your side with a pillow between your legs may help to relieve this pain because it opens the hips slightly.

 The coccyx is a joint that's at the very bottom of your spine. It sits right behind your uterus. Your growing baby pushing against it, hormones, and other issues like constipation can lead to more pain. Often, what feels like lower back pain and hip pain during pregnancy is actually tailbone pain.

 While there's no cure for it, there are some stretches you can do to help ease the pain. If your pain is severe or lasts more than a few days with little change or worsens, see your doctor. Doing gentle exercise, such as yoga with lots of stretching positions, will help keep your muscles loose. It will also help keep both you and the baby as healthy as possible.

70,2018-06-25,Phosphorus Limited,"The equity market gave up most of the Friday’s gains, as it ended the first session of the week on a negative note, losing 59.40 points or 0.55 per cent. The market traded stable for major part of the session, but it was the last hour of the trade when weakness crept in.

The Nifty’s struggle with the falling trend line pattern resistance continued on Monday. With Nifty not able to move past the critical 10820-10850 zones, it is getting vulnerable to pressures, as it moves into the apex of the broad symmetrical triangle that it has been trading in.

Stepping into Tuesday’s trade, we see possibilities of weakness persisting due to the weaker global picture. In any case, the zones of 10,820-10,850 continue to pose critical resistance to the market. Tuesday will see the levels of 10,820 and 10,850 offering resistance, while supports are expected to come in at 10,740 and then at 10,680 in form of 50-DMA.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart was 52.8408. It continued to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. Daily MACD stayed bearish while trading below the signal line. The emergence of a strong black body on candles has once again lent credibility to the pattern resistance.



Pattern analysis shows Nifty continuing to fiercely resist to the falling trend line, which joined the high of 11,170 to the subsequent lower tops. While it continued to remain in a broad symmetrical triangle pattern, it has moved near its apex and has become prone to a sharp move in coming days.

 Overall, it is time that we once again tread the market with some caution. Though it currently rests very near to its short term 20-DMA, any weakness will make sure that the Nifty tests its 50-DMA.

 Also, with each day with no directional move happening, Nifty is also making itself vulnerable to a sharp move that will lead to resolution to the current pattern.

We recommend staying away from taking any major directional call and avoid heavy purchases. Shorts too should be avoided until market makes any meaningful directional move. While remaining light on positions, preservation of cash with cautious view is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Relatively resilient technical set up was observed in PNB Housing, Sun TV, NBCC, Tech Mahindra, First Source, Infosys, UPL, TVS Motors, BEML, Oil India, Havells and Indigo.

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were L&T, Bank of Baroda, Jindal Steel & Power, Hexaware Technologies, Axis Bank, Karnataka Bank, Apollo Tyres, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Mahindra & Mahindra.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes recently, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bullish crossovers included DCB Bank, Tata Power Co., Gujarat Narmada Valley, LIC Housing Finance, Marksans Pharma, UPL, GSFC, BF Utilities, Mahanagar Gas, Equitas Holdings, Puravankara and Jamna Auto.

The MACD charts also signalled bearish crossovers for 13 stocks on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. They included Infosys, Apollo Hospitals, Jyothy Laboratories, Future Retail, Inox Wind, AMJ Land Holdings and ICICI Lombard General Insurance.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa.





The MACD alone may not be a sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.




The Nifty50 index on Monday formed a Hanging Man-like pattern on the day chart. The index surpassed its falling supply trend line formed by connecting the swing highs of 11,171, 10,929, 10,837 and 10,816 levels, but needs to show more strength to put the bulls in the driving seat.

If it holds above 10,777, Nifty can extend gains towards 10,888, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. Supports are seen at 10,770 and 10,720 levels, he said.





A close look at Bank of Baroda stock chart shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

Shares of the company closed 0.95 per cent higher at Rs 117 on July 9."
4,2018-07-10,Phosphorus Limited,"MUMBAI: Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world’s second-largest sovereign wealth fund, is set to invest $1 billion to acquire a 20% stake in UPL Corporation, the Mauritius-based arm of India-listed UPL Ltd, said several people aware of the plan.

UPL Corporation, formerly Bio-Win Corporation, houses UPL’s expansive global agrochemicals business, which contributed 87% of its FY18 sales of over $2.7 billion.

This will be the vehicle that the Mumbaibased company will use to acquire Platform Specialty Products Corp’s agricultural pesticides business called Arysta Life-Science for $4.3 billion, they added.

While ADIA will provide $1 billion in equity funding — it’s single biggest commitment to an Indian company till date — UPL is organising the remaining $3.3 billion from Asian and European banks.

UPL Corporation raised $300 million through dollar-denominated bonds in March.

UPL is the world’s second-largest postpatent agrochemicals company. Platform, the chemical maker whose biggest stakeholder is Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management with a 14% stake, said in June it had entered exclusive negotiations on a potential sale of Arysta.

The West Palm Beach, Florida-based company announced its intention last year to separate the crop chemicals business from its industrial chemicals division, at first planning to hive it off into a separate publicly traded company. Arysta LifeScience employs about 3,000 people and accounted for about half of Platform’s sales of $3.8 billion last year.

Jaidev (Jai) Shroff, global CEO of UPL, and an ADIA spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Mails sent to Platform Specialty Products did not generate a comment till press time.

Both sides are likely to finalise the terms this week before making a formal announcement by this month end. Jai Shroff-led UPL had walked away from the transaction late last month over a valuation mismatch but re-engaged after other potential suitors left.

Platform had said it was in talks with UK investment vehicle Wilmcote Holdings Plc about a potential deal.


Like Platform, UPL, earlier known as United Phosphorus Ltd, has also been a serial acquirer with over 25 takeovers in two decades. The company that started in 1969 as a manufacturer of red phosphorus, used in safety matches and pesticides, is today spread across 133 countries with 33 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries spanning the entire agrochemicals value chain of seeds to specialised post-harvest products.

Arysta will be UPL’s largest bet. Once completed, it will make UPL the world’s fifth-largest crop-protection company and the biggest generic player with a combined revenue of slightly less than $4.6 billion. The company is currently the ninth-largest.

Analysts favour UPL’s long-term prospects, led by its focus on branding and launching of innovative products, maintaining geographical presence, catering to major crops, increasing share in the global market and consistent investments in backward and forward integration, resulting in better cost management.

“Global consolidation is an opportunity for companies such as UPL to gain better access to distribution,” said Basanth Patil, an analyst with HDFC Securities.

The space has seen unprecedented consolidation with the Dow Chemicals-DuPont, Bayer-Monsanto and Sygenta-Adama mergers. More than 80% of the global market share is held by only four companies.

UPL’s strong manufacturing base will help reduce sourcing costs as Arysta gets most of its raw material from India and China. A strong supply chain can then be integrated with Arysta, which has a presence in more countries, thereby benefiting from market access.

The UPL stock gained 0.45% to Rs 624.55 at the close on the BSE on Monday. Its current market capitalisation is Rs 31,811crore.

ADIA has been increasing its India play after recently committing $1billion in the government’s National Investment & Infrastructure Fund’s Master Fund. In infrastructure, ADIA owns minority stakes in Indian renewable energy producer ReNew Power Ventures Pvt and Greenko Energy Holdings.

Last November, it acquired a minority stake in Cube Highways and Infrastructure Pte, a road platform formed by I Squared Capital and World Bank’s International Finance Corp and a month later, it picked up a minority stake in KKR India Financial Services Pvt, an alternative credit business of global private equity leader KKR & Co in India, for an undisclosed amount.

ADIA owns a minority stake in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd. Its other bets include Security and Intelligence Services (India) Ltd and securities depository firm Central Depository Services (India) Ltd. In real estate, it invested $200 million in Kotak’s realty fund."

13,2018-07-11,Phosphorus Limited,"The bulls on Dalal Street kept their cool amid a global rout that shaved 2 per cent off Asian shares, due to escalating trade war worries after US warned China of another round of tariffs -- this time worth $200 billion.

 The NSE Nifty index on the NSE closed just one point up at 10,948.30. The 30-share BSE Sensex, which was up over 100 points in the afternoon trade, closed 26.31 points, or 0.07 per cent, up at 36,265.93. Weak opening in European markets further forced the index to pared most of its day’s gains.

 On the other hand, the BSE IT sector gained more than 2 per cent on hopes of better outlook.

 The rupee is expected to be around 68-72 against the dollar in the next 2-4 months, and the depreciation bias in the domestic currency is likely continue, says a UBS report. 

 Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, “Improving outlook on IT index helped the market to keep its positive momentum while escalation in trade tensions between US and China capped the upside. Expectations of better Q1 result and decline in oil price will support market to prolong the current stability. Progressing monsoon and higher MSP gives leeway for consumption oriented sector to come to the limelight.""

The Nifty50 index opened in the positive, but failed to surpass its previous day’s high and remained rangebound for most part of the session.

The index formed a bearish candle on daily scale, and managed to settle above the psychologically important 11,000 mark for the second consecutive session.

Now, it has to hold above 10,975 to extend its gain towards 11,080 and then its lifetime high of 11,171, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,929 and then 10,888 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,600 followed by 10,700, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,200. Significant Put writing was seen at 11,000 and 10,900 levels, while Call writing was seen at 11,200. The options band signified an immediate trading range between 10,929 and 11,171 levels.

India VIX fell 1.58 per cent to 12.30.

Bank Nifty traded in a narrow range of around 150 points for the entire session and formed a bearish candle on the daily scale. Now, it has to hold above 26,750 to extend its move towards 27,165 and then 27,400 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 26,600 level.

Nifty futures closed flat at 11,022. Long buildup was in Titan, Reliance Industries, Bajaj Finance and Kotak Bank while shorts were created in UPL, ZEE, Axis Bank and Grasim.

31,2018-07-15,Phosphorus Limited,"Friday’s session saw expected stalling of Nifty’s upmove after a breakout from a pattern resistance. The market remained in a capped range and after oscillating in a defined range, the benchmark index Nifty50 ended the day posting negligible loss of 4.30 points or 0.04 per cent. The Thursday’s high of 11,078 has now become the immediate resistance for the market around which we expect some consolidation to occur before the index attempts to test its previous high.

Monday is likely to once again see a quiet and uneventful start to the trade. There are no negatively affecting global triggers and technically speaking, given the slightly overstretched indicators on the Daily Charts, some consolidation might continue.

We expect the week to begin with a rangebound trade with the Nifty expected to oscillate in a defined range. The corrective downsides, if any, may remain limited. The levels of 11,078 and 11,170 will act as immediate resistance area while supports should come in at 10,980 and 10,910 zone.




The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Chart is 66.4924 and it remains neutral and shows no divergence against the price. The Daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. No significant formations were seen on Candles.

If we look at pattern analysis, the Nifty has broken out from a falling trend line resistance which began from 11,170 and subsequently joint lower tops. Post the breakout and recent upmove, Nifty is seen taking a likely breather and this might result into some consolidation before it gathers strength to inch higher.

Overall, the general setup continues to remain bullish, but we might see Nifty stalling its upmove for some more time and consolidate. However, we recommend continuing making select purchases with each opportunity that any consolidation offers while also continuing to protect profits at higher levels. Shorts may be avoided as we might see Nifty attempting to test its previous high over coming days. Positive outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Shorts were seen being added in stocks like NCC, ITC, UPL, Jindal Steel, Tata Power, PNB, South Indian Bank, BEL, Adani Ports, ONGC, Bank OF India, SAIL, Federal Bank and Nalco.

34,2018-07-16,Phosphorus Limited,"Selective buying in heavyweight stocks took the benchmark BSE Sensex to an all-time high level last week.

However, most of the stocks in the 30-share index are still giving negative returns on a year-to-date basis. The selling pressure has been severe in midcap and smallcap stocks. 

Headwinds in the form of weak emerging markets, rising rates, higher crude oil prices, election year worries and relative rich valuations have mainly impacted sentiments on Dalal Street this year. 

Global brokerage Morgan Stanley, which estimates Sensex to hit 36,000 by June next year in base case, believes the largecap index has support from an improving growth cycle, strong macro stability and local appetite for equities.

“We expect Sensex earnings growth of 5 per cent YoY in F2018, 23 per cent in F2019 and 24 per cent in FY2020,” the brokerage said in a report.

In a bull case scenario, it sees Sensex at 44,000 and in bear case at 26,500. 


Factors favouring the market
The global brokerage highlighted the factors that are looking favourable for the market. They include macroeconomic stability evident in positive BoP and backed by RBI’s commitment to keeping real rates positive. 

A bullish steepening of yield curve, which is at a post-2010 high, correlates positively with stocks and low and falling beta, which augur well in a weak global equity market environment.

In addition to this, India’s growth is likely accelerating relative to emerging markets. “Our work shows corporate confidence is at a multi-year high and profits are likely to mean-revert from below trend. Strong domestic flows, currently averaging around $2-2.5 billion a month, are in a structural uptrend,” Morgan Stanley said.

The brokerage prefers largecaps to midcaps and like sectors, including banks (private corporate and retail), discretionary consumption, industrials and domestic materials, while avoiding healthcare, staples, utilities, global materials and energy.

The brokerage further says crude oil prices remain a key risk to equities given its ability to cause pain to fiscal deficit and, therefore, growth. It sees strong growth in 2018 and 2019 driven by consumption, exports, government spending and a nascent recovery in private capex.


Valuations
Morgan Stanley said equities do not look compelling compared with long bonds. India’s recent outperformance has lifted relative valuations above average. “Our composite valuation indicator suggests low double-digit index returns in the coming 12 months,” it added in a report.


Stocks in focus
Bajaj Auto, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, Titan, ITC, ITC, RIL, Bharat Financial, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, M&M Financial, Shriram Transport, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Adani Ports, Havells India, Asian Paints, Ultratech Cement, UPL and Infosys are among the stocks on Morgan Stanley’s focus list. 


Factors against domestic equities
The global brokerage said a likely rise in crude oil prices can put pressure on growth, while upward pressure on inflation from food price hikes indicate that more rate hikes are coming. The election cycle, which brings its own set of uncertainties, relatively rich midcap valuations (even after the recent drawdown) and high equity valuations relative to bonds, which indicates that the market is pricing in some part of the coming growth recovery, are some of the factors looking against Indian equities."
33,2018-07-16,Phosphorus Limited,"If you have a strong conviction on a stock but are worried about the gestation period, investing may not be your cup of tea. Maybe, you should trade!

Some 10 stocks from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) took 20 years for gestation, but have delivered up to 2,619 times return in this period. They were penny stocks back then; five are part of the elite Nifty50 club today. They are Eicher Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UPL, Lupin and Titan Company.

Others which made their investors millionaires included Bajaj Finance, Shree Cement, Gruh Finance, JSW Steel and Ashiana Housing.

No, it has not been a steep climb for any of them. UPL, Titan, and JSW Steel tested investors’ nerves for several quarters or even years before they took off. 

That’s what you face on the path to richness. 

Ian Cassel, a well-known microcap investor, said in a recent tweet: “Every multibagger will have long periods (even years) of stagnation, as fundamentals backfill, old shareholders get bored, and new shareholders enter.”

So how long is it, really?

UPL remained in the Rs 3-8 range all through 1998-2003; Titan traded in the Rs 2-4 range around the same time. The former is at Rs 637, today and latter at Rs 832.

Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied 2,61,772 per cent from Rs 10.70 on July 12 in 1998 to Rs 28,020 on July 12, 2018. The company has no debt on its books and continues to redeploy cash for further expansion and product innovation.

Data available with Ace Equity showed Eicher’s net profit swelled to Rs 1,712.90 crore for the year ended March 2018 from Rs 23.50 crore reported for FY01. Net sales soared over 20 times during this period. 

An investment of Rs 55,000 in Eicher Motors shares in 1998 would have become over Rs 14 crore today. 

Kotak Mahindra Bank is the second biggest gainer on the list, up 1,29,337 per cent from Rs 1.10 in July 1998 to Rs 1,394 at last Friday’s close. Net profit of the lender multiplied over 50 times to Rs 4,084.30 crore for the year ended FY18. In comparison, shares of HDFC Bank rallied 16,022 per cent from Rs 13.40 to Rs 2165 in the same period.

Brokerage Sharekhan says Kotak Mahindra Bank is among a handful of banks that have been able to maintain strong asset quality in sharp contrast to most banking peers that have become fraught with challenges. Kotak Bank is well positioned to capture incremental market share in the advances market.

“With PSU banks hobbled with non-performing assets (NPA) and capital-related issues, private banks (such as Kotak Bank) have a great opportunity to grab market share and gain access to attractive clientele,” the brokerage said in a report.

UPL has multiplied investor wealth by 647 times in last 20 years. The scrip jumped from Rs 0.90 on July 13, 1998 to Rs 582.70 on July 12, 2018. Net sales and net profit have soared manifold in the same period.

UPL is engaged in the crop protection business, comprising agrochemicals, industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and specialty chemicals.

HDFC Securities in an April report said UPL’s long-term prospects remained positive led by its focus on branding and launch of innovative products, maintaining geographical presence and catering to major crops.

It has increased its share in the global agrochemical market (4 per cent in CY16 against 3 per cent in CY14), and improving Innovation Turnover Index, which rose to 19 per cent in FY18 from 15 per cent in FY17. The company has been investing consistently in backward as well as forward integration, resulting in better cost management.

Shares of pharma major Lupin have rallied 46,370 per cent to Rs 885.30 from Rs 1.90 on July 13, 1998, while Titan has soared 35,415 per cent to Rs 808.90 from Rs 2.30 during the same period. 

Lupin’s profit has jumped from just Rs 2.90 crore in FY2000 to Rs 1,344 for the financial year ended March 2018. It is the market leader in 51 out of the 158 products it sells in the US generic market. As many as 109 of its products feature among the top three in the US generic market.

Lupin plans to launch around 30 new products in the US during FY19. With 163 ANDAs pending approval by USFDA, Lupin is poised for good growth, according to Centrum Broking. The management has guided an EBIDTA margin of 19-21 per cent and single digit decline in revenues for US generic business in FY19.

Titan’s bottomline has soared to over Rs 1,150 crore in FY18 from Rs 25 crore in FY05, while top line has grown 15 times.

The previous financial year turned out to be a robust one for the company, with the jewellery division delivering healthy expansion in bottomline and topline. Revenues for the jewellery division grew 25 per cent YoY to Rs 13,257 crore.

Recent regulatory changes such as demonetisation and GST have led to market share gains for the company, while its enhanced focus on wedding and high value studded jewellery and favourable gold exchange policy has also helped grow topline. The management remains upbeat on the growth outlook for the jewellery division with plans to grow revenues at a compounding rate of 20 per cent till FY23. 

The size of India’s jewellery industry is pegged at Rs 2,50,000 crore, of which Titan’s Tanishq brand has just 5 per cent market share. This provides immense opportunity to enhance market share, going forward."

44,2018-07-20,Phosphorus Limited,"A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (“ADIA”), and leading global alternative asset firm TPG, have partnered with UPL Corporation Limited (“UPL Corp”) to support UPL Corp’s planned acquisition of Arysta LifeScience Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Arysta”) from NYSE-listed Platform Specialty Products Corporation. Arysta specialises in the development, formulation, registration, marketing and distribution of differentiated crop protection solutions, including BioSolutions and seed treatment products.

The agreement will see ADIA and TPG Capital Asia invest $1.2 billion ($600 million each) for a ~22% combined shareholding in UPL Corp to facilitate UPL Corp’s ~$4.2 billion acquisition of 100% of Arysta. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals.

UPL Corp is an operating company that leads the international operations of UPL Limited, a global agrochemical solutions provider listed in India. UPL Corp’s acquisition of Arysta will create a global leader in agriculture solutions with a diversified portfolio across all market segments and fulfils UPL’s objective of creating an integrated patent and post-patent agricultural solutions business with a global footprint.

Hamad Shahwan Aldhaheri, Executive Director of the Private Equities Department at ADIA, said: “Backing the Arysta acquisition through our investment in UPL Corp aligns with our strategy of partnering with best-in-class businesses to support and accelerate their growth plans. The combination of Arysta and UPL Corp will create a leading crop protection business with a global footprint and diversified product portfolio supported by a strong manufacturing and R&D expertise.”

Puneet Bhatia, Co-Managing Partner of TPG Capital Asia, said: “We are excited to partner with the founders and management of UPL who have a stellar track record of acquiring and integrating global businesses successfully. The combined platform will generate compelling synergies, and with the addition of Arysta, UPL will reach more than 130 countries with more than 12,800 products and be well poised for further expansion in their sector. This is a landmark transaction that will foster a strong value proposition for the entire ecosystem of growers, distributors, suppliers and innovation partners.”"
45,2018-07-20,Phosphorus Limited,"Foreign institutional investors (FII) turned net sellers during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. However, they were found picking select stocks from across sectors, such as staffing, auto ancillary, construction, chemicals, information technology, pharma, housing finance and stock broking, among others.

FIIs offloaded shares worth Rs 20,443 crore during the April-June period against Rs 13,722 crore inflow in the same period last year. Soaring crude oil prices, a depreciating rupee and higher bond yields in the US were among the primary reasons that led to the outflows.

Among the largecaps, FIIs increased holdings in Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, UPL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Lupin, Power Grid and Bajaj Finance. They increased their holding in HDFC Bank to 40.86 per cent at the end of June quarter from 40.43 per cent as of March 31, 2018. 

Barring UPL and Power Grid, shares of these companies rallied between 2 per cent and 27 per cent during the quarter.



Shareholding data available with Ace Equity till July 18 shows overseas portfolio investors hiked stakes in around 75 companies by more than 1 percentage points.

Tiles manufacturer Nitco drew strong interest from FIIs, who raised stake in the firm to 24.25 per cent at the end of June quarter from 1.18 per cent at the end of March. 

Among others, Indiabulls Integrated Services, SE Power, Mercator, Gokaldas Exports, MEP Infrastructure and BSEL Infrastructure Realty saw FII holdings go up by more than 10 percentage points during the quarter gone by.

In the real estate space, Sobha, Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty attracted FII interest. FII holding in the Bangalore-based Sobha rose to 30.27 per cent from 28.53 per cent in the previous quarter, while in Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty, FIIs raised holdings by over 4 percentage points.

Sales bookings at Sobha jumped 22 per cent to Rs 762.40 crore during June quarter on bigger volumes as well as higher price realisations.

FIIs showed a lot of interest in midcap IT firms, including L&T Infotech (from 6.92 per cent to 7.98 per cent), Sonata Software (from 14.67 per cent to 15.94 per cent), Cyient (from 40.42 per cent to 43.08 per cent), Mphasis (from 22.79 per cent to 29.17 per cent) and Aptech (from 5.19 per cent to 7.12 per cent) during the quarter. 



From the pharma space, Neuland Labs, Suven Life, Ipca Labs and Marksans Pharma saw strong FII interest.

A depreciating rupee will provide a fair amount of tailwind to IT and pharma companies in terms of margin expansion, but one can’t be sure whether it can improve the prospects of IT and pharma on a headline basis, Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher, told ETNow in a chat.

“Selectively, some of the stocks would look good, but as a sector, it would be more defensive and may not help make big money on a proactive basis,” he said.

In the textiles space, Lakshmi Machine Works, Ambika Cotton Mills and Gokaldas Exports saw increased interest from FIIs, who also hiked stakes in Dish TV from the broadcasting space.

Staffing players found favour with foreign investors, who took their stake in Teamlease to 40.30 per cent in Q1FY19 from 32.46 in Q4FY18. Likewise, Quess Corp saw FII holding rise to 13.70 per cent from 4.70 per cent.

“Staffing companies will be a natural play on formalisation of businesses, because you are taking a labour force, which is primarily informal. They will now start coming into the formal world,” independent market expert Saurabh Mukherjea told ETNow. 

Staffing companies are a kind of go between. They are the brokers of people. Staffing as a space and formalisation as a theme would be two mega themes that will work wonderfully well in the years ahead, he said."
46,2018-07-20,Phosphorus Limited,"In one of the largest overseas deals by India Inc in recent years, chemicals producer UPL (formerly United Phosphates) today teamed up with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and TPG to snap up Florida-based Arysta Life Science Inc for USD 4.2 billion in an all-cash deal.

The transaction will enhance the position of UPL as a global leader in the agriculture solutions market and make it a USD 5 billion entity in combined sales offering it a USD 200 million savings through operational synergies.

The tie-up will see Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which is the world's second-largest sovereign wealth fund, and private equity major TPG Capital infusing USD 1.2 billion into UPL Corporation, the Mauritius-based international arm of UPL and the acquirer company, and will collectively own 22 per cent. These new investors will infuse USD 600 million each, UPL said in a statement.

Though known for acquisitions, Arysta is UPL's largest bet. Once completed, it will make UPL the world's fifth- largest crop-protection company after Bayer, DuPont, Syngenta and the biggest generic player with a combined revenue of USD 5 billion. Currently it is the ninth-largest player.

UPL vice-chairman Vikram Shroff said the all-cash deal was signed between UPL Corporation and the Florida-based NYSE-listed Platform Specialty Products Corporation's farm pesticides business under Arysta Life Science Inc brand and its subsidiaries.

Platform is a leading chemical maker and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management is its biggest stakeholder with 14 per cent stake. Its subsidiary Arysta is a global provider of innovative crop protection solutions, including bio solutions and seed treatment.

Arysta was formed through a combination of Arysta Life Science, acquired by Platform in February 2015 and two additional crop protection chemical companies, Agriphar and Chemtura Agro Solutions of Chemtura Corporation, acquired by Platform in 2014.

For the year to March 2018, Arysta reported an operating revenue of USD 2 billion and operating profit of USD 424 million.

For the rest of the funding gap, UPL has tied up a clutch of lenders to raise USD 3 billion to fund the debt- driven deal. Foreign lenders for the bridge loan facility include Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan and Rabobank from its Hong Kong branch.

""We've received debt financing commitments of USD 3 billion for the balance of the consideration for the deal, with a bullet maturity of five years, from MUFG Bank and Rabobank's Hong Kong branch,"" the company said.

Shroff said acquisition will help UPL log in a USD 1 billion pre-tax profit and boost its margins to over 20 per cent due to the synergies between the two companies in terms of geographies, crops and products, manufacturing and differentiated R&D capabilities.

""The deal is expected to drive annual synergies of over USD 200 million,"" he said, adding it will also help fulfill UPL's objective of creating an integrated patent and post-patent agri solutions business with a global footprint and transform into a leading crop solutions company.

Apart from giving UPL access to a differentiated product portfolio, the acquisition will make UPL one of the world's largest global crop protection companies.

Jai Shroff, group chief executive and executive director said, ""Arysta has a differentiated position in the crop protection market given its focus primarily on speciality applications and tailored local solutions. And this deal is in line with our long-term vision of becoming a premier global provider of agricultural solutions designed to secure the world's long-term food supply.""

Joining him, Rakesh Sachdev, chief executive of Platform said, ""with its scale and capabilities, we believe the combined companies will represent a compelling value proposition for growers, distributors, suppliers and innovation partners in a consolidating market.

For the Florida-headquartered Platform, the deal with UPL is part of its plans to separate the crop chemicals business from its industrial chemicals division.

Arysta employs about 3,000 and accounted for about half of Platform's USD 3.8-billion sales last year.

UPL has been a serial acquirer with over 25 buyouts in the past 20 decades. Began in 1969 as a manufacturer of red phosphorus used in safety matches and pesticides, today it has operations in 133 countries with 33 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries covering the entire agrochemicals value-chain from seeds to specialised post-harvest products.

UPL will have an integrated supply chain with a backward integrated manufacturing base in major markets and deep distribution capabilities across the globe to address needs of growers, he added.

Platform chairman Martin Franklin said, ""We decided to separate our businesses last year to position both the performance solutions and agri solutions businesses for future growth and additional compelling value creation opportunities. This deal creates an agricultural chemicals powerhouse with highly complementary capabilities. We are excited to see what the two combined companies can accomplish.""

For FY18, UPL reported operating revenue of USD 2.7 billion and pre-tax profit of USD 543 million.

Evercore, JP Morgan, UBS, Greenberg Traurig, Credit Suisse, Jones Day, J Sagar Associates, Cleary Gottlieb and Platinum Partners acted as financial and legal advisors.

UPL shares which had lost about 25 per cent so far this year, slipped 0.5 per cent to Rs 567.45 on the BSE against a 0.4 per cent gain in the benchmark."
47,2018-07-20,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: UPL on Friday said that UPL Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, signed a definitive agreement with Platform Specialty Products Corporation to acquire Arysta LifeScience Inc. and its subsidiaries for approximately $4.2 billion in cash consideration.

Following the acquisition, UPL will be one of the world's largest global crop protection companies, with differentiated product portfolio, the company said in a filing to BSE. 

The board of directors of the company approved the acquisition proposal in its meeting on Friday, the company said.

The acquisition will give UPL access to a variety of patented products through collaborations and partnerships as well as enhanced in-house R&D capabilities.

55,2018-07-23,Phosphorus Limited,"It is better to be with a leader like Infosys which on a valuation perspective is quite cheap compared to TCS, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP- Research, IIFL, 
  
  tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 



What do you make of UPL buying Arysta Lifescience for $4.2 billion. What does it mean for their market share globally, as also what it means for the stock which has underperformed over the last three months?
The deal is more or less as per expectations and the synergy benefit with the management I have been talking about is completely possible. There could be some initial hiccups. From a valuation perspective, the stock has corrected from a high of around Rs 900 to around Rs 550 odd. If there is any weakness in the stock because of this particular deal, one should look to accumulate it in terms of geographical strength as well as the crop mix. This particular deal is pretty interesting for UPL and equity element added at the international subsidiary level where a dilution will take place. Overall, it appears to be a decent deal for UPL and will help it gain a significant market share. The market share of UPL is going to be close to around 9% globally which is quite a decent number.


In Friday’s session, there was traction in Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv. What would be a good strategy to approach the business -- buy a Bajaj Finance or a Bajaj Finserv or take exposure to all of the entities within the Bajaj Group by buying into Bajaj Holdings?
It is better to buy the company directly rather than routing your investment through Bajaj Holdings because typically when there is a bull market, the discount to the value of investment comes down to close to around 45% to 50% and in a bear market scenario that discount goes up to around 60-65%. 

If you want to be in the financial space, Bajaj Finance is the right company to be in, considering that the growth opportunity there is best in terms of growth. Going forward, the cost of funds is also going to come down. Within the group, our preference should be for something like a Bajaj Finance, then Bajaj Finserv and then at number three Bajaj Auto. In case of Bajaj Auto, we feel most of the price cuts which they are doing at the entry level were not profitable businesses. They are selling some of these entry level bikes at some kind of a loss. We will be more bullish on Hero in the two-wheeler space.


From the NBFC space, what do you make of L&T Finance? Where does it stand within your pecking order?
It is more of a midcap kind of an NBFC. L&T Finance numbers were pretty good. The cost to income ratio could see a significant reduction in that as well as on the gross NPA levels. Also, one could see significant reductions happening. Overall, we would be positive on L&T Finance. However, right now, within the NBFC space, we are more focussed on the microfinance company where we see the earnings growth opportunity to be pretty robust over next three to four quarters.


We were discussing the IT sector a little while back. Now we have seen a slew of numbers come in from the IT space. Things are looking up for the business in a meaningful manner whether it comes to deal wins, or pricing of some of these deals. Look at Wipro’s earnings. While the other parameters looked lukewarm, the margin performance is fairly interesting to note. How do you review the earnings of all of the IT majors in lieu of what Wipro has also reported?
Wipro’s numbers were slightly better than expectation. However, the disappointment was that the Q2 guidance of 0.3 to 2.3% was below our expectations. If you look at the BFSI space, clearly Wipro has seen a lot of improvement over last six quarters with Q on Q growth for six quarters. So that is a positive. But with bankruptcy happening on the telecom space for two of its clients, plus the issue that it is grappling on the healthcare business, it is better to be with a leader like Infosys which on a valuation perspective is quite cheap compared to TCS. 

There were lot of one-offs in Infosys results. Overall, we are positive on the result despite the market being a little bit negative. From our perspective, the pecking order should be Infosys, TCS and then Wipro."

48,2018-07-23,Phosphorus Limited,"ET Intelligence Group: Rising leverage at UPL after the buyout of Arysta Life Science may turn investors cautious despite the purchase’s reasonable implied valuations and benefits accruing from the acquired unit’s complementary product portfolio.

UPL itself has lost 15 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively, in the past one and three months, and is trading at 7.5 times EV/ EBITDA – an 8 per cent discount to its fiveyear average. Compared with prominent peers such as PI Industries and Bayer Crop Science, which trade at multiples of 14 and 26, respectively, UPL is available at a discount. The narrowing of discount with its peers will hinge on the extent of revenue growth at Arysta Life after the acquisition and delivery on synergy benefits.

UPL signed a definitive agreement to acquire Arysta Life Science for $4.2 billion in an all cash consideration last Friday. After the acquisition, UPL will become the world’s fifth largest agrochemical company. UPL will acquire 78 per cent of Arysta Life through its subsidiary, UPL Corp, by taking a debt of $3 billion, while the balance equity stake will be equally funded by investments of $600 million each by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and private equity firm TPG.


The debt will have bullet maturity of five years. According to analysts, net debt to EBITDA ratio of the UPL may increase to nearly 3.6 times after the acquisition from one time currently. The total debt of UPL stood at Rs 6,507 crore in FY18, an increase of 7.4 per cent YoY.

A significant increase in the effective leverage on the consolidated balance sheet appears to be too large for investors’ comfort. Global investors are already pruning their holdings in emerging markets that face increasing re-financing costs because of the rising dollar index.

At $4.2 billion for Arysta, the company is valued at 10 times its EV/ EBITDA. The implied valuation of Arysta suggests it has been in-line with recent global agro-chemical deals. In the last couple of months, Nufarm, an Australia-based agrochemical company, acquired Century at 7.5 times its EV/EBITDA; by contrast, Sumitomo Chemical acquired Excel Crop at 14.1.

The business model of the UPL and Arysta is entirely different, yet the product basket is complimentary. There are a couple of benefits that UPL will accrue from Arysta’s acquisition. First, UPL’s market positioning is built around post-patent products, while Arysta’s focus is on speciality and protected markets. The acquisition will provide UPL with a strong presence in the high-growth market, with a healthy mix of main row crops and speciality crops.

Second, UPL produces from its lowcost product locations, while Arysta has an asset-light model with a strong focus on outsourcing. The combination of these two can improve margins and lead to better capital efficiency. Third, UPL will get access to BioSolution and seed treatment segment, where it has no presence.

These two segments have been growing at 14 per cent CAGR, one of the fastest in the global agrichemical markets, with a market size of around $5-6 billion each. The acquisition will also provide UPL access to new markets such as Africa, Eastern Europe and Russia, and could strengthen its presence in the European and Latin America markets. UPL derives nearly 80 per cent of its sales from overseas markets.

UPL’s management said it expects synergy benefits to be around $100 million in the first year and $200 million in the second once it closes the deal. According to UPL, the deal will be EPS accretive by Rs 10-12 per share by FY20."

63,2018-07-24,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: India’s headline equity indices scaled record highs on Monday, even though the top guns, such as HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Wipro and Bajaj Auto, failed to fire.

Even as the 50-share Nifty gained 74 points to end at a six-month high of 11,084, less than 100 points shy of its all-time high, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 87 counters on NSE. 

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

Among the counters that saw bullish crossovers were UPL, ICICI Bank, Reliance Power, Tata Motors, Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, Punj Lloyd and Union Bank of India. 

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes recently, adding further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Other stocks that gave this bullish indication included Bata India, Andhra Bank, Canara Bank, Bharat Electronics and Jet Airways, India Cements, Bharat Heavy Electricals, Infosys, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Dena Bank.

Meanwhile, the MACD charts also signalled bearish crossovers for 33 stocks on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. They included South Indian Bank, Jain Irrigation, Balrampur Chini, JK Tyre & Industries, Aksh Optifibre, Dilip Buildcon and Kavveri Telecom. 

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.


TABLE - 1
 

The MACD alone may not be a sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators. 


TABLE - 2
 
The Nifty50 index on Monday formed a small bullish candle on the daily chart. A sustainable upward move from here on could confirm a breakout of this range. In such a scenario, one may expect Nifty to take out its January peak of 11,171, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. 

A close above this range may set up a fresh target at 11,241, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

Mohammad advised traders to go for fresh long positions with a stop loss below 11,000 on a closing basis and look for bigger targets.


Understanding MACD

64,2018-07-24,Phosphorus Limited,"Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Equity Advisory, Motilal Oswal Securities, says he is expecting around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. He was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Do you believe UPL’s acquisition of Arysta Lifescience is going to be value accretive and the synergy realisation can provide a significant upside even after yesterday’s upmove in the stock?
UPL has a fantastic track record of acquiring overseas companies in last 20-25 years. They made 20-odd acquisitions in so many years. With Arysta, it will be increasing $3 billion worth of debt on UPL’s special purpose vehicle and that would be a dilution. Net debt to equity will go higher. How they will be able to service the debt, the interest cost on the debt is something needs to be watched.

There will be a bit of postponement. It will be there for the earnings over FY20-FY21. It is very much priced in and it is not going to be value accretive at this point in time for next one-one and a half years.


Talking about the big earnings which the market is going to be reacting to and besides ACC’s good numbers, one wonders what went wrong with United Spirits? How to explain that kind of muted volume growth?
There was high expectation that post highway ban, there would again be a significant jump in the quarter, but the premiumisation is not working well. The Prestige and other brands have shown a very tepid growth and the cost has also gone up significantly.

EBITDA has improved but margin is not improving and the EBITDA margin and the profit margin both are very much flattish. Topline is growing but bottom line is growing a little less -- 10% to 15%. Plus, the earnings volatility is such that it is unpredictable whether one quarter will be a good enough to show traction for profitability in FY19 or FY20 or any other financial year. It is just a flipflop kind of an earning trajectory. They are still struggling with trying to rationalise operations again the regulatory actions.


What could we expect from Asian Paints today given that it is the leader in the paints segment? It is the go-to story when it comes to paint stocks and the fact that the market is betting big on the segment especially after the GST rates are being cut?
Asian Paints has 60% odd market share in the paint industry. It is a dominant player. This quarter, Asian Paints could see a 10-15% kind of a growth. Crude volatility, which is a raw material margin, needs to be watched out for. Crude has now retraced back from 80 to odd 72-73 odd. That gives some kind of a breather for rest of the financial year. We expect around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. That means it can show further growth also.


In the metal story, do you think Hindalco, Tata Steel, Vedanta are buys even at the current levels?
Currency headwinds are almost there for the metal sector but trade war between the two elephants is showing a worrisome sign for these companies. Prices are declining day by day. Realisation will get hit for at least next one to two quarters and that is visible from here. Plus, we believe that the metal companies have done their capacity expansion to the fullest. Now there is not much of a scope there but if demand declines, then bad days will start for them. 

It is not a linear growth for metal stocks at any point in time throughout the year. With 100% capacity expansion, if demand slows down and price realisation is down, then they will have to suffer. However, with Hindalco, there is a different story. They have acquired Aleris and that is a different ball game. One can enter the stocks at around 8% to 10% correction. Even JSW Steel or Hindalco or Vedanta will provide a good opportunity in the longer term.


What is your perspective on mid-tier cement names? Cement is more of a regional play and if names like ACC are doing well, one can only extrapolate that some of the smaller companies will also see traction in their earnings. Would you agree?
I would say even UltraTech Cement has delivered in line with expectation. ACC is beyond comparison because traditionally, it is a very old plant and has had limited capacity expansion. Now the premium segment is picking up in ACC and so it is not comparable with others.

Irrespective of ACC cost per tonne has been reduced, the other cost has gone down and EBITDA has improved slightly, that does not mean that other midcap company which we are talking about is going to be performing better. It is a different ballgame for ACC at this point in time. We believe volume growth will be tepid enough. There will be 6% to 7% average volume growth for all the companies.

In midcaps, Birla Corp is something which needs to be watched out for in terms of results and ongoing for next one-one and a half year, the stock has corrected significantly and Reliance Cement which was the recent acquisition of one-one and a half year back, is running at 80% capacity. There are high chances that the stock can react to the positivity for next one-one and a half year. But it would be an investment perspective and not for trading. So for midcaps, almost 5% to 7% volume growth will be there in this quarterly numbers.


Beside earnings, this week is very critical in terms of a Nifty earnings composition. L&T, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Industries will report their numbers. Which ones are you looking out for and what is your expectation thereof?
This week, the result to watch out for would be ITC. We have to see where are its growth numbers and how the food and the non-cigarette business is shaping up. It can surprise positively rather than negative. 

In Hero MotoCorp, again a price war is taking place at the domestic level with Bajaj. The entry level segment will again be dampening the sentiment. It is not something which would be exciting.

Reliance needs to be watched to see how the margin will come up for this quarter and whether it has taken anything out of the crude advantage. On EBITDA front plus, Jio is doing very well and the retail needs to be watched. Maruti is our favourite."
65,2018-07-24,Phosphorus Limited,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy call on UPL with a target price of Rs 664.

The current market price of UPL is Rs 633.95.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when UPL price can reach the defined target. 


Valuation and view on the stock by Motilal Oswal Securities:
While the acquisition of Arysta would drive significant synergistic benefits (product portfolio expansion, strengthened presence in Europe and cost synergies on backward integration and efficiencies), it would also result in a highly leveraged balance sheet for UPLL. We note that UPPL trades at 8.9x FY18E EV/EBITDA, and the acquisition has taken place at 9.9x FY18 EV/EBITDA of Arysta (at an 11% premium to UPLL’s current valuation). However, UPLL acquired Arysta at CY17 EV/sales of 2.2x, which is at a 5% discount to valuation at which Platform Chemical acquired Arysta (USD3.5b in October 2014 at EV/sales of 2.33x CY13). Post-acquisition, not only FY20 EPS would shrink by ~8% (v/s our previous estimates), but also FY20 RoE would come down from 23.1% to 21.2%. Further, FY20 net D/E would jump from 0.1 to 1.5 and FY20 net debt to EBITDA would rise from 0.4 to 2.6. While we revise up our FY20 revenue and EBITDA estimate by 62% and 59% (building in financials of Arysta), respectively, we cut our FY20 PAT estimate by 8% (due to higher interest cost on increased debt). We, thus, cut our valuation multiple from 17x to 13x FY20E EPS and arrive at a TP of INR664 (+21% upside)."

Also, the index failed to hit its lifetime high of 11,171. However, the overall trend remained positive and supports gradually shifted higher. Now, it has to continue to hold above 11,080 to extend its move towards 11,171 and then 11,200 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 11,050 and then 11,000 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000, while maximum Call OI was at 11,200. There was Put writing at 11,050 and Call writing at 11,150, 11,200 and 11,250 levels.

The option band shifted its trading range to a higher band between 11,050 and 11,200 levels. India VIX fell 2.11 per cent to 12.20. The VIX has been falling for past five sessions and the decline along with rising Put-Call Ratio suggests Put writers have taken the market in their grip.

Bank Nifty formed an Inside Bar and traded in a tight range of 135 points ahead of the expiry of June derivative contracts. Now, it has to hold above 27,000 to witness an upward move towards 27,165 and then 27,250 levels, while on the downside, major support exists in the 26,800-26,750 range.

In Bank Nifty, major Put writing was seen in the 26,800-26,900 range, while maximum Call Open interest stood at 27,200.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 0.11 per cent at 11,129. Long buildup was seen in Havells, Pidilite Industries, Motherson Sumi, Petronet LNG, Tata Elxsi, Shriram Transport Finance, UPL, ONGC and Adani Ports while shorts were seen in Asian Paints, Eicher Motor, TVS Motor, Axis Bank, TechM, MindTree and NTPC.

66,2018-07-25,Phosphorus Limited,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the volatile trading session on a flat note on Wednesday as market participants turned cautious ahead of July futures and options (F&O) expiry amid mixed quarterly earnings.

The 30-share Sensex, which hit its fresh all-time high of 36,947.18 in early trade, closed 33.15 points, or 0.09 per cent, up at 36,858.23, while the 50-share Nifty index settled 2.30 points, 0.02 per cent, down at 11,132.

As many as 28 stocks in Nifty index closed in the red with NTPC, Lupin, HCL Technologies, Ultratech Cement and Axis Bank slipping up to 4 per cent. However, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bajaj Finserv, State Bank of India, UPL and Adani Ports advanced between 1.50 per cent and 4 per cent.

Barring metal, oil & gas and banking index on the BSE, other sectoral indices closed in red. The BSE Power, Realty, Telecom and Consumer Durables index lost up to 1.52 per cent.

On further movement in domestic equity markets, Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan said, “We feel that from here on earnings will play a major role in determining further upside. Factors such as global trade wars and upcoming general elections in India will keep investors cautious in the short term. However, the longer term picture for Indian equities looks positive and we continue to prefer sectors such as private banking, consumer discretionary, information technology and pharma. With the rupee hovering close to 69 mark we feel certain IT and pharma companies will benefit from these tailwinds.”

Elsewhere in Asia, Hang Seng and Nikkei gained up to 0.90 per cent, while Shanghai Composite, Kospi Composite and Taiwan Weighted dipped up to 0.32 per cent. Asian peers ended mixed on fears that the Bank of Japan will scale back stimulus next week. Investors also looked ahead to a key meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for directional cues."
68,2018-07-26,Phosphorus Limited,"UPL is an Indian company only in name and headquarters. It’s actually one of the biggest homegrown MNCs. And the Shroff at its helm is no less layered.

Over the course of a 25-year acquisitional pursuit, Jaidev ‘Jai’ Shroff always wanted the last word, even if it meant walking away from the negotiating table — be it over a valuation mismatch of just about $350 million or an insisted-on deal exclusivity.

But he made waves off the field in the midst of the recent World Cup when, after some frantic deal-making across the US and UK and even Moscow, he finally closed his biggest and boldest corporate manoeuvre yet.

UPL’s $4.2-billion buyout of Arysta LifeSciences — a company almost its own size — from Platform Specialty Products is transformational and could potentially throw up $5 billion in combined revenues and $1.2-billion annual Ebitda.

“Everyone knew this was a great fit for us so we kept the dialogue going during the last 10 years,” says Shroff, global chief executive of UPL, thumping the table with his palm enthusiastically. “But we were always willing to walk away if it didn’t make sense. We are very focused on return on our capital and wanted to do the deal on our own terms.”

This patience and discipline is precisely what Shashank Joshi, head, corporate banking, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, India, and a key lender to UPL — formerly United Phosphorous — in the transaction, found impressive about Shroff. “He did not get into a bidding war but closed the deal firmly within their valuation targets.”

If Tina Ambani is believed to have played cupid 18 years ago for Shroff’s second marriage, then a certain ‘Bengali Babaji’ is responsible its spectacular breakdown.

If his candid moments — with buddies and sizzling hot Russian models off the Aegean coast — are not plastered across Instagram and other social media, then his name is dragged into FT’s exposé of the now-infamous ‘alpha men only’ Presidents Club Charity Dinner held at the Dorchester in January this year.

But over the past two decades, Shroff has proved he is far more than mere flamboyance or a precocious third generation inheritor of his family’s business. He is as Reliance’s Nikhil Meswani calls him, “a trailblazer responsible for building one of India’s best MNCs.”


SEEDS OF SUCCESS
Today, UPL is the fifth-largest agrochemicals and crop protection company in the world, with 87% of revenues coming from an empire spanning 133 countries and 33 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries. “Jai is the architect of UPL’s success.

His father consolidated their position in India but Jai identified the core strengths, stuck to it and grew the business manifold through a series of bolt-on acquisitions (41, to be precise),” adds Meswani, a family friend for over two decades.

More importantly, Shroff has integrated all of them from markets as diverse as Brazil and Argentina to the US, Canada, France, Japan and Australia. And, of course, his latest, the most daring. “But he’s always had enough of it,” quips one of his peers.

With Arysta, UPL will become among the most profitable agrochemicals companies globally and the largest post-patents, getting access to new markets such as Eastern Europe, Russia and Africa and growing in Europe and Latin America. Scale will also enable stronger negotiating powers with farmers and trade channels.

“UPL will also get access to fast-growing segments of biosolutions and seeds treatment, where it does not have a presence,” Alok Dalal and Alok Srivastava, analysts with CLSA, point out.

Who can argue with such synergies and the significant opportunity to drive revenue growth from a broader portfolio and geographical presence and shared innovation capabilities?

UPL has been both, a price-setter and a disruptor, because of its command over supply chain. Shroff is able to undercut prices or shift out of Chinese suppliers as a tactic and grow market share. “If you combine Arysta’s asset-light, R&D-high business model with UPL’s low cost manufacturing and distribution heft, then in one shot, you are taking the competition right into the tents of the big boys,” explains one of his investors who did not wish to be quoted.

That’s strategic in a global scenario where just four companies – Bayer-Monsanto, Syngenta, BASF and Dow-DuPont — control 75% of the market on the back of unprecedented global mergers and acquisitions.

But with most of the large global corporations having a cookie-cutter approach to squeezing margins, a nimble, entrepreneurial company with deep customer relations can become a happy alternative.


BUCKING TRENDS
 UPL’s story is unique in various ways. The company started in 1969 as a producer of phosphorus-based industrial chemicals, import substitution being the prime driver.

There are several chemical companies today in India that are potentially at the same stage of product portfolio evolution as UPL was four decades ago! But UPL graduated to an agrochemicals focus, which helped with longer-term objectives. “We understand the business. We have not diversified beyond our core. We do take geographical risks but never financial ones or move away from our knitting,” says Shroff.

Throughout the mid-1990s, UPL concentrated on international, backed by manufacturing in India. “We soon realised we make more money overseas and it’s far more profitable. So we changed our focus,” he adds. “We were really businessto-business in the 1990s and built global scaled plants here to service the world. We revisited India only in the 2000s.”

“It was never easy to do business in India,” says Dipesh Shroff, former managing director of Excel Crop Care and part of the extended family, who sold his company to Sumitomo. “There was never any institutional support and very few focused to be innovators… Even Rajnikant Shroff had it tough initially.”

Yet UPL has always charted a different course than peers like Rallis. It was, to begin with, the earliest investor among Indian companies for product registrations in regulated markets. With close to 6,000 registrations in several global geographies, it has potentially invested more than the rest of the Indian players combined. Smaller players were deterred by capital and time consumption; it took UPL about three and a half years in the US, four to four and a half years in Europe and more than five in Japan.

“UPL understood the power of backward integration in agrochemicals throughout its journey,” says Vishal Agarwal, managing director, Shiva PharmaChem, a supplier to UPL. “In some years, when it became fashionable to be asset-light, UPL continued its investments in global manufacturing capabilities.

 Even now, it has embarked on a massive capex for a US plant. It has sizeable presence in the phosphorus value chain, several active ingredients and its own caustic chlorine capabilities. It has also moved into complex chemistry and molecules.”

The Shroffs learned, very early on, the need for direct presence in 40 countries, with their own sales and distribution giving them unparalleled access to market knowledge on the ground — which they use to their advantage while evaluating inorganic opportunities.

The rate of new product introductions was steadily declining; post patent products accounted for 61% of the world markets in 2015, compared to 30% in 2000. UPL rode the wave through consolidation opportunities to emerge as a global powerhouse like Adama Agricultural Solutions.

While Rallis and Excel limited themselves to India, UPL created a full suite of crop solutions, including seeds, for geographical diversification. That’s been a winning proposition as the narrative shifts towards food security on the back of a decrease in arable land and the need to increase yields.

Even peers in the Tata group privately acknowledge that UPL has achieved what the group’s doyen, Darbari Seth, had originally envisioned for Rallis.

“No Indian company has straddled seeds and the agrochemical value chain as well. The company surprised a lot of industry players by acquiring seeds company Advanta in 2006 and later merging it with the parent,” says Navroz Mahudawala, founder, Candle Partners, a boutique investment bank.


STRIKE IT RIGHT
Even then, the timing of the Arysta union stands out, coming as it does when most large Indian companies are struggling to manage their strained balance sheets or are looking inwards.

“UPL is probably the only Indian company to have an investment grade global business with top global industry rankings without support from the Indian parent entity. This is truly remarkable,” argues Joshi.

The momentum going strong over two decades shows “their ambition and single-minded motivation,” feels Ravi Raheja, group president, K Raheja Corp, another old family friend. “That’s their biggest achievement.”

Each deal has added a strategic piece to the puzzle and to the overall confidence levels, says Vikram Shroff, Jai’s brother and executive director in charge of dayto-day operations and HR.

If MTM in the UK was the first international acquisition, in 1994, to enter Europe and the herbicide portfolio, Devrinol, gave them a toehold in the US and Japan two years later. RiceCo, a crop focused acquisition helped leverage global sales and marketing network in taking product offerings to global rice markets while Reposo in Argentina and DVA Agro and SIB in Brazil – the single largest country market – gave market access.

“Their secret to success lies in air miles. Jai is tremendously hands-on, yet focused on the big picture strategy and business development, travelling 15-20 days a month,” says fellow Gujarat industrialist Siddharth Jain, director of Inox Group, whose group company Gujarat Fluorochemicals has business relationships with UPL.



GLOBAL INDIAN
 “I live on planes,” Jaidev accepts. “If you want to be successful, you need to be 200% committed and lead by example.” From dealing with trade unions in France to large agriculture distributors in Brazil, banana plantation owners in Costa Rica or innovators in Japan — the secret is accepting global cultures without imposing your own. “It’s in our DNA to work with foreigners,” says Jaidev.

Rarely does the company export Indian expat talent and let the locals manage the regions, even post acquisition, they are under the hawk eye of the central management in India. The Cerexagri senior management, for instance, continues to work in senior position even after 11 years, with some like its business head stepping up to become the global manufacturing head for the entire group.

“Post-acquisition, the formation of integration teams typically have equal members from both companies,” says Vikram. “Senior members from acquired companies have occupied several key positions in UPL. From European acquisitions, we have a person heading one of our US business while two Brazilian senior team members are heading the US business and one of the global verticals. Even the global HR network are locals.”

Blips such as the payment crisis in Argentina, labour in Europe, negotiations with large farmer and distributor lobby groups in Brazil, coups in African countries and volatile currencies haven’t fazed the company yet.

Jai Shroff even recalls concluding a deal in Denmark in 24 hours flat, 22 years ago when the founder of Agrodan gave a stiff ‘do-or-disappear’ deadline. Even at home, old-timers remember the family defaulting on promoter warrants, which led to the stock tanking. For Jaidev, it was baptism by fire when in 1986, they faced a crisis after one of their big distributors went belly up. “So I went around collecting money directly from dealers,” he says nonchalantly.

Financial conservatism, therefore, comes naturally and that is evident — from hedging forex risks to unstretched balance sheets. UPL has raised $3 billion from banks at 4% for five years, which is cheaper than the bond market.



Leverage will rise sharply in the short term, but Jaidev is confident this “acquisition will be paid off in three years.” Analysts such as Amrit Murarka of Deutsche Bank like the fact that while UPL is paying 9.9x the FY18 EV/Ebitda to buy 100% of Arysta, it has partly funded it ($1.2 billion) by giving a 22% in subsidiary UPL Corporation, the international arm used as the acquisition vehicle, at 12.3x EV/Ebitda.

Even then, integrating bite-sized acquisitions is far simpler than marrying two different contrasting cultures of similar size and scale. Arysta built its agrochemicals business through M&A of Chemtura, Agriphar and Arysta Life Sciences – but has only now been able to consolidate. As an industry player puts it, “People management can make or break this.” Even his deep-pocketed rivals won’t sit tight and UPL needs to calibrate its strategy to deal with the industry flux.

Many would even argue that Jaidev needs a professional chief executive. “He is thinking strategy, business development and manufacturing, meeting stakeholders all over the world. At some stage, he will run out of bandwidth,” says another family friend. And that brings us back to his lifestyle.

Associates say his reputation is compartmentalised away from work. In fact, as Raheja puts it, “It often works to his advantage. Let people under estimate him at their own peril.”



Jaidev argues, “Should one be successful and boring… I do not want to be a boring boy. It’s not necessarily good. I don’t think people invest in boring companies.” His father apparently once told him when he was starting out, “Don’t think it will work out eventually, but do give it a shot.” As always, Jai Shroff has the last word."
69,2018-07-28,Phosphorus Limited,"The domestic equity market witnessed a euphoric rally, albeit a fractured one, in recent times, making everyone envy about not owning largecap stocks. Typically, this is called the Fifth Wave in terms of Elliott Wave theory, when there is a large divergence in the market breadth. Factually, only 54 per cent of the total stocks are trading above their 200 DMAs, which is the second lowest in a decade post the 2008 top, when 52 per cent of the total stocks traded above their 200 DMAs.

This further confirms the Fifth Wave theory. Many stocks did not participate in the rally and lagged the broader market; whether these laggards will move up eventually is a big question now. But by the time the Fifth Wave ends, majority of the laggards would have again gone south. One should, therefore, trade in the laggards with stop losses, as this seems to be the most sensible strategy in the current situation.

Some companies posted stellar numbers this week, with JSW Steel delivering 275 per cent profit growth aided by strong demand, ITC clocking a robust 10 per cent PAT growth after weak results over the past few quarters, Biocon showing strong growth at 47% and Colgate Palmolive delivering a strong bottomline growth at 39 per cent. These quarterly numbers were key triggers for the market to touch new highs this week.


Events of the Week:
Hindalco’s acquisition of Aleris at about $2.6 billion was the talk of the town this week. It might look rosy at first glance, but when you look at it closely, such high debt levels in a commodity-type business are always risky. Similar large ticket acquisitions such as Tata Steel’s acquisition of Bhushan Steel and UPL’s acquisition of Arysta LifeScience are all highly risky investments.

Investors should remain cautious and not forget that similar hype during the Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy acquisition and what happened to them post-merger.


Technical OutlookThe Nifty50 has broken all resistance levels and is in a new price territory. The movement should last unless it reverses; if the Nifty50 slips below 11,100, then it shall be a major reversal for the entire market. But till such times, the bulls should remain long and buy on decline. The Nifty IT index has lost its upward velocity and is, therefore, beginning to enter a corrective phase. Traders should focus on stock-specific movements. For buy positions, stop loss should be placed below 11,100 for capital protection.

Expectations for the Week
The third bimonthly monetary policy may do nothing to change the mood of the market next week. This time around, interest rates are expected to remain the same given that inflation is under control and US interest rates are range-bound.

The buoyancy in the market is expected to remain for some more time aided by encouraging corporate numbers, which will justify high valuations. At this euphoric stage, investors must avoid sectors such as IT, FMCG, cyclical commodity and private sector banks for some time, as they are trading at high valuations. One can choose to enter realty, pharma, PSU banks, cement, aviation and OMCs for a medium-term investment horizon.

The Nifty50 closed the week at new highs of 11,278, up by 2.43 per cent."

I have purchased 15,000 shares of Ruchi Soya Rs 15.31 and 3,300 shares of Idea at Rs 62.45. What should I do at this price level?—DEEPAK KARNA
You may hold Ruchi Soya for now, but sell if the stock comes close to your cost price as the company is making huge losses and, its debt and other liabilities exceed current asset by over Rs 10,000 crore. I am not confident that the value of fixed assets including intangible assets are worth substantially more than Rs 10,000 crore. Hold Idea Cellular if you are willing to wait for more than 2 years. Else, sell it close to your cost price. I firmly believe that in the long term, this oligopolistic market of mobile telecom business would stabilise its margins and start growing profits in a stable manner.


I am holding 50 shares of Lupin at an average price of Rs 768, 50 shares of Glenmark Pharma at Rs 596, 500 shares of Alankit at Rs 26.90. Please guide me what should I do.—UTPAL KUMAR GIRI
Hold both Glenmark Pharma and Lupin as these pharmaceutical companies were beaten down badly in the last 18 months and now they trade at reasonable valuation. While Glenmark could reach a target of Rs 650, Lupin could move beyond Rs 1,050 in 12 to 18 months. A series of product approvals it received form the US FDA and biosimilar business in Japan offer significant profit growth potential in the long term for Lupin. Considering significant business growth over the last four years and quite attractive balance sheet with least debt and good amount of cash, you may hold Alankit with a short to medium term target price of around Rs 32.


I have bought 20 shares of India Hotel at price of Rs 147. And its current value is Rs 132.75. I bought UPL at the price of Rs 726.80 and currently it is trading around Rs 634 apiece. Please guide me. —RAHUL GANGURDE
Sell Indian Hotel in the price range of Rs 150 to Rs 160 and buy back whenever it falls back to below Rs 120 level. It is part of good management and holds rich real estate assets in the forms of hotels, but its valuation remains too stretched. If UPL stock moves up close to Rs 700, sell it. The company has taken a bold move to grow inorganically at the global level through acquisitions. However, for retail investors, it is better not to take any possible risk as expansion of debt and dilution of equity are quite substantial for this company in the process.

15,2018-08-08,Phosphorus Limited,"Mumbai: MUFG and Rabo Bank have initiated a $3-billion financing programme for United Phosphorus Ltd (UPL) to fund its purchase of Arysta LifeScience Inc, the largest outbound M&A by an Indian company since the 2008 global financial meltdown. The issue to finance the buyout of the US-based crop protection services firm was launched Tuesday in Hong Kong and Singapore.

More than two-dozen banks are in talks with the two underwriters, including Barclays, Citigroup, JP Morgan, BNP, ANZ and DBS, besides domestic lenders such as SBI, ICICI, HDFC, Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter told ET. Individual banks could not be contacted immediately for comments.

The facility would have a five-year shelf life and would be priced after adding a spread of about 150 basis points to the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR), sources said.

The loans will be provided by pledging the balance sheet of Arysta LifeScience. Shares of UPL will be provided as additional collateral.

In July, UPL signed a definitive agreement to buy Arysta LifeScience Inc, the agrochemicals business of Platform Specialty Products Corp, for $4.2 billion in cash. After the acquisition, UPL will become the world’s fifth largest agrochemical company.

As per the agreement, UPL will acquire Arysta Life through its subsidiary, UPL Corp, by taking a debt of $3 billion, while the balance equity stake will be equally funded by investments of $600 million each by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and private equity firm TPG. MUFG, formerly Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, and Rabo Bank had committed to help fund the acquisition.

UPL Corporation raised $300 million through dollar-denominated bonds in March.

The total debt of UPL stood at Rs 6,507 crore in FY18, an increase of 7.4 per cent YoY.

“We take comfort in UPL’s inorganic track record but acknowledge execution risk that an asset of this scale could pose,” Citigroup analysts Prashant Nair, Daniel Jester and Vivek Agrawal said in a note on July 22. “We believe this deal can create significant value over the next few years. Execution is however critical, given deal size and high debt burden.”

Acquisition financing has been one of the major income sources for global banks as M&A deals hit a record high in 2018.

“The enthusiasm from Indian banks is surprising,” said one of the sources involved in the negotiations. “Domestic banks are not allowed into acquisition funding if it is an in-bound deal, meaning buyout of domestic companies. But they are permitted to fund outbound overseas deals. So, most of the top banks are jumping into it,” he said.

The value of M&A deals announced globally hit a record at $2.5 trillion in the first half of 2018, up 64 per cent compared to the same period in 2017, and the strongest year-to-date period since records began in 1980, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters."

24,2018-08-10,Phosphorus Limited,"Corporate India announced merger and acquisition deals worth USD 8.7 billion in July this year, following which the deal tally for the first seven months of this year stood at USD 74.16 billion, says a report.

According to Grant Thornton's M&A Dealtracker there were 49 M&A deals worth USD 8.71 billion in July, a nearly 22 fold increase on a year-on-year basis, driven by two large outbound acquisitions valuing over USD 1 billion each.

In the January-July period, there were 284 M&A deals worth USD 74.18 billion, primarily on account of revived domestic and cross-border deal activity, witnessing an increase of over seven times in deal values.

The year so far has registered 12 deals in the billion-dollar category and 33 deals valued at and over USD 100 million each.

The telecom, e-commerce, manufacturing, energy, agriculture, banking and IT sectors led the deal activity, capturing 94 per cent of the total deal values in the January-July period.

The start-up sector dominated the deal volumes with a 21 per cent share followed by manufacturing and IT together contributing 25 per cent.

""The deal activity is expected to be bullish for the rest of the year. M&A activities will be primarily driven by a strategic push in the board rooms to achieve scale within both domestic markets and global markets and also to increase product offerings in line with technological developments. Conclusion of the IBC process will also catalyse the deal momentum,"" Pankaj Chopda, Director, Grant Thornton India LLP said.

In July UPL Ltd's acquisition of Arysta Lifescience Inc for USD 4.2 billion was the largest outbound deal in the agriculture sector and otherwise till date. The sector led the deal activity with 48 per cent of the total M&A deal values.

The month of July also recorded seven deals valued at and above USD 100 million each.

The report noted that the absence of big ticket deals in July 2017 on account of GST implementation also supported the surge in the deal values in 2018."

25,2018-08-11,Phosphorus Limited,"Suhasini Maniratnam has played many roles as one of the top heroines in South India — from a vivacious girl in a hill station to an old woman on her last pilgrimage. Still, her new role is rather unusual: she is the honorary consul of Luxembourg, a country with a population of around 600,000, in Chennai. Her many duties involve a very sombre one: if a Luxembourger were to die in Chennai, she has to shut the coffin and lock it before sending it off to the small country in northwest Europe.

Her responsibilities, surely, go beyond the sepulchral. Maniratnam, one of the 215 honorary consuls in India, is responsible for the citizens of Luxembourg and has been helping to forge links between the South Indian and European film industries. Honorary consuls are not career diplomats. They are usually citizens of the host country, where they live, work and pay taxes. They are designated by a foreign government to look after the affairs of its citizens.

It is not just a former star that is on the list of honorary consuls in India. According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), they include high-profile businesspeople — Dabur India chairman Vivek Burman is the honorary consul general of Nicaragua in Delhi, founder and chairman emeritus of Max Group Analjit Singh is honorary consul of San Marino in Delhi, and Aditya Birla Group director Rajashree Birla is honorary consul general of the Philippines in Mumbai.




Honorary consuls often don’t get any remuneration from the sending state, so what makes the post attractive? It is more than the privilege of flying the flag of the country they represent on their cars. R Dayakar, a retired Indian diplomat, says, “Honorary consuls get an opportunity to promote commercial and trade ties and enjoy an added social recognition.” They also have access to senior government officials and the global diplomatic community.

KL Ganju, a former Delhi exporter, is an honorary consul general of Comoros, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, since 2005. He is the only diplomatic representative of the Francophone nation in India.“The president of Comoros himself met me and invited me to take on the role of honorary consul,” says Ganju, who has over the years gone well beyond his brief to forge stronger relations between India and Comoros, which is located strategically in the Mozambique Channel. 


 “Of late, many students from Comoros have started coming to India. I work as their local guardian,” he says. He also helps patients from Comoros who come to India for specialised treatment. In 2012, at the behest of the Indian government, he also played an important role as a negotiator, facilitating Comoros’ entry into the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC).

However, it’s not just smaller countries that depend on honorary consuls. Rajive Kaul, chairman of Kolkata-based Nicco, has been the honorary consul general of the Republic of Korea in eastern India since 1998. “Though none of the Korean companies has large projects in eastern India yet, I consider the opening of the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Kolkata last year as one of my biggest successes,” says Kaul, who is responsibile for looking after Korean assets and people in India’s eastern states.


 Germany has appointed honorary consuls in Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Goa. “With an increasing presence of German companies and learning institutions across India, honorary consuls, who have an intimate knowledge of local conditions, are invaluable in strengthening relations,” says German ambassador to India Martin Ney. BVR Mohan Reddy, founder and executive chairman of engineering services company Cyient, is the honorary consul of Germany for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. He helps expedite the visa application process of Indian students going to Germany.

“I am delighted to see so many youngsters from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana going to Germany,” says Reddy.

The process of finding a suitable candidate for the position of an honorary consul is rather tough. While there are international consultancy firms that specialise in helping people get honorary consular appointments, a candidate could be directly approached by the foreign service of a country. MEA’s approval is essential before the formal appointment.

Nils Ragnar Kamsvag, Norwegian ambassador to India, says, “For Norway, honorary consuls are often tied to a business that has a natural connection to Norwegian companies, such as shipping.” Arvind Gopinath has been Norway’s honorary consul in Chennai for the last 18 years. “My family has strong links with the shipping industry. Many Norwegian companies have been recruiting crew from South India and I provide them with certificates of endorsement before they send in applications,” he says.

Arun Vasu, chairman of Chennaibased TT Group, which runs diverse businesses, is the honorary consul of Sweden for South India. His mother, from whom he took over responsibilities, is Swedish. “As kids, we have had the privilege of visiting Sweden every summer,” says Vasu, whose responsibilities include assisting any Swede in India who requires help in an emergency and in addressing trade enquiries.

Rajju Shroff, who has been honorary consul of Mexico in Mumbai since 1998, is the executive chairman of agricultural products company UPL that has large business interests in Mexico. He is bullish about trade and commercial ties between the two countries. “Our consulate goes out of the way to help Mexican tourists in India. Besides, Mexico too is an attractive tourist destination,” he says.

It is an interesting role in the diplomatic community, as foreign assets in home country."

40,2018-08-17,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Private equity investments witnessed a positive trend in both value and volume terms, with 81 deals garnering $2.1 billion in July driven by big ticket deals.

According to a Grant Thornton report, following the significant uptrend in July PE investments, the deal tally for the first seven months of this year totalled at $11.51 billion, up 20 per cent over the year ago period, thanks to increased appetite for big ticket funding by companies to fuel their expansion plans.

""PE deals recorded a robust 37 percent and 72 percent increase in volumes and values respectively in July 2018 as compared to July 2017,"" Grant Thornton India LLP Director Pankaj Chopda said.

He further said that large ticket investments to support cross-border acquisition and in focused sectors drove the investments and start-ups, real estate, e-commerce, and pharma, healthcare and biotech were the key sectors juring July.

Going forward deal activity is expected to be bullish for the rest of the year.

""Significant amount of dry powder among global private equity firms and positive reforms in sectors' potential of yielding high returns is expected to make India Inc a favourable destination for PE investments,"" Chopda said.

A sectorwise analysis showed that start-ups dominated investment landscape as this space accounted for 57 percent of total investment volumes.

Fintech and data analytics and AI were the active segments with six deals each, followed by the retail and discovery platform space with five investments each.

To fund the largest acquisition of Arysta Lifescience Inc, UPL Ltd raised USD 1.2 billion, marking the largest funding so far in 2018.

The report further noted that sectors such as real estate, e commerce and pharma also attracted investments of over $100 million, indicating an encouraging trend."
46,2018-08-20,Phosphorus Limited,"It took seven months for NSE’s Nifty index to move from 11,000 to 11,500 level. This period remained highly volatile for the domestic equity market amid trade war tensions, sustained outflow of foreign portfolio money, rising crude oil prices and a depreciating local currency. 

After scaling the 11,000 mark for the first time on January 23, the index hit a low of 9,951 on March 23. However, buying in 22 index stocks took it above 11,500 on August 20.

Shares of Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have rallied 67 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, since January 23. Twenty other blue chips – HUL, TCS, M&M, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank and ITC – have rallied between 10 per cent and 30 per cent during this period. 

In terms of valuation, the index is looking expensive compared with its long-term moving average. The 50-share index traded at a P/E of over 28 times on Monday compared with its 10-year average of 20.90. 

Basant Maheshwari, Co-Founder & Partner Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers LLP in a tweet said, “Comparing the average Nifty P/E across stocks is like comparing the average salaries of a scientist, doctor, engineer and part-time gardeners & drivers – high quality secular growth and low quality cyclicals. Nifty has more scientists, doctors, engineers now, than it did 20 years back.”

Among other Nifty stocks, GAIL, YES Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, Eicher Motors, Titan, Cipla, Axis Bank, HCL Technologies and HDFC have gained up to 10 per cent since January 23. 

On the other hand, Tata Motors, Vedanta, HPCL, Bharti Airtel and UPL slipped up to 38 per cent between January 23 and August 17.

The BSE Sensex also hit a fresh record high of 38,266 in early trade on Monday. Gains in capital goods, metals, realty and banking stocks amid firm Asian cues aided the market. 

From a valuation perspective, analysts are not too comfortable with the current level of the market.

Even though the Sensex typically trades at a premium to its peers, it is currently trading at a higher-than-normal premium relative to its emerging market (EM) peers. For instance, from a five-year average perspective, India typically traded at a premium of 18 per cent to the median P/E of nine emerging markets. However, today India trades at a whopping 37 per cent premium to median P/E of EMS, Ambit Capital said in its recent report.

The 30-share index currently trades at a 21 per cent premium to its 10-year average P/E ratio, Ambit said.

The recent rally in the stock market has more support from domestic flows than FIIs. On a year-to-date basis, foreign portfolio investors have taken out some Rs 1300 crore, while domestic institutional investors have poured in more than Rs 68,300 crore.

“Many emerging markets, maybe not so much in India, are under severe distress. I’m talking about some very high-growth economies, like those in Eastern Europe. And we have economies like Poland, which are doing well. Yet, these stock markets relative to the US are at multi-decade lows. Liquidity in markets like the Philippines and Indonesia has completely dried up. India has been fortunate that it has had a domestic investor base, which has kept the market humming,” New York-based investor and author Ruchir Sharma told ET in an interview."

We feel that themes such as consumption and retail will do well with both urban and rural areas fuelling future growth. However a weakening rupee and higher crude oil prices pose a threat to Indian markets in the short term. IT and pharma may continue to see some buying interest due to a weaker rupee. We like stocks such as Arvind limited in the consumption space and Shoppers Stop from the retailing space.”

31,2018-09-17,Phosphorus Limited,"Assets and liabilities are the two major components of business accounting. A business that has more assets compared to liabilities is considered financially sound. 

On the other hand a company whose liabilities grow faster than its assets becomes susceptible to the risk of bankruptcy.

Liabilities can be classified into balance sheet liabilities and contingent liabilities. Balance sheet liabilities include long-term borrowings, trade payables (creditors) and short-term loans for working capital requirements. On the other hand, contingent liabilities are those that may occur in the future and are subject to the outcome of an uncertain event—pending lawsuits, tax disputes or patent infringements.

These liabilities are not included in the balance sheet due to their uncertain nature. These are mentioned in the footnotes or notes to the financial statements section. Data for the past five years, starting 2013-14 for companies with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore shows a significant relationship between contingent liabilities and share prices. 

Companies whose contingent liabilities as a percentage of total balance sheet liabilities have increased in the past five years have delivered an average point to point returns of 109.15% between 6 September 2013 and 7 September 2018. 


Banking and infra sectors top the list
India Inc.’s contingent liabilities stood at Rs 93.2 lakh crore in 2017-18. Some 92% of these belong to the banking sector.
 
Note: Sector-wise contingent liabilities, denoted by bar graphs, are as a percentage of their balance sheet liabilities
On the other hand, companies whose contingent liabilities as a percentage of total balance sheet liabilities have declined in the past five years have delivered of 685.3%. BSE500 index delivered 126.7% returns during the same period. Companies with falling contingent liabilities have outperformed the market by more than 5-times whereas those with rising contingent liabilities have underperformed the market.

However, it is imperative to understand the nature of contingent liabilities as such liabilities may help some companies in the long run. For example, some auto companies offer customers repair and replacements of auto parts within a specified period. Such liabilities may prove costly for the companies in the short run but they help them build the brand image and boost consumer confidence over a period of time. The notes to financial statements clearly mentions the source of such liabilities and investors should look at the quantum and time period of such liabilities while analysing stocks.

Let us look at seven stocks with declining contingent liabilities and with the highest upside potential according to the Bloomberg consensus target price.


1. Camlin Fine Sciences : Robust growth in high-margin business



The company is engaged in the fine chemicals business and provides antioxidants and shelf life extensions, aroma ingredients and performance chemical products. 



Emkay Research is bullish on the stock due to the robust growth in the high-margin blends business and improved operational performance. Its US business is expected to turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2018-19.


2. NCC : Cost controls, better order mix to drive performance



This construction company focuses on urban infrastructure projects such as development of residential and commercial complexes, serviced apartments, SEZs, integrated townships and longterm infrastructure projects that offer stable revenue streams.



 IIFL brokerage house believes that the company’s better order book mix, tight cost control and rising scale of operations are likely to drive operational performance in the future. Moreover, exit from the international business will help NCC to curtail losses at the net level.


3. Kalpataru Power Trans: Return ratios set to improve



It's a diversified conglomerate engaged in global power transmission and engineering, procurement and construction. Its solutions include designing, testing, fabrication, erection and construction of transmission lines, oil and gas infrastructure and railways projects on a turnkey basis.

4. Somany Ceramics : Value-added products hold promise



Manufacturer and marketer of tiles, sanitary ware and bath fittings, Somany’s products include ceramic tiles, floor tiles, polished vitrified tiles, digital tiles, wall tiles and wall claddings. 



SKP Securities is bullish on the stock due to the company’s focus on value-added products and modernisation of its manufacturing facilities, coupled with a structural shift towards organised players after the implementation of E-way Bill. Improved disposable income for lifestyle consumption, rapid urbanisation, and the government’s thrust on housing for all will be key growth drivers going forward


5. Allcargo Logistics : Investment in contract logistics to sustain growth



The company provides integrated logistics solutions for Multimodal Transport Operations (MTO), container freight stations, and project and engineering solutions. It has reported decent numbers in the first quarter of 2018-19 with revenue growth of 9.5%, led by surging growth in the MTO segment. 



According to a report by Narnolia, the company’s aggressive investments in contract logistics business will provide sustainable growth in the long run.


6. NRB Bearings: Strong growth in OEM volumes, revival in exports



Manufacturer of ball and roller bearings, NRB offers solutions not only to the auto sector, but across all mobility applications. 



HDFC securities is bullish on the stock due to strong volume growth in OEMs, revival in exports, led by a recovery in the North-American and European truck markets, improvement in operating margin led by increasing presence in high margin exports business, operating leverage benefits and reduction in debt along with fall in interest costs.


7. UPL: Rising foodgrain demand and exports to drive growth



The company is engaged in the business of agrochemicals, industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and specialty chemicals. India’s crop protection industry is likely to grow fast due to decreasing per capita availability of arable land.

32,2018-09-17,Phosphorus Limited,"After a brief correction that brought some sanity to the market, investors are back to chasing growth stocks. They are ready to pay any price for companies where growth is clearly visible. 

As a result, valuations have reached stratospheric levels. For instance, Page Industries, which notched up an impressive 21% compounded annual growth in net profits in the past three years, is trading at a PE of nearly 100.

Astral Poly Technik, which saw profits grow at a compounded rate of 32%, is trading at 70 times its earnings per share. If the stock is of good quality, should one look at the valuation? After all, a good quality stock will always command a hefty premium. “If you are right on the growth part, a slightly higher valuation would not do harm. For example, HDFC Bank was quoting around 25 PE in its initial years and ignoring it because it was valued higher than other banks would have been a big mistake,” says Manish Sonthalia, CIO – Equity PMS, Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund. 

Even so, investors are paying too high a premium for quality right now. Even a good stock can be a bad investment at a very high price. You won’t make money from these stocks if you buy them at unreasonable prices. It is what experts call, Growth At Stupid Prices or GASP. 

We looked at five stocks that could leave you gasping for breath. Most analysts expect them to churn out poor returns in the next 12 months.


These high quality growth stocks could lead to losses
Most analysts have given a thumbs down to these growth stocks trading at very high valuations
 Data as on 14 Sep 2018; Source: Bloomberg & ETIG database
The market has become very polarised. While some stocks have performed well and become overvalued, many others are still underowned and undervalued. “This trend could reverse partially and there could be a reduction in quality premium once the core and cyclical sectors provide better visibility,” says Deepak Jasani, Head of Research, HDFC Securities. “This kind of distortion happens only once in 3-4 years and offers an opportunity to adopt a new strategy,” adds Sailesh Raj Bhan, Deputy CIO – Equity Investments, Reliance Mutual Fund.


Growth at reasonable pricesWhen the market is close to its all-time high level, it is not easy to find growth stocks that have not touched the stratosphere. “Barring few PSUs, most other growth stocks are quoting at very high valuations and therefore, won’t fit into the GARP strategy,” says Sankaran Naren, Executive Director and CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund. ET Wealth took a deep dive and identified seven high quality growth stocks that are still quoting at reasonable prices.

We first shortlisted companies that were reasonably large (market cap and revenue of at least Rs 1,000 crore each) and boasted a decent traded volume (average daily traded value of at least Rs 10 lakh). Next, we shortlisted companies that reported at least 15% compounded annual growth in their net profits during the past one year and threeyear periods.

Once this was done, we weeded out companies that are not expected to report at least 15% net profit growth in the coming year. These estimates are based on consensus analyst expectations. To make this future net profit figure more meaningful, we restricted our search to stocks that were covered by at least 10 analysts. To make sure that the growth in net profit was business-led and not an aberration, we also imposed a 5% restriction on revenues for all the time periods.


The valuation challengeThe main challenge was that many growth stocks were quoting at exorbitant valuations. “It is difficult to find GARP companies from consumer facing sectors now because there is clear earnings visibility (contrary to other sectors) and everyone is chasing these 60-80 stocks,” says Jasani. Most of the GASP stocks are consumer facing companies. Some value has emerged in the infra space after the correction in the mid- and small cap segments.

Valuation is not an absolute number and depends on the growth rate of a company. Valuation will be higher for companies with higher growth rates. One solution to this problem is to link valuation (measured by PE) with the growth and create a new PE to growth (PEG) ratio. And as a thumb rule, experts say a PEG ratio below 1 is reasonable valuation. You can calculate PEG ratio based on historical growth or forward growth. We have done this for both the historical growth as well as the expected future growth and shortlisted companies only where both PEG ratios were less than 1.

But one needs to be extra careful while using the PEG ratio. It gets compressed when the current or expected growth rate is very high. For example, if the current or expected growth rate is 80%, a company quoting at a PE of 70 will also look reasonable. “PEG ratio below 1 is reasonable when the expected future growth is reasonable. If the expected growth is very high (50-60%),investors should insist on a lower PEG ratio because the company won’t be able to sustain very high growth rates for the long term,” warns Bhan. 

Taking this as a caution, we have eliminated companies where the PEG ratio is below 1 because of the very high current or expected growth rates (defined as growth rate above 30%). Our study threw up eight companies. Since one of them, Escorts is also the Pick of the Week, the remaining seven stocks are covered here. 


Also Read: Stock pick of the week: Promise of long-term growth makes Escorts a top buy 

A word of caution: the broad market valuation is still very high and therefore, a short-term correction will also affect these GARP stocks. “Valuation depends on several factors and interest rate is one of them. Interest rates are hardening globally and PE multiples are compressing and this can be an issue in the near term,” says Sonthalia.


1. Jamna Auto Industries
“Jamna Auto is a key beneficiary of the shift in commercial vehicle demand towards high tonnage vehicles (leading to higher margins and realisations).” Deepak Jasani, Head of Research, HDFC Securities.
 
The market has already started rewarding Jamna Auto for its high historical and future growth rates. This explains why the stock has outperformed the Sensex by almost 38% in the past one year, despite a 33% correction in its price during the past six months. In addition to the recent correction in the stock price, experts are bullish on this counter for its improving fundamentals. 

First, it has benefitted from the structural changes happening in the commercial vehicles space. “Jamna Auto is a key beneficiary of the shift in commercial vehicle demand towards high-tonnage vehicles (parabolic springs and lift axle will witness enhanced demand, resulting in higher margins and realisations),” says Deepak Jasani, Head of Research, HDFC Securities.



Secondly, the recent correction was triggered by the government’s decision to allow higher axle load for existing vehicles. Though this may reduce the demand for medium and heavy commercial vehicles, its impact will be in the short term and could affect Jamna Auto’s revenues only for the next one or two quarters. Third, the company is also planning to de-risk its business by expanding into aftermarkets and introducing new product segments (lift axles, air suspension). Its focus is on the replacement exports market, which is growing by around 15% in volume terms. However, investors should note that commercial vehicles is a cyclical business and therefore, need to time their exit as well.


2. Kalpataru Power
“Due to strong order inflow and its bulging order book, Kalpataru Power’s revenue is expected to grow by 16.2% CAGR between 2017-18 and 2019-20.” Recent research report by ICICI Direct.
 
Part of the real estate developer Kalpataru Group, this company is into design, testing, fabrication, erection and construction of transmission lines, oil and gas infrastructure and railways projects on a turnkey basis. In addition to improving prospects from the power transmission business, there is a strong order inflow from railways, road BOT projects and pipeline businesses. 



Its order book increased by 41% y-o-y in the first quarter of 2018-19, giving it clear revenue visibility for coming years. There is also significant improvement in the performance of its subsidiaries like JMC Projects. More importantly Shubham Logistics, which has reported a loss of Rs 10.4 crore during first quarter of 2017-18, has reported a modest profit of Rs 60 lakh during Q1 of 2018-19. Kalpataru Power has also established presence in more than 50 countries and should, therefore, benefit from the recent depreciation in the rupee.


3. KEC International
“KEC International’s earnings growth is expected to continue for the next 2-3 years due to higher margins and its fast growing order book.” Rupesh Sankhe, Power and Capital Goods Analyst, Reliance Securities.
 
The flagship company of the RPG group, KEC International has a presence in 100 countries across Africa, Americas, Central Asia, Middle East, South Asia and South East Asia. In addition to the 28% underperformance against the Sensex in the past one year, its investment worthiness has also increased due to improving fundamentals.



First, the government’s UDAY scheme has helped state electricity boards and they have in turn increased their capital expenditure, leading to bigger orders for players like KEC. KEC’s order book has hit an all-time high of Rs 18,200 crore (1.8 x of 2017-18 revenues). Since KEC is favourably placed (it is the lowest bidder) in other orders worth Rs 3,180 crore, its order book is expected to bulge further in the coming quarters. Second, concentrating only on high margin orders has led to significant margin expansion during the past four years.


4. CESC
“We reiterate that the pending demerger could enhance value and remains a potential trigger for the CESC stock.” Recent Research report by Edelweiss
 
While CESC’s core business (power generation and distribution) is going on smoothly, CESC has been forced to split its core business into separate power generation and distribution companies due to regulatory issues. After the split, the management wants to focus more on the distribution business with low capex. This strategy should boost its profitability in the coming years. Since the entity is facing conglomerate discount (when the total value of a firm is less than its sum of parts), the management wants to split the company further. Most experts are bullish on the demerger plans of this Sanjiv Goenka Group company. Some of its subsidiaries such as First Source.



Solutions and Spencers are also doing well. The prospects for Spencer’s have improved after the decision to close down unviable stores. It has already broken even at the EBITDA level and is expected to break even at PAT level in the next 12-18 months.


5. Indiabulls Housing Finance
“Indiabulls Housing’s stage III assets were broadly similar to gross NPAs. So, there is no other earmarked stress pool. This will result in credit costs falling to 20-25 bps.” Recent research report by Edelweiss.
 Indiabulls Housing has underperformed the Sensex by about 25% in the past one year. However, there is no change in its fundamentals. The company has been reporting around 30% earnings CAGR and a similar rate is expected in the coming year as well. Since there was no negative surprise despite the shift to Indian Accounting Standards or Ind-AS, experts are hopeful that Indiabulls Housing will sustain its earnings momentum and improvements in key ratios like return on equity in future. The housing loan demand continues to soar due to the government’s push of ‘housing for all by 2022’.



Indiabulls Housing is also protecting its margin by regular hikes in loan rates to offset the increased funding costs. More importantly, there is no let up in its asset quality due to its strict risk management systems. Analysts feel this will bring down its credit costs.


6. UPL
“The acquisition of Arysta is likely to be value accretive if UPL realises 30% of targeted synergy. No worry about details because Arysta is part of a listed company” Aditya Jhawar, Analyst, Investec Capital Services.
 UPL is one of the few global agriinput companies with a presence across the agri-value chain. With around 20% historical CAGR and expected future net profit growth, this mid-cap company is also a stable growth player. Its strong performance continued during the first quarter of 2018-19. 



Its first quarter revenue from Africa more than doubled and it did well in Latin America despite currency devaluation in countries. The recent acquisition of US-based Arysta Lifesciences for an astounding $4.2 billion (Rs 33,000 crore) is seen as a positive development by experts, who say this deal is value accretive for UPL.


7. Suprajit Engineering
“The next leg of growth will be led by gains in global non-auto cables market; domestic 4-wheeler space and marketshare gains in aftermarket.” Recent research report by Axis Capital.
 
Suprajit Engineering, India’s largest and among the world’s top five automotive cables manufacturer, has consistently outperformed the industry on revenue and EBITDA growth over the past decade. Its valuation has became reasonable only in the past one year. Since its growth is still continuing, the correction gives investors a good entry point. 



The management is taking steps to maintain its high growth rates in the coming years and experts believe that Suprajit Engineering will be able to deliver. With new OEM orders coming from European auto majors and a bigger push planned in North America, the export segment is also doing well.

33,2018-09-18,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: With over 3.37 crore shares changing hands, the counter of Bank of Baroda was buzzing as the most traded stock on NSE early Tuesday.

Shares of Bank of Baroda (BoB) plunged 14 per cent on NSE today after the government proposed the merger of three banks — Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank —aimed at creating the country’s third-biggest lender. The boards of the three banks will now consider the proposal.

40,2018-09-19,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities ended in the negative territory for a third consecutive session on Wednesday on losses in bank, FMCG and tech stocks, even as global stocks advanced for a second day in a row and rupee recovered against the US dollar.

Market opened in the green and traded with mild gains for the most part of the day, but lost steam in late afternoon session, eventually closing in the red.

The 30-share Sensex finished 169 points, or 0.45 per cent, lower at 37,121, with 14 stocks in the green. The NSE Nifty suffered a loss of 45 points, or 0.39 per cent, settling at 11,234, with 27 stocks advancing and 23 declining.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices trailed benchmark Sensex, falling by 0.72 per cent and 0.98 per cent.


Let's take a look at the highlights of Wednesday's session:

Rupee gained some ground
Indian rupee recovered on Wednesday by rising 58 paise to 72.38 against the US dollar on fresh selling of the US currency by exporters and banks. Weakness in the dollar against other currencies and easing crude prices in the global market helped the domestic currency rebound. 


Sensex movers and shakers
HDFC twins contributed over 100 points to the fall in Sensex. IndusInd Bank, Maruti, ITC and Reliance Industries also featured among top drag. In terms of percentage loss, IndusInd Bank (3.03 per cent), Maruti (2.30 per cent), HDFC Bank (1.58 per cent), YES Bank (1.44 per cent) and HDFC (1.35 per cent) were the top five losers.

Metal pack bucked the trendEven as market ended the day on a dull note, metal pack dazzled on reports that the government was to raise import duty on some steel products to 15 per cent. Another media report suggested that the US may exempt Indian steel and alumimium from the higher tariff regime announced by President Donald Trump's administration this March. But the exemption is likely to come with riders. The BSE Metal pack climbed 1.25 per cent, with JSW Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, Nalco and Hindalco among top gainers. 


Sugar stocks ralliedAfter approving a hike in ethanol purchase price by up to 25 per cent, the government is likely to raise minimum selling price for sugar to Rs 32,000 per tonne for the 2018/19 season from Rs 29,000 in the current season, Reuters reported. Stocks such as Magadh Sugar & Energy (up 10 per cent), Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals (up 8.37 per cent), Dhampur Sugar Mills (up 7.32 per cent), Kesar Enterprise (up 6.14 per cent), Avadh Sugar & Energy (up 5.78 per cent) and Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries (up 5.57 per cent) surged over 5 per cent.


World stocks extended winning streakGlobal stocks climbed for a second consecutive day and US bond slipped as investors shrugged off fears of US-China trade war. China's Shanghai SE Composite Index and Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed over 1 per cent. French, German and UK stocks too were in the green at the time of writing this report. 


52-week high and low stocksAs many as 132 stocks, including InterGlobe Aviation, Adlabs Entertainment, AGC Networks, Agri-Tech (India), Akzo Nobel India and Aptech, hit 52-week lows on NSE. On the other hand, Cipla, Delta Magnets, Gangotri Textiles, JSW Steel and Uniphos Enterprises featured among 15 stocks that hit 52-week highs on NSE.

The Nifty50 index opened in the positive, but failed to surpass the 11,150 level and witnessed volatile swings, as it drifted towards the 11,000 mark. However it recovered from the lows and closed with marginal losses ahead of the expiry of September series F&O contracts.

The index formed a bearish candle as it closed below the opening level even as price behaviour suggested that a tug of war and volatile swings could continue between the bulls and the bears. Now, Nifty has to hold above 11,000 to witness a bounceback towards 11,080 and then 11,171 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,980 and then 10,929 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,000, followed by 10,800 level, while maximum Call OI was at 11,200, followed by 11,100. There was Put writing at 11,000 followed by 10,950 while Call writing was seen at 11,200 and then 11,100 levels. The options band signified a wider trading range between 10,850 and 11,171 levels.

India VIX moved up 2.44 per cent to 17.08. Higher VIX suggested that volatile swings are likely to continue in the market.

Bank Nifty opened in the positive but formed an opening high and remained in a trading range of 200 points for most part of the session. It crossed the previous day’s high and negated the formation of lower highs and lower lows. However, follow-up buying was missing at higher levels.

Now, it has to hold above 25,250 to witness an upward move towards 25,650 and then 25,800 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 25,000 and then 24,750 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 11,050 with a loss of 0.33 per cent. Long buildup was seen in M&M Finance, UBL, UPL and Hindalco while shorts were seen in Motherson Sumi, Tata Motors, Tata Elxsi and Godrej Consumer Products.

Future Consumer Enterprise Employees Welfare Trust bought 2 lakh shares of Future Consumer while Williamson Magor & Co. has bought 2 lakh shares of subsidiary Eveready Industries. When promoters or insiders buy shares, it is seen as an indication that the companies are cheaply valued.

2,2018-10-03,Phosphorus Limited,"The domestic equity markets witnessed an impulsive correction in September. As a result, nearly 60 per cent of the Nifty50 stocks breach their respective support at the 200-day moving average (DMA). 

As of September 28, 2018, blue chips such as Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Coal India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, YES Bank, UPL, Tata Steel, Eicher Motors, Grasim Industries, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment and Kotak Mahindra Bank were trading below their 200-DMAs.



When a stock falls below its 200-DMA, it generally means it is trading below its last one-year’s average price. The 200-DMA is most commonly used indicator among traders and investors as it typically represents one working year. 

The average is perceived to be the dividing line between a stock that is technically healthy and one that is not. Furthermore, the percentage of stocks above their 200-day moving averages helps determine the overall health of the market.

However, when a stock dips below its 200-DMA, it in a way gets oversold and shows signs of recovery and a possible technical pullback. It also offers good entry points to investors from a medium-term perspective.

“What we saw in the market in September was a sharp revision to the mean. Mean revision is a powerful concept wherein we see a market return to its average,” says Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“This usually occurs when the market runs up much ahead of its curve. With regard to largecaps that are trading on, near or below their 200-DMAs, many -- but not all -- have shown signs of bottoming out. In this kind of a market, investors should remain with largecaps and use these levels to make bargain purchases,” he said.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said historical behaviour of a particular indicator or technical tool should be given due importance while making buy and sell decisions in technical analysis and the 200-DMA is not an exception to that rule.

“Technically, we can conclude that stocks that breached 200-day moving averages are in a longer-term downtrend, which may not be practically true because often we find stocks or indices breaching 200-day moving averages for a brief period and then resuming their uptrend,” he said.

For instance, Maruti Suzuki breached its 200-day moving average in May and stayed below it for a couple of days and then resumed its uptrend from the low of Rs 8,255 to move all the way to Rs 9,929. A similar thing happened with HDFC Bank in December 2016. 

“Just a breach of 200-DMA is not an indication to stay away from a scrip, especially if it is from the largecap segment. Along with this average, it is important to consider the larger trend and direction of the market. Unless the entire market itself is reversing, we should not avoid such largecaps. They should be considered an opportunity to create fresh longs by looking at various other technical parameters,” Mohammad said.

However, Ruchit Jain, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking, said largecaps that have breached their 200 DMAs in this correction are likely to continue the underperformance in the near term.

“Traders should avoid bottom fishing in such stocks. A prudent strategy for traders should be to avoid bottom fishing at current juncture. In such times, weekly charts should be given more weightage and only when a reversal pattern is formed on the higher time frame charts, should traders look at opportunities for stock picking,” Jain said. 

He said this market could correct further in the near term and hence, traders should wait on the sidelines and be vigilant on market moves.

Other analysts also said while over half of the largecaps are trading below their 200-DMAs, only a few of them look attractive.

Mohammad said one can look at the HDFC twins and Kotak Mahindra Bank at present, as they appear to have formed a short-term base after breaching their 200 DMAs. Asian Paints also looks good as it is taking support on its 200 DMA.

“As Maruti Suzuki is trading far below its 200-day moving average, traders or investors should avoid this for the time being till the price stabilises at a particular point,” he said.

Vaishnav said stocks from pharma, infrastructure, IT, metals and energy sectors qualify for bargain hunting at this moment. “The main reason for selecting these sectors and leaving the rest out is that they have clearly outperformed the broader market on a relative basis and are improving on their relative momentum when benchmarked against the broader market,” he said.

IT stocks Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies are now trading above their 200 DMAs. Reliance Industries (RIL) and ICICI Bank were also trading above their 200 DMAs as of September 28, 2018."

9,2018-10-15,Phosphorus Limited,"Elections, high crude oil prices, weak rupee and tradewar concerns make the outlook for the stock market hazy. But the likely weakness in the market may make share valuations cheaper over the next few months. Analysts say the best strategy for retail investors will be to spread out their investments over the next few months to reduce the risk of committing money at higher prices when the sentiment is wobbly. While the most popular way of doing it is systematic investment plans, or SIPs, through mutual funds, those who want to hold shares in their demat accounts could do these staggered investments through stock brokers. “While doing this there is no burden of making lump sum investments at one time. This works in both bull and bear markets, as the average cost of holdings improves if one sticks to the strategy,” said Deepak Jasani, head of research at HDFC Securities. ET spoke to four brokerages for their stock picks to build a portfolio through SIPs and the strategy investors need to follow.


HDFC SECURITIESDeepak Jasani of HDFC Securities advises a stock SIP portfolio of better-known medium-risk stocks and lesser-known high-risk stocks. Jasani advises investors to opt for a better-known stocks SIP if they have a lower risk appetite and opt for a lesser-known stocks SIP if their risk appetite is higher. He advises keeping ratio equal in terms of value of stocks in both the stock SIP options. Jasani said one should be invested in these stocks for a period that coincides with trend cycle of stocks, which is 15-18 months, but added that one should review the portfolio every six months. Investors can choose as many stocks from the list as they wish or add the stocks out of the list that they have tracked and want to accumulate over time, he said. Ideally one should do SIPs in 4-6 stocks. At the end of the 15-18 months, they may extend the SIP period or stop the SIP and wait for an opportune time to sell the stocks if they are in good profit, he said.



GEOJIT SECURITIESIn the current market environment, it would be wise to start with a stock SIP with a mix of high-quality sectors and stock ideas available at cheaper valuations compared to the averages of the past three years, said Geojit. Given the risk-taking ability, 15-30 per cent can be spread on opportunities in auto, pharma and NBFCs, with a view that equity market will stabilise over the next two quarters. Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Securities, recommends a portfolio for defensive as well as aggressive investors. He advises equal ratio of investment in UPL, Titan, IndusInd Bank, HCL Technologies and Asian Paints in defensive-stock SIPs. For aggressive investors, Nair recommends allocating 20 per cent in Tata Motors, 15 per cent each in Can Fin Homes and Capital First and 25 per cent each in Inter-Globe Aviation and Ashok Leyland. One can go on to hold these SIPs for 2-3 years.


IDBI CAPITALThe brokerage advises doing an SIP investment spread over the next 12 months given that the market is still showing a bearish inclination. The elections are coming in the next 6-8 months, while depreciating rupee, rising crude oil prices and global trade war tensions are posing other concerns, said IDBI Capital. “The SIP can be done as a basket investment with 14 to 20 stocks with a periodicity of a month or fortnight,” said IDBI Capital. The brokerage’s list of beaten-down and deep-value stocks includes Aditya Birla Capital, Ashok Leyland, BSE, Bharat Electronics, NBCC, Sun TV, YES Bank and Federal Bank.




IIFL
IIFL is focusing on stocks more from the large cap space, which are not likely to get impacted by liquidity crisis and which will continue to see strong growth going forward. “Our focus is on quality companies which have been beaten down. We are focusing on stocks more from the large-cap space, rather than telling people to bottomfish in midcaps,” said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL. The investing ratio in each stock should be 25 per cent. He advises an SIP portfolio of Bajaj Finance, RIL, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance."
10,2018-10-15,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Corporate India announced merger and acquisitions (M&As) worth USD 11.5 billion in the third quarter of this year, following which the January-September deal tally stood at USD 76.03 billion, says a report.

""Strong earnings, promising demographics and big ticket deals drove the M&A activity, clocking deals worth USD 76 billion from over 350 transactions,"" said Prashant Mehra, Partner Grant Thornton India LLP.

Moreover, large deals such as Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart, merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, UPL's acquisition of Arysta LifeScience and some other large deals in this space resulted in a two fold jump in deal activity compared to the same period in 2017, Mehra added.

According to the report, there were 130 M&A deals worth USD 11.5 billion in the third quarter of the current year, registering a five fold jump over last year, when transactions worth USD 2.14 billion were announced through 119 transactions.

The significant uptrend in the third quarter deal activity was driven by outbound activity, which was a result of domestic companies trying to establish presence in the international markets coupled with domestic consolidation, the report said.

Moreover, the July-September quarter recorded two deals in the billion dollar club and 12 deals estimated and valued at and above USD 100 million each together capturing 89 per cent of total M&A values.

A sector-wise analysis showed that, the agriculture sector led the deal activity in the third quarter of this year, accounting for 37 per cent of the total deal value, driven by UPL Ltd's acquisition of Arysta LifeScience Inc for USD 4.2 billion.

The pharma sector remained active during the July-September quarter, recording eight deals worth USD 1.3 billion, with Aurobindo Pharma's acquisition of the dermatology business and generic US oral solids portfolio of Sandoz Inc.

It was followed by Constellation Alpha Capital Corp's acquisition of Medall Healthcare for USD 212 million, marking the largest investment in an Indian diagnostics company till date, the report said.

The start-up sector meanwhile, led in terms of deal volumes, capturing a 22 per cent share as a result of revived domestic investors' interest in the FinTech segment followed by travel and on-demand services platform.

Going ahead, ""with the insolvency regime being the main catalyst, we expect an increase in restructuring activities, apart from also experiencing a new renaissance in the M&A and the restructuring horizon,"" Mehra said.

However, in the run-up to the elections, we could expect investors and corporates to adopt a more cautious approach over the course of the coming months, he added."

14,2018-10-21,Phosphorus Limited,"Weakness continued to persist in the domestic equity market for most of the past week. On Friday, the Nifty opened deep in the red and drifted further to end the day with deep cuts despite some modest recovery from the low point o f the day. The Nifty50 ended the day lower by 149 points, or 1.43 per cent.

From Thursday’s intraday high, Nifty lost over 400 points in just two sessions by Friday’s close and, thereby, it failed the confirm the base that it had attempted for form.

Going into Monday’s trade, it would be important for Nifty to not only defend the 10,180-10,250 zone, but also move past the 10,400 mark to defend the support that it has formed over the past few sessions.

The market’s behaviour vis-à-vis these levels will not only be important for Monday’s session, but also for subsequent sessions.

On Monday, the 10,350 and 10,435 levels are likely to act as immediate resistance for Nifty, while supports should come in at 10,250 and 10,180 levels.


ETMarkets.comOn Monday, the 10,350 and 10,435 levels are likely to act as immediate resistance for Nifty.
The RSI on the daily chart stood at 34.3387 and it remained neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD remains bearish as it traded below its signal line. A falling window has emerged on the candles. This is essentially a gap down, but in the present context, it may not spell much damage as it has occurred near the support zone.

Monday’s opening and market trajectory from there on would be crucial. The 10,180 and 10,250 levels will be extremely critical to watch out for in the event of any weakness. The Nifty will have to keep its head above these levels to avoid further weakness from creeping in. It failed to confirm this base around the current supports and for it to do that, it is necessary that it crawls back above 10,400 and sustains there.

We recommend a cautious view on the market, but at the same time, advise traders to refrain from aggressive short positions as long as the Nifty50 defends the 10,180 and 10,200 levels.

STOCKS TO WATCH: Resilient behaviour is expected from stocks like Pidilite Industries, ICICI Lombard, UPL, DLF, Mahindra Lifespace, Voltas, Trent, Hindustan Zinc, Gujarat Pipavav, Essel Propack, Whirlpool Industries, Page Industries and Linde India.

15,2018-10-23,Phosphorus Limited,"Overseas portfolio investors started the current round of major selloff on Dalal Street towards the later part of the September quarter, which turned the market highly volatile.

While foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been withdrawing from most emerging markets ever since the US economy started firing and bond yields there turned more attractive, soaring crude oil prices and a falling rupee only hastened this selloff. 

FPIs offloaded stocks worth Rs 6,000 crore in the domestic market in Q2, and at least double that amount in September and October.

Curiously, at the same time, they were busy picking stocks from sectors like chemicals, abrasives, auto ancillary, select private and public banks, pharma and information technology.

Within the BSE500 basket, FPIs raised stakes in almost half or over 200 stocks during the quarter. Among notable names, Aarti Industries saw FPI holding go up to 4.20 per cent at the end of September quarter from 3.80 per cent at the end of June quarter.

Among others, FPI holding went up from 4.02 per cent to 4.11 per cent in Gujarat Fluorochemicals, from 5.47 per cent to 5.59 per cent in Atul, 2.36 per cent to 2.45 per cent in Himadri Speciality Chemicals, 23.95 per cent to 24.41 per cent in Jubilant Life Sciences and 11.83 per cent to 11.87 per cent in Pidilite Industries. 

Shares of Aarti Industries and Atul have rallied 10 per cent and 17.78 per cent, respectively, so far in 2018, whereas those of Himadri Speciality Chemical and Jubilant Life Sciences are down 19 per cent and 13.51 per cent, respectively.

As many as 489 companies from the BSE500 index reported their shareholding patterns for the September quarter till October 21, according to corporate database Ace Equity. 

Foreign portfolio flows into equities turned positive in July and August after an outflow of more than Rs 20,000 crore during the first quarter of 2018-19. However, FPI outflow of Rs 10,824 crore in September against net investment of around Rs 4,040 crore in July and August set the clock back, resulting in net outflow for second quarter. 

Several banks also saw FPI holding go up during the quarter. AU Small Finance Bank, DCB Bank, The Jammu & Kashmir Bank, The Karnataka Bank, Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, Central Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Union Bank of India all recorded increase in FPI holding during the quarter.



Select beaten-down construction and real estate players also managed to attract overseas investors money during the quarter. Among them were included Dilip Buildcon, DLF, Indiabulls Real Estate and Sunteck Realty. These shares, incidentally, were down up to 53 per cent on year-to-date basis till October 19.



FPIs also did a fair bit of shopping in the NBFC space, raising their holdings in Bajaj Finance to 20.08 per cent from 20.05 per cent. The stock is up 24 per cent so far in 2018.

FPIs also bought additional shares of Capital First, IFDC, Manappuram Finance, Reliance Capital, Shriram City Union Finance, Multi Commodity Exchange of India and Tata Investment Corporation. Shares of these companies are down up to 60 per cent this calendar.

FPI holding went up from 54.34 per cent to 55.52 per cent in Indiabulls Housing Finance, 52.42 per cent to 54.47 per cent in Fortis Healthcare, 47.41 per cent to 48.70 per cent in Shriram Transport Finance, 42.90 to 45.37 per cent in Care Ratings, 43.08 to 43.17 per cent in Cyient, 40.69 to 42.37 per cent in UPL, 42.20 to 42.29 per cent in Bharti Infratel, 40.30 to 42.17 per cent in Team Lease Services, 40.73 to 42.17 per cent in NIIT Technologies and 40.77 to 40.81 per cent in Zee Entertainment.

However, Bharat Financial Inclusion, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Apollo Hospital Enterprise, YES Bank, PVR, Sobha, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Tata Power, Piramal Enterprises Delta Corp and Radico Khaitan were among 268 stocks where FPIs offloaded significant amount of shares during Q2.

They reduced holdings in HDFC from 72.89 per cent to 72.19 per cent and in HDFC Bank from 40.86 per cent to 39.18 per cent.





On the other hand, these overseas portfolio investors kept their holdings intact in Bank of Maharashtra, Corporation Bank, Forbes & Company, Greenply Industries, Indian Overseas Bank, Ratnamani Metals & Tubes, Solar Industries and The New India Assurance."
16,2018-10-23,Phosphorus Limited,"Private Equity (PE) investments moderated to USD 14.60 billion during January-September period, owing to macroeconomic concerns, market volatility and valuations of companies, a report said Tuesday.

According to Grant Thornton's latest PE Dealtracker, 621 PE investments worth USD 14.60 billion were announced in the reported nine-month period of 2018. In the year-ago period, the value stood at USD 15.60 billion.

""India's rupee has slumped to an all-time low amid an investor exodus from emerging markets, which threatened to dent business confidence, cautioning PE investors,"" the report said.

Meanwhile, the July-September quarter marked 217 PE investments worth USD 5.20 billion, registering 41 per cent growth in terms of number of deals, even as the value dipped by 28 per cent.

""The environment for private equity market has been sluggish due to concerns like the economy, market volatility and valuations, among other things,"" said Prashant Mehra, Partner, Grant Thornton India LLP.

Mehra further said: ""We expect to see a rise in the PE activity due to the government's focus on providing a fertile ground for digitisation and tech investment through policy initiatives by incubating tech funds with traditional banks"".

As per the report, the September quarter was dominated by investments in startups, which contributed to 60 per cent of total investment volumes garnering USD 1 billion. FinTech also attracted significant attention from investors with 20 deals, followed by retail and health tech segments.

18,2018-10-26,Phosphorus Limited,"Strong rollovers to November F&O series and a bounce back in US stocks in overnight trade are a few positives, but data showing a surge in fiscal deficit to 95 per cent of the budget, weak Asian markets and political slug fest may continue to depress sentiment in domestic equities.

Let's check out what might matter to Dalal Street on Friday:


Singapore trading sets stage for tepid start 
Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 23.50 points, or 0.23 per cent, lower at 10,159.50, indicating a negative start for the Nifty50.


Tech view: Nifty forms indecisive Doji
The bears are back to flex their muscles. The Nifty on Thursday made a small bearish candle similar to indecisive 'Doji' on the daily chart. Such a pattern at a swing low of 10,079.30 level, a second such formation in the last three sessions, and a close above 10,100 level made some analysts believe that the index is attempting to form a bottom around the prevailing levels. “As long as the low of 10,100-10,050 holds, there is a possibility of upside bounce in the market,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. 


F&O rollovers at 82%
The market-wide rollovers stood at 82 per cent, which were higher than the average rollovers of 81 per cent seen in the last three series. Nifty futures rollover at 76 per cent were much higher than average rollovers of 68 per cent seen in the last three series. “We expect this leg of downtrend to extend till 9,950 level. With stocks and indices in extremely oversold zones, sharp bounce backs cannot be ruled out,” said Edelweiss Securities.


Asian shares mixed 
South Korea’s Kospi was also down 0.6 per cent, and Australia’s shares were hanging on to modest gains of 0.2 per cent, Reuters reported. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was the biggest gainer, up 0.5 per cent, though that only partially erased Thursday’s 3.7 per cent slide.


US stocks bounce back
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 401.13 points, or 1.63 percent, to 24,984.55, the S&P500 index gained 49.47 points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,705.57 and the Nasdaq Composite index added 209.94 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,318.34, Reuters reported.


Wall-St drop nowhere near harming US economy: Fed
The recent cratering of stock markets is nowhere near severe enough to rattle confidence and significantly hurt US business and consumer spending, Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed, said on Thursday.


Fiscal deficit touches 95% of target in 6 months
India’s fiscal deficit touched 95.3 per cent of budget estimate in the six months to September, just a little ahead of 91 per cent at the same time last year. Government spending stood at 53.4 per cent of FY19 estimate, almost on a par with 53.5 per cent in the year-ago period, but revenues were lower this year.


RBI pushes back suggestions on easing PCA
RBI has pushed back suggestions by the government nominees in its board meeting on Wednesday on easing prompt corrective action norms.

21,2018-10-26,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: The bears had a free reign today as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty fell for the second consecutive day.

Sentiment turned sour as global shares fell, the rupee stumbled from one low to another and FIIs just kept hitting the exit button. 

Global stocks were to face their worst week in more than five years as anxiety over corporate profits added to fears about global trade and economic growth, Reuters reported. 

The market has been battered by a string of issues like the ongoing trade war, prospects of weak economic growth and geopolitical tensions arising out of death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Domestic factors such as weak macroeconomic numbers, rupee's poor health and tepid September quarter earnings are other top drags. 

Closing at a fresh seven-month low, the Sensex plunged 341 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 33,349 and the Nifty 95 points, or 0.94 per cent, at 10,030. On a weekly basis, the Sensex lost 966 points, or 2.82 per cent, while the Nifty came off 274 points, or 2.65 per cent. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outsmarted the benchmark Sensex today, settling with nominal losses of 0.11 per cent and 0.04 per cent, respectively. 


The big highlights of today's session:

Rs 75,000 crore gone in a dayFriday's loss shaved off over Rs 75,000 crore cumulative wealth of BSE investors as market capitalisation of companies slid to Rs 1,33,31,977.38 crore from Rs 1,34,07,102.28 crore, available data showed. The top five companies in terms of m-cap were Tata Consultancy Services (Rs 6,75,279.15 crore), Reliance Industries (Rs 6,62,180.42 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 5,33,294.35 crore), ITC (Rs 3,43,592.12 crore) and Hindustan Unilever (Rs 3,37,782.64 crore).


Who dragged my Sensex down?YES Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, TCS and Kotak Mahindra Bank emerged as the top five Sensex losers. In total, seven stocks - Tata Motors, Reliance Industries, Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, HDFC and Hero MotoCorp - stood up to the bearish trend, settling in the green. In terms of index contribution, Infosys, TCS, ITC, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank featured as the top five drag on the Sensex basket.


YES Bank stock plunges 9% Shares of YES Bank settled at Rs 180.55, down 8.97 per cent on the BSE, a day after the private lender reported a 3.8 per cent year-on-year drop in profit at Rs 964.70 crore for the September quarter on onetime hit on mark-to-market (MTM) investments in corporate bonds and higher provisions on loans to a corporate client. Total provisions increased to Rs 940 crore, up from Rs 447 crore a year earlier, and higher than the Rs 626 crore reported in June 2018, hitting profits. 


Bharti Airtel shrugs off poor Q2 Shares of Bharti Airtel settled 1.06 per cent up at Rs 299 on the BSE even as it reported on Thursday a fall in consolidated net profit for the tenth straight quarter as losses on mainstay India business widened due to pricing pressure from aggressive competition. Global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Buy’ on Airtel with a revised target price of Rs 415 (Rs 500 earlier).


Equitas Holdings & Ujjivan Fin crumbleShares of Equitas Holdings and Ujjivan Financial Services closed the day with losses of 23.34 per cent and 17.62 per cent, respectively, on the BSE today after the RBI issued directives to them on compliance of rules for listing their small finance banks. The Reserve Bank has asked both companies to comply with guidelines and list their small finance banks within three years of commencing operations, Ujjivan and Equitas said in separate BSE filings on Thursday. 


Earnings update FMCG major ITC on Friday posted 11.92 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 2,954.67 crore for the quarter ended September 30. The numbers failed to excite the investors as the stock fell 2.30 per cent to Rs 280.65 on BSE. UPL reported a 13.92 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit at Rs 270 crore. Shares of the company jumped 3.90 per cent to Rs 621.70 on the BSE today.


Rupee sinks furtherThe domestic unit settled 19 paise lower at 73.46 against the dollar today after the dollar rose to a 10-week high. Weakness in stocks amid uninspiring corporate earnings have pushed investors to safe havens, including dollar and gold, putting pressure on emerging market currencies. Gold prices rose today, eyeing a three-month high. 


Crude easesGlobal crude oil prices eased today amid oversupply concerns after Saudi Arabia's Opec governor remarks to this effect. Oil prices dropped more than 1 per cent on Friday, heading for a third weekly loss. A slump in stock markets and concerns about trade clouded outlook for fuel demand, Reuters reported.


European, Asian stocks falterWorries over global trade and economic growth weighed on global stocks today. Shanghai Composite settled 0.19 per cent down while Hang Seng fell 1.11 per cent. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index or KOSPI fell 1.75 per cent. From the European markets, French CAC 40 was down 2 per cent, German DAX 1.46 per cent and UK's FTSE 100 1.10 per cent at the time of writing this report.

Technical viewThe Nifty50 formed a candle like ‘Bearish Belt Hold’ on the daily chart today. ""The index made a strong bear candle on the weekly chart, with the 400-point range pointing towards severity of the correction. As the bulls are unable to make any meaningful recovery, the chances of dipping below 9,950 to complete one corrective structure looks bright in the next couple of trading sessions,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

One-off expenses impact PAT: (i) UPL had a one-off cost of Rs 200mn for LATAM restructuring & loss on dilution in Associates. Additionally, in 2QFY19, Arysta acquisition expense was Rs 370mn. These two resulted into a total impact of Rs 570 mn. (ii) Other income was at Rs 320mn (-74 per cent QoQ and -58 per cent YoY). UPL attributed this decline in other income to changes in the accounting post-transition to Ind AS. (iii) Additionally, exchange differences impacted negatively by Rs 520 mn. (iv) Finally, effective tax rate was higher at 29 per cent likely due to higher India sales.


Other takeaways from the conference call: (i) UPL reported a constant currency growth of 12 per cent YoY in Revenue with 4 per cent growth contributed by price increase and 8 per cent by volume, (ii) LATAM’s contribution to revenue grew to 41 per cent (37 per cent in 2Q18). Excluding Argentina (which was impacted due to currency), all other key countries in LATAM reported growth with strong performance in Brazil. UPL will push campaign in South Cone (in South America) to drive leadership in fungicide resistance management in soybean, (iii) In India, during 2Q, cotton crop was impacted due to erratic rainfall in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. However, UPL believes that water reserves in dams in Southern India are good and therefore, prospects of Rabi crop are good, (iv) UPL received 4 registrations that will result into important launches for next season, potentially providing growth avenues, (v) Europe saw a reduction in beet acreage but sales volumes were maintained due to low opening inventory, (vi) RoW growth was led by Africa on back of new product registrations, (vii) UPL maintained capex guidance of Rs 15bn for FY19 of which Rs 8bn has been incurred till date.


Maintain BUY with target price of 780: We do not currently integrate Arysta into our estimates pending regulatory approvals and need for more balance sheet details. We continue to like the derisked business model of UPL and the economies of scale. We maintain BUY with P/E multiple of 14 and average earning for FY20 and FY21 with TP of 780. Key risks to our estimates are 1) higher raw material costs/difficulty in passing through raw material costs resulting into margin pressures and 2) Volatility in foreign exchange."
23,2018-10-30,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: The weak momentum in the market is making investors jittery. While crude prices have come off a bit, a depreciating rupee has intensified foreign outflows, which is taking a toll on investor sentiment back home. Corporate earnings, too, have been anything but inspiring.

The only silver lining is that Nifty50 is defending the 10,000 mark strongly. 

But despite the fragile environment, there are as many as 127 stocks on NSE that look strong on the daily charts, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The technical indicator saw an upward crossover to give a bullish signal on these counters, hinting at possible upsides for these stocks.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

The list included Tata group stocks Tata Motors and Tata Steel, drug makers Divi’s Labs, Wockhardt and Lupin and NBFCs Edelweiss Financial Services and JM Financial.

Others included SAIL, CESC, L&T, Prakash Industries, UPL, RBL Bank and Orient Paper also witnessed upward crossovers, suggesting possible upsides for these stocks. 




The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

MACD is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Twenty-two companies, including HDFC Bank, GMDC, Hathway Cable, HT Media, Whirlpool of India and NLC India, witnessed bearish crossovers on the daily charts.

The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ call using a single valuation ratio.

Market veterans say the MACD alone may not be good enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As far as the Nifty50 is concerned, experts believe intraday pullbacks towards 10,200 and 10,160 levels are likely to be bought into.

“The 10,290 level should be watch out for. A sustainable move beyond it would trigger a bout of short covering that may push the index towards the 10,400-10,440 range,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

He advised traders to go one step at a time and keep revising stop losses for existing positions.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said traders are advised to adopt a cautiously optimistic stance and should maintain a tight stop loss for long positions below the 10,020 level.

A close look at the stock chart of Tata Motors shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock tended to show an upward momentum and vice versa.

On Tuesday morning, the stock traded 1.9 per cent higher at Rs 178.75 on NSE.

26,2018-10-31,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Consumption, often touted as the biggest investment theme in the domestic market, has let investors and fund managers down this festive season.

There are clear signs of a slowdown in consumer demand, both in urban and rural India, and fewer investors are buying this theme on Dalal Street.


What went wrong?The premise for consumption as a preferred investment theme was based on hopes that rural demand would jump after MSP hikes, farm loan waivers and election-related spending in the runup to the 2019 general elections. But southwest monsoon ended up below normal this year, affecting farm output and food prices have remained sluggish, hurting farmer incomes.

Some analysts say MSP hikes are unlikely to aid demand due to poor procurement and infrastructure facilities. Among sectors , FMCG players are yet to pass on the recent hike in input costs. Their volumes might have peaked. 

Urban demand for consumer durables and automobile has slowdown down as many consumer-focused NBFCs are facing liquidity issues. Recent interest rate hikes and inflationary concerns due to rising crude oil prices have also dented outlook for consumption plays.


Data confirms slowdownNomura’s proprietary heat-map of high-frequency data is confirming early signs of a demand slowdown. The moderation is spearheaded by consumption – both rural and urban, the brokerage said.

“Traditional bellwethers of rural consumption – two-wheeler and tractor sales – have moderated to 5 per cent YoY in Q3 from 16-25 per cent in Q2. Higher fuel prices are also starting to bite urban demand – September witnessed a 3.6 per cent YoY contraction in passenger vehicle sales,” the brokerage said.


Q2 numbers & margin risksConsumer-linked firms have so far reported mixed numbers for September quarter. While Hindustan Unilever and ITC managed to meet Street expectations, Asian Paints disappointed the Street on the margin front. Risks on margins are elevated given the rising input cost dynamics, Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.

Data showed sectors such as consumer discretionary and consumer staples have seen a cut in FY19 price multiples. Consumer staples commands the highest valuation at over 40 times despite the expected price-to-earnings multiple for 2019 contracting 15 per cent since August 28. 


Unhealthy returnsAmong the consumption-linked equity indices, BSE Auto index has lost one-fourth of its 25 per cent of market value this calendar. The BSE consumer durables index is flat, while the FMCG index has delivered 6 per cent return since last Diwali.

Among mutual fund schemes, Sundaram Rural and Consumption Fund, which managed Rs 2,400 crore assets, has seen its NAV drop 12 per cent in last one year, compared with a 4.55 per cent fall its benchmark NIFTY 500 TRI. ITC, M&M, HUL, UPL and Britannia Industries were some of its biggest holdings of the fund as of September 30.

“Rising interest rates, short term issues on the liquidity front for NBFCs and rising cost of fuel were recent issues which could’ve had a toll on near-term demand viz., in discretionary segments such as auto. Oil inflation which flows into raw material cost of companies using the downstream products, could create pressure on profitability margins in the near term. Historically, consumer companies have demonstrated the ability to pass-on material cost inflation with a lag,” Sundaram Mutual Fund said in a written reply to ETMarkets.com query.

The mutual fund noted that its rural and consumption universe has a larger skew towards mid and small-sized companies where valuations have softened and have now moved to their long-term averages. The volume improvement and earnings growth trends across consumption categories, including staples and discretionary, continue to remain healthy all along, the mutual fund noted.

Among others, Reliance Consumption Fund, Quant Consumption Fund, UTI India Lifestyle and Canara Robeco Consumer Trends, too, have offered negative returns and failed to beat their benchmarks.

Mail sent to Canara Robeco Mutual Fund did not elicit any response.

“While we are not worried about a sharp slowdown in consumption demand, tapering is likely. Rural demand may remain stable to weak. State election spending and MSP implementation won’t be effective in raising demand. Urban and semi-urban demand may be dented due to limited NBFC lending,” said Phillip Capital.

This brokerage is factoring in weaker volume growth for automobiles (two-wheeler and commercial vehicles), consumer durables and FMCG firms in the second half of the financial year.

Consumer durables volume growth is expected to remain modest for at least a year. Auto volume growth is now seen at 8-9 per cent in H2FY19 against 13-14 per cent last year. FMCG volumes are already at peak, Phillip Capital said. 


No Diwali booster this time?There are lights and discounts everywhere, but showrooms are empty, making analysts wonder whether e-commerce onslaught or lack of demand is hurting retail sales this Diwali.

“It is no fun for retailers and businesses this Diwali. The festive demand has been underwhelming. There are the usual lights and offers splashed across windows, but (without exception) crowds are sparse. There aren’t any queues and there’s little or no buzz; most retailer conversations indicates as much,” said Edelweiss Securities.

Offline retailers are hopeful of a pickup in demand over the next weekend when the most auspicious shopping day of dhanteras falls.

Edelweiss Securities noted that among various segments, luxury apparel is taking big hit while mid-market apparel is doing just about okay for offline stores. This could be due to e-commerce discounts and easy financing. 

“Car sales have been slower than that of two-wheelers. But consumer durables stores are ready to outprice e-com offers and are seeing strong sales. Most retailers are optimistic (desperately hopeful?) about the next (last) and big weekend,” the brokerage said.


Marketmen still hopefulNilesh Shetty of Quantum Mutual Fund said the festival season has not gotten off to a great start, but his meeting with companies recently versus a year ago suggests the pricing power coming back for them. 

“Demand on the ground seems to be a lot better than it was a year ago. We are somewhere close to in the early stage of a pickup in consumer demand. I am not too sure about the second half of FY19, but it looks like we are at the cusp of a pickup in consumer demand from where we were a year ago,” he told ET NOW. 

Sundaram MF said that the near-term macro-led issues is expected to be transitory and its impact on market sentiments should get mitigated as confidence on consumption growth gathers pace in the coming quarter.
“Structural factors such as increased farm mechanisation, favourable demographics, increasing income levels and working population, premiumisation within categories, should help household consumption spending in the long run. Added to this, initiatives on financial inclusion have been the fulcrum to bring large strata of rural population into mainstream finance and increase institutional credit and create long-term drivers for consumption growth,” it said."
3,2018-11-18,Phosphorus Limited,"MUMBAI: Agrochemicals major UPL, which has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, has announced yet another deal, involving Yoloo (Laoting) Bio- technology, a Chinese agrochemicals firm, for a reported consideration of around Rs 95 crore.

In July 2018, the city-based company had announced its largest acquisition of the US-based Arysta LifeScience for USD 4.2 billion, catapulting it among the top five agrochemicals players globally with over YSD 5 billion in combined revenue and around USD 1 billion in pretax profit.

The deal with the Chinese company will be executed through one of UPL's Hong Kong subsidiaries, a statement from UPL said on Monday.

UPL will acquire 100 percent shares of Laoting Yoloo based in the Heibei province for an undisclosed amount and in turn will issue 25 percent shares of its Hong Kong subsidiary to Beijing Yoloo.

But UPL source said they will USD 13.3 million or around Rs 95 crore for the deal.

Laoting Yoloo has over 100 product registrations, about 1,200 distributor contacts and over 240 employees.

The transaction is conditional to receiving necessary regulatory approvals and fulfilling other conditions.

""Our goal is to create an open network for agriculture, activating connections across the world's agriculture system. It aims to power new levels of sustainable growth --for farmers, for producers, for customers, for partners and for societies everywhere. The acquisition will enhance our ability to achieve this purpose,"" UPL Global chief executive Jai Shroff said.

It can be noted that in February this year, UPL had completed acquisition of UD-based Arysta LifeScience for USD 4.2 billion, elevating UPL's position in the global agricultural solutions market with USD5 billion in combined sales and pretax profit of around USD1 billion. The deal was announced in July 2018.

The deal was done after UPL raised USD 3 billion bank loan and USD1.2 billion equity investment from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and TPG.

UPL is strong in India, the Americas, Western Europe and Arysta's strength is in Africa, Russia and Eastern Europe, providing it a global platform for 13,000 products from the new entity."

9,2018-12-15,Phosphorus Limited,"In a village 70 km from Hyderabad, researchers of Kaveri Seeds are experimenting with new varieties — not just to find high-yielding seeds but seeds that will have high climate resilience. One can see columns of climate-controlled net houses in Kodakandla village in Telangana’s Jangaon district, where the new seeds are being tested to check if they can withstand climate shocks. Nearby lie the remains of a maize harvest. Elsewhere, hybrid varieties of chilli are being tested on over 10 acres.

“Earlier, the focus of R&D was yield. Now, with groundwater levels going down and temperatures rising, we need to develop tolerance in seeds to different kinds of stress,” says Yogendra Varma, the head of research & development at Kaveri.

The effects of climate change, like more frequent heat waves, dry spells, droughts and changing frequency and intensity of rain, on agriculture cannot be ignored. And at risk are not just the 120-million farmers of the country but also more than 500 companies that make up India’s Rs 15,000 crore seed industry.



“Farmers want stability in their crops even if the yield is 10-15% lower,” says GV Bhaskar Rao, chairman and managing director of Hyderabadbased Kaveri Seeds.

Rao says the company is spending 7-8% of its a substantial amount given the seed Rs 772 crore in 2017-18. But the search for climate-resilient varieties comes with a business risk: it can up to seven years to introduce a new variety — from R&D stage to commercial launch — and the success rate can be less than 1%, says Varma, the R&D head.




These hardy varieties are being sent for processing to Kaveri Seeds’ 30-acre seed processing facility — around 20 km away from Kodakandla, in Pamulaparthi village. The unit is like a giant warehouse, with rows of gunny sacks basking in sunlight. In one corner, raw paddy seeds are being processed in a multi-stage process, where a contraption tosses the seeds up in the air to remove impurities. In another part of the plant, cotton and okra seeds are being cleaned for packaging. This plant, with a capacity to process 85 tonnes of seeds an hour, is Kaveri’s biggest, processing 60% of the company’s output.

The other major seed players in the Indian market are multinationals like Bayer AG, DowDuPont’s Corteva Agriscience and Syngenta and home-grown Nuziveedu Seeds, United Phosphorus, Rasi Seeds, Ankur Seeds and Ajeet Seeds. Bayer completed its acquisition of Monsanto globally earlier this year, but the two companies still operate as separate entities in India.

Meanwhile, cotton seeds, which make up a third of the seed market in India, are also being given a climate shield.

India is the world’s largest cotton producer and last financial year, the crop was cultivated on 11.3 mn hectares – most of it genetically modified Bt cotton. Genetically modified seeds are different from hybrids since they have a gene inserted from an unrelated species. For instance, the second-generation Bt cotton in India, introduced by Monsanto, has two genes from bacterium bacillus thuringiensis. But farmers sowing Bt cotton have been battling pink bollworm attacks for the past few years even though resistance to these worms was supposed to be the USP of the genetically modified variety.



Now, to minimise the impact of bollworms, which usually attack late in the crop’s lifecycle, companies are introducing Bt cotton varieties that take shorter time to grow. Early maturity also saves the crop from truant rain.

Nagpur-based Ankur Seeds has created such a seed variety that needs 20 days less to mature than regular Bt cotton, which has a growth period of 160-180 days.

“In the 1960s and 70s, new varieties were invented so that they could be useful for the next 25 years. But now, if we invest in new seeds, they will only be useful for three to four years because of unpredictable weather events,” says MG Shembekar, managing director at Ankur Seeds.

According to an estimate in the 2017-18 Economic Survey, when temperatures are 1° Celsius higher than normal, farm incomes fall by 6.2% during kharif season and 6% for rabi season in unirrigated districts. Similarly, when rainfall is 100 mm less than the average, farm incomes decline by 15% during kharif season and by 7% during rabi season.

Climate change can reduce wheat yields by 6-23% by 2050 and 15-25% by 2080, says a paper by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.





The earth’s average surface temperature has risen by 1° Celsius since pre-industrial levels and the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change vowed to keep global temperature increase this century to below 2° Celsius. This year, United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for further restricting global warming to 1.5° Celsius and countries negotiated hard at 24th Conference of Parties at Katowice in Poland last week to put in place an action plan to achieve objectives of the Paris deal.

Last year was India’s fourth warmest year ever since record-keeping began in 1901, with annual mean temperature 0.71° Celsius higher than the 1971-2000 average.

At its field labs, Kaveri Seeds is also testing a chilli hybrid seed that will be resistant to strong winds during cyclones. It is also trying to create a quick growth chili variety with a 150-day lifecycle compared with the usual 230-240 days.


Hybrid seeds are produced by cross-pollinating two different but related plants to produce a variety with specific traits. But unlike non-hybrid varieties, these seeds from a hybrid plant cannot be used to grow the same variety, which means farmers have to buy new seeds every season.

The shorter-duration chilli variety will need to be irrigated once in two weeks instead of once or twice a week, says Khuman Singh Chauhan, who heads Kaveri’s R&D for vegetables. These seeds for the future will be water-efficient as rains become erratic and the number of dry days during monsoons rise, he adds.

Besides tackling the likelihood of low water availability, extreme temperatures is another challenge for seed makers to overcome.



Kaveri Seeds is developing a tomato hybrid that can withstand temperatures of up to 45° Celsius. Most of the current varieties cannot endure the mercury crossing 42°. Tolerance to high temperatures is being ingrained in seeds of other crops too.

The IARI, under the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) programme, is experimenting with a wheat variety that can endure heat stress. The crop usually requires a minimum temperature of 8-10° Celsius at night in winter in north India. But this variety is tolerant to higher temperatures. For paddy, which is India’s largest crop by acreage, there are attempts to make the seeds more tolerant to flooding and drought, depending on which part of the country paddy is planted.

For instance, a variety launched some years ago by a government institute in Cuttack, Odisha, can withstand submergence for around 10 days in a flood. This is ideal for fields in river basins prone to flooding like the Brahmaputra delta in Assam.



Another paddy variety, already planted on six lakh hectares in Chhattisgarh and Bihar, has drought-tolerance properties.“We have to scale it up by bringing in the private sector,” says M Prabhakar, NICRA’s principal investigator.

Bayer AG plans to bring to India a paddy variety that can withstand flooding for two weeks. “While the product has been launched in Bangladesh, we’re working towards introducing it in India soon,” says a company spokesperson.

In India and Bangladesh, around five million hectares, or just under a tenth of the total area for rice fields, are prone to floods every year, according to the International Rice Research Institute. Rice fields are also a source of methane emissions, due to the bacteria in the soil when the fields are filled with water during planting. “We need to adopt a forward-thinking approach — to not only address issues that farmers are facing today but preempt challenges that they might have to overcome in the future,” says a spokesperson at Corteva that produces maize, paddy, mustard and millet seeds.



CLIMATE CHANGE: A LOOMING THREAT:


Earth’s average surface temperature has already risen 1° Celsius since 19th century.
2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change vows to keep temperature increase this century to below 2° Celsius and will strive to restrict it further to 1.5° Celsius.
Climate change is already having an adverse impact on agriculture, thanks to rising temperatures, more intense extreme weather events, more frequent dry spells and droughts, variations in frequency and level of rains and rising sea levels.

11,2018-12-18,Phosphorus Limited,"MUMBAI: UPL is likely to be negatively impacted by the drought in the European region, said CIMB Securities in a note, which retained its reduce rating on the company with a target price of Rs 593. 

Shares of UPL ended down 3.11 per cent at Rs 743.90 on the BSE on Tuesday.

Bayer AG in its recent conference call had highlighted that the European drought is likely to impact fungicide and insecticides sales in the region. 

CIMB said rainfall in Europe is at a multi-year low and heatwaves are prevalent, which means that there will be fewer attacks of fungus.

“Post the Arysta acquisition, UPL now has a higher dependence on Europe. The European continent is the biggest market fungicides which thrive on wet and damp conditions. However, the recent heat waves in Europe spell bad news for fungicides sales,” said CIMB.

Europe accounts for around 20 per cent of UPL and Arysta’s sales, the brokerage said.

“UPL faces volume as well as pricing risk for Mancozeb. The stalwart molecule is up against new formulations from Bayer and DowDuPont, which are under patent periods; hence UPL could lose market share,” said CIMB. 

Significant incremental revenue in UPL’s agrochemical division was derived from Mancozeb over the past few years, said CIMB."

14,2018-12-21,Phosphorus Limited,"Jaidev Shroff, Global CEO, UPL, firmly believes that synergy points from the Arysta deal will flow in the next 23-36 months. He told ETNow that its presence in western Europe and eastern Europe both will be more balanced. Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Could you just first start by the news flow that has been going around where Bayer did a concall, they spoke about the drought in the European market and of course, after the acquisition even Europe is a very big market for UPL now?


Jaidev Shroff: There is some miscommunication, Bayer’s call was about the last season when there was a drought which impacted the cereal fungicide business and it impacted companies who have a big presence in the cereal fungicide business. UPL does not have a significant presence in the cereal fungicide business so our business was not impacted last season. 

About the next season, it is very difficult to predict the weather conditions which are going to come for the next growing season in Europe, which will be in May, June, July next year. So we do not understand the report, that is one aspect. The other aspect is we actually had a very good year in Europe in our business these first six months of the year. We had a 7 per cent growth and European business has been doing very well and we expect to do very well in Europe even as an integrated company. 

Our presence in western Europe and eastern Europe both will be more balanced. Today, our presence is mostly in western Europe, but with the Arysta deal our presence through eastern Europe will improve significantly. So we will see a good growth.


ET Now: Europe particularly you are saying is doing decently well and will continue to do well and I take your point that it is very difficult to predict weather conditions. Let us talk about the acquisition, how is the deal progressing, you have announced some management changes but the guidance that you have given for synergy benefits continue to occur over the next couple of years?


Jaidev Shroff: That is right. So the integration, we have put our integration team together of about 45 people from both the companies and they have been working non-stop for the last 90 days. We have announced a first set of new management teams across the world that has gone down very well. It is a mixed team of both UPL and Arysta and the next layers of management teams will also be announced soon. We are working on the synergy calculations. All that is on track to roll out in the next 23-36 months. We will have those in the bag which will really help us improve our earnings as a joint company.


ET Now: Let us just also particularly talk about the size it gives you and how it changes your dynamics in the business. Over the next two years, what is the size that you see UPL operating at and how does it change the synergy benefits, costing benefits, the negotiating power you have?


Jaidev Shroff: I think there is a lot of consolidation in the industry happening and size matters as we all know. Our presence through the crop lifecycles across different parts of the world and crops will increase. Your relationship with the farmer just would not be based on one or two products but it will be a whole portfolio. 

And I think the whole industry is moving towards a portfolio approach, towards the relationship with the farmer and you amortise your cost of relationship over a whole portfolio of technology. With the market moving towards bio-solution, we get a huge portfolio of bio-solution products worldwide. We have a portfolio of climate smart technology that has really helped plants and become more resilient to climate change. 

All these technologies we are bringing in will make us a very more modern company really ready for the future in agriculture.


ET Now: Let us talk about the Latin American business which of course is key to growth of the company. So after a soft year, first six months have been very good but can you just tell us expectation of soya bean. Soya bean continues to be in a very sweet spot in Brazil even now?


Jaidev Shroff: That is right. Soya bean has been buoyant. They had some increase in acreage in Brazil because of the additional demand from China and so, Brazil is doing very well. The season is in progress there, we have seen a little higher incidence of Asian rust disease in Brazil this year, this should lead well to for our portfolio where we have launched two more products for the protecting segment in Brazil in the last year. 

Both those products are patent protected and we expect substantial growth there. We will continue to track growth in South America as we have done for the first six months where we had a substantial growth.


ET Now: South Brazilian market is something where you have seen increasing demand for your product or market share gains?


Jaidev Shroff: Yes, so Arysta has been traditionally very strong with the cooperative sector and that gives us a much bigger footprint in that area. Once the deal is done, that will help us gain market share there. We have a very strong presence in the large farm segment in Mato Grosso and the big southern area. This deal will just further strengthen our presence in other crops like vegetables and fruit growing areas including sugarcane which will give us a whole new portfolio and help us continue to grow.


ET Now: If we look at the markets or investors of the company, they would be worried about two things; with the sort of global trade war that is going on, what can be an impact for a company like you and with the sort of currency moves that is going around the world. The way it is going, it could have a big impact, not on your business but on your margins. So how are you arresting that?


Jaidev Shroff: I think UPL is a global business, Arysta is also a global business, we have been doing business globally our presence around the world in 132 countries. We understand the risk management in terms of managing currency risks and we have been in Argentina for the last 25 years and they have had so many shocks. We always manage to adjust and deal with the challenges. 

The farmers buy our products when they need them and they pay the value for what they need and eventually if you look at the production of all, agricultural chemicals are primarily dollar denominated markets or all the pricing is in dollars. Eventually all the suppliers adjust their prices in a crisis market. So in the short term, for a quarter, you could have an issue. But over a period or a year, you always adjust prices to deal with the currency impact and that is normally a pass-through in our industry. So we do not see that as a major impact. You always have an impact in one quarter or it depends when the currency hits in the middle of the season. You cannot change prices immediately but post that, you adjust and farmers understand that and farming companies too understand.


ET Now: Your company’s mantra has been to give low price, good quality products which will make their ways and inroads towards various farmers across the world. That continues to be the growth mantra and is leading to market share gains.


Jaidev Shroff: Absolutely. I think when there is a crisis, farmers trade down a little bit and UPL is there to gain from that. We really offer value proposition with the best technology available and with a very strong manufacturing base, we are able to be competitive and give value to the farmers. Typically we have been able to gain market share in almost every market we have been present in the last 15-20 years. Why should we give that up?"

Technical & Alternate Strategist, Indianivesh Securities
Technical analysts expect the Nifty to find support between 10,600 and 10,700 in the short term, and said that the index is likely to face resistance in the 10,900-11,000 zone. Oil and gas, capital goods, metals and banking sectors are expected to show strength in the coming weeks, they said.


Where we are: The index sustained the intermediate supports of 10,350 and rebounded until 10,985. However this appears to be the on-going pullback which commenced from the lows made October 2018, which could possibly get capped at 11,000 levels.


What is in store: Intermediate supports for the week going ahead are placed at 10,650-10,600. On breach of these levels, bears will attempt to break 10,350 levels and continue to oscillate lower until 10,200. Stocks that have posted a similar pullback to Nifty index are TCS, Titan, UPL and Zee Entertainment. These stocks witnessing pullback now have their upside capped and could witness a fresh leg of correction that could possibly unfold on the lower side. These corrections would initially have a 10 per cent leg on the lower side.


What should investors do: Within the pharma sector, Biocon at current market price of Rs 621 has a limited upside. The stock is now gearing up to break the intermediate supports of Rs 610-600 levels. On a decisive break below Rs 600, bears could gear up for extended move until Rs 580-570 levels.

Stocks that are bullish on higher time frame charts mainly quarterly/ yearly and could possibly continue to march towards the northern trajectory are Bata and L&T. Bata at current price of Rs 1,116 has a initial target of Rs 1,300-1,350 and L&T which is poised to post the highest close after 2017 has a target of Rs 1,800. However, stock prices hold the potential to travel beyond Rs 2,000 mark. Similarly UBL at current of Rs 1,348 could post a highest close, well above 2017 highs. Initial target for the stock is at Rs 1,550-1,600 level."

Four of Anil Ambani-led firms – Reliance Power, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital and Reliance Nippon, all of which are a part of the BSE Midcap index – saw 45-46 per cent erosion in market value during the year. They together made a Rs 30,489 crore dent to investor pockets, with the promoter himself taking a Rs 20,000 crore hit.

Wadhawan Group firm Dewan Housing Finance Corporation lost 60 per cent of its market value during the year, shaving Rs 4,300 crore off promoter group wealth.

Data showed 45 of 104 BSE Midcap index constituents declined anywhere between 20 per cent and 60 per cent, eroding Rs 3,00,000 crore worth of market value during the year. Of this amount, nearly 65 per cent, or Rs 1.94 lakh crore has gone from promoters’ pockets.

The midcap space witnessed bouts of selling pressure through the year mainly due to frothy valuations, introduction of additional surveillance mechanism (ASM) for volatile stocks by the stock exchanges and a Sebi move to recategorise stocks in terms of market capitalisation for mutual fund schemes.

As of Monday, the average market cap of the index constituents had fallen to Rs 13,000 crore from Rs 19,700 crore at the end of 2017. The fall in the midcap stocks has, meanwhile, eased concerns over unjustified valuation premium that these stocks were trading at the start of 2018.

“At the bottom of the cycle in 2013, the Nifty Midcap index was trading at a 700-bps discount to Nifty on a trailing basis. But in January 2018, it traded at a 2,200 bps premium to the Nifty. A part of it has come down,” Hiren Ved of Alchemy Capital Management told ETNOW in an interview.

Ved said it will never go back to those discount levels. Optically, valuations look expensive as a lot of the PSU banks have reported losses, leading to a contraction in the premium that midcaps enjoyed over the largecaps. 

Brokerage JM Financial said many of the midcaps and smallcaps have fallen below their long-term averages and are trading at a discount to their largecap peers. “However, the earnings expectations remain elevated and, hence, we continue to prefer largecaps,” the brokerage said in a note.

This brokerage likes midcaps such as Alembic Pharma, CanFin Homes, Fine Organics and JK Lakshmi, among others.

Some of the popular midcap stocks like Reliance |Capital (down 62 per cent), KIOCL (61 per cent), Dewan Housing (60 per cent), NBCC (56 per cent) and Motilal Oswal Financial Services (56 per cent) eroded up to 62 per cent of investor wealth during the year. Wockhardt, Emami, NLC India, Blue Dart, Bharat Forge and Tata Global Beverages are other index stocks, which hurt investors most during the year.

Kajaria Ceramics, Oberoi Realty, Teamlease, UPL, V-Guard and Westlife are other name that disappointed investors.

“My sense is, there may be more pain left. Some smallcaps and 
midcaps may bounce back from their absolute lows, but over the next two-to-three years, the market will be led by largecaps and larger midcaps,” Ved said.

Kotak Institutional Equities, however, said one may still look at midcaps from auto & auto components, banks, capital goods, diversified financials and gas utilities segments."

1,2019-01-07,Phosphorus Limited,"Mumbai: Global private equity funds KKR & Co and Blackstone Group and two local companies, Godrej Agrovet and American private equity fund TPG Capitalbacked United Phosphorus Ltd (UPL), have put in independent bids to acquire a controlling 57.7% stake in agrochemicals maker Gharda Chemicals, according to two people with direct knowledge of the development.

The stake held by scientist RA Mashelkar-led Gharda Medical & Advanced Technologies Foundation (GMATF) in Gharda could be worth anything between Rs 5,600 crore and Rs 6,000 crore. The demand includes the non- compete fee and the control premium, with the debt-free company being valued at Rs 9,500 crore.

The debt-free Gharda Chemicals could rake in a valuation of more than 14 times its operating profit.

Gharda Chemicals posted an operating profit of Rs 683 crore on revenue of Rs 2,608 crore in fiscal 2018.

Based on that, the valuation could be around Rs 9,500 crore. Around 10% of Gharda Chemicals is owned by its employees and the rest by minority shareholders.




“The talks are on for sometime and we are not sure whether the deal will be concluded soon as Gharda faces several litigations due to alleged pesticide poisoning,” said one of the fund managers who is in discussions for the stake.

In 2017, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the deaths of farmers due to pesticide poisoning and an FIR had been lodged against Gharda Chemcials as its pesticide named 'Police’ was among those used by farmers. The report is yet to be submitted to the government.

Spokespersons for Blackstone, TPG and KKR declined to comment.

Mails sent to UPL, Godrej Agrovet and Gharda Chemicals did not elicit any response until the publication of this report.

For the strategic buyers such as Godrej Agrovet, acquisition of Gharda will give a beachhead in the agrochemcials and crop-protection market as well as entry into the veterinary drug segment.

Godrej Agrovet Limited is a leader in areas of animal feed, crop protection, oil palm, dairy and poultry and processed foods. In crop protection, UPL has a strong presence with a range of fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, biopesticides and crop nutrition.

ET reported on September 19 about the plans of Gharda Medical & Advanced Technologies Foundation to sell its 57.5% in agrochemicals maker Gharda Chemicals.

The not-for-profit GMATF plans to use the proceeds to build a pipeline of innovative products and technologies for the chemical and metal industry.

After the US, Japan and China, India is the fourth-largest producer of agrochemicals. It is valued at $4.1 billion and is expected to grow at 8.3% to reach $8.1billion by FY25, according to a FICCI 2018 report."

12,2019-01-11,Phosphorus Limited,"MUMBAI: Stocks of agrochemical makers are poised for a robust recovery after three years, and companies such as Insecticides India, Excel Crop Care, Sharda Cropchem, Dhanuka Agritech, Rallis India and Monsanto India could give returns as high as 50 per cent in the next one year, according to analysts.

“The agrochemical Industry is showing signs of recovery after three years, with acceleration in sales growth and profits led by an increase in the global agro chemical industry, rising exports and (more) pest infestation due to global warming,” said Prashant Biyani, analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher. “Better timing and spatial distribution of rainfall, higher pest incidence via-avis last year, and steps by the government to improve farm income are expected to increase the application of agrochemicals.”

These firms were under pressure for the last few years mainly because of spatial distribution of rainfall, lower than expected pest incidence, supply constraints, and a persistent increase in raw material prices.

Some of the stocks have already been bought by fund managers and high networth investors in the last few weeks on expectations of a turnaround in the sector. Shares of Insecticides India rallied 49 per cent in the last three months, while UPL has surged 24 per cent during this period. PI Industries and EID Parry gained 15 per cent each in three months.

Indian companies are currently expanding capacities in a calibrated manner and enquiries from MNCs are fast turning into actual transactions, aiding topline growth and higher utilization for technical manufacturers, said analysts.

“As (the effects of) industry consolidation, higher channel inventory of finished goods and the spill-over effects of two consecutive weak monsoons are behind us, we believe that a recovery in the agro-chemical market is in the offing,” said Archit Joshi, analyst, HDFC Securities. “With a strong product pipeline and an expected recovery in CRAMS/CSM (new chemistries and verticals), we believe that the Indian crop protection market is on a recovery mode.”

FICCI estimates the size of the Indian agrochemical industry to double to $8.1 billion by 2025.


“The availability of cheap labour and low processing costs offer opportunities for both domestic companies and MNCs to set up manufacturing hubs in India for their export markets,” said Prabhudas Lilladher’s Biyani."
15,2019-01-14,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty turned downbeat on Monday as investors chose to stay on the sidelines ahead of key inflation data. 

Uninspiring December quarter earnings and indecisive global cues have prompted players to offload their risky bets and eye safe haven assets instead. 

Most Asian peers too lost their way ahead of Chinese trade data. 

Investors now wait for the earnings trajectory to get a sense of the economy's direction. 

Under these circumstances, how to position yourself? Market experts suggest a stock-specific approach. 

Based on the suggestions of analysts, below are nine stocks that can fetch you solid returns in the next 2-3 weeks. Let's take a look.

Tech Mahindra| Buy| Target price: Rs 775| Stop loss: Rs 675

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

ITC| Buy| Target price: Rs 322| Stop loss: Rs 280

""Positional traders are advised to buy into this counter at the current market price and add further on dips around Rs 287 and look for an initial target of Rs 322. Stop loss suggested for the stock is below Rs 280,"" said Mohammad.


Hindalco| Buy| Target price: Rs 220| Stop loss: Rs 200
This counter appears to be stabilising around Rs 200 after retracing 80 per cent of its last leg of the rally from the lows of Rs 192–259 as it registered an opening Marubozu formation in which opening and day’s low of price remains same suggesting domination of buyers.

Besides, on lower timeframe chart, it chalked out a channeled move in last 30 sessions and almost tested the demand of the said channel with a low of Rs 203 couple of sessions back. Sustaining above Rs 203, it shall eventually head to test its bearish gap zone of Rs 219–221 registered on January 2. 


Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities

UPL| Buy| Target price: Rs 865| Stop loss: Rs 728
UPL has moved into a broader sideways range movement in the last few weeks, after witnessing a sharp upmove during October-November 2018. Currently, the stock price is making an attempt to stage upside breakout of the larger consolidation pattern at Rs 780-790 levels.

Volume has started to rise during upside movement in the stock and weekly 14-period RSI is currently showing a positive signal for the upside momentum. ""One may look to buy UPL at the current market price, look to add more on dips down to Rs 750 and hold for the upside target of Rs 865 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 728,"" Shetti said.

14,2019-01-14,Phosphorus Limited,"Lower range expectations for Nifty favour selling strangles with an eye on 10,800 and 11,000 serving as stop loss points, according to technical analysts. They are positive on stocks such as ITC, UPL, Biocon, Amara Raja Batteries and Infosys, which have potential upside of over 5 per cent.


SANDEEP PORWALTECHNICAL ANALYST, ASHIKA STOCK BROKING

Where we are: The tussle between bulls and bears continues. Nifty is trading sideways with an unusual rise in the volatility, keeping market participants baffled about the trend direction. Despite the best efforts by the bulls, Nifty ended the week at 10,795, below its 100-and 200-DMA placed at 10,856 and 10,803 respectively.

What is in store : Sluggish momentum has become a point of worry, since time & again no major follow-up is seen. Price is oscillating with in a symmetrical triangle (Daily Chart).

Some silver lining is visible since all the minor dips are being bought into and price action formed sequential higher bottoms. In the current series highest OI concentration is seen at 11,000 CE while the open interest in put option is at 10,500 strikes. In all, we expect rise in the volatility likely to persist while directional trigger is expected once Nifty stages a breakout of prevailing trading range i.e. 11,000-10,500.

What investors could do: Among sectors, we are positive on IT, FMCG & Pharma. Accumulation is advised given the favourable risk reward ratio. In a scenario of sideways trading range, we expect stock specific actions to continue. We have positive view on ITC, UPL, Biocon, Amara Raja Batteries and Infosys, and expect a potential upside of over 5 per cent. On the other hand we expect followup correction in Indusind Bank given that price closed below 50-DMA placed at 1,562.


ANAND JAMESCHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, GEOJIT FINANCIAL SERVICES

Where we are: The excruciatingly tight range so far in January series has kept Nifty traders stifled. Especially so, given the directional moves seen during the last six months. With December elections behind us, markets are looking forward to fresh cues for build-up. The onset of the earnings season need to been seen from this perspective.

What is in store: The recent consolidation has drawn up a triangular pattern in charts, hinting at continuation of the bullish move from the October bottom. However, sharp decline in Nifty ATM volatility since November suggests that we are in for an extended period of consolidation. The 30-day volatility has nearly halved during this period. It is fair to say that, we are not yet in a “buy, if Nifty breaks above…” kind of stage yet. Option traders meanwhile have marked 11,000 as an important resistance, having built up call shorts consistently at this level. Next major activity is seen at the 10,800 puts, where build up in longs is seen. There is also rise in activity in deep put OTM strikes of 10,500 and 10,000, which suggests that the surprise quotient is skewed on the positive side.

What investors could do: Lower range expectations for Nifty favour selling strangles with an eye on 10,800 and 11,000 serving as stop loss points. But with earnings on, and with upcoming budget and elections, focus should rather be on sectoral plays. The swing back in state owned banks may be limited, consumption themes continue to be recommended, and we also like agrochemicals.


JAY PUROHITTECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES ANALYST, CENTRUM BROKING SECURITIES

Where we are: Market slipped into consolidation phase from last few days and prices have been vacillating within the territory of a Symmetrical Triangle as well as Diamond pattern on daily chart. Last week, Nifty moved in the range of 140 points and concluded the week where it started. Thus, we are witnessing formation of a Doji candle on weekly time scale, indicating indecisiveness among market participants.

What is in store: The recent up move in Nifty was not supported by fresh long positions as we didn’t witness noticeable open interest addition in January series, which is a sign of concern for the market. In Bank Nifty, the open interest increased significantly from start of January series and we are seeing some long unwinding from last two sessions. Also, Bank Nifty is forming a Bearish Harmonic Pattern called Bearish Bat pattern around 27,900 level. Overall derivative data and chart structure gives us a hint that upside is getting capped in Bank Nifty around 27,900–28,000 level and we may see some correction in banking index in coming days. The Nifty Midcap 100 index retested the breakdown trendline and started correcting. At current juncture, Nifty is not giving any directional trade and a close beyond the range of 10,700–10,930 would decide further trend for the market.

What investors could do: Considering the structure of BankNifty and Nifty Midcap 100 index; we are advising Nifty traders to book profit in long positions. However, fresh shorting can be done on a close below 10,700 mark for the target of 10,500 and 10,400 levels."

18,2019-01-17,Phosphorus Limited,"Japan’s MUFG Bank ( formerly Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ) has great expectations of India.

UPL chief executive Jai Shroff experienced this after Japan’s largest bank jumped right back into the arena when his talks with US’ Arysta LifeScience revived after a year in the summer of 2018.

There was a competing consortium of Citi, JP Morgan and ANZ jostling for the mandate. But MUFG offered to underwrite the entire $3 billion of debt at similar terms as before, as Shroff moved in for his boldest move — to make UPL the world’s fifth largest agro-chemicals and crop protection company.

He had walked out before over a slender valuation mismatch, though his prudence impressed the MUFG brass at its Mumbai office.

Having agreed to bankroll Shroff the entire $4.2-billion deal in debt financing the first time round, MUFG officials were thrilled to again support India Inc’s largest cross-border acquisition since 2008.

This time, Shroff had also swung blue-chip backers such as TPG Capital and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, armed with an equity cheque of $1.2 billion.

Even then, just before the deal was to close, UPL decided to switch the 18-month bridge loan to a 5-year facility, due to an uncertain bond market. “Technically, it’s a whole new review for long term,” recalls Anand Vora, chief financial officer, UPL. “Still, in less than 48 hours, MUFG were ready to give us the sanction letter. They were very prompt.”

Eventually, MUFG and the agrifocused Rabobank were to walk away with the bragging rights.

The story is somewhat similar to when Aurobindo Pharma founder Ramprasad Reddy was announcing the biggest cross-border acquisition by any Indian pharmaceuticals company in September 2018 — a $900-million acquisition of the dermatology and oral solids business of Sandoz, generics arm of Swiss big pharma Novartis in the US. Again, MUFG was ready to underwrite the entire amount solo, literally weeks after the UPL deal.


RISING SUN
India Inc clearly has a new financier, and for once, it’s not a Wall Street bank. Neither is it Swiss or a blueblooded British bankroller. For the first time, a Japanese bank that has been present in India for almost as long as the Tatas, has trumped competition to emerge as the premier debt house — G3 bonds and dollar loan syndication — among all foreign lenders on Mint Street in 2018, as per Bloomberg data.

To put rankings into perspective, MUFG was not even in the reckoning four years ago (See graphic). Be it a marquee client such as Reliance Industries and Tata Steel or mid-cap champions such as UPL, Bharti and Aurobindo, MUFG is the bank to bank on.

Corporate clients sense this strategic shift as India becomes the second most important market for the bank. Industry estimates put MUFG’s India business size at $13-14 billion, just by banking with larger corporates. This would be only second to a Standard Chartered Bank and far higher than a JP Morgan or Citi, say industry insiders.

With renewed aggression, competitive rates and a $2.8-trillion global balance sheet to lean on, MUFG is no longer the sleepy outfit it used to be in India. It is flexing muscles, hustling for deals, elbowing out competition and grabbing business in the hyper-competitive corporate banking market. It’s taking business, market and revenue share away from traditional powerhouses such as JP Morgan, Citi or even their investment banking peers, Goldman Sachs. Even the European counterparts such as UBS or Deutsche Bank, who have always leveraged their deep-rooted traditional private wealth linkages with clients to win chunky corporate accounts, are being steamrolled by this juggernaut.

 From offshore bonds, loans, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) or working capital needs, a new rainmaker with a fat cheque book is changing the old order. In any case, there are around 1,400 Japanese companies doing business in India. Servicing this vast pool itself gives MUFG natural business opportunities and growth. But the mandate is to spread far wider. “Speed is what is giving them the ability to grab deals,” says UPL’s Vora.

Till recently, Japan’s financial exposure to India was largely confined to extending yen-linked loans to infrastructure ventures. This has often been perceived as extended diplomacy, with traditional rival China emerging as an economic giant. Now, with a new set of assertive lenders like MUFG, ties between two of Asia’s oldest democracies are stronger and deeper.

Junsuke (John) Koike, regional executive (India & Sri Lanka), MUFG Bank, says, “Breaking all false perceptions and backed by a strong balance sheet, we have achieved top-ofthe-mind recall and are now among the top global banks on CFOs’ minds. This, to me, has been the real break out moment for us.”

“We have a large deposit base in Japan,” says Koike, “But also face the challenge of negative interest rates. However, our global network — including Morgan Stanley and our partner bank network in Asia — is unrivalled. It allows us to better support cross-border flows and investments. Besides, it is our proven diverse expertise in key business sectors that lands us on top of global league tables, and our long-term commitment that is valued by clients.”


GLOBALISED MANDATE
Nearly a decade ago, in a bold move towards globalising the franchise, MUFG ponied up $9 billion — weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed — to support Morgan Stanley at the height of the financial crisis. Buying a fifth of the storied Wall Street institution also helped create a counterweight to the difficulties besetting Japanese finance.
Since then, MUFG has expanded strategically across key markets through a string of acquisitions in the US, Thailand, Indonesia and even Vietnam to emerge as a global banking powerhouse.

The symbiotic Morgan relationship is also paying rich dividends. “MUFG is a pure play commercial bank, while Morgan Stanley a thoroughbred investment bank. So, there is hardly a conflict,” says a competing banker.

If MUFG lends to a client, Morgan Stanley can leverage that by doing an M&A, bond or equity trade for them to win fees, says the head of a European corporate and investment bank. Access to deeper pockets without merging helps Morgan Stanley compete alongside rivals with much bigger balance sheets, while the Japanese lender can finance transactions outside Japan and earn a higher rate of interest than comparable home market credits.

“We prioritise and approach a lot of big clients together to offer the full suite of advisory and financing solutions across many situations,” adds Aisha De Sequeira, co-country head, Morgan Stanley (India). “It works seamlessly. We are not just connecting at country level, but across borders in multiple jurisdictions, and across different product areas. Clients see us as a team and that’s the biggest external validation one can get.”

For example, all loans for Tata Steel Europe have been backed by MUFG, while Morgan Stanley has been the investment bank for bonds and won the advisory mandate for their European joint venture.
“One is a pure play commercial bank, the other a pure play investment bank. So there is hardly a conflict except in bonds, where they compete,” highlights another US bank chief executive.

 From 2016, MUFG started getting repeat mandates from clients.

“It validated that we were not there just for tokenism. From leading the acquisition of Cipla’s Invagen buyout to providing a very large single commitment to UPL in 2018, we have been at the forefront of most of India Inc’s cross-border M&A funding needs in recent years,” points out Shashank Joshi, head, global corporate banking, MUFG Bank (India).

Last April, MUFG helped raise some $500 million for Reliance Jio Infocomm from the Samurai loan market for seven years, the biggest such deal by an Asian corporate borrower and a first for the corporate. Even public sector units such as NTPC have relied on similar 11-year Samurai loans, the longest tenure external commercial borrowing in recent years.

“MUFG is one of Reliance’s tier-I relationships and we value it immensely,” says Alok Agarwal, chief financial officer, Reliance Industries. “They work with us across all debt products. I appreciate their professional approach, responsiveness and commitment to building a long-term relationship.”
A large part of this is also on account of a conscious diversification of senior talent across geographies. With more feet on the street and senior local talent like Joshi — former Citi and HDFC banker — MUFG’s comfort level has compounded, be it for governance and accounting standards or disclosures.

“Don’t underestimate the power and growing equity of Indian corporate houses these days,” says a Mumbai-based promoter, who is also a senior member of the Forbes billionaires club. “You can have relationships and access to senior management much better than China or Brazil and certainly Russia. As a community, our corporates too are far more comfortable dealing with the foreign banking community than before, as they globalise even more.”

PHARMA FAMILY
Indian pharmaceuticals, especially, has seen the strongest support from the bank. Over the past three years, MUFG has led underwriting of almost all outbound M&A financing in the sector, with aggregate commitments in excess of $10 billion — most on sole basis. The ability to underwrite large tickets is down to its strategic focus on pharma and healthcare, like technology and oil and gas.

Bank sources say even Malaysia’s IHH Berhad had approached the bank in 2017 for Fortis, though MUFG declined to comment on specifics, citing client confidentiality.

Dedicated teams with deep industry knowledge and a specialised M&A finance practice in the US, Europe and Asia help MUFG. Startups are next on the agenda.

“In many outbound M&As, they have been one of the more aggressive banks. If they trust the promoters, they are willing to fund any part of the capital structure. They are Japanese and so, very diligent in their risk assessment. But once they are confident, they will back you to the hilt,” says Sharvil Patel, managing director, Zydus Cadila.

With Morgan, the Japanese bank is storming the global M&A sweepstakes as well. The latest success story is Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $74-billion acquisition of Celgene announced this month, where MUFG and Morgan Stanley are underwriting the entire $33.5-billion bridge commitment. This comes on the back of MUFG acting as initial underwriter on recent multi-billion dollar deals such as the Takeda-Shire transaction ($38 billion), Cigna-Express Scripts ($27 billion) and Beckton Dickinson-CR Bard ($24 billion) takeovers.


MONEY FOR EVERYTHING
The competition, however, argues that MUFG — like several Japanese majors — has an undue advantage. Their strategy has been to throw balance sheet. For many, it just does not make sense. “Their cost of funds is cheap because they are sitting on billions of domestic savings. So, they are happy lending even at tight pricing. Their selection of credit is much better but appetite to write larger cheques is much higher,” quips a senior corporate banker from a storied European bank. “Our (European) banks will not allow that if there is no potential of other fee-generating businesses such as M&A or bonds.”


Bloomberg
What he means is that typically, American or European banks try to sell down a loan to a syndicate of lenders from day I, or finalise terms of the loan after gauging market appetite for such a paper. “Japanese banks, after understanding business and associated risks, will underwrite from their own balance sheet. Then, at the opportune moment, they bring in others,” explains a senior auto sector executive.

While rubbishing rivals’ theories, Joshi argues that the test in any deal is the distribution of your underwriting position. “Our success in distributing all large deals profitably validates the bigger bets we have taken,” he says.


Bloomberg
MUFG’s corporate banking India chief finds support in several finance professionals, who feel the cost of dollar funding is often higher for Japanese institutions than large traditional banks. Yet, they are winning over market share.

“Everyone buys dollars in the global market,” says an executive from a top tier conglomerate. “It’s not that they are throwing their depositors’ money away. It is, at best, the same, or in some cases higher, by a few basis points compared to western banks. Those who hide behind such excuses do not understand global loans or currency markets.”"
19,2019-01-21,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Indian headline indices Sensex and Nifty looked up for the fifth consecutive session on Monday, driven by select heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Infosys and Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

Optimism stemming from Q3 earnings of blue chips, including RIL and HDFC Bank, and positive global cues created positive vibes. 

World markets did not disappoint as investors felt that China will come out with more stimulus measures to revive its economy. The world's second biggest economy grew 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis, Reuters reported. 

Monday's trade remained stock-specific as out of a total 31 stocks, including Tata Motors DVR in the Sensex index, only 11 posted gains and 20 suffered losses. 

However, the gains in the likes of RIL (up 4.36 per cent), Kotak Bank (up 2.42 per cent), Infosys (up 1.61 per cent) and HDFC Bank (up 0.72 per cent) gave Sensex a lift of 192 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 36,578.96.

The Nifty closed higher by 55 points, or 0.50 per cent, at 10,962, with 17 stocks up and 33 down.

Midcaps and smallcaps, however, failed to perform big today as the indices closed with a loss of 0.56 per cent and 0.70 per cent, respectively.


We walk you through the highlights of Monday's session:

RIL m-cap surges Shares of Reliance Industries extended their gains to the second consecutive session today. In the two-day rally, the stock has jumped almost 9 per cent while its market capitalisation rose by Rs 63,862 crore to Rs 7,82,505.28 crore on Monday, from Rs 7,18,643.5 crore last Thursday. The scrip closed 4.36 per cent up at Rs 1,234.50 on the BSE. Positive comments from top brokerages, following a strong December quarter earnings, have sparked strong buying in the stock.


Kotak Bank's Q3 in line
Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank settled 2.42 per cent up at Rs 1,267.30 after the private lender reported a 23 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in standalone profit at Rs 1,291 crore for the December quarter, slightly better than Rs 1,273 crore anticipated by analysts in an ETNow poll. The bank reported a healthy growth in net interest income (NII) while gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) eased on a sequential as well as yearly basis. 


HDFC Bank hits a sweet spot
Domestic as well as global brokerages maintained their bullish view on HDFC Bank after it posted 20 per cent growth in net profit for the third quarter ended December. CLSA maintained ‘Buy’ on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,730. JPMorgan has an ‘Overweight’ call on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 2,400. Edelweiss also maintained ‘Buy’ on HDFC Bank with a revised target price of Rs 2,530 from Rs 2,454. Shares of the company closed 0.72 per cent up at Rs 2,146.55.


Hudco surges 6% 
Shares of Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco) surged 5.59 per cent to Rs 45.35 after it reported strong set of December quarter numbers. The company's net profit jumped 27 per cent to Rs 328 crore in the third quarter against Rs 259 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. Revenue jumped 21.9 per cent at Rs 1,310.5 crore on a year-on-year basis.


LIC wraps up IDBI Bank buy 
In a BSE filing, IDBI Bank said LIC has completed acquisition of 51 per cent controlling stake in the bank, making it the lender's majority shareholder. The Cabinet had approved the acquisition of controlling stake by LIC as a promoter in IDBI Bank through a combination of preferential allotment and open offer of equity in August last year. However, the report failed to lift shares of IDBI Bank as the scrip closed 3.17 per cent down at Rs 56.50 on BSE, extending the losses to the third successive session.


Wipro slips 2%
Shares of Wipro closed 2.51 per cent down at Rs 337.50 as the company lowered margin guidance for its IT services business in the range of $2,047 million to $2,088 million for the March quarter, which translates into a flat 2 per cent sequential growth. Citi has advised that one should adopt a 'sell into strength' approach on the stock. Global brokerage CLSA has also retained sell rating given lack of convincing acceleration in growth. 


L&T shares wilt 
Shares of Larsen & Toubro closed in the red after market regulator Sebi turned down its Rs 9,000 crore share buyback offer. The scrip closed 0.31 per cent down at Rs 1,314.20. In a regulatory filing to stock exchanges on Saturday, L&T said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked it not to proceed with the proposed buyback of up to 6.1 crore shares at a price of Rs 1,475 per share, aggregating Rs 9,000 crore.


Hindustan Zinc shares slide 
Shares of Hindustan zinc closed 1.56 per cent down at Rs 268.15 after it reported a nearly 4 per cent fall in its net profit on a yearly basis. Net profit declined nearly 4 per cent to Rs 2,211 crore against Rs 2,298 crore a year ago. 


Energy pack wins big
With a gain of 2.68 per cent, the BSE Energy index led the pack of sectoral gainers. However, only seven out of the total 27 components of the index managed to log gains. Nevertheless, the index jumped, thanks to gains in heavyweight Reliance Industries. 

On the other hand, BSE Realty index fell 1.22 per cent, leading the pack of sectoral losers. Losses in shares of Indiabulls Real Estate (down 5.12 per cent), Prestige Estates Projects (down 2.98 per cent) and DLF (down 1.69 per cent) dragged the index most. Only three stocks - Mahindra Lifespace Developers (up 2.30 per cent), Sobha (up 0.58 per cent) and Phoenix Mills (up 0.21 per cent) - out of total 10 managed to settle in the green.


151 stocks with bearish slant
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 151 counters on the BSE, indicating that these stocks may fall or extend their fall in coming sessions. Among the stocks with bearish crossovers were South Indian Bank, Punjab National Bank, Reliance Capital, DLF, MCX, UPL and HEG. However, Hindalco, United Breweries, Future Lifestyle, Mahindra Logistics and Trent featured among 56 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on MACD charts.


Power Grid, Tata Power above 200-DMAs
Power Grid, Max Financial, Delta Corp, Allahabad Bank, Corporation Bank, Tata Power and Gujarat State Petronet featured among stocks that traded below their 200-DMAs. However, NIIT, FCS Software, Bal Pharma and INOX Leisure settled among the stocks that traded above their 200-DMAs."
21,2019-01-22,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Stocks in India may have gone up for five consecutive days, but dwindling market breadth remains a sticking point.

This was evident on Monday as Nifty50 heavyweight Reliance Industries led from the front. What was missing was broad based participation, which has made the market a bit cautious. 

That in a way suggests 97 stocks on the NSE could see correction in coming days, according to momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The technical indicator has signalled a downward crossover -- a sign of bearish undertone -- on these counters, hinting at possible downside. 

Many of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend. The list includes banking stocks such as South Indian Bank, Union Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and IDFC First Bank.

Adlabs Entertainment, GMR Infra, Reliance Power, Reliance Capital, DLF, Reliance Infrastructure and UPL too look vulnerable on technical charts. Torrent Power, Tata Global Beverages, Natco Pharma, MCX, EID Parry, Supreme Infra and Inox Wind PNC Infratech are a few other scrips that may see weakness in days ahead.









MACD -- the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages -- is known for indicating trend reversals in traded securities or indices. 

A nine-day exponential moving average called the signal line is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. When MACD goes above the signal line, it throws up a bullish sign, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice-versa.

Meanwhile, 24 stocks showed bullish crossover on the daily charts. These include SPARC, Hindalco Industries, HDFC, Omaxe, Trent, Thirumalai Chemicals, Mahindra Logistics and TTK Prestige.





The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio. Traders should use other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend, say analysts.

As far as the Nifty is concerned, only a few stocks such as Reliance Industries, Infosys, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank is driving the index.
“The broader market indices are diverging from the benchmark index for the last few sessions. Once the last leg of the pullback gets over, the Nifty is also likely to follow suit and can see lower levels,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan said.

Daily strength indicator RSI and momentum indicator Stochastic both are in a bullish mode, which supports the upside bias.

Short-term Nifty traders are advised to put their stop loss level below 10,880 on a closing basis, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.


UNDERSTANDING MACD
 A close look at the stock chart of Union Bank of India reveals that every time the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show a downward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 1.97 per cent lower at Rs 84.60."
20,2019-01-22,Phosphorus Limited,"The calendar year 2019 is expected to be volatile for markets. Important events such as Lok Sabha elections and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase the interest rates are expected to keep the markets volatile. Select growth in earnings in companies across market capitalisation would also add to the volatility of markets. Given such high level of uncertainty over the direction of markets, it makes sense to be with multicap mutual funds, which invest in companies of all sizes.

Among multi-cap schemes offered up by fund houses, Mirae Asset India Equity is one of the schemes which has met investors’ expectations consistently. The scheme is a good investment option because it invests in companies after careful consideration to financial performance, management bandwidth, corporate governance and return ratios. Its fund managers, Neelesh Surana and Harshad Borawake, have refrained from investing in companies which are momentum or short-term in nature. A few factors are borne in mind before selecting investments in companies. Companies should generate high cashflows, have pricing power in their sectors and their balance sheet should be relatively lighter than peers. This focus has paid off. In the past three- and fiveyear periods, the scheme has given 17% and 19% returns, while its benchmark index, S&P BSE200 TRI, has given 15% and 14% returns in the same period, respectively.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers have bought in companies which have demonstrated stability of earnings.

CFP, Roongta Securities
The scheme has high exposure to large-sized companies. Multi-cap funds are suited for investors in volatile markets. In the current year, events such as general elections would keep markets volatile. To deal with volatility, investors must consider investing in multi-cap funds. The fund has been one of the finest performers in its category beating its benchmark index and peers consistently both in bearish and bullish phases."

24,2019-01-30,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: While the relevance of the Union Budget has come down considerably post GST implementation, analysts say the forthcoming one, being the last budget before the general elections, could deliver a slew of populist measures that may give a lift to select stocks. 

The budget could have measures that would boost the fortunes of consumer-facing and labour-intensive sectors at least in the near term.

Farm distress would be a key focus area for the upcoming Budget, says Pankaj Murarka, Founder at Renaissance Investment Managers. The Budget may significantly increase rural outlay and provide a roadmap for universal basic income (UBI). 

""Agricultural and FMCG sectors would be key beneficiaries of increased rural outlay. Besides, tractor, two-wheeler and passenger vehicles segments should benefit from the government’s increased rural thrust,” Murarka said.


Agri, textile, footwear industries
Labour-intensive sectors will be in focus. In the case of agriculture sector, there are expectations of a hike in allocation under Gramin agriculture markets from Rs 2,000 crore Budget target in FY19.

The government may hike institutional credit limit for agriculture sector from Rs 11 lakh crore in FY19. There could also be a hike in allocation towards Krishi Sichai Yojana over Rs 2,600 crore budgeted for FY19.

Such developments will be positive for pipe, FMCG and auto sector companies, such as Finolex, HUL, Marico, M&M and Hero MotoCorp, says Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates.

The government might also cut customs duty on fertiliser to help rural people, Indiabulls Ventures said in a Budget note. This should benefit stocks like GSFC, UPL and Coromandel International.

For the labour-intensive textile industry, there may be a proposal for 10 per cent safeguard duty on import of silk fabric.

A reduction in import duty on textile machinery and GST rate on footwear priced above Rs 1,000 from 18 per cent to 12 per cent is likely. This should benefit textile and footwear stocks such as Bata, Relaxo Footwear, Himatsingka Siede, Trident, Arvind, Nitin Spinners, Siyaram Silk and KPR Mills.


Consumer-facing sectors, including banks
“Any measure like a package for the farm sector, tax relief or BPL pension will boost demand. Domestic consumption stocks like ITC, HUL, Britannia, Dabur and two-wheeler companies like TVS Motor can benefit from all of that,” Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Other than a boost to middle class, the auto sector is also seeking an extension of custom duty concession for electric vehicles. Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto and M&M could be beneficiaries.

Consumer-facing private lenders like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Bajaj Finance will gain from any boost to consumer spends. “Companies to play for farm package could be M&M, PI Industries and Coromandel International seem good bets,” it said.

A likely interest subvention scheme for MSMEs and increase in capital infusion for PSU banks could also help lenders. Any disciplined approach on fiscal deficit will benefit banks from stable yields and possibility of an anchor rate cut.

Any further boost to affordable housing may help housing finance companies such as HDFC and LIC Housing finance.


Infra to get a boost?
Religare Securities expects higher allocation to the infrastructure sector. For FY19, the government had increased allocation by 21 per cent to Rs 5.97 lakh crore. This included various schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). If such expectations materialise, they may swell order books of L&T, BHEL, Thermax, KEC International and Siemens, among others.

An increase in customs duty on power equipment may boost Thermax, while any increase in allocation to defence may bring stocks of BEML, BEL, Bharat Forge and Bharat Dynamics into focus.

Higher fund allocation for development of rural infrastructure and large infrastructure projects such as bullet trains, Bharatamala, Sagarmala, Smart Cities, Inland Waterways development and towards PMAY for both rural and urban areas could help all infrastructure players.


Cement, steel cos eye custom duty cuts
Any drop in custom duty on pet coke, currently at 10 per cent, will be positive for cement companies. Power and fuel costs account for 30 per cent of the total cost for these businesses. This will also be positive for steelmakers. A reduction in customs duty on graphite electrodes (GE) from 7.5 per cent to nil and imposition of 30 per cent export duty, if materialises, could boost shares of HEG and Graphite India.


Real estate seeks respite
There are expectations that GST rates will be cut to 5 per cent for under-construction properties from 12 per cent at present. A rationalisation of taxes could increase demand for under-construction properties, said Religare Securities.


Others
Higher disposable income in the hands of taxpayers would be a positive for insurance companies. Jewellery stocks may hog limelight if the government cuts import duty on gold from 10 per cent to 4 per cent. Higher disinvestment targets may have a bearing on PSU stocks."

1,2019-02-04,Phosphorus Limited,"UPL has been growing at a CAGR of about 15%, whereas the industry has been growing at about 4-4.5%
  . Vikram 
   
   Shroff, Executive Director, Sameer Tandon, Director-India, and Anand Vora, CFO, UPL, talk to ET Now. Edited excerpts:


UPL has completed acquisition of Arysta LifeScience in a $4.2-billion cash deal. That is a huge deal? Why did you go for scaling up to this degree?

Vikram Shroff: First of all let us give a little bit of the background, the global agrochemical industry has been consolidating. Size does matter in our industry for launching new molecules, for having economies of scale, for the registration pipeline and things like that. So, you need to be of a critical size. Also, UPL has put together about 40 different acquisitions. 

We have been looking at various companies from time to time, Arysta was a very exciting opportunity that came to us and we are very happy that the acquisition has gone through. Arysta adds a lot of good points to us -- the complementarity of geographies, the product portfolio, their huge strength in biological and new actives so these are the kind of things that really help us. 

Talking specifically about the benefits, the acquisition was closed on 1st February. We still need to do a little bit more of a deep dive. In the next 12 to 24 months, we expect a lot of the benefits from the synergies to start kicking in.


Gharda Chemicals is another name which comes up on your radar. What is your take there?

Vikram Shroff: We look at every company that comes our way but our practice is never to comment on it or never to get excited because if things happen, it happens. We have a new board and all these decisions will go through that whole process. It is far away. I do not think there is anything that is going to happen any soon. There are companies in US, China that we are always engaging with. So, acquisition is part of our DNA but there is nothing that is going to be announced soon. We have a lot of good things to do and the final decision will be with the board.


Is the agrochemical space looking right now? There are a few companies which have become very large in the last couple of years. How are you seeing things develop and change from here on?

Sameer Tandon: Agriculture is improving and the consumer is demanding better quality and that is what is leading to companies like us, Vikram just told you that Arysta was a very big biological business. What we want to do is bring this biological and chemicals together to complement the offer for the farmer, so that he should be not only be able to produce but produce a very good quality, which is of global standards. That is something which is being differentiated. 

At UPL, we have done much better than our peers. We have been growing at a CAGR of about 15%, whereas the industry has been growing at about 4-4.5%. So, we have done much better than our peers in this industry.


Let us put the spotlight on the numbers because numbers did make a lot of people nervous. An Indian company going ahead and buying out such a large company, does it makes sense? 

Anand Vora: First, let us get the record straight. We have done about 40 odd acquisitions and very successfully integrated all of them. Needless to mention, this is a big one but we are very confident. The more we know about Arysta now, as we have access to data and financial information, the more do we get excited because there is so much complimentary business and opportunities to work together, that we feel it has been a perfect fit as far as UPL is concerned."

8,2019-02-07,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Headline equity indices Sensex and Nifty ended flat on Thursday after seesaw trade as RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) lowered the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent in a surprise move and changed its policy stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘calibrated tightening’. 

The market was expecting a change in policy stance, but the rate cut came as a surprise. The market swung between gains and losses after the RBI move that economists say can give a boost to the domestic economy. 

However, after an initial knee-jerk response, the market turned stock-specific and remained so for the rest of the session. Sensex closed 4 points down at 36,971, while Nifty settled with a nominal gain of 7 points at 11,069.

Gains in shares of Sun Pharma, ITC, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Auto were offset by losses in Reliance Industries, HDFC and Larsen & Toubro in the 30-pack Sensex.

Global cues, too, were lacklustre. However, rupee's rise against the US dollar and a fall in crude oil prices offered some relief for the market. 


Let's take a look at highlights of Thursday's session:

Chalet Hotels gains on listing dayShares of Mumbai-based Chalet Hotels closed 3.71 per cent higher after listing at 5 per cent at Rs 290 on BSE against an issue price of Rs 280.

Grasim gains 3% post Q3 numbersShares of Grasim Industries closed 2.90 per cent higher at Rs 753.20 after the company reported a 76 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated December quarter profit at Rs 958 crore.

With only a few months left for the general elections, the Modi government has expectedly announced some measures to provide relief to distressed farmers and individual taxpayers in the recent Interim Budget.

Budgetary allocations were also announced for farmers, the middle class and small and medium enterprises, and they are expected to boost consumption and investor sentiments.

RBI's recent surprise decision to cut interest rates by 25 bps is a pre-election stimulus gift from the central bank for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. With the general elections scheduled for May amid a host of global factors, there could be heightened volatility in the market. As history repeats itself, the stock market always favours a stable government and good economic reforms.

At present, investors are factoring in a BJP win in the 2019 general elections. If the outcome is in the favour of the BJP, this is likely to push the market higher. The basic growth drivers of the Indian economy will always remain in the limelight no matter which government comes to power. 

Also, global cues will continue to impact the Indian stock market, before and after the elections. As global volatility and the fact that India gets a reasonable part of foreign flows as part of emerging economies, a decisive government at the Centre would boost further flows.

The pre-election phase seems to be creating an opportunity to create wealth. At this juncture, investors should use this chance to build a solid portfolio of quality stocks that have attractive valuation and bright fundamentals for the long term. Largecap stocks are better placed than midcap and smallcap stocks to fare relatively better in times of volatility. Largecap stocks may help investors create wealth without taking extra risks or exposing themselves to volatility. 

Sectors such as infrastructure, cement, automobile, capital goods, FMCG and other sectors will remain key focus of the government, no matter which party forms government at the Centre. On the earnings front, growth estimate for FY 2019-20 remains positive on the back of an expected recovery in corporate banks’ profitability and a revival in the investment cycle.

The crisis in NBFC companies should boost profitability of corporate banks in the near term. Long-term investors can look at stocks like Reliance industries, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, L&T, HUL, M&M, Bajaj-Auto, UltraTech Cement and UPL."
10,2019-02-11,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Broadening worries of global economic slowdown and US-China trade frictions put a dampener on investor sentiment as headline indices Sensex and Nifty fell early Monday.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Sunday warned governments to prepare for an economic storm as growth undershoots expectations. 

A new round of trade talks is to begin in Beijing today after recent negotiations yielded no breakthrough. The wait for a deal between the two parties is making investors wary, analysts said. 

The Sensex slipped over 180 points and the Nifty touched 10,875-mark within the first 15 minutes of the Monday's session. Around 9:35 am, the BSE Sensex came off 151 points at 36,395 while the Nifty was 64 points lower at 10,879.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist, technical research and trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in
Lupin| Buy| Target price: Rs 890| Stop loss: Rs 797This counter appears to be repeatedly attracting buying interest around Rs 800 level, as pointed out by the long lower shadows of the last three sessions.

After the recent fall from around Rs 1,200 level, this counter has been consolidating around Rs 980 for the last couple of sessions and appears to be positioning itself for a pullback.

An intermediate uptrend in the stock over the last many months, as per the positive sequence of higher tops and bottoms, can be seen. Last week’s upside breakout was associated with a spurt in volume. ""With positive chart pattern, one may look to buy Divi's Labs at the current market price and should add more on dips to Rs 1,605,"" said Shetti.Bata India| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,365| Stop loss: Rs 1,105After showing a minor downward correction in the previous week, the stock has bounced back smartly last week to close higher.

Bharti Airtel| Buy| Target price: Rs 335| Stop loss: Rs 300The stock is witnessing a bottoming out formation as it has been making a rounding pattern.

14,2019-02-14,Phosphorus Limited,"With an eye on Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans to conclude agriculture and energy deals with Argentina when he hosts President Mauricio Macri on a state visit between February 17 and 19. 

India hopes to benefit from Argentine agriculture sector, a strong pillar of local economy, besides tapping natural gas deposits in the Latin American country. Argentina has the world's second highest shale gas reserves after the USA. The Indo-Argentine agriculture deal could contribute to food security in India. 

Further, the two sides are expected to conclude a slew of deals in a variety of sectors including defence and high-tech, according to informed sources. ET has learnt that that the two sides are planning to conclude around 10 pacts during the visit taking forward momentum in ties since Modi’s trip to Buenos Aires last November for the G-20 Summit.

Argentina, which produces Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) and has the world's second highest lithium reserves, is eyeing the Indian market. A defence delegation will visit Buenos Aires soon after the presidential visit to finalise defence partnerships. Argentinian LCA could be used for both light combat and advanced training. 

Macri's visit will also boost nuclear energy partnership which has made little progress since the bilateral deal was signed in 2009. A joint commission on nuclear energy will meet in Mumbai a day after Marci’s visit to concretise the agenda for partnership.

“The presidential visit is aimed at giving quality fillip to the Indo-Argentinian strategic partnership. The two sides are ready to cooperate in strategic areas like outer space and radars,” Argentine Ambassador to India Daniel Chuburu told ET.

Modi and Marci have developed good chemistry following their meetings. Interestingly, Macri, as a Mayor of Buenos Aires, had attended the 4th India-Latin America Business Conclave here in 2010. It should be noted that India and Argentina have supported each other on major international issues as well as each other´s candidatures to various UN and multilateral bodies. India has always extended support to Argentina on the sovereignty issue of Malvinas Islands and on the issue of sovereign debt servicing and holdout creditors, officials here told ET. 

Several Indian companies have established operations in Argentina with cumulative investments of approximately $1 billion. These include TCS, Crisil. Bajaj, Hero, Cellent (Aegis Essar), United Phosphorus Ltd (UPL), Glenmark and Godrej, among others. Argentine investment in India till 2017 stood at $120 million."
15,2019-02-16,Phosphorus Limited,"The pain was written all over the stock market's face as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty tumbled 2 per cent each during the past five sessions. 

While the BSE barometer took a beating of 738 points to settle at 35,809 for the week to February 15, its NSE counterpart lost 219 points to hit 10,724. The pessimism ran so high that the indices could not even manage a single positive close during the entire week. In fact, the Sensex had to put up with its longest losing streak in a year.

No major breakthrough in US-China trade dispute, mixed corporate earnings as well as a sharp selloff in select heavyweights dealt a blow to risk appetite. Sentiment turned fragile ahead of national elections due by May. 

“Serious attack against Indian security forces too weighed on investor sentiment on Friday. Expect volatility to increase further with investors turning cautious. Global developments like Brexit and US-China trade war and also Lok Sabha elections which is due in a few months will decide the trend of the market. In such a scenario, investors should focus on quality stocks and use price corrections to add fundamentally strong stocks,” said Hemang Jani, Head-Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

We will get you a snapshot of top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week. 


Yes Bank: Yes Bank shot up over 25 per cent this week, becoming the top gainer on the Nifty. The private lender gained traction after the Risk Assessment Report for FY18 observed nil divergences in the bank’s asset classification and provisioning from the RBI norms. However, the RBI has pulled up the private bank and warned of regulatory action for making public its observation, which it said was confidential. 


Jet Airways: Shares of Jet Airways came alive and climbed 2.99 per cent on Friday after its board approved a bank-led provisional resolution plan (BLPRP) that will pave the way for conversion of the airline’s debt into equity, making lenders the largest shareholders in the company. The scrip gained 3.20 per cent to Rs 232.60 for the week ended February 15.


CG Power: Shares of CG Power and Industrial Solutions on Wednesday declined over 32 per cent after the company said its consolidated net loss has widened to Rs 150.18 crore for the December quarter. However, the stock pared some losses and settled the week with a loss of 16.80 per cent at Rs 29.30.


A sweet dose: Sugar stocks hogged all the limelight on Friday after the government hiked the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar by Rs 2 per kg to Rs 31 to help millers clear farmers’ dues. A few sugar stocks made merry. Piccadilly Sugar and Allied Industries rose 10 per cent, Dhampure Speciality Sugars 4.93 per cent, Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals 4.72 per cent, Parvati Sweetners and Power 4.65 per cent and Gayatri Sugars 4.59 per cent. 

“The increase in MSP of sugar is positive for mills and expects the hike to improve the operating profit margins of sugar mills by around 6 per cent from the current levels and also aid them in clearing cane dues to farmers,” Icra said.


Top gainers and losers: Gujarat Narmada Valley (down 21.30) stood as a top loser in the BSE 500 pack. It was followed by Uflex (down 19.40 per cent), National Aluminium (down 17.80 per cent) and CG Power (down 16.80 per cent). On the other hand, Dilip Buildcon (up 33.60 per cent), Shankara Building Products (up 27.60 per cent), YES Bank (up 25.10 per cent) and Redington (India) up 21.50 per cent had a good week.


Stocks @ fresh 52-week lows/highs: As many as 118 stocks of the BSE500 index plumbed their fresh 52-week lows during the week. Some on the list included Gujarat Narmada Valley, Uflex, Rain Industries, Take Solutions, Natco, Sadbhav Engineering, Magma Fincorp, Tejas Network and Hindalco Industries. By contrast, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, UPL, Wipro, Bata India and Info Edge scaled fresh 52-week highs.


Sectoral update: Barring the BSE Power index (up 0.19 per cent), others closed in the red for the week under consideration. BSE Oil & Gas tanked the most 4.22 per cent, followed by Healthcare (down 3.93 per cent), Telecom (down 3.77 per cent) and Auto (3.59 per cent).


Nifty’s top loser: With a fall of over 9 per cent, Hindalco Industries was the top loser of the Nifty pack. The company came under pressure after it reported 34.39 per cent drop in its net profit at Rs 247.46 crore for the quarter through December as against Rs 377.14 crore a year earlier. 


IPO update: Neogen Chemicals has received capital market regulator Sebi's nod to float an initial public offering (IPO). With this, the total number of companies getting Sebi’s nod for public issues, including IPOs and FPOs, has reached seven so far in 2019. The stocks are proposed to be listed on the BSE and the NSE."

Asia’s dollar bond markets have staged a blistering rally this year, but for a group of borrowers that sit on the cusp of a junk rating, there’s no relief in sight.

As worsening global macro-economic conditions put firms under pressure, concerns over so-called fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that are cut to junk, are mounting in Asia and globally. Man Group, the world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund manager, warned investors in December of the “astonishing bubble” in BBB level debt.

The US-China trade war and jitters over a slowdown are prompting worries that weaker companies could falter. Moody’s Investors Service cut Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest wireless carrier, to junk earlier this month and downgraded five Asian companies in January, compared with two upgrades. A move to below investment grade raises borrowing costs and also prompts a wave of forced selling by investors who may be unable to hold junk securities.

“The macro picture remains a major headwind for the investment market,” said Arthur Lau, head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, who sees more fallen angels in the region this year. “Some of the companies are likely to face more margin pressure and operational challenges.”


Election Risk
Globally, an era of easy money has fuelled borrowers to take on leverage and they remain vulnerable to any tightening in liquidity. In Asia, major elections in countries like India could also throw up surprises for investors, and add to the volatility. At least eight Asian companies’ bonds were cut from investment grade to junk in 2018, an increase from four during the previous year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

Borrowers that are on the brink include India’s state-owned Power Finance Corporation and REC, which are both rated one step above junk by Moody’s and Fitch Ratings. Indian chemical giant UPL’s bonds are also on the edge of becoming non-investment grade.

“There are more issuers on the borderline with a worsening credit profile,” said Manjesh Verma, head of Asia credit sector specialists at Citigroup Inc. “We see rising fallen angel risks.”

Some of the bonds on the cusp of junk are “mispriced” and price declines would be “significant” if these companies drop to junk grade, Verma said."

25,2019-02-22,Phosphorus Limited,"MUMBAI: The stock market selloff may be overdone if the extent of shares that have fallen below a key technical indicator is anything to go by.

In the past, the market has rebounded whenever 400 stocks or 80 per cent of the BSE-500 index fell below the 200-day moving average (DMA) — a trend indicator.

After the drop in the markets — especially in mid- and small-cap shares — in the past five months, 101of BSE 500 stocks are currently trading above their 200 DMA. When an index or a stock closes below the 200-DMA, it is said to be in a long-term downtrend. But the indicator is also considered to be a reversal sign when too many stocks in an index fall below 200 DMA.

The findings are based on Edelweiss SAT-DMA Index, which shows the stocks trading above their 200 DMAs.

“The analysis revolves around the hypothesis that the market tends to bottom out when less than 20 per cent of BSE500 stocks are above the 200 DMA,” said Yogesh Radke, head of alternative & quantitative research, Edelweiss Securities.

But the rebound may not happen in a hurry. In the past 15 years, the market has remained sluggish for 46 days from the day when the SAT-DMA Index hits the 20 per cent mark.

“Going by history, the extrapolation indicates the likelihood of the market languishing for the next 40 days before resuming its upward trajectory,” Radke said.

The trend of SAT-DMA Index hitting the 20 per cent mark and a subsequent bounce-back was seen on six occasions in the past 15 years — June 2006, March-April 2008, February-March 2011, November-January 2012, August-September 2013 and February-March 2016.

The sell-off in the stock market has been on account of liquidity concerns in NBFCs, outflows by foreign portfolio investors, uncertainty ahead of elections and steep share valuations. Since September 1, the Sensex has declined 6 per cent, the mid-cap index has dropped 16 per cent and the small-cap has tumbled 22 per cent. The fall in Sensex and Nifty has been moderated by strength in a few bluechips.



Stocks in the BSE 500 index that are currently trading above 200 DMA include large-caps such as Wipro, Axis Bank, Reliance Industries, Infosys and Bajaj Finance, and mid-cap stocks, such as Bata India, Power Finance Corp, Aditya Birla Fashion, UPL and Divi’s Lab.

In the past, the BSE500 Index has dropped by 5 per cent on an average from the day the SAT-DMA Index hit the 20 per cent mark. As the SAT–DMA Index moved above 20 per cent, average returns are 7-8 per cent in the next 2-3 months and 25 per cent in the next year.

“The sharp correction especially in mid- and small-cap stocks is overdone and I believe Indian market will bounce back soon as the valuations of many quality stocks are attractive,” said Raamdeo Agrawal, joint MD, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “The current valuations of several quality stocks have improved the risk reward ratio in favour and offering a buying opportunity in the beaten down mid-cap and small-cap stocks.”"
26,2019-02-22,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Following the crowd usually takes you nowhere in the stock market. True!

But what do you make of the stocks that figure in portfolios of one after another mutual fund scheme? At the end of January, there were 78 stocks that were part of the portfolios of at least 100 mutual fund schemes, including ETFs, data from Ace Mutual Fund showed.

Don’t forget domestic institutional investors have become one of the key market drivers in recent years, having managed to cushion severe corrections every time there has been a big selloff by the overseas portfolio investors. 

Foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in Indian market, having offloaded shares worth over Rs 34,000 crore since January 2018. DIIs poured in some Rs 1,15,000 crore in the same period.

Not surprisingly, the list of 78 stocks includes the usual suspects. HDFC Bank is part of at least 535 mutual fund schemes; ICICI Bank 528 schemes, State Bank of India 465 schemes and Axis Bank 450 schemes.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

27,2019-02-22,Phosphorus Limited,"We still believe that in the banking space, some of the corporate facing private banks will be delivering better 
  
  
  numbers in coming quarters than what they have delivered in last three, four quarters, Siddharth Sedani, Head - Vice President - Equity & Portfolio Advisory, Anand Rathi, tells ET Now. Havells and UPL are Sedani’s top midcap picks.Edited excerpts: 

What to do with aviation amidst reports that SBI and PNB are going to provide emergency funding of Rs 500 crore to Jet Airways? With crude prices spiking up to a three-month high, would you find comfort in any of the aviation names?
Aviation space is not at all meant for investments. Technical trading and short-term positional calls can always be taken but for investment purposes, it is complete a no-no because crude is a very big factor which impacts the entire space. We know that crude has come up from $50 to $65 odd today. This would be definitely hurting all these companies. 

Despite posting numbers that were a little better than what it was last quarter, Jet Airways has posted losses. I would advise investors not to get into the aviation space and look out for other sectors with a six to 12-month horizon.


How are you looking at some of the other sectors? The blanket call when it comes to the metal space seems to be that one should avoid it due to cyclicality. What is the sense that you are getting?
The dollar will be a little stronger going forward. Apart from that, crude has gone up. So global cyclicals and commodities are again coming back to the business. We believe metal will be getting a push globally. Metals always react to some of the global factors. Coming to the Indian metal industry, we understand that the government will provide support. In terms of their pricing, realisations are getting better. 

In the metal space, respite can be seen because we have seen a big correction over the last three months. If I pick and choose a particular stock in terms of our preferred bets, then I would like to pick up JSW Steel. Realisations are better, capacities have been increased, augmentation in capacities will be done in the next one year and we believe overall operational efficiencies are improving for JSW Steel. Let us not forget they have good domestic operations also where there is quite good support as far as pricing is concerned. JSW Steel can be the only preferred bet in the entire metal space.


There is news about GVK being in the race for picking up stake in the airport. What is the sense that you are getting on the infrastructure space as a whole? How should investors play this sector?Whichever government comes in power, infrastructure will remain the need of the hour for us. We would like to play infrastructure but very selectively with very selected leaders. 

Of course, these plays like GVK or GMR have their own problems in terms of debt levels, operational efficiencies and execution levels. Although they may be in race for getting awarded for new airports, overall I would still like to play with L&T, the proxy to Indian infrastructure. It is the largecap stalwart and we believe that there are a lot of good tractions in terms of their order book.

In fact, the management is quite confident about delivering in terms of revenues in coming quarters. L&T would be the only play we like in infrastructure. In fact, we have a good upside to L&T, we have around 1894 as a target price to be precise and we believe that L&T can be the mainstay story of 2019.


You are saying in your note that you have revised your estimate upwards for the earnings but we have not seen any major positive surprises in this quarterly earnings. On what basis have you revised your earnings on the upside? 
Well I will give you a very good example. Out of Nifty 50. there are around 20 companies who have beaten their estimates with a variance of 5%. If I talk about in in terms of beat as well as in terms of weakening of the estimates, I would say this quarter has been a better quarter compared to Q2.

Having said that, the BFSI banking space has really done good in this quarter compared to the last quarter. In last three quarters, it has been the non BFSI segment which have been delivering growth for Nifty 50, but this quarter it was BFSI which delivered growth. 

We still believe that in the banking space, some of the corporate facing private banks will be delivering better numbers in the coming quarters than what they have delivered in three, four quarters back.


What about the defence theme? Do you like this play?
We like this play but there are very specific stocks which we like in this play. We know Bharat Electronics and BEML but what we are looking at now are the private players which will be participating in defence. We like one of the companies -- Bharat Forge -- which has been beaten down since last two three months because of the losing streak in terms of Class A trucks in US.

The second part of the story for Bharat Forge would be defence and we still have that understanding that Bharat Forge can be the biggest player in the private sector where it can participate with the government in terms of defence is concerned. So this would be the one stock which we are looking at both ends.

The auto ancillary play is a little weak as of now but I think it will improve in a quarter or so. With an investment perspective. we like companies like Bharat Forge in the private space.


What are you making of these reports that Axis Bank maybe looking at an acquisition route to insurance right now?
Absolutely I would assume it as more of a neutral event unless and until a few names crop up and we understand that at what valuation things can happen or an acquisition can happen. At the current stage, I would be looking at Axis or ICICI to see if they sustain the kind of asset quality which they have and that slippages do not come further. 

In fact, if there is the improvement in terms of numbers or asset quality happens in the coming quarters then that confidence of corporate facing banks will be again back into the market and then they can consolidate going forward. 

However, with these news it would be really premature to comment but as and when the news or the name of the companies come up, it would be wise to comment on this. 


What is the outlook on the oil and gas space? CLSA believes that the Asian GRMs falling to a 10-year low is a worry in Q4 and oil marketing companies are possibly building a buffer ahead of elections and that we could see petrol and diesel prices remaining at near record levels. What is it that you like within this space?
Only six months ago, crude prices touched $80. Our upstream companies especially the public sector units like ONGC or Oil India were not a performer. And it is really unfortunate that despite oil being up, still they did not perform. This time also, I am a little sceptical and doubtful that these companies will be performing.

Oil has come up from $55 to $65 odd whereas the evergreen stock of all Reliance, saw the refining margins dipping. But Reliance’s other plays are chipping in well like petchem or retail or telecom for that matter. So Reliance is a different story altogether and let us not mix it up with crude oil prices. 

But for OMCs, this is a big concern for me and I would like to stay away from OMCs particularly as, they would not able to pass on the oil price hike with the elections round the corner. Maybe they have to absorb it.

So other than a three-six months’ investment, I would like to stay away from OMCs.


I am sure at Anand Rathi you guys would have a couple of stocks where you are having a conviction buy on midcaps. Name those two midcap stocks for us.
We predominantly look at midcaps. After the fall, we have seen lot of value propositions in midcaps. One of the value propositions which we are looking at is Havells. Although Havells has not corrected big time, but the kind of numbers they have been posting, are encouraging. The cable segment has been really doing good. The lighting segment has been seeing expansion in margins and in fact they have branded stores of themselves called Havells Galaxy which already have 500 stores and are planning to expand ever further. 

We believe this is a brand franchise we can bank on. These companies will be really performing well operationally. Valuations can be steep but overall perspective growth is flowing because at the end of the day, we hardly find few companies which have been really posting good earnings. So Havells is one of the plays we like in the midcaps category, with a target of Rs 788. 

In the agrochemical space, we like UPL. Margins has expanded around 2%. We have seen international revenues growing up to 24% and the recent acquisition which they have done is of a big magnitude of around $4.2 billion. As and when synergies work in next two-three quarters, this company is there to post good set of numbers. In fact, this quarter also was a good set of numbers. So, UPL also is one of the plays in the midcap category with a target of Rs 950."

Monday's rally added Rs 96,000 crore to investor kitty as cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms jumped to Rs 1,40,42,922 crore from Rs 1,39,46,745 crore on Friday. 


215 stocks hit circuits

Shares of IT major Wipro closed 1.86 per cent higher at Rs 386, its highest close in 19 years. The stock rallied after the company said it had received approval for an increase in authorised share capital and issue of bonus shares from majority of its shareholders.


RCom shares crack 8%
Snapping the winning run of two days, shares of Reliance Communications closed 8.10 per cent down at Rs 6.01. The stock came under a fresh spell of selling pressure after Axis Trustee said more shares of Reliance Communications have been pledged with it, taking the total to 9.18 per cent. 


BEL gains on order win

Jet Airways stock falls 3%

Shares of Adani Ports and SEZ plunged 8.26 per cent to Rs 324.85 after several brokerages pointed out that if company's arm Adani Logistics acquires Adani Agri Logistics from Adani Enterprises in an all-cash deal, it will weigh on the stock performance in the near term. “Historically, APSEZ has had related-party transactions involving loans and advances towards other group companies. Even good assets are getting bought out in this transaction, it would still weigh on the stock performance in the near term,” Edelweiss Securities said. 


Realty stocks lose steam
The optimism over GST rate cut on under-construction properties gave realty stocks a boost in early trade.

6,2019-03-12,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Bulls continued to have an upper hand on Dalal Street as the NSE benchmark Nifty jumped over 1 per cent for a second straight session on Tuesday. 

Out of Nifty pack, five stocks -- Reliance Industries (RIL), ICICI Bank, UPL, Titan Company and Axis Bank -- settled at fresh record highs.

Shares of RIL settled 2.05 per cent higher at Rs 1,330.85 on the NSE, while ICICI Bank and Axis Bank gained 3.42 per cent and 1.10 per cent to close at Rs 388.70 and Rs 742.60, respectively. 

“Reliance is the consumer-facing businesses. Retail, Jio and the media businesses are unlocking its value. In the next two-three years the stock should see 100 per cent appreciation from the current levels, given the kind of fundamental possibilities the company has created for its shareholders,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers in an interaction with ETNow.

UPL (up 0.14 per cent) and Titan Company (up 1.03 per cent) also hit their record close of Rs 898 and Rs 1080.25, respectively. Brokerage firm Sharekhan in February gave ‘Buy’ rating to Titan Company with a target price of Rs 1,200.

“Q3FY19 was yet another strong quarter for Titan with revenue rising by 35 per cent and adjusted PAT growing by 63.2 per cent, beating ours as well as the street’s expectation,” Sharekhan had said in a report.

Going by market experts, positive global cues, as well as unabated buying by overseas institutional investors, mainly lifted market sentiment. 

Hemang Jani, Head-Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said: “Strong global cues and aggressive buying by foreign investors are some of the triggers that led to positive market sentiment. However, elections results on May 23 will be the deciding factor for further upside in the short term. In such a scenario, investors should focus on quality stocks and use price corrections to add fundamentally strong stocks.”

Jani is bullish on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. “With peaking of NPA cycle, corporate-facing banks are likely to benefit with improvement in the overall asset quality and profitability,” he said.

The BSE Sensex closed 481.56 points, or 1.30 per cent, higher at Rs 37,535.66 today."
7,2019-03-13,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Investors made light of the weakness in other Asian markets and pushed on with buying equities, in the process lifting both Sensex and Nifty for the third straight day.

Asian shares took blows on concerns over global economic slowdown, coupled with uncertainty surrounding Brexit. 

On the plus side, continuous FPI inflows and hopes that the RBI may go in for a rate cut in its next meeting as inflation undershot the medium term target kept the animal spirits going.

True to the historical trend, the market as part of a pre-election rally gained ground on improved prospects that Narendra Modi's government will win another term after the general elections of 2019.

At the end of the day, the Sensex settled up 217 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 37,752. NSE's Nifty closed at 1,342, up 41 points or 0.36 per cent.

Midcaps and smallcaps, however, went off the rails. BSE Midcap closed lower by 0.43 per cent and Smallcap by 0.31 per cent.

Picking up from where they left off, Indian stocks saw a terrific week as benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty settled with a weekly gain of over 3.50 per cent. 

Positive global cues only made the climb easier.

Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 12,298 crore during the week while domestic institutional investors offloaded equities worth Rs 7,402.30 crore.

Overall, market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms soared by Rs 3.95 lakh crore in the five sessions to Rs 148.62 lakh crore, from Rs 144.67 crore on March 8.

So, what are the top stocks and sectors that kept investors glued to their seats the whole week. Here we go.

20,2019-03-18,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Gains in shares of banking, financials, oil & gas and metal heavyweights helped the equity benchmarks log solid gains for the sixth consecutive session on Mo nday.

The market opened with strong gains, but turned volatile amid profit booking in certain sectors, including auto, IT and technology. Volatility index India VIX jumped 7.26 per cent.

However, the session ended on a positive note and sentiment remained upbeat on hopes of a dovish policy from the US Fed later this week. Softer crude oil prices, a stronger rupee and sustained FPI flows also helped.

Sensex ended 71 points, or 0.19 per cent, higher at 38,095, while Nifty settled 35 points, or 0.31 per cent, up at 11,462.

Midcaps and smallcaps underperformed Sensex as their sectoral indices on BSE fell up to 0.20 per cent. 

Here is a lowdown on the key highlights of the session:


Investors richer by Rs 4.14 lakh cr in 6 daysThe six-day rally in domestic equities made investors richer by Rs 4.14 lakh crore as overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms shot up to Rs 1,48,81,140.87 crore from Rs 1,44,67,087.91 crore on Friday, March 8.


DHFL shares gain 3%Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) closed 2.69 per cent higher at Rs 135 after the company in a BSE filing said it would be selling its entire 30.63 per cent stake in Avanse Financial Services.


Maruti falls on reports of production cutShares of Maruti Suzuki India closed 2.56 per cent down at Rs 6,910 after reports of a production cut. A Business Standard report suggested that Maruti is estimated to have cut production to around 126,000 units compared with more than 172,000 units a year ago, which is a 26.8 per cent drop.


L&T Infotech drops on buzz of Mindtree stake buyShares of L&T Infotech closed 3.33 per cent down at Rs 1,573, while those of Mindtree climbed 1.74 per cent to Rs 962 amid reports that Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is eyeing a stake in the midcap IT firm.

  o Infosys and Tech M, said Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Now that a resolution seems pretty likely, the quantum of recoveries would definitely be quite large for banks with exposure to Essar Steel. What is your view?
We will have to wait till March 27 for absolute numbers but obviously there will be a big positive also. It will have a rub-off effect on some of the other cases also. We keep talking about whether the PSU banks are a good play or not. The biggest fintech app in the country is 59-minuteloan.com. I was tracking the figures and they have sanctioned loans worth Rs 30,000 crore within such a short period of being launched. The disbursal is Rs 24,000 crore. There is an interesting play here. One can incrementally add some positions in some of the top PSU banks like SBI and BoB. They are still at about 1-1.5 book value. 


What is the sense that you are getting about the IT space? Given the way the currency is faring, what would it mean not only for IT, but also some of the other exporters?
It would be wrong to put everything in one basket in terms of the currency impact. For every 1% impact on the currency, the margin gets eroded by about 20-25 bps but within the pack, you should also see that there is a lot of localised initiatives being done. The digital deal win momentum is very good. Something like Infosys has a valuation discount to TCS at this price. The BFSI vertical is looking good. 

In Tech Mahindra, even the telecom vertical has shown month on month upside in terms of the business being generated. So I will not be very negative on IT. One has to be selective here. So, maybe an Infosys and Tech Mahindra for me in this pack. You may not want to add incremental positions but may be you want to stay on with these names for some time. 


We have been looking at different pockets. But where would you be looking to buy at lower levels? 
A couple of them actually. Agrochemicals, for example is a niche space, we like it a lot considering that we are seeing a lot of rural thrust by the government. In agrochemicals, India has one of the lowest penetration levels. One stock which we like in this space is UPL. Post the Arysta acquisition, that story seems to be over now. 

Post this, there will be about $5 billion of sale with about a crore of EBITDA. If you see their revenue mix, almost 35% or a third of it comes from herbicides which is a very high volume and high margin business. In the next two to three years, about $3 billion worth of products will become off patent in the US. That brings a very good opportunity and if you track the company, it has a very high ROCE business and high EBITDA margins. They are consistently at about 22-23% ROCE. So, it is a very good business to look at in this space. 

We also like some of the consumer staple names and low ticket consumer durables which will have an impact as consumption picks up in the next quarter. We like Nestle in the staple pack. With the dealer check we have done, we have seen volume pickup in beverages and chocolates. They have been struggling to gain market share in chocolates, especially with respect to Cadbury’s. There is a marginal improvement there. There is a market share gain even in the prepared dishes and despite these valuations, we like that name. 


Have you bought anything a fresh in the March rally?
Adding on to the banks -- both ICICI and Axis. One interesting study with some of the other brokerages showed that even in deposits, especially in current accounts, we are seeing a market share loss for PSU banks. The deposit growth last year for PSU banks was 8% and the private banks was 22%. Now in current accounts they have lost market share from 58% to 54%. 

Now being a banker, a current account share loss means that your cash management and corporate loan funds are going to private banks. It has a very far reaching impact on your fee and interest income. Despite the runup, we are positive on it and that is something we have bought. We have also bought some of the fast moving electrical goods something like Havells and Bajaj Electricals. 


You touched upon consumption. I know that you have outlined some of the reasons why you are a little bearish on an M&M. If we bring in Maruti into the wider auto basket, how much more pain do you anticipate there and why?
My personal view is that a lot of the pain is in the price. Obviously, there has been news of production cuts but this was coming. The dealer inventories were going up from one month to two months despite large discounts. We have to watch out for two things; a) the facelift they have done for Baleno -- the response seems to be mixed. b) The Wagon R new model also has mixed reaction. The only model where the facelift seems to have worked is Ertiga. Also their Nexa platform has been incurring losses.

Various reports suggest the losses per store could be between Rs 80 lakhs to 1 crore but it is a transient phase for auto as a pack and during times when there is maximum pessimism long term, investors must look at it a little more dispassionately and with a three to five-year view. 

One can start accumulating Maruti on dips because there are also bigger factors like BS VI, tighter credit and some of the new electric vehicle models are supposed to be launched. All of this is likely to mean revert in some time. With a slightly long outlook, you can maybe add on dips. For now, in auto probably two-wheelers is a better bet."

36,2019-03-30,Phosphorus Limited,"Global funds are making a beeline for India big time.

“Hopes of a stable government took the Sensex higher by almost 8 per cent this month. Buying has been mainly led by FIIs who have put in around Rs 45,000 core into domestic markets. We believe that any rate cuts in developed markets such as the US or Europe may result in steady inflows for emerging markets (EMs),” said Hemang Jani, Head-Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

All eyes are on national elections starting next month, which will keep domestic markets volatile in the short term. The results are due on May 23.

From a small office in downtown Mumbai to an imposing steel-and-glass building overlooking the city’s Bandra-Kurla Complex financial hub, Rashesh Shah, 55, has come a long way. Shah, armed with an MBA from India’s top business school and expertise gleaned from his time at one of the nation’s largest banks, partnered with a colleague in 1995 to set up Edelweiss Financial Services.

Named after the Alpine flower that grows in harsh terrain, the firm took root in the stock market and blossomed into a $1 billion group built around credit, insurance, and wealth management. But it’s Edelweiss’s status as India’s top buyer of bad loans that’s attracted funds such as Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec.

Since a national crisis sparked by last year’s near-collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., Edelweiss has tripled its liquidity, awaiting opportunities, Shah told Bloomberg Markets in an interview, a lightly edited version of which appears here. Shah, a recreational triathlete, says running a business is like running a marathon: Maintain a measured pace and resist the urge to start too fast. “You need to run one kilometer 42 times, not all at once,” he says.

I was the first one from my family to go to an English-medium school [where English is the medium of instruction]. It was much cheaper to go to a Gujarati-medium school. My mom was very aspirational, so she said, “He will go to an English-medium school.”

My father ran a business making stationery products, exercise books, diaries—a very small-time business. Getting a loan from the bank or a small overdraft was so much trouble. I saw that part, and I said it’s not worth it. I wanted to do something classier.

I went to the Indian Institute of Management and got an MBA. Straight out of college in 1989, I started investing in equities in a small way. The petrochemical cycle had been going down for two, three years. I did a lot of research and came to the conclusion that prices were going up. I bought a lot of Indian Petrochemicals Corp. Ltd. and in one year more than quadrupled the money.

The other was Tata Motors in 1993, called Telco at the time. Same thing. They had a huge inventory, as it was a recession in India. I knew interest costs were very high, and their inventory was falling every month. I calculated that just the falling inventory interest savings [would mean] their profit would double from the year before. So I bought that.

Then again, there have been a lot of bets that went wrong. So you never bet the house on one trade. If you back it up with analysis and a good hypothesis, then your probability of being right goes up. But the probability is never 100 percent. Have a view, have a hypothesis, and then make an affordable bet.

After graduation from IIM, Shah went to work briefly for Prime Securities Ltd. in Mumbai and moved on to ICICI Bank, one of India’s largest lenders.


I learned two things at ICICI. One was analyzing companies, projects, profitability, and profit drivers. It was the best job; as an analyst, you can analyze a lot! The other thing—which in hindsight has been more important—was the ability to understand and appreciate the qualities of an entrepreneur. The main quality determining whether any project is successful or not is the entrepreneur.

I was in the export group of ICICI. We had all the new-age entrepreneurs [as clients]: Infosys, United Phosphorus, Bharat Forge. They were all expanding exports at that time. They had to scale up their competencies and governance to compete on the world stage. Working with a company like Infosys taught me a lot.

When Shah co-founded Edelweiss with Venkatchalam Ramaswamy, a colleague from ICICI, they wanted an iconic name, like Apple. They settled on a flower known for its hardiness.


I quit my job with ICICI in May 1995. I had savings of 30 lakh [3 million rupees, $95,600 at the exchange rate at the time], and by mortgaging our house I put in another 20 lakh. The rest came from Venkat and other investors. I promised my parents we would never lose money. We haven’t lost money in any of the last 22 years.

When we started the business, [Infosys co-founder] Narayana Murthy told me, “Don’t build a business; build an organization.” That has always stayed with me. Your organization is like your soul.

Most of the large financial-services groups were founded by big business groups in India. They had access to capital, equity, debt. We came without anything. So I said we ought to be very careful with the capital. For the first five years we gave ourselves a salary of only 3 lakh; we could have gotten more than 25 lakh in the market.

We were the first to do employee stock options in financial services. This was unheard of in India outside of software companies. It has helped us in creating this culture of partnership.

When we started the bad-loan business, we said, “OK, we will give it four or five years. We’ll spend about 20 crores [200 million rupees] over four or five years—about 4 or 5 crores a year as operating costs. That’s our investment.” Today, that business makes a profit of 400 crores a year.

You have to take the profit and invest it back in the business, building scale in capability and competency. Every year, whatever profit we make, about 20 percent has to be invested back in the business, either trying out new businesses or new products.

We are truly long-term. We used all this upheaval [in the Indian economy] as countercyclical opportunities. In 2008, 2009, when the markets were bad, we started our ARC [asset reconstruction] business. Our entries into asset and wealth management were made in similar environments. The key is being countercyclical because in India things are available when everybody is giving up hope. In our ARC we hired people in 2009, when the world was on fire. We went from four people in 2009 to 40 people by 2012.

We look at challenging times as a great opportunity because we think the long-term trend in India is still up. As for risk management, we always ask ourselves only two questions: Is it worth it? Can we afford it?

There is no USP [unique selling point] in financial services. It’s a really strange thing. It’s ultimately a commoditized market. If you look at a credit card of one bank vs. other banks, a savings bank account of one bank vs. another, or maybe a mutual fund of one manager vs. another, the parameters will be very similar. The two areas where you can make a difference are at a customer experience level and with the organization’s culture.

The other strength we have is that we are diversified. We are a nonbank lender; we have a housing finance company; we have a capital markets business; we have an asset management business, wealth management, ARC, and brokerage and so on. We experiment a lot. So when the experiment works, it looks very smart. But there are a lot of failures. A good photographer takes a hundred pictures, right? And he throws away 99. But the one that is left is fabulous. But we don’t think of the failed ones.

Looking ahead, Shah sees more opportunities than challenges in the Indian economy. “You can’t exactly say how the river will flow, at what pace it will flow,” he says. “But the river will flow.”


India is on a very good long-term trend. But it’s highly volatile. Now, you can either say volatility is a problem or an opportunity. I think we look at it as an opportunity. But you need to be confident of the long-term assessment. So when we acquired JPMorgan AMC [JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s onshore mutual fund business] in 2016, we said OK, maybe it will scale up in one year, maybe it will scale up in three years. That’s OK because of the price at which we are buying we can have holding power. It scaled up very well.

In India, household wealth is going to grow, and you will need advisers and wealth managers. It’s happening in every other country. Why not in India? It’s early days for private credit in India. But then I would say that 20 years ago, private equity was also very small. Over 10 years, things evolve a lot. Everything currently looks very small and raw. The [liquidity] crisis that happened in the last quarter [of 2018] I think is a turning point.

India is a very self-correcting country. Look at what has happened in the credit market: the bankruptcies, the way credit is evolving, nonperforming loans. The bad-loan crisis we had has resulted in a new insolvency and bankruptcy code, which has brought in a big change in the credit market. The recent upheaval will also bring a lot more focus on ALM [asset-liability management], liquidity management, governance structure for NBFCs [nonbanking financial companies], and so on.

Credit research needs to improve if you want to have diversified providers of credit—banks, mutual funds, bond markets, insurance companies, foreign players, NBFCs, private credit funds. We are where the U.S. credit market was a few decades back. The need for India in the next 10 years is to reform the credit market. The cost of funding will come down; growth will get a big boost.

Over the next year or so, [India’s] growth rate may come down due to the crisis at nonbank lenders. People will focus more on liquidity liability, and a lot of people are unhappy about that.

When I say India is always a drama, it’s because we are a vibrant young country. Just like an adolescent. They have mood swings. We have a population that loves drama.

This is the big thing about India. Our nominal GDP for the last 20 years has grown at 13 to 14 percent [a year]. Growth in financial services is about 4 to 5 percentage points higher than that. That means you are doubling every four years. The economy is getting more financialized. We call this India’s golden age of compounding.

I’m very confident that 10, 20, 30 years down the line, India will be calmer. You see, everything can’t be drama."
4,2019-04-08,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Signals of more stimulus in China and improved US payrolls data rekindled risk appetite among investors helping Asian stocks climb to seven-month highs on Monday.

Indian stocks took cue and rose in early trade, but a jump in crude oil prices and rupee's fall against the US dollar proved a drag on the market.

Reliance Industries: The Mukesh Ambani-led company and Royal Dutch Shell plan to exit the Panna-Mukta oilfields when their contracts with the government expire this year, people familiar with the matter said. This would likely leave the task of managing these depleting fields with state-run ONGC.


RCom, Bharti Infratel: An arbitration tribunal has ordered Reliance Communications (RCom) to pay Bharti Infratel ₹39.2 crore for prematurely exiting the towers of the Sunil Mittal-led telecom infrastructure company, adding to the financial woes of the Anil Ambani-owned bankrupt telco.


Mastek, Majesco: Mid-tier IT firm Mastek is aiming to sell its 12 per cent holding in its former subsidiary Majesco by the end of 2019 and deploy the cash for acquisitions, as it aims a fourfold growth in business in the medium-term.


ITI: State-run telecom product maker ITI said it has recorded 20 per cent growth in revenue at Rs 2,051 crore for financial year 2018-19.

Board meetings
 Analyst callsAntique Stock Broking has maintained buy rating on UPL and revised target price to ₹1,000 from ₹910. The brokerage believes that UPL is likely to get benefit at operating level during fourth quarter of FY19 on account of favorable currency movement, positive product pricing and better acreage in key markets.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Mahindra & Mahindra with a target price of ₹790. M&M's core business faces headwinds in the form of an uncertain tractor demand outlook due to the cyclical downturn and the initial forecast of El Nino, a weak product lifecycle in UVs, a huge product skew toward diesel segment and a deteriorating margin profile.

• ICICIdirect has maintained buy rating on Tata Steel with a target price of ₹625. It is positive on Tata Steel on the back of increasing focus on higher margin domestic operations. Tata Steel’s standalone operations benefit from its integrated operations thereby clocking higher EBITDA/tonne vis-à-vis its domestic peers.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Motherson Sumi Systems and lowered target price to ₹170 from Rs 233. It has cut estimates by 15-30 per cent to factor in weaker domestic and global car markets, rupee appreciation against euro, and slower ramp-up of SMP volumes.

• Edelweiss has maintained hold rating on NMDC with a target price of ₹100. The brokerage expects volume challenges to persist owing to ongoing production halt at Donimalai despite ramp up expected in existing mines at Chattisgarh and new deposits in JV with CMDC. Over the past three months, the stock has underperformed global peers as well as iron ore prices.

11,2019-04-19,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Mutual funds dumped PSU banks, specialty chemicals stocks, carbon black producers, housing finance companies and select drug makers, but loaded up on consumer-focused businesses, including FMCG and hospitality, during the March quarter as the nation geared up for the general elections.

These domestic institutional investors also bought into power producers and battery makers. 

The quarter witnessed a deterioration in mutual fund flows into equities. Desi money managers invested only Rs 2,174 crore in stocks in February against Rs 7,161 crore in January while in March they withdrew Rs 7,665 crore. That, even when investment flows into equity and ELSS schemes more than doubled to Rs 11,756 crore in March from Rs 5,122 crore in February.

Market veterans attributed the March outflows to portfolio rejig. While strong investment flows in March had more to do with year-end tax savings, an FPI flow-driven recovery in domestic stocks from their February lows offered domestic funds enough liquidity and a good chance to rejig their portfolios, they explained.

Industry watchers expect strong MF buying going forward.


What did your money manager sell

Mutual funds cut their holdings in Hathway Cable & Datacom in March quarter to almost nil. At the end of March, they held just 0.01 per cent in the company against 6.3 per cent at the end of December, 2018. This company will report March quarter earnings later on Thursday.

On a sequential basis, fund managers cut exposure to housing finance names such as GIC Housing Finance by 420 basis points to 1.2 per cent, LIC Housing by 220 basis points to 4.9 per cent and PNB Housing Finance by 100 basis points to 7.7 per cent.


Funds turn cautious on PSU lendersMutual funds cut their holdings by 250 basis points in Union Bank to 5.5 per cent; by 160 basis points to 2.2 per cent in OBC, by 160 basis points to 4.6 per cent in PNB, and by 100 basis points to 1.4 per cent in Syndicate Bank.

They also cut holdings in specialty chemicals firms Nocil, Clariant Chemicals, Bodal Chemicals and Oriental Carbon & Chemicals by up to 200 basis points. In Phillips Carbon Black, their holding went down by 70 basis points to 2.1 per cent. 

In the agrichemicals space, mutual funds trimmed stakes in UPL and GSFC by up to 140 basis points. Aurobindo Pharma, Solara Active Pharma Science and Torrent Pharma were a few drugmakers where MFs trimmed holdings by up to 170 bps.

Mutual funds are not going to be perpetual sellers. They are primarily slaves of inflows and outflows, says Dhirendra Kumar, CEO at Value Research.

“Given the turbulence in the market in last one year, mutual funds would have been waiting for liquidity and adequate level of the market to do some portfolio re-alignments. March might have offered them such an opportunity,” Kumar told ETMarkets.com.

A sharp rally from the February lows helped BSE Sensex end March quarter 2,698 points, or 7.48 per cent, higher at 38,767. On Monday, it traded at 38,942.


Stocks on MF radar
Data showed domestic fund managers raised their holdings in Inox Leisure (by 40 basis points to 21.4 per cent), even as they trimmed holdings in PVR by 170 basis points to 12.3 per cent and in ACC by 130 basis points to 10.33 per cent. They cut stakes Ambuja Cements by 80 basis points to 4.8 per cent.

Sheela Foam saw the biggest jump in MF inflow. Their holding in this stock rose by 730 basis points to 17 per cent by March-end from 9.7 per cent at December-end, data compiled from corporate database Ace Equity showed.

Consumer-focused companies such as Emami (up 570 basis points) and Relaxo Footwear (up 390 basis points) also saw MF holdings go up.

MFs also hiked stakes in battery makers Exide Industries by 140 basis points to 18.1 per cent, and in Amara Raja Batteries by 100 bps to 8.5 per cent.

The institutional class lapped up 2.1 per cent stake in The Indian Hotels Company to 24.7 per cent, and in Taj GVK Hotels & Resorts by 110 basis points to 9 per cent. They raised stake in Tata Power by 190 basis points to 10.7 per cent and in Torrent Power by 160 basis points to 11.1 per cent.

They also showed interest in retailers such as V2 Retail and Trent, where their holdings went up by 120 bps and 90 basis points, respectively.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows were Aksh Optifibre, Balaji Telefilms, Bharat Wire Ropes, Blue Coast Hotels and Eveready Industries.

Future Supply Chain Solutions, HEG, IL&FS Transportation, Jet Airways, Natco Pharma, Reliance Communications, S Chand And Company and Varroc Engineering also featured among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows on NSE.

Domestic benchmark index NSE Nifty was trading 95.70 points down at 11,657.10 while the BSE Sensex was trading 277.63 points down at 38,862.65. 

In the Nifty 50 index, Wipro, TCS, Tech Mahindra, UPL and Tata Motors were among the top gainers on the NSE. 

However, BPCL, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indian Oil Corp, YES Bank and Hindalco Inds. were among the top losers."
13,2019-04-24,Phosphorus Limited,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India’s largest institutional investor, raised bets on banking as well as select auto, gas, retail and midcap IT stocks during March quarter, which saw domestic equity benchmark Sensex jump 7.22 per cent to 38,672 as of March 29 from 36,068 on December 31, 2018.

At the same time, LIC did some major portfolio overhaul, offloading shares of several telecom, metals, power generation, pharma, hotels, chemicals and cement companies.

The banking sector emerged a tempting bet during the quarter on hopes of earnings recovery and likely bottoming out of NPA provisioning. The insurance behemoth seems to have lapped up a number of banking stocks – both largecap and midcap. Shareholding data of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Federal Bank and IDBI Bank all showed a spike in LIC holding.

LIC also upped stake in Indian Overseas Bank and Syndicate Bank, but offloaded shares in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI. 

During the quarter, LIC completed the acquisition of 51 per cent controlling stake in IDBI Bank. RBI in March categorised IDBI Bank as a private lender for regulatory purposes with effect from January 21, 2019. LIC held 44.31 per cent stake in the bank as of December 31.

Elara Capital in a report said there has been a structural shift in the private banking space in the past few quarters, wherein private lenders steadily raised their term deposit (TD) rates.

“This is because private banks’ credit growth is outperforming CASA deposit growth. We expect credit growth of 20 per cent YoY for Q4FY19E against CASA deposit growth of 12 per cent YoY for private banks,” the brokerage said

The domestic equity market was upbeat through much of March quarter amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors on hopes of the Narendra Modi government coming back to power. 

Beyond banking, LIC also increased stake in select auto firms like Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Motors and M&M. LIC was not among key shareholders in Hindustan Motors as of December 31, 2018.

At the same time, it offloaded some stakes in the beaten-down Tata Motors. LIC held 5.10 per cent stake in the auto major as of March 2019 against 5.17 per cent at the end of December quarter.

Tata Motors earlier this month reported a 5 per cent decline in March sales globally, including that of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) vehicles, at 1,45,459 units. It had sold 1,53,156 units in March 2018.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 22 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 40 companies in March quarter, but reduced it in nearly 60 others.

India’s leading gas players Gail and Indraprastha Gas saw a lot of interest from the domestic institutional investor. 

LIC also picked up over 1 per cent stake in Linde India, NIIT Technologies, UPL and Spencer's Retail during the quarter. It was not among the key shareholders in these companies at December end.



In the pharma space, LIC sold shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, GSK Pharma, Glenmark Pharma, Lupin and Sanofi India, but bought additional shares in Cipla and Piramal Enterprises.

Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala recently said that the price erosion in the pharma sector is behind us. “Indian pharma market will tend to grow faster than it has grown. Pharma is not a market where demand can go down. You must know that 40-45 per cent of all medicines used in the US is made in India. I think it is a sunrise industry, it is not a sunset industry, it can never be a sunset industry,” he said.

Crisil, Tata Coffee, Bombay Dyeing, Indo Rama, Adani Ports, ONGC, OFSS, Rajesh Exports, Tata Chemicals, Exide Industries, Century Textiles, UltraTech Cement and Gillette India were among the other stocks in which LIC increased stake during the quarter.

However, it reduced stake in cement players ACC, Ambuja Cement, Heidelberg Cement, Jaiprakash Associates and India Cement and several hotel stocks including EIH, Hotel Leela Ventures, India Tourism Development Corporation and The Indian Hotels.

In the telecom space, LIC brought down its stake in Bharti Airtel to 3.72 per cent from 3.73 per cent in MTNL from 19.02 per cent to 18.49 per cent and in Reliance Communications from 5.97 per cent to 5.94 per cent."

21,2019-04-30,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market trod water on Tuesday, as investors resorted to profit booking on disappointment over March quarter earnings of select bank and auto heavyweights, including YES Bank and Hero MotoCorp. 

Weak global sentiment, a 1 per cent rise in crude oil prices, caution ahead of US Fed policy review and speculation over key macroeconomic data such as March fiscal deficit and infrastructure output data were the other key factors that hit investors’ risk appetite. 

Gains in IT shares, including those of Infosys, HCl Technologies and TCS, despite a stronger rupee, helped the market pare much of the losses. 

""Investors resorted to profit booking as weak results from banks and auto hit investor sentiment. However, a late recovery in IT and metal stocks helped minimise losses,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Sensex closed 36 points lower at 39,031 while Nifty settled 7 points down at 11,748.

Current chart structure, according to technical analysts, looks sluggish and investors are advised to remain light on positions. Some of the technical picks where investors can catch dips for 10-15 per cent return in short term are DMart, NHPC, Bharat Forge, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Motors, they said.


Where we are: Month of April was a range bound for the market and May has got off on the same note. Though Nifty witnessed breakout above previous high of 11,760 and touched new all-time high of 11,856 last month; market is largely sideways in the range of 250 points since last five weeks.


What is in store: Index hasn’t broken its previous swing low of 11,550 thus, maintaining sequence of higher highs and high lows. Hence 11,550 becomes pivotal support level for the market. However, breaking below 11,550, market will see break in current uptrend and profit booking will emerge in the market initially towards 11,350-11,310 levels. On the upside 11,800-11,860 will act as resistance zone for the market. Crossing above 11,860 on sustainable basis, Nifty will see fresh breakout. Then Index can rally initially towards 12,000 and 12,300.


What could the investor do: In Nifty weekly options, maximum open interest for Puts is seen at strike price 11,700 followed by 11,600; while for Calls it is seen at strike price 11,800 followed by 12,000. Good amount of Call writing was seen in 11,800 and 11,850 indicating as immediate resistance zone for the market. India VIX closed at 24.03 up by 10.7 per cent for the week. After some relief in volatility the previous week, it has picked up again. Expect VIX to remain at elevated levels and rise further as markets heads towards election results later in the month. On stock specific front UPL, DCB Bank, Reliance Industries, Shree Cements and ICICI Prudential Insurance are showing strength."
5,2019-05-07,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Another week has gone by, but NSE barometer Nifty50 has failed to break past the crucial 11,550-11,850 range.

This range has been intact since March end. If one were to go by history, the month of May in election years has been known for wild market swings, suggesting that the index may send out some directional cues sooner than later. 

For now, the index looks rangebound with seven constituents showing a bearish bias, as suggested by the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled a bearish crossover – a sign of bearish undertone – on these counters, hinting at possible downsides.








These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Tata Steel, Coal India, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Auto, Titan Company, UPL and Zee Entertainment. Among non-Nifty stocks Indiabulls Real Estate, Bank of Maharashtra, Havells India, Zee Media, SJVN, Gujarat State Petronet, Dr Lal Pathlabs and Motilal Oswal Financial Services are among 29 other stocks sending out weak signals.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed there are 20 stocks, mostly smallcaps, which have been showing bullish trends. The list included Uniply Industries, Raymond, Deepak Nitrate, Birla Corporation, Cimmco, Bhansali Engineering and Mold-Tek Technologies.





The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, its sharp fall on Monday to an extent was led by global weakness. “We need to see how the index reacts around the 11,550 mark. A close below this level may confirm an intermediate top, which may pull the index towards 11,350. If we hold the level, we may see a bounceback to fill Monday’s bearish gap between 11,630 and 117,00 levels,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking. 

The technical analyst advised traders to keep positions light in such volatile conditions and avoid undue risk.

“The recent distribution occurred near the upper end of a triangular pattern, but the index tumbled towards the lower end. As per the number of legs, the triangular pattern seems to be nearing completion. This is a high probability area for the next legup to kick in,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst Sharekhan said on Monday.

On Tuesday, the index traded at 11,640.40, up 42.15 points, or 0.36 per cent at the time of writing this copy. 

Understanding MACD

A close look at the stock chart of UPL shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has shown downward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip closed at Rs 944.40 , down 0.57 per cent on NSE."
6,2019-05-08,Phosphorus Limited,"New Delhi: Five companies associated with or related to pesticides maker UPL Ltd have settled ‘misconduct’ charges with the World Bank that emanated from violations in execution of projects funded by the multilateral financial institution.

The companies have been asked to undergo a corrective action plan, according to two people aware of the matter, and are banned from World Bank-funded projects until the agency is satisfied with the remedial measures taken by them.

The companies were carrying out waste management contracts for a sustainable city project in the Vietnamese city of Danang, according to the people. They violated the World Bank’s procurement guidelines by failing to disclose information about sub-contractors hired for the project, a UPL executive said on condition of anonymity.

The World Bank group has not disclosed details of the violations on its website, although it has identified the entities that have entered into “negotiated resolution agreements” with it. The companies are Tatva Global Environment, Gharpure Engineering & Construction, Enviro Technology, Kerala Enviro Infrastructure and Bharuch Enviro Infrastructure. Kerala Enviro Infrastructure is identified as an associate company of UPL in its annual report for FY18, while the other four are listed as related parties. “The companies … are not owned by UPL Ltd. UPL has no role to play in their functioning and therefore we are unable to comment,” a spokesperson for publicly traded UPL said in response to ET’s queries.

As part of the corrective action, the companies appointed an independent auditor to inspect their books and submit a report to the agency.

“The entities were independent venture capital investments by Shroffs with no role in day-to-day functioning,” said a spokesperson for UPL’s promoters, the Shroff family. “There was a deviation to the extent of communication procedure after winning the contract. This was pointed out by World Bank and immediately rectification steps were initiated.”

The World Bank’s internal investigation arm, Integrity Vice Presidency or INT, is monitoring the investigation into the misconduct charges. The INT is tasked with monitoring projects financed by the World Bank to ensure there are no violations of end-use guidelines of the sanctioned funds.

UPL, formerly known as United Phosphorous Ltd., ranks among the top five pesticides makers globally after it acquired US-based Arysta Lifesciences in a $4.2 billion deal last year."

The Nifty50 index opened negative and closed with deep cuts for the sixth consecutive session on Wednesday. The index recently broke multiple supports at 11,550 level and drifted sharply toward 11,350. It formed a Bearish Marubozu kind of candle on the daily scale, which implies complete dominance by the bears as sustained selling pressure was seen for most part of the session.

As long as it holds below its 50 DMA of 11,440, it could continue its decline towards 11,333 and then 11,250 levels while on the upside, the medium-term hurdle has shifted towards the 11,550 mark.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,500. Minor Call writing was seen at 11,500 followed by 11,900 levels while there was Put writing at 11,500. The option band signified a shift in the lower trading range from 11,200 to 11,700 levels.

India VIX fell marginally by 0.71 per cent to 26.2. However, a higher VIX suggests volatile swings could continue in the market ahead of the election outcome.

Bank Nifty opened negative and gradually extended its losses towards 28,951 mark. It has broken its major support at 29,500 and corrected by more than 800 points in last two sessions. It formed a Bearish Belt Hold pattern on the daily scale and has been forming lower lows since last three sessions. Now as long as it holds below 29,250 level, Nifty could drift towards 28,888 and then 28,500 levels, while a major hurdle is seen at 29,500.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,419 with a 1.06 per cent loss. Long buildup was seen in Kajaria Ceramics, CG Power, CEAT and UPL while shorts were seen in Voltas, ZEEL, Siemens and L&T Finance.

11,2019-05-12,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities have been in a free fall since the last eight sessions on worries over US-China trade war, uncertainty over election outcome and uninspiring March quarter earnings.

During this period benchmarks Sensex and Nifty have plunged 4 per cent each. Moreover, investors have lost over Rs 6.42 lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed stocks dropped to Rs 1,46,66,587.70 crore last Friday from Rs 1,53,08,828.49 crore on April 26.

The coming week is expected to see the continuity of the bearish trend, as election developments may keep market jittery, while macro data and global sentiment, too, will have a significant impact.


Here’s take a look at factors that will steer market movement in the coming week:


Election politics: Market is getting more and more nervous as we approaches the end to the 7-stage general elections on May 19. The results will be out on May 23 and analysts say Dalal Street will keep experiencing bouts of volatility till then. 


Trade war saga: After the US raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the world is holding its breath in anticipation of Chinese retaliation.

The two-day US-China trade talks concluded without bearing any fruit. However, hopes have not died completely as both parties agreed to talk about it in the future as well. Reuters, quoting Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, reported that China and the United States have agreed to hold more trade talks in Beijing. Each step in the positive direction will be a tonic for markets across the world.


Inflation prints: India's April retail inflation prints will be out on Monday while the wholesale inflation numbers will be released on Tuesday. In March, the annual retail inflation rate rose to 2.86 per cent. On the other hand, wholesale price-based inflation rose for the second consecutive month to 3.18 per cent in March on costlier food and fuel. While there is the anticipation for a slight uptick in inflation prints for April, the market is hoping that it may still remain under the RBI's target, boosting the chance for another 25 basis point trim in key rates by the country's central bank in June. 


March quarter earnings: HDFC, Vodafone Idea, ITC, Lupin, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, UPL and Bajaj Auto are among the companies that will release their March quarter results next week. The earnings numbers have been mixed and they have failed to lift market mood. Positive signals from the above-mentioned companies may give some food to the low spirited bulls.


Crude's course: As per Reuters, Brent crude futures are holding above $70 a barrel, up 30 per cent this year. On Friday, Brent crude oil settled 0.4 per cent higher at $70.62, but posted a weekly loss of 0.3 per cent. Elevated oil prices will add to the miseries of the Indian equity market as the commodity price has a direct impact on the country's fiscal maths and currency. 


Foreign money: Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 1,245.14 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday, data available with the NSE suggested.

Trade war worries and political uncertainty have triggered an outflow in the foreign fund this month- a sharp contrast to the trend of the last three months. In February, March and April, FIIs pumped in Rs 12,053 crore, Rs 48,751 crore and Rs 16,728 crore, respectively. However in May, as of Friday's close, they have pulled out Rs 3,217 crore, data available with NSDL showed.

If the outflow of foreign money continues, the market may see more downside in the coming days.


Technical indicators: Nifty formed a bearish candle on the weekly chart in the week gone by. Besides, the index has been forming lower highs and lows since the last five sessions and traded below its 50-day EMA, which indicates weakness, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said in the near term, Nifty sustaining above 11,250 level would be crucial for the bulls to prevent further damage."
12,2019-05-14,Phosphorus Limited,"ITC, HDFC, Ashok Leyland, Titan and UPL are the stocks where Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, is bullish today. He was speaking to ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 


I do not know where to start.
Sell in May is an odd adage and it is held true to the date. Donald Trump and the election uncertainty and weak earnings have all played out. But believe me, this is a brilliant opportunity to buy. The second half of May will be a deceiver and a counter pullback rally is very much on the cards, maybe today or tomorrow, but there is a 600-point rally now waiting to come and the other elephant in the room will be the elections. 

Till then, there will be rumour mongering. But a large part of the fear element may have played out. We think the market will ignore most of the tweets because the damage is already done. But truly, this May has been rather unsettling and we still got the second half to go but I am relatively sanguine. Oversold conditions notwithstanding, we should see some smart pullback in select stocks and the index.


Foreigners were selling. DIIs were buying. The data is exactly the same. Thousand crores of net buying, thousand crores of net selling and yet markets capitulated yesterday.
You can see forward, the US futures and so on. People had an inkling of where this trade war was going. So smart money or the people who are on the trading side saw that weakness get sold into. By the way, data tells you that the 9th day consecutive fall is the first time in eight years. It is telling you how heavily oversold you are and like you mentioned, there is an equal amount of buying and selling just one crore of difference. Then why should you be down 150 points and that too in the last half an hour? . There is a lot of extreme shorts and extreme pessimism but it is not so on the numbers. We know that auto, discretionary, consumption has been a weak spot but look at the positives. If I can name them, cement, corporate banks, capex and construction all these seem to be in a very fine fettle.

It is a glass half full, half empty. I would say the second half of May and beyond should see smart pullback, a counter-trend rally and we will take it from there. The other event would be the elections. But most of the volatility may be in the price now.


What do you do with pharmaceuticals if you are an investor? I do not recall the last time you had Sun Pharma drop down 20 odd per cent in one given day! 9% was the fall yesterday. How do you approach this weakness? Do you buy on dips yet or is that like trying to catch a falling knife?
That’s a good point. It has been in the eye of the storm whether for corporate governance or some of the issues regarding some of the subsidiaries. Now, you are totally rumour driven. We do not know what the impact is but definitely yesterday was the day where the bears have hammered the stock. 

Fundamentally, numbers and some of the generic pricing pressures should ease. They have seen a lot of approvals on the FDA side. If you are a value picker, that whole basket of pharma looks good. We have to ignore the negatives that play out for some time just as President Trump tweets. We know that finally a deal will be reached with China. It is just that the volatility is hurting and same is the case with pharma. 

A lot of the stocks have gone through a lot of the tiring processes but the ones that stand out would be Dr Reddy’s, Lupin and Aurobindo where the price damage is giving you an opportunity. On Sun Pharma, a SIP would be ideal here for the next 16 weeks or 6 months because you could average out on a good stock just because of amalgamation of rumours and some downgrade maybe the cause of the price fall.


Give me a list of three stocks where you are a buyer today.
Not three, I will give you five stocks. It would be ITC, HDFC, Ashok Leyland, Titan and UPL. All five are in different sectors. All earnings are to be upgraded and the pessimism in ITC was overdone. Last week, I travelled to five cities in three states and saw the mood there. These are smaller cities -- some in Gujarat, some in Karnataka -- the mood is not BJP versus… it is Modiji versus the mahagathbandhan irrespective of the candidates.

So my call if I can stick my neck out is 240 to 250 on the BJP, 290 on the NDA and you will cross the mid line aaram se. I think the pessimism is overdone. Let me also specify to the retail investors that gold is no longer the new defensive. The new gold is SIP and that SIP is here to stay not for the next 6, 9, 12 months, for the next many years. So, please do not ignore your SIP, in fact up your exposure because SIP is the new gold for many, many years.


A year ago if I would have spoken about Eicher, before I finished the question, the response which I used to get from everyone was great company, buy the stock. Now it is don’t buy Eicher at Rs 20,000, buy it at Rs 17,000. Your view?
Good point and you have summed it up well. Siddhartha Lal is a visionary. He could look much well beyond. I used to drive the Bullet when I was in college and look at what the Bullet is now. He has transitioned the Bullet into a Harley Davidson concept in India. Pan India, there are 750 outlets and like you said, this is a cyclical slowdown rather than a structural one. I am very sure that Eicher should see volumes, margins all starting to bounce back maybe in the next two quarters. 

The undertone remains that auto is one of the lame ducks and we know a number of reasons, I would not go into that. But I think if you can see some of the CV players (a disclosure we think Ashok Leyland fits the bill), you are talking of 200 airports. You are talking of truck orders which have gone out after the Pulwama attack and for that, Ashok Leyland will stand out heads over others. We think their foray into CIS countries is another modification of their geographical area. I can put my money on Ashok Leyland, Eicher and Bajaj Auto in that order."

It also projects 60 per cent growth in Ebitda. 

“UPL’s domestic segment is expected to post 7 per cent revenue growth.

Europe and North America are expected to register revenue growth of 130 per cent and 20 per cent. Revenues from rest of the world is expected to rise 12.7 per cent,” Emkay Global Financial Services said in a report.

Edelweiss Securities sees 20.60 per cent and 12.30 per cent jump in core profit after tax and revenues for UPL. It also estimates 11.10 per cent jump in Ebitda.

The brokerage house believes that improved global agricultural scenario is likely to remain beneficial for the company. 

For the domestic market, a weak rabi season coupled with higher channel inventory is expected to dent growth momentum, Edelweiss said. It projects 20 basis points contraction in Ebitda margin at 21.2 per cent."

Board meetings (Full list) 



Analyst calls
 • Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Endurance Technologies with a target price of ₹1,350. The brokerage has maintained FY20/ FY21 EPS, as increase in EBITDA margins by 70 bps/50bps was off-set by cut in revenue estimates due to weaker two-wheeler industry outlook. Endurance is the best proxy play on India’s twowheeler industry growth, as it should continue to outperform through sustained increase in content and crossselling, said Motilal Oswal. 

• Reliance Securities has maintained hold rating on Mangalam Cement with a revised target price of ₹255. Continued cost pressure and soft volume dragged Mangalam Cement’s quarterly performance, it said. While commissioning of 11MW WHRS and sustainability of realisation recovery is likely to aid the company to witness a remarkable improvement in its unitary EBITDA in subsequent quarters but considering its below par operating performance even after realisation recovery, stock is unlikely to be re-rated, it added. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has retained reduce rating on IIFL Holdings with a fair value of ₹410. IIFL Holdings reported strong earnings growth even as most operating trends were muted, said Kotak Institutional. Realisations in the wealth business remained weak while capital market-related income declined, it said. Post demerger IIFL Wealth will remain the most preferred franchise even as NBFC’s business models will gradually take shape, the brokerage said. 

• IIFL has a buy rating on Amara Raja Batteries with target price of ₹627. The brokerage has cut EPS estimates by 8-10% on lower revenue growth assumptions. Exide and Amara Raja saw negligible EPS growth over FY17-19, as the strong revenue growth was offset by margin contraction, said IIFL. With margins seeming to have bottomed out, EPS growth may return as soon as demand revives, it added. 

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Jubilant FoodWorks and revised target price to ₹1,500 from ₹1,600. Jubilant Food’s fourth quarter same store sales growth of 6% was much lower than forecasts, said CLSA. The mid-single digit SSG also raises concern of a slowdown due to heightened competition from food aggregators, said CLSA. The brokerage has cut EPS estimates for FY20-FY21 by 7-11% on slowing SSG.

19,2019-05-17,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets kicked off Friday's session on a firm note, tracking positive cues from Asian markets and overnight gains in US stocks. 

Asian shares traded mildly higher as upbeat US economic news and solid company earnings offered a respite from the interminable Sino-US trade saga, Reuters reported. Japan's Nikkei bounced 0.7 per cent in early trade, while the main Australian index added 0.5 per cent. 

In overnight trade US stocks jumped as positive US housing data added to the global optimism.

""We expect Nifty to resolve out of last four session’s consolidation (11,300–11,100). This would lead to a conclusion of the corrective phase, in turn paving the way to extend ongoing pullback towards 11,500 in coming weeks. In the process, we expect volatility to remain elevated owing to expectations of General Election outcome. However, we do not foresee the Nifty breaching the key support of 11,000 ahead of the election outcome,"" said ICICI Securities in a note.

The markets would keep an eye on stocks such as Dr Reddy’s Labs, Bajaj Auto, IOC, UPL, Bajaj Holdings, Balkrishna Industries, CESC, PI Industries and Zee Learn which will report their March quarter results today.

25,2019-05-23,Phosphorus Limited,"Mumbai: Several analysts have upgraded the ratings and target price for the UPL stock this week, betting on the company’s chances to emerge stronger after the operational integration of Arysta. While Arysta’s acquisition gives UPL a bigger footprint, it also offers complementary products and boosts UPL’s geographical strength, analysts said.

“In view of better growth visibility over the medium term, led by an articulated strategy emphasising synergies, cash flows and de-leveraging, we raise our target PE to 16x, now in-line with its three-year average” said Sonali Salgaonkar, analyst, Jefferies India.

With integration of Arysta completed in record nine months, the UPL management is now focusing on generating synergy. It maintains revenue synergy of $ 350mn over the next three years, while it expects a lower cost synergy of $ 200 million as against $250 million announced in Q3FY19.

“Considering strong earnings momentum over FY19-21 with significant free cash flow generation, we upgrade our target multiple from 12x to 14x,” said Manish Mahawar, analyst, Antique Stock Broking.

UPL currently trades at 7.2 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA which according to analysts is a discount to global peer average of 8x despite stronger EBITDA growth. As markets start factoring in potential synergies, this discount is expected to narrow.

“We don’t think consensus factors in the acquisition yet, as the market awaits clarity on synergy execution,” said Girish Achhipalia, analyst, Morgan Staley India. “That said, we note UPL has a strong record of integrating acquisitions and progress shown at the capital markets day was impressive.”

The stock has rallied 34 per cent so far this year. Analysts expect operating profit to grow at a compounded annual rate of 14 per cent over FY2019-22 and long-term profit after tax to growth at 10.7 per cent. UPL’s net debt to operating profit is expected to improve from 3.8x in FY19 to 2.6x in FY20 and 1.8x in FY21.

“We continue to like the geographically de-risked strategy and presence across value chain business model of UPL,” said Mehul Thanawala, analyst, JM Financials.

For FY20, UPL management indicated a revenue growth guidance of 8 per cent to 10 per cent on a base figure of Rs 3,250 crore. The company’s management is targeting an operating profit growth of 16 per cent to 20 per cent for FY20. UPL plans debt repayment of Rs 3,150 crore to Rs 3,500 crore every year for the next 2-3 years. Separately, UPL expects to keep the working capital cycle between 100 to 110 days.

UPL has been facing frequent supply disruptions from China due to an increase in compliance costs and capacity closure. UPL plans to tackle this issue by increasing inhouse manufacturing facilities, which could improve gross margins by 200 bps."

28,2019-05-30,Phosphorus Limited,"As Dalal Street continues to speculate over a potential earnings revival time for India Inc, some 125 out of over 1,200 firms listed on NSE have doubled March quarter profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. 

Among the top grossers, textile player Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing posted 114 times or over 11,345 per cent YoY increase in profit for the quarter, while Kanoria Chemicals, Yuken India, Hathway Cable & Datacom, Linde India, EID Parry, TVS Electronics, Alfred Herbert, Bhagyanagar Properties and Shriram City Union Finance reported profit growth in the range of 10-55 times, or 1,000 to 5,250 per cent.

Except for Hathway Cable (down 9 per cent), Linde India (down 16 per cent) and TVS Electronics (down 95 per cent), net sales of these firms have increased from 8 per cent to 1,472 per cent during the quarter.

Is it worth looking at stocks of some of these companies to invest?

""Sustainability of profit growth should be the key determinant; make sure these are not one-off surprises,"" says Siddharth Sedani, Vice-President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

“Many companies would have reported strong numbers in Q4. Some of them delivered exceptional gains in terms of profitability. However, investors should look at the sustainability of those earnings and see how these numbers were in the past four to five quarters. One can consider companies with good management and promising earnings. However, global factors will continue to impact Indian markets,” he said.

India Inc’s March quarter earnings season has entered the last leg, with 48 companies from the Nifty pack and 28 from the Sensex pack having already declared their numbers till May 29. 

In the 50-share Nifty, as many as 33 companies have posted an increase in bottom lines, while 15 have reported a drop in profit.

Among others, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Globus Spirits, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, TV18 Broadcast, Aro Granite Industries, Kirloskar Industries, Asian Hotels, Hatsun Agro and The Jammu & Kashmir Bank and Kakatiya Cement posted 500-965 per cent YoY profit growth. Net sales of TV18 Broadcast, Kirloskar and Kakatiya Cement increased over 50 per cent YoY for the quarter. 

Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on J&K Bank post Q4 results with a price target of Rs 80. “At 0.6 times on March 2021 adjusted book value (ABV), the valuation is reasonable given healthy loan growth and margins outlook, robust liability franchise, controlled asset quality and waning capital concerns,” the brokerage said.

Among Nifty companies, Ultratech Cement and Cipla posted 131 per cent and 106 per cent year-on-year rise in profit on a 17.38 per cent and 22.17 per cent YoY sales growth, respectively.

Dr Reddy’s reported 67 per cent YoY profit growth. It was followed by Grasim Industries (up 59 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 57 per cent), NTPC (up 48.70 per cent), Adani Ports (up 38.69 per cent) and Wipro (up 37.74 per cent). 

Reliance Securities has upgraded UltraTech to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ post Q4 results. Centrum Broking maintained ‘buy’ rating on Cipla with a target price of Rs 640. 

Axis Bank and SBI posted net profits of Rs 1,505 crore and Rs 838 crore, respectively, for the quarter against net losses of Rs 2,188.70 crore and Rs 7,718.20 crore, respectively, in the same period last year. 

Yes Bank posted Rs 1,506.60 crore loss for Q4FY19 against net profit of Rs 1,179.40 crore posted for the same period last year. 

Among others, Tata Steel, UPL, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, JSW Steel and Tata Motors reported 77 per cent, 72 per cent, 62 per cent, 53 per cent, 49 per cent and 47 per cent YoY drop in profit for the quarter.



While commenting on the ongoing earnings season, Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interaction with ET Now said that only a few sectors are showing signs of revival. 

“The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility. The focus should be on the banking and the financial space where there is going to be a good amount of traction a) because of the repo rate cut, liquidity infusion and because of the greater visibility because 60 per cent of the earnings growth next year in the Nifty will come from the banking space,” he said.

DCM Shriram, Orient Cement, Godrej Agrovet, Nectar Lifesciences, Usha Martin, Sagar Cement, Insecticides (India), Brigade Enterprises, Godrej Properties, Bharat Forge, Procter & Gamble Health, Bluestar, Phoenix Mills, Butterfly Gandhimathi, Marico, Indiabulls Ventures and Orient Paper were among other companies on the NSE that reported over 100 per cent YoY profit growth for March quarter."

30,2019-05-31,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty closed in the negative zone on Friday dragged down by losses in bank, metal, energy and auto shares.

Giving up early gains, the market experienced a fresh wave of selling in most sectors, which led the stocks closing in the red.

Investors took money off the table in light of weak global cues. Besides, caution crept in ahead of the release of key macroeconomic prints, including fourth-quarter GDP, infrastructure output and fiscal deficit numbers for the month of April.

Government data released on Friday evening showed that India's economy grew at 5.8 per cent in January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters.

Market participants said since the political front was clear, market will shifts its focus to RBI monetary policy meet next week.

Sensex closed 118 points, or 0.30 per cent, lower at 39,714.20 while Nifty settled 23 points, or 0.19 per cent, down at 11,922.80.

However, both Sensex and Nifty logged gains of nearly 1 per cent on a weekly basis. 


Let's take a look at the highlights of Friday's session:

222 stocks hit lower circuitsManpasand Beverages, Electrotherm (India), Technofab Engineering, Atlas Jewellery India, Byke Hospitality and Cox & Kings Financial Service were among 222 stocks that hit their lower circuits today. On the other hand, Reliance Communications, Ortin Laboratories, Websol Energy System, Trejhara Solutions, Mohota Industries and Uniply Industries were among 168 stocks that hit their upper circuits. 


Who dragged my SensexITC emerged as the top drag on Sensex, followed by HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra and YES Bank. In terms of percentage losses, YES Bank, with a loss of 4.27 per cent, finished as the top loser. ITC (down 3.61 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (down 2.17 per cent), Vedanta (down 2.01 per cent) and NTPC (down 1.74 per cent) declined too.


Technology stocks shineAmid the widespread selling, BSE IT and teck indices logged gains of 1.19 per cent and 1.07 per cent, respectively, on healthy gains in shares of Vodafone Idea (up 4.51 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 3.53 per cent), Tata Consultancy Services (up 2.40 per cent), HCL Technologies (up 1.52 per cent), Bharti Airtel (up 0.72 per cent) and Infosys (up 0.48 per cent).


62 stocks giving bearish signalsMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 62 counters on BSE, signalling that these stocks may suffer losses in the coming sessions. Among those stocks were, JSW Steel, UPL, Cipla, CG Power and Industrial Solutions, DCM and Shalby.

NCC shares plunge 16%Shares of NCC suffered a massive loss of 16.33 per cent to end at Rs 97.85. In a BSE filing, the company said it may lose Rs 6,100 crore worth of orders awarded in Andhra Pradesh if YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led new government decided to cancel all the works awarded before April 1. However, the company added that so far it had not received any communication from the government in this regard. 


Jain Irrigation falls 8%Shares of Jain Irrigation Systems settled at Rs 49.85, down 8.03 per cent, a day after the company said its consolidated profit declined 39.37 per cent to Rs 56.2 crore and consolidated revenue decreased 5.99 per cent to Rs 25,83.1 crore in Q4FY19 on a yearly basis.


ONGC shares log gainsShares of ONGC closed 1.30 per cent higher at Rs 171.85 a day after it reported a 32 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit on increased statutory levies and impairment. CLSA reiterated buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 285, adding that the stock was at a compelling valuation and offered higher dividend yield. Macquarie maintained an outperform view on the stock with a target price of Rs 210.

0,2019-06-02,Phosphorus Limited,"A recent open house of the Trai on regulating OTT apps in the telecom sector saw an unusual bunch of participants, a number of retired senior officers of the armed forces, marking the first time a meeting of the telecom regulator that had such a representation. And they were there for a cause for sure, according to a participant, as they lent their weight in support of regulation of OTT telecom apps to enable lawful interception so as to ensure that principles of national security are upheld above anything else.
How Old is Too Old for a Bank CEO?When companies can have CEOs aged above 70, why can’t banks? Shaktikanta Das, who, as RBI governor, has stabilised the rocky relationship with the government, faces this poser from a lobby group which wants the age limit for bank CEOs to be raised. We hear that RBI may contemplate, though reluctantly, to provide two more years beyond 70 rather than five. Or, instead of pushing the problem of CEO selection by two years, it may impose a condition that would show the succession plan.


Missing at IATA AGMThe IATA annual general meeting is one of those annual pilgrimages that many in the aviation world can illafford to miss. Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal, for instance, made it a point to never miss one. Networking, schmoozing aviation industry leaders and building future alliances was something the otherwise reclusive entrepreneur revelled in on the sidelines of the meeting. At the ongoing AGM in Seoul, though, he is conspicuous by his absence, as he was stopped by the authorities at Mumbai airport en route to Dubai. Our guess is that his trip to Dubai would have ended in Seoul in time for the IATA event. While he’ll be missed, an addition from India this year is Ajay Singh of SpiceJet, a new IATA member. Can Singh and SpiceJet fill in for Goyal and Jet Airways, respectively?


Jet Set… Go?When we saw the Hindujas, Gopi and Ashok, and Anshuman Mishra, banker for the high and mighty and the connected at the palace in Abu Dhabi last Monday at the Iftar banquet held by Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, the Indophile minister in the UAE, we were quite sure the Jet deal was done and the new owners were ready to strap up at the cockpit. For desserts, there was an exclusive special screening of the Modi biopic for the VIP guests and dignitaries and mangoes — a weak spot for the host, we are told.


Drumming Up a New ProfileWhen you have a boss who unwinds on the DJ console after taking some of the biggest names in public, guess you can’t hide your musical talent that easily while moonlighting. So Sonjoy Chatterjee, Goldman Sachs’ boss in India for the past six years and drummer for Victor and the Crowns found himself on the bank’s Instagram page. Yet another indication how much the firm has changed over the years.


Honest HighRecently, after a boozy night out, the poster boy of Indian startups, had one pearl of wisdom for some of the starry-eyed followers: Never take money from an Indian VC! We will avoid the expletives that followed thereafter, but we can say that considering he has been leading the tirade against foreign capital spoiling the local ecosystem, most of his young followers in the party came out bewildered. Anything to do with his mega payouts, we wonder, but one is honest when high for sure.


Fast and the FuriousThe Monaco Grand Prix has always been the epitome of glamour and glitz and the global elite will always find time for it. Gautam Singhania has been a regular, and often he is joined in his power yatch by the Shroffs of UPL. This time around we were surprised to see even Dabur’s Mohit Burman come on board. We were so wrong to think the guy has only IPL in his mind.


Campus, the New Playground of BillionairesTelecom wars, retail wars, wars over business and the big bucks – all that’s passe. And the latest? University? Yes, that’s the latest “passion project” of several of our business leaders and ET front page regulars. We hear two of the most aggressive billionaires in town are planning mega projects on the outskirts of Mumbai and so we are all keenly watching whose clearance comes through first. Till then, the gossip mills will keep churning stories about this new rivalry in town.


A Bond to Bank OnICICI Ventures was one of the first home-grown PE firms of yore that nurtured many an entrepreneur, from Kishore Biyani to Ajay Bijli and DRL’s GV Prasad. This weekend saw a grand reunion of sorts at the wedding of Ramya, the daughter of Renuka Ramnath, the grand dame of the industry who currently runs her own outfit. It was good to see P Vaidyanathan, Jayanta Banerjee, Aluri Rao and Bharghav Dasgupta come together to wish the newly-weds.


Following in the Footsteps of the CEO?With the Indian-born chief executive of a US tech services company with a large offshore base resigning last month, speculation is rife that the company could see an exodus of senior executives hired by the CEO. Incidentally, a few years ago the CEO in question was a contender for the top job in an Indian tech services firm."

BOARD MEETINGS
 


ANALYST CALLS
 • Citi has a sell rating on Glenmark Pharmaceuticals with a target price of ₹615. Notwithstanding the recent weakness in the stock, Citi said it is looking for signs of meaningful traction in the US business to turn constructive — as this is key for margin improvement as well as cash generation and meaningful reduction in debt. 

 • IIFL has an add rating on Bharat Electronics with a target price of ₹149. While gross margins are likely to moderate in FY20/21 due to sales mix, benign employee expenses and other fixed overheads will help operating profit margins sustain at 20-21% levels, with 13-15% sales growth, said IIFL.

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Ujjivan Financial Services with a target price of ₹375. The brokerage believes that FY20 should start seeing normalisation of the cost-income ratio, a key concern. The valuations are inexpensive with gradual recovery in return on equity towards normalised levels and addressing the issue on listing of the bank should aid valuation expansion from current levels, the brokerage said. 

 • IDBI Capital Markets has maintained buy rating on Nava Bharat Ventures and trimmed target price to ₹125 from ₹127. The company’s EBITDA in the March quarter was lower than estimated due to weaker-than-expected profitability in the power segment, said IDBI Capital Markets. The stock trades at an attractive valuation, the brokerage added. 

 • CLSA has maintained buy rating on J Kumar Infraprojects with a target price of ₹315. The key message from J Kumar Infra’s fourth quarter result was its pick-up in new orders despite election-led, slow-down fears and robust execution, said CLSA. The brokerage expects J Kumar’s EPS to see an 18% CAGR over FY19-FY22 and highlighted that the stock looks cheap at 4.6 times FY20 estimated EPS.

Crude, after being in the bull market for a couple of months, has been taken over by the bears. Crude oil prices have tumbled more than 20 per cent, falling below $60 a barrel mark because of growing fears that demand has become weaker than expected as the global economy is on a downhill due to the trade tensions.

Besides crude oil, prices for other industrial commodities such as copper, nickel and steel have also been falling globally.

India has been a major beneficiary of the fall in international crude oil prices over the past few years. Chemicals are a critical input for several end-use consumer industries. The fortunes of the chemicals industry have long intertwined with crude oil prices and lower crude prices should benefit chemicals companies, which use crude oil or its derivatives as key ingredients in making the various products.

Going forward, domestic demand growth coupled with opportunities in the export market should help India to establish itself as a chemicals manufacturing powerhouse globally. To note, Indian chemicals market was pegged at $190 billion in FY18, of which, broadly one-third would be specialty chemicals (including pharma and agrochem). As the prospects of the chemicals sectors brighten up, many chemicals companies are making substantial investments in companies and technologies that can bring renewable, low-carbon energy to consumers and minimise environmental and carbon footprints.

The specialty chemicals sector is expected to see double-digit growth for multiple years on the back of an increase in per capita consumption locally, import substitution, and rising share of global exports.

The forecast for the forthcoming season is near normal and with focused farmer-connect initiatives, managements of the chemicals companies are confident of introducing newer brands successfully. Many chemicals companies are expecting to ramp up exports driven by commissioning of additional manufacturing units in the coming quarters.

We may see many launches ahead of the new cropping season and companies will continue to benefit from the strong pipeline of attractive, high-potential products. Also, tariffs imposed by the US have affected Chinese exports, and lowered input prices, which should in turn benefit Indian importers.

With improving supplies from China, it is expected that prices of pesticide inputs may decline 20-25 per cent in financial year 2020, meaning thereby that it will provide manufacturers an offset against modest revenue growth and higher receivables, which are possibilities in the event of below-normal monsoon.

The introduction of the export-oriented units (EOU) scheme by the government to boost exports and increase foreign earnings may also support the sector. Going forward, the chemicals sector is expected to get direction from input supplies from China and how monsoon pans out back home.

PI Industries, UPL, Rallis India, Insecticides India, Astec Lifesciences and Coromandel Fertilizers are some of the companies that will stand to benefit from increased demand for agri-inputs.

For the week, the Nifty formed a spinning top candlestick at the top indicating indecisiveness in the market. On the daily time frame, too, the index has formed indecisive pattern Doji, but with long lower shadow which means buying coming at lower levels.


What is in Store? Holding above Friday’s low of 11,769, the market can see a bounce-back towards 12,000-12,100 which is the overhead resistance zone. On the downside, if breaking below 11,769 level, expect profit booking towards 11,591 levels where a rising gap support is seen. Among the Nifty options, maximum open interest (OI) for puts is seen at strikes of 11,000, followed by 11,500; but significant amount of OI is seen at 11,800 and 11,700 indicating support zone. Among calls, maximum OI build-up is seen at 12,500 followed by 12,000, indicating 12,000 as immediate hurdle for the market. The India VIX closed at 14.86 down 7.6 per cent for the week. Over the last couple of weeks, the VIX has seen steady decline and reached the pre-election levels. It is likely to stabilise at the current level and a sharp rise from here would see profit booking.


What could Investors Do? Stock specific, HDFC Life Insurance, V-Guard Industries, UPL and Voltas are looking positive and can be looked at the long side; while Amara Raja Batteries and Glenmark Pharma are showing weakness."

22,2019-06-20,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: A fresh wave of short covering at the expiry of weekly contracts helped Indian equity market close with strong gains on Thursday.

The sentiment turned positive after the US Fed signalled rate cuts in the near future, which was seen as a positive sign for emerging markets such as India. 

“The Fed is a factor that infused positivity. Besides short covering launched the market into the higher orbit,"" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.

However, the undercurrent of the market remains fragile amid concerns over the NBFC sector and high valuations. ""The market is at its peak as far as valuation is concerned. It is a ‘sell on rise’ market as the pain and pressure remain in the NBFC sector,"" Oza said.

Sensex leaped 489 points, or 1.25 per cent, to close at 39,601, with only four stocks - HUL (down 0.26 per cent), HDFC Bank (0.16 per cent), ITC (0.07 per cent) and NTPC (0.04 per cent) – ending in the red.

23,2019-06-20,Phosphorus Limited,"HSBC has maintained buy recommendation on UPL with a target price of Rs 1,220.

""We maintain our buy rating a target price of Rs 1,220, which implies about 28 per cent upside,"" said the brokerage.

Shares of UPL closed 8.51 per cent down at Rs 869.6 on 20 June, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 


Investment rationale:
Soyabean demand and pricing is likely to remain under pressure due to as-yet unresolved US-China trade tensions, events like ASF and rising US exports to EU and other countries, which might keep Brazil price premiums in check, unlike in 2018. 

China soya-bean imports are down around 25 per cent YoY (Sep 18-May 19) and imports from Brazil are now falling (9 per cent lower YTD 2019). Despite high US-China tensions, soyabean premiums have not widened, indicating weakness in demand.

USDA estimates US inventory at 27mt as of end-2018/2019 season (up 125 per cent YoY and versus five year average) and 113mt of production in 2019/2020. In the event of non-resolution of a trade deal, and even with an expectation of normalising exports, inventory would still be more than 20mt next year, which would not augur well for a recovery.

Our global agro-inputs team estimates a 30 per cent reduction in pork production in China could lower global soyabean demand by approximately 4 per cent if not substituted (which is unlikely), equating to around 17 per cent lower China demand. This could be added pressure and, if played out, could dent a pick-up in Brazil soyabean exports for rest of the year.

Soyabean pesticide consumption forms approximately 55 per cent of the Latin America market and assuming no substitution lower China demand could lead to an approximately 7 per cent decline in Brazil soyabean exports. However, this translates to only about 3 per cent reduction in LatAm soyabean pesticide consumption on our estimates.

UPL derives approximately 35 per cent of its revenues from Latin America and the brokerage expects the impact of lower China demand to be non-material. 

UPL has a strong growth profile in Latin America in times of crisis, led by market share gains. Thus, lower prices could be a silver lining given farmers’ preference for high quality and low priced products, where UPL has an advantage. 

In addition, trade tensions could cause pesticides imported from China to become expensive in the US due to higher tariffs, potentially benefiting Glufosinate-based products, which would be positive for UPL’s herbicide portfolio in US. 

However, any resulting global slowdown due to trade tensions could be a risk both to the industry and UPL’s growth outlook."

Nifty50 on Thursday managed to respect its previous day’s low and gradually extended its gains towards 11,850 level by surpassing the crucial hurdle at 11,761.

The index formed a Bullish Engulfing Candle on the daily scale, as strong buying interest emerged at lower levels near to its 50-day EMA after the consolidation of last four sessions.

28,2019-06-21,Phosphorus Limited,"While the domestic equity market is looking intact optically at the benchmark level, a selloff below the surface has nudged 75 per cent of the NSE-listed stocks below their 200-day moving averages; meaning they have entered a bearish phase. 

The 50-share Nifty is up over 7 per cent this year at 11,691 till June 19, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap250 indices have declined up to 5 per cent in the same period. 

On Friday, as much as 42 per cent of Nifty components traded below their 200-day moving averages (DMAs). The list included Britannia Industries, Cipla, Eicher Motors, Gail India, Hindalco, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, ITC, YES Bank, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel and Tata Motors.



“A stock trading below 200 DMA means it is in the corrective zone. The benchmark index looks well placed currently, but individual stocks have been beaten down badly. Ideally, one should focus on stocks that are sustaining above their 50-DMAs,” said Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher.

“I do not see Nifty going down below 11,550,” she said, adding that market participants can consider pharma and capital goods stocks at this point. 

Even in the Nifty500 pack, 60 per cent or 300 stocks are trading below 200-DMAs in clear signs of selling pressure across sectors. 





Stocks trading below this crucial support line included 3M India, ACC, Adani Green, Avenue Supermarts, Bank of Baroda, Deepak Fertilisers, Crisil, Cochin Shipyard, ICICI Securities, Jaiprakash Associates, Jain Irrigation, among others. 

Moving averages (MA) are a tool for analysing trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance levels. 

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major MAs, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is considered a continuous uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks test 50-DMAs or 100-DMAs, while serious corrections may cause a stock slip below 200-DMA. 

The 200-day average, also known as a long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for an index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. The 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks. 

On Thursday, stocks like Wipro, Voltas, UPL, Va Tech Wabag, Symphony, Sunteck Realty, SRF and Sonata Software traded above their 200-DMA, while SAIL, Sterling Tools, Tata Chemicals, Tata Motors, Videocon Industries, VIP Industries and Wonderla Holidays are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs. 

Around 300 stocks, including Aarti Industries, DCM Shriram, BPCL, Bata India, Info Edge, Infosys, Inox Leisure, HDFC, Redington and PNC Infratech, were above all the three DMAs, signalling a bullish trend. 

“Available data clearly shows the market has begun a sideways secondary trend after a long primary uptrend. In the secondary phase, the market first consolidates and takes a fresh call either on the upside or downside depending on the technical setup at that point of time. PSE and infrastructure stocks, including L&T and NCC, should remain resilient in the coming days,” said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst for Technicals and Derivatives at Angel Broking, said the primary uptrend is expected to resume soon.

“However till then traders are advised to keep positions light and avoid bottom fishing in stocks that have run into the abyss through this volatile period,” Chavan said."

The Nifty50 index failed to continue its positive momentum of last session and corrected towards 11,700 level on Friday. It formed a Bearish Belt Hold candle and a Harami pattern on the daily chart, as it traded inside the trading range of last session amid sustained selling pressure for most part.

The index recently took multiple support near its 50-DEMA at 11,650, but absence of buying interest was also visible at 11,850 level. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily as well as weekly charts, which indicated that the bears restricted the upside momentum.

Now, it has to cross and hold above 11,761 to extend its move towards 11,850 and then 11,929 levels, while a hold below 11,650 level can negate the short-term consolidation for a decline towards 11,600 and then 11,550 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,700 followed by 11,500 while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 levels. There was meaningful Call writing at 12,000 followed by 11,800 levels while minor Put writing was seen at 11,650 followed by 11,500 levels. Option data suggested a shift in the immediate trading range between 11,600 and 11,900 levels.

India VIX moved up 4.36 per cent to 14.61 level.

Bank Nifty formed a Doji candle with a long lower shadow on the weekly scale and a bearish candle on the daily scale, which indicated that every declines got bought into but the absence of followup buying interest was missing at higher levels. Now the index has to hold above 30,600 to extend its move towards 31,000 level while on the downside multiple supports are seen at 30,250.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 11,754 level with a loss of 0.80 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Indiabulls Housing Finance, MRPL, UPL, BEML and Hexaware while shorts were seen in Ujjivan, PVR, RBL Bank and Chola Finance.

32,2019-06-22,Phosphorus Limited,"The benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty declined over half a per cent during the week gone by amid fears over India’s retaliatory tariffs on US goods, ongoing NBFC crisis, soaring crude oil prices and concerns over poor progress in monsoon. 

The Sensex slipped 0.65 per cent to 39,194 for the week ended June 21. The index was at 39,452 on June 14. Similarly, the NSE Nifty dipped 0.84 per cent to 11,724 from 11,823 during the same period. 

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week:


Top Nifty gainers


ICICI Bank: Shares of ICICI Bank rallied 3.12 per cent to Rs 430.80 on June 21 from Rs 417.75 on June 14. During the week, ICICI Bank and IndoStar Capital Finance entered into sourcing and servicing arrangement to partner in extending credit to small and medium fleet owners to purchase used and new commercial vehicles. Under this partnership, IndoStar Capital Finance will originate and service the customers through the entire loan life-cycle including sourcing, documentation, collection and loan servicing and in turn, ICICI Bank will provide funding to these customers.


Power Grid: Shares of the company advanced 2.72 per cent to Rs 199.90 for the week ended June 21. Power regulator CERC has allowed state-owned transmission utility PowerGrid to offer towers to telecom companies for BTS (base trans-receiver station) installation to improve mobile connectivity, especially in remote rural areas. The move will not only address the issue of deficiency of telecom coverage in the country, particularly remote areas, but this segment could also be a money spinner for Power Grid. Besides, the power distribution utilities will get a share of income, which would eventually reduce the tariff burden on consumers. 


Top Nifty losers

UPL: Shares of agrochemicals maker UPL dropped over 11 per cent to Rs 890.10 during the week. According to HSBC Global Research, UPL appears at risk due to its global diversified exposure, but the near-term impact should be non-material.


Yes Bank: The private sector lender remained under pressure after Moody’s Investors placed the bank's ratings under review for a possible downgrade citing it high exposure to the struggling NBFC and realty sectors. The agency said the ongoing liquidity pressures on finance companies will negatively impact the credit profile of Yes Bank, given its sizeable exposure to weaker companies in the sector. The scrip declined 4.74 per cent to Rs 109.60 on June 21 from Rs 115.05 on June 14.


Stocks that rallied up to 21%
As many as 12 stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 5 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Hexaware Technologies (up 21 per cent), Suzlon Energy (10.17 per cent), Oberoi Realty (7.86 per cent), Syndicate Bank (7.56 per cent) and Dr Lal Pathlabs (7.21 per cent).


23 scrips that cracked
More than 20 stocks on the BSE500 plunged in double digits during the past five trading sessions. Jain Irrigation (down 33 per cent), Eveready Industries (down 21 per cent), Graphite India (down 19 per cent), SREI Infra (down 15.86 per cent) and Manpasand Beverages (down 14.42 per cent) stood among companies that went down over 10 per cent during the week. 


IPO update
IndiaMart InterMesh, an online marketplace for business products and services, on Friday said it has raised more than Rs 213 crore from 15 anchor investors by allotting 21,95,038 equity shares at a price of Rs 973, the upper band of its IPO which will open on June 24. ICICI Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, Birla Mutual Fund, Hornbill Capital Advisers LLP are among the 15 anchor investors.


Stocks @fresh all-time high
As many as nine stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs during the week. The list included some of the blue-chip stocks such as Titan Company, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance and Tata Consultancy Services. SRF, Godrej Properties, PI Industries, City Union Bank and Maharashtra Scooters also scaled new life peaks.


Scrips at fresh life lows
On the BSE500 index, The New India Assurance, General Insurance Corporation of India, Manpasand Beverages, Laurus Labs, Central Bank of India, Reliance Communications, Jet Airways, SH Kelkar, Reliance Power, Vodafone Idea, Eris Life and Reliance Infrastructure reeled and touched new all-time lows.


Sectoral update
Sector-wise, the BSE Consumer Durable, Realty and Power rallied more than 1 per cent during the week. However, the BSE Telecom, Auto, FMCG, Healthcare and Oil & Gas indices weakened between 1 per cent and 2.20 per cent.


Jet Airways
Shares of beleaguered aviation firm Jet Airways remained highly volatile during the week. On the NSE, the scrip jumped over 100 per cent in a day on Thursday. Still, it settled the week 11.70 per cent lower at Rs 72.50. Jimeet Modi, CEO, Samco Securities & StockNote said, “This week gone by saw the biggest speculative displacement in stocks like Jet Airways, which were fundamentally weak but witnessed spine-chilling movements on both directions. The reasons? Demand-supply mismatch, greed and fear, hopes and expectations – a clear reflection of emotional responses from investors all at once.”"
31,2019-06-22,Phosphorus Limited,"Mumbai: Shares of UPL, the producer of crop protection products, recovered on Friday after analysts said the company will not be impacted much because of the trade tensions and an outbreak of African swine fever.

Shares of agrochemical major fell 8.5 per cent on Thursday over concerns of lower exports to Latin America due to trade tensions between the US and China and events such as the spread of African swine fever, which could impact soybean demand in China. However the near-term impact of these events should be non-material, according to analysts.

“Trade tensions could cause pesticides imported from China to become expensive in the US due to higher tariffs, potentially benefiting glufosinate-based products, which would be a positive for UPL’s herbicide portfolio in US,” said Saurabh Jain, analyst, HSBC Securities. “UPL derives 35 per cent of its revenues from LatAm and we would expect the impact of lower China demand to be non-material.”


The UPL stock, which has surged 38 per cent since January 1 to a high of Rs 1,034 on June 11, declined 13 per cent in the last three trading sessions before closing at Rs 890.50 on Friday, up 2.5 per cent over the previous close.

Historically, UPL has a strong growth profile in LatAm in times of crisis, led by market share gains. Thus, lower prices could be a silver lining given farmers’ preference for high quality and low priced products, where UPL has an advantage, analysts said.

“US-China trade war concerns are overblown while African swine fever in China is expected to have limited impact on Brazil’s soybean acreages and pesticide volumes,” said Lakshminarayana Ganti, co-head of research, SBICap Securities. “UPL’s diversified business model across geographies, crops and products shields it well from exogenous shocks.”

On the debt side, UPL faces no redemption pressure. All debt has been denominated in the dollar. The $3-billion acquisition debt carries interest of L+160 bps and has a 5-year bullet repayment in January 2024. It only has a $200 million loan repayment due in FY21.

Analysts believe UPL is in a comfortable situation to easily prepay Rs 3,500-crore debt in FY20 and FY21 each, as per management guidance.

“Debt/EBITDA should come down from 4.2x in FY19 to 2.4x in FY21, within the 2.25-2.5x covenant of rating agencies and our conservative estimates of synergies of $150 million in FY20 and $225 million in FY21 should be be sufficient to repay the interest on acquisition debt,” said Ganti of SBICap Securities."

43,2019-06-28,Phosphorus Limited,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 26 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

IIFL has maintained buy rating on ICICI Lombard with a 12-month target price of Rs 1,300. The company's FY19 annual report highlights investments in technology and virtual offices, which enable it to gain market share, IIFL said. ICICI Lombard is our top stock pick for 2019, the brokerage said, and forecasts a 33 per cent EPS Cagr over FY19-21. Shares of ICICI Lombard gained 0.36 per cent to Rs 1,121.30 on Thursday.


Jefferies has maintained its buy rating on UPL with a target price of Rs 1,125. The brokerage believes, UPL's recent acquisition of Arysta LifeScience is likely to catapult UPL as the 5th largest agrochemical firm globally. For FY20, UPL management expects capex outlay of approximately Rs 2,000 crore, the brokerage said. Shares of UPL declined 1.52 per cent to Rs 943.30 on Thursday.


Elara Capital has changed rating of Yes Bank to reduce from Sell and lowered its target price from Rs 192 to Rs 107. The brokerage believes further deterioration in asset quality in addition to delays in equity raising would increase volatility in the stock price. The bank's bond and nonconvertible debenture exposure to the DHFL and Anil Ambani groups have slipped to below investment grade and the composition of below investment grade loan portfolio is likely to rise by another 100bp, the brokerage said. Shares of Yes Bank declined half a percent to Rs 112.40 on Thursday.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has maintained buy rating on UltraTech Cement with a target price of Rs 5,280. The acquisition of Century’s cement asset and Binani has led to the company increasing its capacity market share and take its pan-India capacity market share to 20 per cent, the brokerage said. Over FY13-19, while compounded annual growth in operating profit stood at 7 per cent, profit after tax remained almost stable due to higher interest cost, the brokerage said. Shares of Ultratech Cement ended flat at Rs 4,605 on Thursday.

IIFL has initiated coverage on HG Infra Engineering with a target price of Rs 364. Revenue CAGR of 35 per cent over FY13-19 has largely come on the back of in-house construction with owned equipment, growing employee base and improving scale & processes, said IIFL. Existing order book of Rs 6,200 crore provides growth visibility for FY20-21, while a comfortable balance sheet with net debt equity of 0.4 times gives comfort on ability to bid for and execute the upcoming EPC and HAM project pipeline from NHAI, said IIFL. Shares of HG Infra ended up 2.4 per cent at Rs 280.45 on Thursday."

0,2019-07-01,Phosphorus Limited,"One of the global leaders in agrochemicals industry UPL will be positively impacted by the ongoing US-China trade war. While this trade war may put pressure on US agricultural product prices, it may be a blessing in disguise for UPL because it could force US farmers to buy UPL products. 

The proposed 25% tariff on Chinese products by the U.S. includes agrochemical products glyphosate, glufosinate, dicamba, etc. If implemented, this would push up prices of products from China, which will benefit UPL’s glufosinate-heavy herbicide portfolio in the US China is reacting to the trade war by reducing agricultural imports from the U.S. and replacing them with imports from the Latin American countries, and this will also benefit UPL. 

With sales compound annual growth rate of around 20% during the past five years, UPL’s market share in Latin American countries is also on the rise.

Around 12% year-on-year reduction in import of soybean by China, the largest importer of soybean, due to African swine fever can be a concern for UPL as it may bring down the global soybean prices. But the impact of this reduction won’t be too big on UPL because soybean crop’s contribution the companies business is less than 15%. The concerns about the impact of the proposed changes in Mauritius tax laws on UPL have also been addressed by the company. The management has clarified that this would not negatively impact UPL’s Mauritius subsidiary.

The recent correction in the UPL counter, triggered by the above mentioned concerns, has brought its valuation to reasonable levels—its enterprise value-Ebitda ratio is at 15% below its three-year average—and provides a good entry point for long-term investors. More importantly, analysts say that the company’s fundamentals remain intact. 

For example, there are clear gains expected from UPL’s acquisition of Arysta because of cross-selling opportunities. It will also benefit from enhanced scale in sourcing and distribution of goods. In addition to helping improve earnings per share, the successful completion of this acquisition will also enhance UPL’s global ranking. From being the seventh largest agrochemicals company, it will become the fifth largest.

Though UPL’s debt level is high now, it is not a concern over the short-term as more than 90% of its debt repayment is due only in 2022. Analysts also believe that its debt will be come down in the coming years. Debt- Ebitda ratio is likely to fall from four in 2018-19 to 2.25 in 2020-21 because UPL is expected to generate free cash flow of around $3 billion (`20,705 crore) during the next five years and a part of it will be used for reducing debt.

31,2019-07-06,Phosphorus Limited,"Domestic equity markets ended first week of July in the green after the Economic Survey projected India’s economic growth rebounding from a five-year low to 7 per cent this fiscal. Softening crude oil prices and the US-China trade war truce also calmed investor nerves globally. 

As a result, the benchmark BSE Sensex added 118.75 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 39,513 for the week ended July 5. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index inched higher by 22.30 points, or 0.19 per cent to 11,811 during the same period.

Overall, the market kicked off the week on a positive note after RBI relaxed the leverage ratio for banks to help them boost their lending activities. Market participants remained optimistic despite domestic manufacturing sector losing growth momentum in the month of June. The Economic Survey painted a rosy picture for D-Street which further fuelled the sentiments till Thursday. 

However, Sensex and Nifty pared most of their gains on Friday as Budget proposals failed to enthuse investor sentiment. What further dented the confidence was -- rating agency Moody’s comments which said there are risks of India missing 3.3 per cent fiscal deficit target for the current financial year if tax revenue falls short of the projection.

58,2019-07-16,Phosphorus Limited,"To curb production and sale of spurious chemicals, the government Tuesday said it will make compliance of quality standards compulsory for 40 more chemicals that are locally-manufactured as well as imported.

Chemicals and Petrochemicals Secretary P Raghavendra Rao said government is also expected to soon introduce Harmonised System (HS) of coding for chemicals and petrochemicals imported in large volumes.

Currently, there are no prescribed mandatory standards and HS coding for chemicals and petrochemicals in the country. However recently for the first time, the government made standards compulsory for caustic soda.

HS coding is a standardised international system to classify globally traded products.

""We have already introduced mandatory standards for caustic soda. We are going to do it for more chemicals. We have identified 40 chemicals and the works is in progress,"" Rao told PTI on the sidelines of a Ficci event.

The government's aim in the next five years is to make mandatory standards for major chemicals that are manufactured locally as well as imported, he said.

Stating that making quality standards is a big process, Rao said, ""standards cannot be introduced just like that. We have to take concurrence of the WTO and other countries. Otherwise, they will object.""

The government will not only make mandatory standards but will also take strict action against those companies which do not comply with them, he added.

Addressing the conference, the Secretary emphasised on HS coding for all major imported chemicals and petrochemicals in the country.

""Lot of imports fall under 'others category'. What is this others category? We are going to end this 'others category' soon. All significant imports should have harmonised system of coding,"" he said.

Expressing concern over huge import of chemicals and petrochemicals, the Secretary said, ""we import 25 per cent of the domestic requirement. We need to take steps to ensure non-essential imports come down and domestic production goes up.""

At present, the country's annual net import of chemicals and petrochemicals stands at Rs 1,20,000 crore, which is expected to touch Rs 3,00,000 crore by 2024, if no steps are taken to check, he said.

""It is very scary situation. Our target is how do we reduce the import dependency without compromising on quality...,"" he said and asked all stakeholders to put best efforts towards this direction.

On agro-chemicals, the secretary stressed on safe and judicious use of such products as he asked the companies to come up with new solutions to address the challenges posed by climate change in the farm sector.

UPL Ltd Global CEO Jaidev Shroff and Corteva AgriSciences Executive Vice President Rajan Gajaria said there are many challenges and opportunities in the sector."

Federal Bank recently posted a 46.25 per cent rise in June quarter profit at Rs 384.21 crore on healthy growth in non-crore income and stable asset quality. Brokerage Anand Rathi has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Federal Bank with a price target of Rs 130. 

Shares of Federal Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have rallied 10 per cent and 22 per cent on a year-to-date basis till July 17, while the benchmark Sensex has gained 7 per cent in the same period.



Among the public sector banks, LIC upped stake in Bank of Baroda, but cut holdings in Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India.

Punjab National Bank earlier this month reported a fraud of more than Rs 3,800 crore by Bhushan Power & Steel. The development came at a time when the bank was coping with a major financial fraud of around Rs 13,000 crore by diamond merchant Nirav Modi.

Mutual funds also increased holdings in some of the private banks during June quarter, raising their total exposure by 370 basis points to 19.90 per cent YoY and 20 basis points QoQ. 

The domestic equity market was upbeat through much of June quarter amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) on hopes of the Narendra Modi government coming back to power. FIIs poured more than Rs 30,000 crore in domestic stocks during April-June.

Beyond banking, LIC also increased stake in pesticide and agrochemicals firm UPL, industrial gases and fuel firm GAIL India, FMCG major ITC, pharma and drug companies Granules India and Bliss GVS Pharma and household and personal product-related firm Gillette India. 

Among others, Blue Dart Express, Havells India and Adani Ports also reported a rise in LIC holding during the quarter. 

On the other hand, the insurance behemoth brought down its stake in MTNL to 14.56 per cent at the end of June quarter from 18.49 per cent in the preceding quarter. It also reduced stake in Power Grid (from 7.50 per cent to 4.89 per cent), BHEL (14.13 per cent to 11.67 per cent), NMDC (14.72 per cent to 12.89 per cent) and Shipping Corporation of India (11.91 per cent to 10.32 per cent). 

It also cut stake in other companies including Welspun Corp, Nalco, NTPC, SAIL, Paisalo Digital, OMDC, Tamboli Captal, Oil India and SV Global Mill.

""Investors turned sellers on concerns that the economy is moving through a slowdown phase. IMF lowered GDP growth forecast by 30 bps for 2019 based on weak domestic demand outlook, which fuelled a selloff in a market where sentiment is already hurt due to tax concerns,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Mixed quarterly results, outflow of foreign funds and weakening rupee will keep weighing on investor sentiment, he added.

70,2019-07-24,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Leading agrochemical company UPL on Wednesday said its wholly-owned subsidiary has arranged EUR 100 million (approximately Rs 768.80 crore) loan at zero interest rate to meet the working capital requirements across the group. UPL Corporation has arranged the financing, and the transaction is expected to be completed in August-September 2019 after receipt of required approvals, the company said in a regulatory filing. 

 ""The short tenor loan carries zero running coupon and is the first such financing raised by the group,"" UPL said. 

 The facility is proposed to be arranged by Cooperatieve Rabobank UA, the leading Dutch Food and Agri-focused bank. 

 Earlier, the UPL Corporation had raised USD 3-billion five years unsecured term loan to part finance the acquisition of Arysta Lifescience. The loan was jointly syndicated by MUFG Bank and Cooperatieve Rabobank UA. 

 The term loan was later swapped into EUR equivalent of USD 1.5 billion at a fixed rate of 1.50 per cent annum and USD 400 million into JPY at fixed rate of 1.15 per cent per annum as substantial business is in these currencies would provide a natural hedge, the UPL said. 

 With its acquisition of Arysta Lifescience in January 2019, UPL became the fifth largest overall and largest post patent company in the agri-chem space and reported revenues and EBITDA of Rs 21,837 crore and Rs 4,114 crore in 2018-19 fiscal, respectively."

76,2019-07-26,Phosphorus Limited,"Startups and technology firms are trying to break into India’s agricultural landscape using newer business models. These firms are tapping governments, insurers, banks, farming co-operatives, development agencies and even corporate social responsibility programs to create a viable business and help farmers. Most farmers have small holdings. Some even rent the land they farm on from others. Farmer distress is widespread. 

Farming contributes around 15% to India’s gross domestic product. In short, India has few large farms that can pay for technology solutions. When CropIn Technologies first started out in 2010, the company tried selling its agri-tech solutions directly to farmers. 

After investing lakhs of rupees, however, it managed to earn just Rs 6,000. Now, it tailors its solutions to specific needs. “Each customer segment that we deal with, we have a different value proposition for them,” said Jyoti Vaddi, head of business development at CropIn Technologies. Large companies that depend on agricultural produce want information on sowing and pre-harvest activities up to harvest. 

Development agencies are keen to develop sustainable farmer livelihoods, Vaddi said. CropIn is working with the World Bank in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh on a climate resilience project. It is also identifying a model where farming communities can adopt technology to create sustainable benefits — such as weather alerts on phone, best practices on farming, and advice on taking care of pest attacks. Agri-tech companies such as CropIn are also finding a market in banks and non-banking financial companies that give agricultural loans. The lenders are seeking CropIn’s expertise to help manage risk. 

“If they have invested money in certain loans with farmers, the bankers want to know if it performing, how the crop is doing. Sometimes, a farmer takes a loan to sow one crop and then sows half his field with something else. There could be a genuine reason, but this is information a banker would want to know,” Vaddi said. CropIn is working with public and private sector banks as well as NBFCs. For banks and insurers, the company provides a platform that has data on the historical crop yields of a district. This helps in forecasting yields using machine learning. 

The company also uses remote sensing satellites to determine what crops are sown in a region, using crop signatures it has collected over the past five years. Large technology companies, such as IBM and Microsoft, too are involved in the agri-tech space. The Weather Company, an IBM unit, provides hyperlocal weather information to farmers, along with data on soil moisture and temperature, which aids farmers in making informed decisions on how and when to irrigate. The company has tied up with agro-tech startup AgroStar to create crop disease prediction algorithms. “We are not expecting marginal farmers to pay for this. 

We work with governments, banks, insurers, corporates who have business interests in agriculture and corporates that want to do meaningful CSR work,” said Himanshu Goyal, India Business Leader at The Weather Company. “It is not very expensive. It is cheaper than what a normal software costs and it is affordable,” he said. The company looks at delicately balancing value and cost, which even a company can appreciate, and one where people can build in affordability in business models, he said. 

Microsoft is working with agrochemicals company United Phosphorus and the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) to provide agri-tech solutions to farmers. State governments and government-promoted organizations are also potential markets for agri-tech companies. The agriculture ministry signed a statement of intent earlier this month with IBM for a pilot study on using artificial intelligence and weather technology solutions in agriculture. 

Tie-ups with governments also use sensors in agricultural fields to measure soil health and ground-level conditions. Pilots that require placing sensors on farms are also underway. Eka Software, which has built a digital commodity management platform that is used by the likes of Cargill and Rio Tinto, has built a blockchain platform for coffee farmers in a tie-up with the Coffee Board of India. The platform aims to help farmers get a good price for their product, while offering coffee roasters and exporters data on crop quality. “There is a lot of scope to use technology to digitise agriculture in India and curb waste,” Manav Garg, CEO of Eka Software, told ET in an interview earlier. 

“We have built this platform for coffee, but we can also create similar platforms for other agricultural commodities.” State governments are also looking to invest in blockchain technology to help cashew and shrimp exports. “India is one of the largest exporters of shrimp to the European Union, and the EU has put in requirements to disclose the health of the shrimp. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the governments are putting in place blockchain (technology) in which the manufacturers of the shrimp feed the content and that is made available to buyers. Kerala is doing the same thing for cashew nut,” said NG Subramaniam, chief operating officer of India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services. The blockchain technology is being launched by the state fisheries department, the Marine Product Export Development Authority and Tata Trusts, the Tata Group’s philanthropy arm. Business models are still evolving at the farm level, experts say, whereas at the retail level — organic food or providing farm produce directly to homes — it is more established. 

The government’s increased focus on improving farm incomes is also resulting in more pilot projects in the agri-tech space. “Future scale-up models will need farmers to have a stake, both to have ownership over and to demand accountability from the services. This is an emerging context,” said Amit Vatsyayan, Partner - Government and Public Sector Advisory Services, EY India. “A platform approach is very much needed for greater acceleration and adoption.”

77,2019-07-28,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: Come week will be data-heavy as far as earnings, high frequency data and regulatory decisions are concerned. So far, the sentiment on Dalal Street has been fragile, as suggested by the third straight week of fall for benchmark indices, thanks to a less-than-expected set of earnings and cues suggesting slowdown globally.

For the week, Sensex fell 454 points, or 1.18 per cent to 37,883. Nifty fell 135 points, or 1.18 per cent to 11,284. 


Here are a couple of factors which may sway the market direction next week:


US Fed policy: If we go by a Reuters poll of economists, the US central bank is all set to cut policy rate in its two-day policy review starting Tuesday. This would be the first time in over a decade when the Fed will reduce policy rates. As per the poll, a 25 basis points Federal Reserve interest rate cut is almost a done deal. The Reuters poll anticipates another rate cut later in the year amid rising economic risks from the ongoing US-China trade war. 


Q1 results of a dozen Nifty firms: Dr Reddy’s Labs will announce its June quarter results on Monday; Axis Bank, Hero Motocorp and Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday; UPL, IOC and Eicher Motors on Wednesday while SBI, ITC, HDFC, Bharti Airtel and Power Grid will release June quarter earnings on Friday. NMDC, Ashok Leyland, DHFL will be other firms announcing their quarterly results this week.


US-China negotiators to meet in Shanghai: Lead negotiators for China and the United States will meet in Shanghai on Tuesday for two days in the next round of trade talks, China’s commerce ministry confirmed this week

It would mark the first face-to-face meeting between US and Chinese trade teams since presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed at a G20 summit in Japan to revive talks to end their year-long trade war, Reuters reported.


High frequency data releases:  Next week will see release of trade data. Readings such as manufacturing and service PMIs, auto sales numbers, core sector output and July GST collections will also be keenly followed. The numbers may hold the key when the RBI's monetary policy committee meeton August 5-7.


GST council meet outcome: The council in its meet on Saturday brought down the GST on electric vehicles (EVs) to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. It also slashed the GST on EV Chargers from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. The new rates will be effective from 1st August 2019. Besides, it approved exemption from GST on hiring of Electric Buses by local authorities. The move will influence shares of auto and auto component makers."

80,2019-07-31,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: When the bluest of the blue chips take a hit, can others go unscathed?

Out of the 38 BSE-listed stocks where foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) owned at least one-third of shareholding, only two have managed to deliver positive returns since the July 5 Union Budget. 

While some of these stocks lagged amid slowdown concerns, the biggest drag on them has been a brisk selloff by FPIs after the introduction of an tax surcharge in higher income brackets, which would make many of the overseas portfolio investors to cough up more in taxes.

Analysts say stocks where FPI ownership is higher than long-term average and where fundamentals are weakening have become vulnerable to sharp drop due to FPI selling.

FPIs have sold Rs 11,740 crore worth of equities this month, the highest outflow since October 2018. Data compiled by corporate database Ace Equity showed stocks where FPIs held 33-74 per cent have dropped up to 60 per cent since Budget.

The HDFC twins, the bluest of blue chips, too have tanked 6-7 per cent since Budget. FPIs held 38.6 per cent in HDFC Bank and 74.7 per cent in housing major HDFC at the end of June quarter, data suggests.

“The surcharge aspect is quite tricky,” said Naveen Kulkarni of Reliance Securities. “There may be many stocks where FPIs will start finding comfort in terms of valuations, but the attraction will essentially be offset by the increased tax burden,” he said. “Growth, of course, remains a concern.”

Among top FPI favourites, Mindtree shares have dropped 20 per cent since Budget. FPIs held 33 per cent stake in this firm at the end of June quarter. Others such as Manappuram Finance, Birlasoft, M&M, UPL, Cyient and Federal Bank have lost 17-20 per cent in values since Budget.

Among some of the other FPI favourites, PTC India, Page Industries, Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, TeamLease Services, Just Dial, Max India, IDFC, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank and NIIT Technologies have fallen 10-14 per cent. 

The list includes many largecaps, where valuations had gotten stretched. “The overall sentiment is negative at this stage. If institutional investors, in particular, have to take out money, these are the stocks which will take a hit,” Dhiraj Relli, Managing Director & CEO at HDFC Securities, told ETMarkets.com last week.

Meanwhile, Cox & Kings has slumped 60 per cent since Budget after a series of debt defaults jolted the travel firm. FPIs held 36.1 per cent in this stock at the end of June.

Another FPI favourite Indiabulls Housing Finance has tanked 25 per cent. The firm came under intense selling pressure this week after BJP leader Subramanian Swamy sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing the Indiabulls group firm of a Rs 1 lakh crore fraud. The company denied any wrongdoing.

A study by brokerage Target Investing showed stocks such as Shriram Transport, Max Financial and Havells India could come under pressure. The brokerage expects FIIs to liquidate at least 20-30 per cent of their shareholding in the stocks they currently over-own.

“For many of these stocks, fundamentals have been worrying while valuations are higher than their five-year average. The income-tax surcharge announced in the Budget has created the environment for such stocks to get de-rated. These stocks have fundamental stress, which we do not think, will go away soon. They can be in stress for the next two or three quarters,” the brokerage said in a note."

20,2019-08-05,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a zigzag show on Monday amid signs of further escalation in the trade war, a steep fall in the yuan, uncertainty over a major law change on Kashmir and weakness in the rupee. 

China’s yuan hit its lowest level in almost 11 years, triggering a sharp drop in emerging market currencies. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 90 paise down at 70.49 against the US dollar.

“Weak global sentiment was the top trigger behind Monday’s market fall. It seems the trade war is not going to end anytime soon,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

Losses in heavyweights from bank, NBFC, energy, auto and metal sectors dragged Sensex by 418 points, or 1.13 per cent, to 36,699. Nifty finished at 10,862, down 135 points or 1.23 per cent.

“The ongoing turmoil in Kashmir may further induce volatility in the market. Escalating trade tensions between the US and China will keep market participants on the edge and cause weakness in oil prices as well as the currency,” said Ajit Mishra, VP- Research, Religare Broking.

Here is breakdown of key highlights of Monday's session:


Investors poorer by Rs 1.6 lakh crore
Monday’s selloff dragged cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,38,37,963 crore from Rs 1,39,98,244 crore last Friday, making investors poorer by nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore. Year-to-date, investors have lost Rs 6.10 lakh crore in equities. 


645 stocks plumb 52-week lows
ITC, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Vedanta, YES Bank, Escorts, Coal India and Indiabulls Housing Finance joined the band of 645 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on BSE. Meanwhile, 14 stocks, including Asian Paints, Mandhana Industries, Junction Fabrics and Apparels, SSPN Finance and High Street Filatex, hit 52-week highs.


89 stocks look bearish
Momentum indicator MACD showed 89 stocks, including Titan Company, Lupin, Essel Propack, Equitas Holdings, HCL Infosystem, Kaveri Seed Company and Rain Industries, with bearish crossovers, signalling that these stocks may see losses in the coming sessions. On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, Arvind, TVS Motor Company, Maruti Suzuki India and Hero MotoCorp were among the 71 stocks that showed bullish crossovers.


235 stocks enter oversold zone
Momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 235 stocks, including Vodafone Idea, Indiabulls Real Estate, RBL Bank, HDIL, Gati, Oriental Bank of Commerce and PTC India Financial, in the oversold zone on BSE. On the other hand, Raghuvansh Agrofarms, Sahyog Multibase, Confidence Finance, Mandhana Industries and Modella Woollens were among the 13 stocks that entered the overbought zone. 


SBI, HDFC Bank, UPL below 200-DMAs
State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, UPL, DCB Bank, Adani Ports, Blue Star, Pfizer and Titan Company were among the stocks that witnessed negative breakouts and traded below 200 DMAs. On the other hand, Hindustan Unilever, Welspun Investments, NIIT, ABB India and Zodiac Clothing Company were among the stocks that traded above 200 DMAs.

Spandana Sphoorty IPO off to a slow start 
The Rs 1,200 crore initial public offering (IPO) of Spandana Sphoorty Financial got off to a tepid start amid a global market selloff. By 4:45 pm, the issue had seen a subscription of 6 per cent, receiving bids for 5,69,789 shares compared with the total issue size of 98,22,367 shares. 


RIL shares fall 3%
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 3.48 per cent to Rs 1,143 after the global brokerage Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to 'underperform' from 'neutral', reducing the price target to Rs 995 from Rs 1,350 earlier. The brokerage said the company’s liabilities have increased significantly to $65 billion, while supply delays in refining and petrochemical, the faster roll-out of new commerce and potential stake sale in either of refining, Jio or retail pose key risks.


DHFL shares down 10%
Falling for the ninth session in a row, shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) finished 10.08 per cent lower at Rs 41.95 after reports that Deloitte has quit as the auditor of the cash-strapped firm. 


Venky’s (India) surges 13%
Shares of packaged foods maker Venky's (India) surged 13.46 per cent to settle at Rs 1,351.25 after the company said its June quarter revenue jumped 20 per cent year-on-year to Rs 905.3 crore against Rs 755.55 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last financial year. However, net profit declined by 13 per cent YoY to Rs 61.8 crore against Rs 71.05 crore during the corresponding quarter last year."
19,2019-08-05,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: The massive selloff in the stock market has eroded Rs 15,00,000 crore worth of investor wealth in last 30 days.

While broader market has been in pain for the entire first half of Calendar 2019, a selling spree by foreign investors post the July 5 Budget and earnings disappointment have ensured that largecaps no longer remain safe bets.

At Monday’s low of 36,443, BSE Sensex was mere 374 points away from erasing entire this year’s gains. The 30-pack index had closed at 36,068 on December 31. BSE’s total market capitalisation has fallen 10 per cent to Rs 138 lakh crore from Rs 153.58 lakh crore on July 5. Sensex has fallen 8 per cent during the same period. 

Reliance Industries, the second most valued stock on Dalal Street, dropped over 3 per cent on Monday after foreign brokerage Credit Suisse cut its rating by 26 per cent.

Recently, foreign brokerage UBS cut Maruti Suzuki India rating to ‘sell’ from ‘buy’ while CLSA cut M&M’s rating to ‘sell’. Tata Motors, UPL, IOCL, Axis Bank, Vedanta and Tech Mahindra are a few companies, which have missed profit estimates, triggering cut in price targets for these stocks.

A few of the large cap firms such as YES Bank and Tata Motors have even seen their ratings cut by rating agencies. Analysts said earnings have failed to cheer the market so far. With the government’s income-tax surcharge proposed on high income groups, falling rupee that hit 70-mark on Monday and global trade tensions at new high, India has started becoming an unattractive destination for FPIs. This has led to an outflow of Rs 15,000-odd crore of FPI money since the Budget. FPIs are known for their investment in Sensex and Nifty stocks. 

Shares of Indiabulls Housing have plunged 36 per cent in last one month. Tata Group stocks Tata Motors (22.67 per cent), Titan (19 per cent) and Tata Steel (18 per cent) have plunged up to 23 per cent. SBI has tanked 20 per cent. Coal India, JSW Steel, ONGC, and Vedanta have fallen between 14-18 per cent.

“There were no big bang reforms, or any major stimulus, in the Union Budget. On the contrary, an increase in income-tax surcharge and the proposal to raise public shareholding dampened investor sentiment and led to a sharp correction post Budget,” Kotak Securities said in a note.

Consensus Nifty EPS estimates have been seeing repeated cuts, with the momentum of downgrades spreading across stocks. Earnings of Nifty companies so far (two-thirds of the index weight) indicated Q1FY20 EPS growth of only 5 per cent YoY, Emkay Global said in a note.

“This contrasts with a steep 20-30 per cent growth rate built into consensus expectations for FY20/FY21. Despite the recent correction, we see Nifty valuations (17.5 times one-year forward) not factoring in further earnings risks,” the brokerage said."
21,2019-08-06,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: In his annual letter to Berkshire Shareholders earlier this year, legendary investor Warren Buffett warned investors that a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock may cause a splendid business to become a poor investment. 

This, he said, could be the case for a painfully long period, if not permanent.

With June quarter earnings for two-thirds of Nifty firms already in, analysts say actual numbers belie tall earnings projections for FY20. This has made a few brokerages to ask their clients to focus on quality midcaps instead, where prices have corrected sharply below intrinsic values in last 18 months. 

“My expectation of more stock purchases is not a market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will behave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities,” Buffett in wrote his February 23 note.

The Saint of Omaha said their thinking, rather, is focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price.

Data suggests in the battering seen in last 18 months, midcaps have given up nearly 70 per cent of the gains that they made during 2014-17. Their valuation discount to largecaps has widened to 22 per cent now. Another 10 per cent underperformance could make midcaps very appealing against Nifty50, said Kotak Securities.

“Midcap’s discount to Nifty is now closer to the lower end of its 10-year range. It is prudent to buy quality companies having reasonable earnings growth forecasts and reasonable valuations,” the brokerage said.

Value investor Vijay Kedia expects the market to balance itself, with the expensive largecaps shedding some weight. “Quality midcaps will recover gradually over time,” said Kedia, who said he has never kept any cash idle in his 30-year-long investing career. 

As for Nifty, UBS has pegged earnings growth at 16 per cent for FY20 and at 15 per cent for FY21 against the Street expectation of 26 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively. Financial companies are expected contribute 70 per cent of the incremental FY20 earnings growth, the brokerage said. Excluding financials, Nifty earnings can grow merely 6 per cent this year, UBS said.

Nifty50 earnings have grown at a pitiful compounded annual growth rate of 3 per cent in last five years.

Among the 28 Nifty companies that have announced June quarter numbers so far, Tata Motors, UPL, IOCL, Axis Bank, Vedanta and Tech Mahindra missed profit estimates by huge margins.

In case of NSE Midcap100 index, profit after tax stood at Rs 56,000 crore in FY19 against Rs 51,000 crore in FY2014. The poor profitability growth in FY19 was a result of losses at PSU banks, which amounted to Rs 28,000 crore in FY19.

“In FY20, the expectation is that this PAT will come back vigorously, jumping to close to Rs 1 lakh crore, as PSU bank may report Rs 11,000-12,000 crore profit. Earnings of eight PSU banks are out so far and this trend is already playing out to some extent. This profitability will provide some stability in the midcap space. Excluding the PSUs, earnings growth projections for midcaps is about 12 to 13 per cent. I think they could possibly do better,” said Sahil Kapoor of Edelweiss Securities.

Brokerage Emkay Global, too, sees a good opportunity in midcap and smallcap stocks. It prefers APL Apollo, Radico Khaitan, Sterlite Technologies, City Union Bank, Varun Beverages, IPCA Labs, Federal Bank, Jubilant Foodworks, Exide Industries and Gulf Oil Lubricants India from this basket."

Nifty is currently facing resistance at 11,185 levels and this is likely to be broken on the upside in the current week, according to technical analysts. Stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Kotak Bank, HDFC Asset Management, Info Edge, Adani Port, L&T, Dr Reddy’s, Dabur and Berger Paints have bullish chart structure and poised for further upmove.


Where are we: As index had formed lower high and lower low on weekly time frame and breached rising channel, it indicates we are in grip of bears for short term perspective. In later part of previous week, Index had staged smart recovery but it can be considered as relief rally. Index had cut in its size by 10 per cent from its peak. With this fall, Index had come below 200-DMA. 70 per cent of Nifty 50 stocks are below 200-DMA but remaining 30 per cent stocks which are above longterm moving average are the ones which carry higher weights.


What is in store: With immediate rise Index had reached upto 11,150 level, it is an important level because in the past, it had an important turning point at 61.8 per cent retracement level of immediate fall and 200-DMA.Collectively, it forms stiff resistance at 11,150 level. So in the short term, the index can remain under pressure as far as it continues below 11,150 level. Move above 11,150 can lead to further improvement upto 11,350 level. On down side strong resistance remain at 10,600.


What could traders do: Looking at pattern of the fall in recent few years, Nifty had fallen in the range of 10-15 per cent and it had given good entry point for investors. So with decent correction, investors can start accumulation with leading large- and mid-cap companies. For investment perspective Adani Port, L&T, Dr Reddy’s, Titan, UPL are good stocks."

30,2019-08-14,Phosphorus Limited,"Asset under management of the mutual fund industry inched higher to Rs 24.53 lakh crore in July despite a harsh selloff in the domestic equity market, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed. Total AUM stood at Rs 24.25 lakh crore in June. 

Investors’ mutual fund portfolios suffered a dent after the Union Budget 2019 slapped a surcharge in the high income-tax bracket that hit foreign portfolio investors (FPI). In response, FPIs, who had poured in around Rs 80,000 crore during February-June, offloaded stocks worth more than Rs 12,000 crore in July itself.

The BSE Sensex dipped around 5 per cent, while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined 8 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.

41,2019-08-22,Phosphorus Limited,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019.

53,2019-08-27,Phosphorus Limited,"NEW DELHI: The rollback of the tax surcharge has put the focus back on FPI favourite stocks, which are looking for some respite and rebound after a relentless selloff seen since July 5, following some market-unfriendly announcements in the Union Budget.

Analysts said recent foreign outflows had more to do with the deteriorating US-China trade ties, which made the entire emerging markets (EM) pack vulnerable to outflows. The tax surcharge was just an immediate trigger for FPIs to take money off the table, they felt. 

FPI favourite stocks with growth visibility may make a comeback now, but across-the-board buying in these stocks is unlikely, analysts said.

Data showed as many as 32 of the 39 stocks, where FPIs owned one-third or more stake, plunged up to 80 per cent since the Union Budget till August 23. Twenty-nine of these stocks underperformed Sensex’s 7 per cent drop since Budget. This period saw FPIs pull out Rs 24,500 crore from domestic stocks. 

Some of these FPI favourites did see positive price action on Monday, even though data showed the institutional investors pulled out Rs 753 crore from the market. 

Shares of India’s largest mortgage lender HDFC traded 1.22 per cent higher at Rs 2,174 on Tuesday morning after rising 5.12 per cent on Monday. The housing finance stock, where FPIs held 74 per cent stake as of June 30, 2019, had lost Rs 45,500 crore in market value between July 5 and August 23, after rising 15.66 per cent between January 1 and July 5.

Axis Bank gained 1.36 per cent to Rs 693 on Tuesday morning, in addition to a 2.98 per cent jump on Monday. This stock was down 18 per cent since the Union Budget till Friday, after having risen 30 per cent from January 1 through June. 

Just Dial was up 53 per cent for the year till July 5, before falling 12 per cent post Budget. The stock, where FPI ownership stood at 51.1 per cent as of June 30, advanced 0.60 per cent to Rs 697.20 on Tuesday morning after rising 1.53 per cent on Monday.

Ridham Desai of Morgan Stanley said FPI outflows since Budget were not entirely triggered by the tax surcharge.

“The tax issue was slightly a different problem. While on one hand we were trying to incentivise more foreign investment in the country, on the other hand, we ended up putting a tax which almost everybody in the government acknowledged was unintended,” he said. 

“Besides, the outflows had to do with the overall emerging markets situation. Resolving the tax issue per se does not bring back FII flows. But it does highlight an important thing, that the government is listening. Because if you see the narrative in the market place over the past two months, it has been that we are dealing with a government that is not listening to our problems,” Desai told ET NOW.

UPL’s 22 per cent slide since Budget (against a 32 per cent jump earlier in the year) and TeamLease Services’ 20 per cent fall (after a 6 per cent rise year-to-Budget) are a few other examples of FPI stocks taking a beating since Budget.

A few FPI favourities such as Cox & Kings (India), Care Ratings, Indiabulls Housing Finance, YES Bank, Birlasoft and Gayatri Projects, meanwhile, have witnessed consistent fall through the year on weakening fundamentals.

Global trade war also took its toll. “Globally, metal prices are down 15-20 per cent on YoY basis. Demand is contracting worldwide, and it is reflecting in the Indian economy. FPIs may still come back to the growing sectors. But they may not come back in an aggressive manner to sectors like auto and metals. Many FPI-heavy stocks witnessed a good run in the first half, but going ahead any FPI buying will be limited to consumer stories and, maybe, to IT stocks. It may not be across-the-board buying,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder and Managing Director at Equinomics Research.

Saurabh Mukherjea of Marcellus Investment said at least half of the foreign outflows seen in the past few months should return because of the signals that the Finance Minister sent out on Friday.

“What you have to realise is that a part of the FPI inflows through March-May was event-driven trade. FPIs were trading Modi victory. July gave them a logical reason to do so. I would say $1-2 billion should come back over the next two to three months. If we look at it, FM's sops for auto and NBFC sectors will lead to economic traction. We might see more than a couple of billion dollars coming back,” Mukherjea said."

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

IDBI Capital has maintained hold rating on Abbott India and revised target price to Rs 9,050 from Rs 7,997. The brokerage said better visibility of growth trajectory gives comfort to assign higher valuation multiple. After attaining a leadership position in top-10 brands in India, the management is set to build next set to 10 brands which should drive the growth, said IDBI Capital. The brokerage expects revenue and profit after tax of Abbott India to see a CAGR of 13.5 per cent and 18.3 per cent respectively over FY19-FY21. The stock ended down 0.94 per cent at Rs 9,122 on Tuesday.


Antique Stock Broking has initiated coverage on Solar Industries India with a target price of Rs 1,400. Being a market leader in highly regulated domestic explosives industry with huge entry barriers, Solar Industries is well-positioned for robust growth with multiple levers in place, said Antique. The brokerage expects Solar Industries' sales and PAT to grow at 20 per cent and 26 per cent over FY19-21 respectively. The stock ended up 6.87 per cent at Rs 1,152 on Tuesday.

HSBC has maintained buy rating on UPL and lowered target price to Rs 720 from Rs 750. China soybean imports from Brazil remain soft but trade tensions could support Brazil exports again and benefit UPL, said HSBC. African swine fever remains a concern as it has led to a 25 per cent year-on-year decline in China’s swine livestock, but lower US supplies can offset the impact and safeguard exports from Brazil, said HSBC. The stock ended up 1.2 per cent at Rs 556.05 on Tuesday.

CIMB Securities has initiated coverage on TVS Motor Company with a target price of Rs 284. Rich valuations still overlook its weak profitability ratio, net debt position and Indonesia losses, said CIMB Securities. A thin presence in sub-segments and large product portfolio amidst BSVI emission regulations could pose challenges for the company, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 1.49 per cent at Rs 372 on Tuesday.

China soybean imports from Brazil remain soft but trade tensions could support Brazil exports again and benefit UPL, said HSBC.

MEHUL KOTHARI
SR. TECHNICAL ANALYST, INDIANIVESH SECURITIES


Where are we : For the past four weeks, the domestic markets have been oscillating in a broad range. Initially, the Nifty was stuck between 11,200-10,600 but now that range has been compressed to 11,100-10,740. Generally, such consolidation leads to a faster breakout on either side. Technically, we have observed that the price action of the recent week has helped the index to convincingly cross the previous week’s high. This has happened after 10 weeks which is an encouraging sign for the bulls and indicates that the bottom of 10,740 should be held for some more time and the Nifty could reach higher levels.


What is in store: A breakout above 11,100 on closing basis could lead to an upside towards 11,300–11,400. However, a breach of 10,740 would bring the bears back and pull the index back to 10,600 level. Considering the derivative data, the long and short ratio of FIIs in index futures has reached near 23 per cent — the lowest it went since February 2018 (which was around 18 per cent). Generally, we have witnessed a sharp recovery in the markets in such conditions. Thus, chances are high that the breakout might happen on the higher side.


What could traders do: With regards to individual stocks, we are witnessing a trend line breakout in Maruti, UltraTech and Hero MotoCorp. Any dips could be used to accumulate them for positional trade. On the contrary, UPL is the stock which we would recommend to sell. The current price action on the daily chart has taken a shape of “rising wedge” pattern, which generally occurs after a drastic fall and could be considered as a dead-cat bounce. Traders can create shorts in the stock between ₹578-582 levels for the downside target of ₹555 with a stop loss of ₹592.



PRITESH MEHTA
LEAD TECHNICAL ANALYST, YES SECURITIES


Where are we : Undeterred by Thursday’s fag-end decline, Nifty marched ahead in Friday’s session. Rather than looking at the presence of supply line around three-digit Gann number of 111(00), it is now essential to focus on the overall market structure which continues to be positive. The trend which has caught our attention is the participation of broader markets (NSE MidCap 100 index up over 3 per cent since recent low of September 4). It’s no longer only large-cap driven market. We have seen different stocks and sectors participating in last few sessions (So this market is not driven by only handful of large heavyweight stocks) which makes it difficult to break the spirit of the bulls.


What is in store: Despite the strong Friday rally, range expansion is highly awaited and current consolidation could probably end in this week’s trade. A typical trend is observed in last two week’s trade i.e. buy on dips which underlines market strength and resilience. The index has completed three consecutive shifts in orbits post June peak of 121(00) and since last one month it is locked in tussle between three-digit Gann number of 106(00)-111(00). Broad based participation, churning of sectors, presence of Gann anniversary period and comeback of BankNifty in Friday’s trade indicates case of a strong upside move towards 11,350.
What could traders do: Daily ratio chart of BankNifty versus Nifty shows a reversal from point of polarity zone around 2.5. The same coincides 50 per cent retracement of the previous upmove from September 2018 to July 2019, which suggests possible outperformance from banking stocks from hereon.

TECHNICAL AND DERIVATIVES ANALYST, KARVY STOCK BROKING


Where we are: Nifty is currently hovering around the psychological mark of 11,000 as tough war is witnessed between the bulls and bears from last couple of weeks. In the broader market we may see stock specific action spread across the various sectors taking cues from the domestic and global news flows. The next crucial supports placed near 10,900-10,920 zones below which it may drift towards 10,800 levels. The index may witness fresh round of short covering rally if it closes well above 11,120-11,150 levels.


What is in store: We expect Nifty to remain highly vulnerable to the global and domestic developments coupled with the ongoing weakness in the rupee and rebound in crude oil prices. As per the options data of the weekly options expiry, Nifty is having maximum call writing at 11100CE followed by 11200CE while on the flip side 10900PE is having the maximum open interest followed by heavy build up in 10800PE indicating the next crucial support. The overall technical set up suggests that the broader market conditions may remain volatile with wild move expected on either side.


What could traders do: At current juncture, the volatility has narrowed to 15 per cent as depicted by India Vix index with Nifty flirting with its short-term moving average. It is advisable to avoid any directional call in Nifty till clear trend emerges on technical parameters. Meanwhile short-term traders may put their long bet in counters like Siemens, Divi’s Lab, Nestle and Avenue Supermarts which has witnessed pattern breakouts followed by Bajaj Auto and Larsen & Toubro which has added long addition in the derivative space."

Indian chemical giant UPL Ltd. was defeated in court Friday by a small Philadelphia agrotech company that sued it for stealing its main trade secret — and the expert it hired to develop it.

A federal jury in Wilmington, Delaware, told UPL and its Decco unit to pay AgroFresh Solutions Inc. $31 million partly for infringing its patent on a technology that keeps apples fresh in storage after harvest. The award was less than a tenth of the $346.2 million AgroFresh had asked for.

AgroFresh is “pleased” with the verdict and “will petition the court for an award of up to three times its compensatory damages based on the findings by the jury of a willful infringement,” Chief Executive Officer Jordi Ferre said in a statement. The compensatory part of the award was $7 million.

Shares of AgroFresh rose 2.6% to close Monday’s session at $2.35. They surged 29%, to $3.03 as of 6:07 p.m. in New York, after the statement.

UPL, of Mumbai, said in a statement it’s disappointed in the verdict and will appeal. UPL shares closed down 0.5%.

The technology, called SmartFresh, centers on a synthetic compound that slows the ripening process. According to the lawsuit, the primary patent expired in 2015, the year AgroFresh was spun off from Dow Chemical Co. The spinoff sought damages for what the defendants did earlier.

That was to turn a tech whiz under exclusive contract with AgroFresh into a sort of double agent, it claimed, helping Decco sail past the sweat equity AgroFresh had poured into its largest source of revenue and develop a competing product called TruPick.

The jury rejected UPL and Decco’s contentions that the patent shouldn’t have been issued, as well as their argument that they had used public information to develop TruPick. It apparently found some merit in the defense’s description of the proposed damages as “astronomical.”

“Competition can be fierce, ladies and gentlemen, and it’s no different here,” Gerald Ivey, a lawyer for the defendants, said in his closing argument.

The technology behind a firm apple is sophisticated. The compound is extremely volatile in gas form, a major hurdle to its commercial use. AgroFresh researchers developed a way to stabilize the gas by trapping the molecules in various formulations. To treat produce, a trained applicator dissolves a pouch of powder or a tablet in water in an enclosed storage space with the fruit.

The global market for post-harvest treatment of produce will grow to $1.67 billion by 2022, from $1.17 billion in 2017, according to one forecast. A separate forecast, by the United Nations, puts the global population at about 9.7 billion by 2050, with 68% of it in urban areas, where most of the produce consumed would have to be shipped from farms.

During the harvest from August through October, MacGill told the court at the outset of the trial, growers place as many as 1.2 million apples in storage facilities the size of a high school gym. Thanks to SmartFresh, he said, more than eight billion pounds of apples have been sold as fresh, rather than processed.

To develop the product, AgroFresh sought the help of a food-science professor, according to court papers. UPL, which was interested in buying the company, had signed a nondisclosure agreement in September 2014 for access to its documents as part of the bidding process. The next month, it hired a former AgroFresh manager, who met with the professor, who then signed a confidentiality agreement with Decco and helped it develop TruPick, according to the filings.

The case is AgroFresh Inc. v. Essentiv LLC, 16-cv-662, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington)."

Once a year, for the Hindu festival of Diwali, India’s stock exchanges hold a special one-hour session where brokers make ceremonial purchases of shares to win the favor of the goddess of wealth.

The centuries-old tradition of seeking the blessings of Lakshmi has taken on an added purpose this year as investors pray the recent government steps revives growth and solidifies the recovery in equities that’s taken the $2 trillion market close to its June peak.

“We expect the index to scale into uncharted territory and give a lot of opportunities for wealth creation in the coming quarters,” said Rajiv Singh, chief executive officer at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. Singh said cyclical stocks will do well as the economy is expected to revive.

While India’s key equity indexes have risen at least 10% since last Diwali, led by a handful of heavyweights, the broader market has trailed the gains sparked by a surprise tax cut for corporates and the return of global funds to local shares. That’s as investors continue to seek the safety of the biggest stocks in times of tepid earnings growth and a lingering credit-market crisis.



Still, analysts remain optimistic that the stimulus measures and the five back-to-back rate cuts so far in 2019 will help narrow this divergence in the new Hindu financial year -- Samvat 2076 -- that gets underway Sunday. The session will begin at 6:15 p.m. in Mumbai. Markets will be closed Monday.

“The backdrop for the economy and earnings is improving as we step into the new Samvat,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. The $600 million of foreign funds that came into shares this month, on top of September’s $955 million, will grow as the economy gets better, he said.

The iconic Jeejeebhoy Towers, home to the BSE, will be decorated and lit up for the occasion, as brokers flock to its premises in traditional attire along with their families to take part in a ritual that goes back at least five decades. The S&P BSE Sensex has ended higher in eight of the past 12 Diwali-day sessions.

5,2019-11-06,Phosphorus Limited,"Individual investors, including high networth ones, are seeking comfort in blue chips as the broader market has turned volatile.

The total number of individual shareholders in Nifty50 constituent companies increased to 2.33 crore as of September end, 2019 from 2.23 crore on June 30 and 2.16 crore as of March 31,.

As options dried up elsewhere in the market, these investors went for heavy buying in select Nifty stocks, trying to make the most of a market rebound. That, even when valuations of many of these stocks hit sky-high levels.

For instance, Bajaj Finance hovered at a price-to-earnings multiple of 51 times and a price-to-book value of 3.10 times on November 1 after the scrip jumped 130 per cent since December end, 2017.

Nestle India traded at a P/E of 85.40 against the industry average of 49.20. Its price-to-book value stood at 15 times on November 1. The stock has rallied 93 per cent in 22 months to trade around Rs 7,700. Nestle became a part of Nifty on September 27, 2019.

Are these valuations justifiable?

Sunil Singhania-led Abakkus Asset Management in a recent report, titled ‘The Big Call-Bubble in Quality?’ said some of the quality stocks have now reached the bubble zone and could give zero or negative returns over the next few years.

With over 22 lakh small shareholders, 10 per cent of Nifty’s individual investors were holding Reliance Industries, the country’s biggest firm by market value. The stock jumped nearly 60 per cent to Rs 1,457 on November 1 from Rs 921.10 on December 29, 2017. The domestic equity market has remained highly volatile during this period following Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps for mutual funds, credit crisis in the NBFC sector, general elections, unfavourable announcements in the Union Budget 2019, bleak macroeconomic data and adverse global cues.

More than 10 lakh retail investors held SBI, Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares each as of September 30. Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares have cracked more than 50 per cent since December 2017, while country’s biggest lender by assets SBI has largely been flat.

ITC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, TCS, HDFC Bank and Coal India were among other players in which more than 6 lakh individuals held a stake at the end of September quarter, 2019.

IDBI Capital Markets in October maintained a ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490. Among other largecap players, Emkay Global Financial Services is ‘overweight’ on Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Grasim, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, RIL and United Breweries.


Tables: Number of individual shareholders in Nifty companies
 
 
Among other ‘expensive’ Nifty stocks, industry heavyweights TCS, HUL, RIL, Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Titan Company, ICICI Bank, Britannia, Axis Bank and UPL are among other stocks whose P/Es hovered above their respective industry average as of November 1, 2019.

The P/E ratio measures the relationship of a stock price with its earnings per share.

Analysts say stock investing is never only about financials and there are always some qualitative and future growth aspects to it. “Every valuation methodology has one underlying principle: the value paid today should be justifying future earnings potential,” Abakkus said in a report.

The domestic money manager listed HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Titan, Siemens, Berger Paints and ABB among 27 perceived high-quality expensive stocks, where profit after tax and revenue growth stood at a CAGR of 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, in past nine years (See Table).

“We don’t think anywhere in the world at any point of time, companies have traded at P/Es of 50-100 for 10-15 years stretch,” Abakkus said in the report.



It said penetration levels of most of the products these companies produce are much higher today than what they were 9-10 years back, and hence, the growth over the next few years should be lower than what it was over the past few years.

On the other hand, the number of investors in the BSE Smallcap index stocks remained almost stagnant in last three quarters at 4.23 crore.

The number of individual shareholders in BSE Midcap index companies increased marginally to 1.37 crore at the end of September quarter from 1.36 crore at the end of the preceding quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed on November 1. The figure stood at 1.34 crore on March 31, 2019.

Analysts see more comfort in the second-rung stocks, which have been beaten down badly over the past 22 months. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have cracked 17 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC, says midcap and smallcap stocks are clearly giving more relative valuation comfort and that is where you will end up making more money than the largecaps over the medium to long term.

“We have been suggesting that investors should increase a little bit of allocation towards midcap and smallcap stocks. Even in our portfolios, wherever the investment mandate allows, we have been buying midcaps and smallcaps from across sectors,” he told ETNOW during an interaction."

Fitch raises India's FY20 deficit forecast to 3.6% Fitch Solutions on Wednesday raised India's fiscal deficit forecast to 3.6% of the GDP for this fiscal year, from 3.4% previously, due to weak revenue collections resulting from sluggish economic growth and government's sweeping corporate tax rate cut. Fitch said it was revising the fiscal deficit forecast as revenue collection is likely to fall far short of the projections in the FY2019/20 Union Budget due to weak GST and corporate tax collections.


IMF seeks transparency on India's fiscal mathNew Delhi needs to become more ""transparent"" on the fiscal numbers as it is a ""laggard"" among the G20 peers on this front, a senior official from the International Monetary Fund said here on Wednesday. The government has been missing its budgeted fiscal targets for the past few years and there is a need for a ""credible fiscal consolidation"" which is more ambitious as well, the official said, adding this is more so as government has not addressed how it will make up for the massive Rs 1.45 lakh crore tax giveaways in the form of corporate tax cuts. The comments come amid allegations of the budget math not adding up with some pointing to a Rs 1.7 lakh crore hole in the estimates,


India’s oil and gas output downDomestic production of crude oil and natural gas has fallen by 6% and 1.5%, respectively, in the first half of the current fiscal year, further increasing dependence on imports to meet rising demand.

8,2019-11-07,Phosphorus Limited,"Corporate actions can often hold a lot of cues not just about how a business is doing but also how the stock is going to perform in the near term. There are corporate actions that often bring material changes to a company, directly affecting stakeholders. These may be monetary as well as non-monetary.

Which is why it makes sense to have a look at the corporate agendas for the day’s as announced to the stock exchanges. 

BPCL, Sun Pharma, DLF, Power Grid, HPCL, UPL, Adani Transmission, United Breweries, IGL and UCO Bank are among some of the firms that will declare Q2 earnings later in the day.

Here is a list of the board meetings scheduled for the day:-"
9,2019-11-07,Phosphorus Limited,"Some of the real estate companies would benefit from the government moves, but it is not the time to get carried away and just buy any stock, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Do you think there is reason to get excited about owning realty stocks on the back of the steps announced by the finance minister last evening?Whatever was done yesterday augurs very well for real estate sector. It is more of a relief package rather than a stimulus. Probably a lot of real estate players and home buyers who were stuck would find relief out of this measure. Would all the realty stocks rally from here on? Yes, but to me, the proxy plays would be more important. 

A lot of banks which were already stuck in a lot of such projects which were 50% complete and were about to be declared as NPA or have been declared as NPA. There would be more beneficiaries — some banks, lots of NBFCs, PSU banks, building materials as a sector — all will benefit more. Some of the real estate companies would benefit but as I said, it is not the time to get carried away and buy any type of stocks. 

Stay in the fundamentally great stocks, companies which were not getting relief out of this, would get a little bit of earnings momentum from here on. It will take its own sweet time, three months, six months down the line. However, the structure is not yet finalised and it is not time to get carried away but to buy only the time tested ones.


Do you think chasing stocks for all those who have missed out, still makes sense?The rally has been too fast and furious for a lot of people to digest this type of earnings or rather market momentum. One gets a ‘left out’ feeling among a lot of participants. It is sort of liquidity driven, as foreign investors have started to invest in the last three-four weeks. The sense here is that the market has actually not been led only by liquidity, but is also the revival of earnings. A lot of people had written off the second quarter earnings expecting a washout, but that has not been the case. There are a lot of green shoots as well.

My sense is that this rally is driven not only by liquidity but also by bit of fundamentals and a glimpse of economic recovery which will take place via monetary and fiscal stimulus where RBI is cutting rates and also government has started taking a lot of steps in the last two-three months. So yes, there is some juice left to the rally. Of course, nobody knows if in the shorter term, there can be 200-300 point rally here on, but the sense is that it is more a buy-on-dips market rather than a sell-on-rise. Every dip has to be accumulated to buy fundamentally good stocks. 


 Is Titan one of those stocks one should buy on every decline or does a 10% decline not make it a value buy yet?There are two answers. If you ask whether it is a value buy, the answer is no, it is not a value buy. Rather, it is a buy or an accumulator because what we have seen that there are a handful of such stocks in India, maybe 15-20 stocks like Nestle or Titan, or even something like Bajaj Finance or Finserv. These are normally very common plays and it is cliché to talk about them. 

In the case of Titan, these were quarterly number and a guidance which people knew about, but the management came out and straight forward talked about cutting the guidance from 20% to around 11%. It does not hamper the prospects of a company which has been at the forefront of all these businesses. So my view is yes, if you get another 5-7% correction, you should start accumulating Titan if you want to construct a portfolio for the next two-three years. 

One quarter can still be a dampener but that can again be used as a trenching out opportunity. We would be buyers in this type of businesses where consumption can remain the centrifugal theme in the market for some time to come.


Today we will have results of Sun Pharma, UPL coming out. What is going to be on your radar? In pharma, we have been big fans of MNC pharma companies with high market shares, the foreign player doing a lot of capex. It can be companies like Abbott Laboratories or Pfizer or Sanofi. All these companies have done fantastically well, particularly Abbott Laboratories which we have been buying since last one, one and a half years. We see no reason why this trend will not continue. 

So, rather than playing the Indian pharma story or the generic story, we have been more active on the MNC pharma side. A sort of recovery was indicated in the numbers of Cipla as well as some other numbers. Probably there is a trend which will bottom out in the generic companies as well. But we are not yet very aggressive buyers over there. 


Would you say the pain is in the price and at 7000 plus levels, would you be a buyer in Maruti?It is a good hold. The price movement in the auto stocks and particularly in Maruti, has been a little far ahead of expectations. The last couple of months have seen a good demand recovery, and not entirely due to the festive season. There were a lot of discounts available before the BS-VI sets in. So, in that sense, the price movement in auto is a little uncomfortable in the shorter term, But then, the correction had been a sort of carnage. It is a good hold at this time. 

Let us monitor the auto sales numbers for November and December, where one needs to realise that the festive season demand will be over, but whether the sustainability of a normal course of sales which Maruti used to do last year is achieved or not, will be a key monitorable and already the management is guiding towards lower growth. The stock would react a little bit on that and for that it could be a good hold and after monitoring for the next couple of months, a conclusive call can be taken on Maruti. 


When it comes to some of the FMCG majors like HUL and Marico, the commentary is not boding well despite whatever we may be seeing on the stock price. What would be your call on some of the FMCG names?The market was factoring in a disastrous set of numbers from a lot of companies not only FMCG; but even in some of the blue-eyed boys like paint stocks, the management commentary is not very optimistic. The numbers also disappointed to the extent that the market was expecting, Dabur talked about headwinds which have emerged from the lack of demand or demand being low but the numbers did not show that type of behaviour if you analyse these numbers. The sense here is that FMCGs could still be bought selectively. 

If the market needs to go above from here, there is a lot of interest in the consumption related stocks, building material stocks and paints stocks. There is a demand for the top 50-70-80 companies in India. I do not see any reason for people to sell this off if other companies start doing well in these 15-20-25 good businesses and this portfolio probably would do very well over the longer term."
10,2019-11-07,Phosphorus Limited,"Government-owned e-commerce firm MSTC was one of the biggest gainers on the bourses on Thursday, after L&T appointed it its selling agent. The scrip hit the upper circuit limit on BSE.

Sun Pharma was the biggest Sensex gainer after it posted Rs 1,064 crore profit for September quarter. InterGlobe Aviation gained after announcing a codeshare deal with Qatar Airways. 

Among sectors, all but auto ended in the green on NSE buoyed by positive global cues, including a visible thaw in US-China trade war. The 50-share Nifty ended 50 points up at 12,016, while its BSE counterpart Sensex rose 183.96 points to end at new lifetime peak of 40,653.

""Nifty witnessed some profit booking at high points, but managed to close above 12,000 for the first time since June. It formed a dragonfly Doji candle pattern on the daily chart. If it manages to go past the 12,025 mark, then we may see a push towards the 12,100-12,200 zone in the near term,” said Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.


Here is a lowdown of the movers and shakers of Thursday’s session on Dalal Street:

IndiGo-Qatar agreement lift sharesInterGlobe Aviation, operator of IndiGo, gained 1.75 per cent to Rs 1,494.20 on BSE after the carrier announced a codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways.

15,2019-11-08,Phosphorus Limited,"We are now fully focussed on execution after integration with Arysta and our customers are praising that, says Diego Casanello, Global COO, UPL. Our working capital build up ramps up throughout the first quarter and then in Q4 there is a rapid decline, says Casanello. Excerpts rom an interview with ETNOW.


The volume growth has been strong but margins have been muted on a year-on-year basis. What are the factors at play this quarter?We have had very strong volumes this quarter thanks to very good development in Latin America. Prices have been only slightly down, but if you think about 15% growth in volume, it has been a strong quarter as we gained market share in the agricultural market.


The revenue mix this quarter has been more tilted towards strong growth from Latin America, but weaker margins have impacted performance. Is this a trend that will reverse in the second half of the year?Latin America has historically a slightly lower margin, compared to other regions. This quarter, the graphic mix has been more weighted towards Latin America. In the northern hemisphere, we have had some drought conditions but as these markets come back, the higher margin in those markets will basically normalise our margins moving forward.


Have erratic global weather patterns played a very large role on your sales? I would have never expected rains in Mumbai in November. Globally also, my this time, rain and crop patterns have been very erratic. How does that change your business?There has always been variations across the world. It is important that you have a global footprint that allows to you hedge those risks. We are not only in the business of crop protection, but also in the business of sustainability. We are offering technologies that support farmers with respect to climate change. In terms of business development, there are pros and cons. Overall, we see this as a net positive.


Are there any plans for debt reduction or do you see it peaking in Q3 before it reduces because the market continues to have some concerns regarding the debt levels?We have guidance of $500 million of net debt reduction. We are tracking well with respect to what we are planning for this year. Our working capital build up ramps up throughout the first quarter and then in Q4 there is a rapid decline. It is a seasonal business. We are still tracking well to hit that guidance.


Are the synergies from Arysta playing out on expected lines?We have announced a synergy target of $200 million on cost and $500 million on revenue. We are ahead of our plan on cost and revenue synergies. We have consolidated plans, we have consolidated offices. We have now broader portfolios and are able to bundle those portfolios and help our customers offer complete crop solutions. This year, we will have a success story with respect to synergies.


If I track UPL, every two-three years, you have been acquiring global companies and that is how you managed to really build a formidable franchise. How come I have not heard any acquisition news in last 18 months?We just actually finished the acquisition of Arysta Lifescience. We closed the deal in February. This was a major acquisition. The business was as big as UPL and now we are number five globally in crop protection, with revenues of almost $5 billion. That was a major acquisition and now we need integration and that is where our focus is. There are some smaller acquisitions in the short-term, but right now it is very important to focus on execution and continue to grow as one of the leaders in this market.


In FY20, there was a bumpup in your debt because of working capital requirement. Where do you think your margins will settle? We have to look at the historical margins of Arysta and UPL. Analysts are very well aware how we are tracking the past and if you apply that same logic, you will see that margins are in general very stable in this business. We are not concerned about margins. This quarter, we had only a minus 1% price decline with 15% volume growth in a market environment that was very complex. 

If you see the situation, especially in the northern hemisphere, despite the draught and the highly competitive environment, our margins have been very, very healthy. Once again, with geographic mix, as North America and Europe comes back, you will see margins going up again. But historically, the margins are very stable.


DuPont has highlighted that soybean and corn seasons have been delayed this time around. Have you done any pre placement in Brazil?The planting has been delayed in North America. There was flooding in North America and that has reduced the area of soy and corn last season. It has also impacted some of the competitors that are very heavily exposed to that segment, especially on the seed side. We have a presence in very high value niches around the world. So we were not exposed to that situation. On the contrary, in the US in particular, due to the China-US trade tensions, customers have actually looked to buy more from UPL from the perspective of hedging their risk arising out of those tensions. So, there was an impact on the total area planted, particularly in corn and soybean, but there was a positive impact as we were a welcome hedge to that situation.


You are an Indian company with a significant global presence. You have managed to grow in the last 10 years because the world was opening up. What do you think will happen in this trade war situation? How will this have an impact on your geographical presence, manufacturing facilities and the local businesses? You work a lot with farmers and agriculture is a very sensitive topic in today’s world?We hope that the overall trade situation normalises. We can say that today the situation is a net positive for UPL, but over time, we believe in fair trade and that stability in this market is a good thing. Our business is very local that means we produce, we formulate our products in the markets where we also sell our products. That in itself is a protection against the disruptions. 

India so far is in good relationships with most of the markets we are doing business today. But again, we hope the trade tensions come down, especially as our farmers need planning stability.


On Arysta acquisition, there was almost Rs 5 billion of integration charges there. Is any further impact expected?We have told the analysts that we are expecting around $60 million integration charges this year. If you look at the magnitude of the acquisition, it is a very effective integration and the way we are trending right now, I think we have those integration charges very much under control. We closed the deal in February and announced a new organisation on 1st of April. We clarified our commercial policy to our customers very soon after that. While some of our peers that have gone through similar processes, have taken much longer. We are now fully focussed on execution and our customers are praising that. We believe that it is going to help this year to really achieve our results."

""Our goal is to create an open network for agriculture, activating connections across the world's agriculture system. It aims to power new levels of sustainable growth --for farmers, for producers, for customers, for partners and for societies everywhere. The acquisition will enhance our ability to achieve this purpose,"" UPL Global chief executive Jai Shroff said.

0,2019-12-02,Phosphorus Limited,"The recent performance of the Indian stock market is not in sync with economic fundamentals. While the market continues to hit all-time highs, macro indicators paint a dismal picture of the economy. The weakness comes across through numbers that show declining core sector growth, falling consumption, likely fiscal slippage and lower GDP growth projections. Some experts believe that deteriorating macro fundamentals are due to structural issues that will create obstacles on the road to economic recovery. As markets cannot remain isolated from the economy for a long period of time, one can expect high volatility in the near future.

Generally, volatility analysis is done using the returns a stock or an index generates and such returns are calculated for different time frames—weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly. Statistical tools like standard deviation and beta are often used for volatility estimation and for identifying stable or low volatile stocks. Instead of looking at volatility from the returns side, how about looking at companies that have displayed low volatility in their core fundamentals like revenue growth or EPS growth over a period of time?

Companies that maintain stability in principal fundamentals tend to control systematic or market risks better than the rest. Stability in revenue growth implies pricing power and durable demand for the company’s products or services. On the other hand, stability in EPS growth indicates operational efficiency and cost control. To identify such companies, the consolidated numbers showing sales revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth were analysed for the past 10 financial years, starting from 2009-10. Over 700 companies with market cap greater than Rs 500 crore were considered. Similar growth numbers were extracted for the aggregate BSE500 index.

Standard deviation of the series of revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth were worked out for the companies and for the aggregate BSE500 index. Only companies that reported positive adjusted EPS in all of the past 10 years were included in the analysis. To identify companies with low volatility in financials, only those with standard deviation of revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth less than that of the BSE500 index were filtered out. Only 22 companies passed these filters. The past 5-and 10-year average return of this group was 82% and 413% respectively. The BSE500 delivered 42% and 133.3% returns during the same period. All returns are absolute and point to point. The numbers clearly show that stocks with stable financials outperformed the market substantially. To look at the future potential of these shortlisted companies, only those that are covered by at least four Bloomberg analysts and those with a 1-year forward price potential greater than 10% were included.

Out of the seven companies, NTPC, Power Grid and Infosys have also shown stability in their RoEs (%). The standard deviation of these stocks based on their last 10-year RoE is less than the standard deviation of the average RoE of the BSE500 index.



NTPC
This PSU with Maharatna status is engaged in electricity generation and allied activities. The company reported strong PAT growth in the September quarter despite low PAF. The performance is helped by capacity additions and reduction in operation and maintenance costs. 



PE: 9.8
ROE(%): 10.8
Current price (Rs): 117
1-yr target price (Rs): 153
Potential upside: 31%

JM Financial is bullish on the stock and believes that improving coal supply from captive mining and coal imports will help NTPC maintain its PAF at over 85% for the full year 2019-20. Moreover, the research house feels that the CCEA approval for the sale of the government’s stake in THDC and NEEPCO to NTPC will be earnings and value accretive due to the company’s access to low-cost debt.

ITC
The diversified conglomerate has a presence in FMCG, hotels, packaging, paperboards and specialty papers and agriculture. Despite consumption slowdown, the company reported decent numbers in the September quarter with 6.6% and 36.2% year-on-year growth in sales and adjusted EPS on a consolidated basis. Lower tax and improved EBITDA margins aided the company’s performance.



PE: 20
ROE(%): 24.2
Current price (Rs): 249
1-yr target price (Rs): 321
Potential upside: 29%

Analysts believe the company’s strong brand leadership, product innovation, healthy business model, high cash generation, cost control measures and diversification across non-cyclical sectors are the key positives. Moreover, low capital intensity and robust pricing power have helped the company to maintain a strong RoCE profile.




Analysts’ recommendations


Buy: 34 
Hold: 4 
Sell: 0



NESCO
This diversified engineering conglomerate is in the business of exhibitions, events, hospitality, MICE and realty. In the September quarter, the company reported strong net profit growth helped by a decline in raw material and employee benefit costs. It generated high net cash amid consistent operating cash flows. 



PE: 23.1
ROE(%): 15.4
Current price (Rs): 616
1-yr target price (Rs): 790 
Potential upside: 28%

Nirmal Bang is bullish on the stock due to the restructuring of the NESCO IT park, increase in rentable space of BEC and the expected increase in rental rates. Moreover, a healthy balance sheet, consistently positive free cash flow and management’s growth-oriented focus with the expansion of the flagship business over the next 20 years are other positives.

1,2019-12-03,Phosphorus Limited,"Pledging of client’s shares by Hyderabad-based Karvy Stock Broking to raise money to fund its real estate business has dented investors' confidence in stock brokers. Investors are shifting to larger brokers, says Jaideep Hansraj, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities in an interview with ETMarkets.com. Hansraj, who deals with 13.59 lakh customers, denied that it was a systemic failure and termed it as an isolated incident. Edited excerpts:


The mess at Karvy Stock Broking has actually dented stock investor confidence on brokers. What led to this? Was it a systemic failure?
Indeed, investor confidence has been shaken and several investors are shifting their demat accounts to larger, established players. While confidence in smaller, younger players may be impacted, there is a flight to safety to larger, established and regulated players. 

These cases happen where businesses hold their own interests higher than clients’. It is not a systemic failure, but an isolated instance of breaking norms of prudent business behaviour.

We believe that the financial services industry is all about trust, and any player taking this lightly impacts the entire industry. The broking industry is unique in itself that it is made up of a milieu of long-serving smaller players, start-ups, and some trusted large banking companies. 


Stockbrokers often crib about being over-regulated. But this kind of crisis keeps happening. Is the average investor safe with her broker?
Regulations are meant to safeguard the interest of the investors. In this case, it wasn’t strictly about regulation, but the interpretation of trust. The Depository Participant has a simple underlying principle that clients’ shares -- while under Power of Attorney (POA) for administrative purposes -- are held solely for them. They cannot and will not be used for anything else. 

You don’t need regulation for this, but a culture of ethical behaviour. The investor must know that in financial services, he has to trust the intermediary. Trust is built over the years of keeping client interest paramount. There is a value to this. There is safety in this.


What should investors do to protect themselves in such a situation?
Be smart, follow basics. Investors must choose carefully whom they want to do business with. One must not open an account with anyone just because the office is close to home, a friend has recommended, or it has a fancy website. The critical question to ask is – can I trust the institution and the people behind it? It is, after all, your hard-earned money. 


Let’s talk about the market. The indices have hit record highs while economic growth has slowed to a multi-quarter low. Isn’t that an aberration? What’s driving this rally? Is it sustainable?
There has been a disconnect between the macro-economic environment and markets, which could continue for some time. The Street seems to be factoring in a swift recovery in the economy, going by the rich valuations of the Nifty50. But we are not sure when the convergence between the economy and the market will take place. There is a mixed bag of factors in play here. 


Trust is built over the years of keeping client interest paramount. There is a value to this. There is safety in this.-Jaideep Hansraj
High-frequency indicators are not showing signs of macro improvement. But the broader Indices are close to near-highs. This is because of a faster recovery in earnings led by the corporate tax rate cut and lower loan-loss provisions for banks. 

After the reduction in corporate tax rate, earnings have picked up in Q2FY20, and foreing portfolio investors (FPIs) have turned positive on India. Sentiment and flows are also driving markets higher as there have been some positive developments on the US-China trade war. The series of intervention by the Finance Ministry in the last two months has also changed the mood of the market. 

There has been a remarkable difference in the performance of the top 20 stocks of the Nifty and the rest of the market. Most high-quality largecap stocks have benefited from the lower tax rate, and to that extent and their performance has further contributed to the Nifty’s up move. 


Midcaps and smallcaps are the talk of the town. But since the last time we saw a rally in midcaps, the equation has changed with market regulator Sebi’s reclassification of funds. Can one expect midcaps to rebound like in the past?
If you look at the valuations, both the midcap and smallcap indices are trading at a discount to the Nifty50. The midcap index forward PE is at a 12% discount to the Nifty’s forward PE. (In the middle of this year, the discount of the midcap index vis-à-vis the Nifty50 had fallen to 20%). 

Meanwhile, the underperformance of the smallcap index vis-a-vis the Nifty50 is closer to the three previous instances seen in the last 15 years. This portrays a good upside potential in the smallcaps against the largecaps. The midcap index too has broken the 200-week moving average on the upside and that could be a positive sign for the space.

For the mid and smallcaps to outperform the largecaps, we need a broad recovery in the economy with improved credit offtake along with better print of IIP and GDP growth. If the forthcoming Union Budget provides some incentives to taxpayers and investors, then we could see a broader rally in the market which could revive interest in the mid & smallcap space. 

A base for future outperformance of mid and smallcap has been set in this calendar year which could fructify in next calendar year as and when there is a broader economic recovery. One can increase exposure in mid and smallcaps vis-à-vis largecaps with a two to three-year view. 


Investors looking for value buys are facing a crucial question: which of the beaten-down stocks will rebound and which will probably never return to their previous highs again?
Investors need to be careful while evaluating value stocks and ascertaining whether they will recover or remain a value trap. Companies having deep value but lacking the ability to show revenue and earnings growth in future could be value traps and hence worth avoiding. Companies which are trading below their 10-year average valuations and can show revenue and earnings growth with recovery in their sector or economy, deserve to be evaluated and invested. 

Investors should have a specific checklist or parameters like quality of management, promoter holding and pledged shares, margins, return ratios, cash flows, working capital, etc. before taking the final decision to invest in any value stock. 

Excellent quality mid and smallcaps that have been beaten down due to the down cycle of the sector or economy and are available way below their RoE and RoCE, should be the preferred choice. Poorly governed companies with weak balance sheets and return ratios should be avoided as they may not be on investors’ and portfolio managers’ radar. 


How do you read the outcome from the just-concluded Q2 earnings season? Some say the numbers were good for select stocks mostly because of the corporate tax cut?
The September quarter results were optically healthy on earnings but weak on revenue growth. EBITDA looks very high due to the adoption of Ind-AS 116. Net Profit figures for many companies are not comparable on a YoY basis as many of them have moved to lower corporate tax rate and reduced their deferred tax liabilities or assets to account for the lower tax rate. Adjusted net profit of Nifty 50 declined by 3.2% YoY. 

Private sector banks reported weak earnings due to adjustment towards deferred tax assets, while SBI reported a significantly higher net profit as it continued with the earlier tax regime. Hence, if we see Nifty50 adjusted earnings growth excluding banks, then it has fallen by 10.5% in Q2FY20 on YoY basis. 

Nifty50 companies that outperformed our estimates on PBT basis include Cipla, Dr Reddy’s, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC and Tata Motors. Similarly, Nifty 50 companies that underperformed our estimates are: GAIL, Hindustan Unilever, IndianOil Corp, Tata Steel, UPL and Ultratech Cement. 

Sector-wise, banks, diversified financials, healthcare services, media and transportation delivered strong growth in net profit YoY while automobiles and components, gas utilities, metals and mining, oil & gas and telecom sectors declined YoY."

9,2019-12-10,Phosphorus Limited,"Dalal Street produced many multibaggers since the beginning of this century despite challenges in the form of the global financial crisis, liquidity crunch, credit crisis and a slowdown in the domestic economy.

While 173 stocks in the domestic equity market multiplied wealth by over 10 times between January 2001 and December 2019, a couple of stocks stood out and rallied up to 2,00,000 per cent.

With a 2,16,860 per cent rally, Symphony emerged as top grosser, jumping to Rs 1,095.70 as of December 6, 2019 from an adjusted price of Rs 0.50 as of December 29, 2000.

This would have turned an investment of just Rs 10,000 in Symphony into around Rs 2.17 crore in 19 years.

Brokerage HDFC Securities in November gave a ‘buy’ rating on Symphony with a price target of Rs 1,812.

“Symphony continued its strong momentum in the second quarter after a sharp recovery in the summer of 2019. The second quarter performance was in line with expectations and further builds our confidence for a robust H2FY20 show. We remain bullish on Symphony given its sharp recovery in domestic business and the scope to tap new opportunities (industrial and commercial cooling, portable coolers in Aus and US). We believe the stock will get a re-rating, owing to consistent outperformance versus appliance companies,” HDFC Securities said.

For the quarter ended September 2019, the company posted a net profit of Rs 57 crore, up 67.65 per cent from Rs 34 crore reported for the same period last year. Net sales increased 31.75 per cent YoY to Rs 195 crore during the quarter under review.

NBFC major Bajaj Finance and pesticides and agrochemical player UPL are the next big gainers in the list. Where the former rallied 1,53,459 per cent, the latter advanced 1,15,318 per cent during this period.

Bajaj Finance recently posted a 63 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 1,506.29 crore for the quarter ended September 2019. The NBFC had posted Rs 923.47 crore profit for the corresponding quarter last year.

UPL, which was on an acquisition spree in recent years, had in November announced another deal, involving Yoloo (Laoting) Bio- technology, a Chinese agrochemicals firm, for a reported consideration of around Rs 95 crore.

In July 2018, the company announced its largest acquisition of the US-based Arysta LifeScience for $4.2 billion, catapulting it to the league of top five agrochemicals players globally with over $5 billion in combined revenue and around $1 billion in pre-tax profit.

Brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on UPL post Q2 results with a price target of Rs 665.

“In the near term, the stock may remain subdued due to weak growth, the US litigation and concerns over shifting goal posts on merger synergies post Arysta merger, especially those from revenue. We, however, maintain a ‘Buy’ rating based on the long-term growth prospects, once the combined UPL–Arysta portfolio starts delivering the full potential as expected by the management,” Nirmal Bang Securities said in a report last month.

Auto and auto ancillary players Balkrishna Industries (up 98,777 per cent) and Eicher Motors (up 75,996 per cent) stood among other top five gainers in the list.

Balkrishna Industries reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 294.31 crore in Q2FY20 against Rs 210.30 crore in the same period last year. However, the company's revenue declined 17 per cent YoY to Rs 1,084.28 crore in Q2FY20.

Chola Securities in November gave a ‘Sell’ call on Balkrishna Industries with a price target of Rs 790 due to muted demand outlook and return on equity of less than 20 per cent.

On the other hand, Asian Market Securities recently initiated coverage of Balkrishna with a target price of Rs 989.

Established in 1987, Balkrishna Industries started as an automobile tyre manufacturer and entered high margin off-highway tyres (OHT) business in 1995.

Eicher Motors owns one of the oldest motorcycle brands in the world – the Royal Enfield (RE) – a brand that is also the market leader in the Indian super-premium motorcycle (over 250 CC) category. It also has a JV with Volvo for the commercial vehicle business in India.

RE is witnessing demand weakness for the first time since its renaissance in 2008, as it is in a perfect storm with weak industry environment, substantial cost inflation and a new competitor. After witnessing severe headwinds during the past 12 months, volumes to recover gradually from here on, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

25,2019-12-23,Phosphorus Limited,"Mumbai: As equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty continue to scale new highs every second week, analysts are divided on their market outlook for the weeks ahead. Stock selection would be crucial from here on, they say.

Sensex and Nifty scaled record highs last week on the back of continued foreign fund inflows, as risk appetite improved following an agreement on the Phase One of US–China trade deal. However, RBI’s pause on key policy rate capped the gains. For the week, Sensex rose 1.64 per cent while Nifty added 1.53 per cent.

The market has been witnessing rotation of sectors as well as stocks. “This is something we have been observing over the past three months,” says Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group. “It is becoming difficult to see where the market is headed and what shape and position it will take going forward.”

But most analysts agree the market is teeming with stock-specific opportunities. Based on the recommendations of some of the top analysts on Dalal Street, we picked 12 stock ideas that they said are likely to deliver solid gains over next few weeks.


Vikas Jain, senior research analyst, Reliance Securities.

Cadila Healthcare| Buy| Target price Rs 295| Stop loss Rs 248
This stock has seen a breakout from the long-term average and rose to a seven-month closing high with volumes signalling strong buying interest. Key technical indicators are positively poised above their averages, signalling strength on the counter. The analyst believes long positions can be initiated at this level and on dips for a price target of Rs 295 with a stop loss at Rs 248.


UPL | Buy | Target price: Rs 645 | Stop Loss: Rs 555
This stock has seen a breakout from its congestion zone at Rs 540-570 levels with strong volumes and closed above the medium-term averages. A bullish cross-over in RSI and Stochastic are signalling a turnaround and resumption of its northward journey which may result in a sharp up-move from current level. The analyst recommends that long positions can be initiated for a target of Rs 645 with a stop loss at Rs 555.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Britannia | Buy | Price target Rs 3,370| Stop loss Rs 3,027
Price action on this counter appears to be quite encouraging, as it is in a consolidation mode for last four weeks after retracing around 62 per cent of its last leg of rally from the low of Rs 2,835. Moreover, it closed above its narrow consolidation band at Rs 3,115 – 3,025 in the last session. Hence, if it sustains above Rs 3,030 level, it shall eventually head towards its interim top at Rs 3,399, the analyst said. He advised traders to buy the stock for a target of Rs 3,370 with a stop loss placed below Rs 3,027 on a closing basis.


Titan| Buy| Target price Rs 1,270 | Stop loss Rs 1,149
Friday’s price action on this counter on much higher volumes is clearly suggesting that it has bottomed out at the recent low of Rs 1,123. After registering a huge bearish gap in the Rs 1,277 – 1,199 zone on November 6, this counter slipped into the consolidation between Rs 1,199 and Rs 1,130 levels for five weeks. With last Friday’s strong comeback, the analyst believes the stock has positioned for a pullback rally. In that scenario, it shall eventually move ahead towards Rs 1,277 level to bridge the said bearish gap. The analyst advised positional traders to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on declines in the Rs 1,180 – 1,170 zone for a target of Rs 1,270. The stop loss suggested for the trade is a close below Rs 1,149 level.


Corporation Bank | Buy| Target price Rs 28| Stop loss Rs 24
This counter appears to be consolidating for last 18 sessions in the Rs 27 – 23 band after witnessing sporadic rise from the lows of Rs 15-29 in just four sessions. Friday’s price action, at the lower end of consolidation band, on the back of huge volumes suggested that this counter is positioning itself for a resumption of the up-move. In such a scenario, it shall initially head to test its recent swing high of Rs 29, the analyst believes. He advised positional traders to buy this stock with a stop loss below Rs 24 on closing basis and for a target of Rs 28.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst Angel Broking

ICICI Lombard | Buy | Target price Rs 1,552| Stop loss Rs 1,327
This stock has been a traders’ delight for some time, but it faced a hurdle around Rs 1,400 level in the past few weeks. On the daily chart, the stock broke this hurdle and confirmed a bullish continuation breakout, known as ‘Rectangular Channel’. In addition, prices have closed above the higher range of the Bollinger Band, indicating a trending up-move after its recent consolidation. On the oscillators front, the RSI has given a fresh ‘buy’ signal with its smoothened moving average supporting the ‘buy’ call. Hence, the analyst recommends buying this stock at current level for a target of Rs 1,552 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 1,327, he said.


L&T Infotech| Buy | Target price Rs 1,840 | Stop loss Rs 1,640
On the daily chart, the stock has seen a strong up-move in the past couple of sessions to break above the trend line resistance joining the two major tops. The said breakout is supported by a strong bullish candle. In addition, the RSI has entered the positive zone and given a fresh buy signal with its smoothened average. The prices have closed above the higher range of the Bollinger Band, suggesting a trending up-move in the near term. Looking at all the above evidence, the analyst senses a strong upside in the near term. He recommends buying the stock at current level for a price target of Rs 1,840 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 1,640, he said.


DLF| Buy| Target price Rs 249| Stop loss Rs 221

Where We Are: The holiday week gone-by saw a tepid expiry to December series as markets mainly traded rangebound due to lack of any global trigger amidst the festive lull. The overall market breadth improved with much of action seen in midcap smallcap counters. Nifty closed the week at 12245 ending 12% up year to date.
