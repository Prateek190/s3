24,2018-01-03,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (Taipa) believes that the telecom infrastructure policy formulated by the Narendra Modi-led BJP government in Gujarat was unfair and needs overhaul in tandem with Centre’s Right-of-Way (RoW) norms.

 Taipa represents mobile tower firms such as Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel, American Tower Corporation (ATC), Tower Vision and GTL Infrastructure— that deploy infrastructure for— Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Jio for telephony services.

 “The Gujarat state needs to notify a tower policy, aligned with RoW rules issued by the Central government in order to ensure seamless tower installation across the state irrespective of any particular technology,” Taipa Director General Tilak Raj Dua said.

 The state policy notified in October, 2012, according to industry insiders, was biased to favour billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned pure play fourth-generation (4G) technology operator Reliance Jio Infocomm.

 Based on a proposal of Reliance Industries’ Infotel Broadband Service Limited (IBSL) which procured Broadband Wireless Access spectrum in 2010, the 21-page guideline talks about deploying telecom network for ‘4G services’ alone.

 IBSL was later acquired by the Reliance Industries and renamed to Reliance Jio which commercially launched 4G services in September 2016.

The norms, according to the telecom infrastructure lobby group, only regulates provisioning of 4G services by laying fibre and erecting poles rather than focusing on holistic development of telecom infrastructure.

 The policy imposes exorbitant charges for laying the OFC cable ranging from Rs 1000- Rs 1500 per meter which contradicts the charges prescribed under the RoW rules notified on November 15, 2016 by the Union government, Taipa added.

 Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, needs to double the number of mobile towers currently deployed in order to connect the unconnected and ensuring seamless network for government-to-citizen (G2C) services such as Digital India, according to Dua.

The state has close to 26,000 mobile towers mounted with more than 1 lakh base trans-receiver stations serving 69 million wireless subscribers."
22,2018-01-03,Bharti Infratel,"ET Intelligence Group: Corporates are contributing their bits in maintaining ecological balance even as they pursue growth. This is reflected in various initiatives such as reduction in water consumption by 30-60 per cent and rising share of renewable energy.

India is the fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses. It accounts for about 4.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In this backdrop, it becomes crucial for local companies to take initiatives to go green.

India’s largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki lowered its groundwater consumption by more than 60 per cent to 13,945 million cubic meters between FY15 and FY17, according to company’s sustainability report for FY17. Maruti has been able to save 200 litres per vehicle.

This was achieved by increasing the use of recycled water and by resorting to rain water harvesting which required investments in creating water lagoons. Ranjit Singh, general manager for CSR and Sustainability at Maruti Suzuki, said, “Our emphasis has been on consistently reducing water consumption by innovative methods. Our Gurugram facility has entirely shifted to canal water from groundwater.” He mentioned that sourcing from rainwater harvesting rose to 25,000 million cubic meters (mcm) in FY17 from 6,800 mcm two years ago.




 Dabur, a consumer staples company, used 11per cent less raw water and increased the use of recycled water by 9per cent. Vedanta, a metal major, met 11per cent of its water requirement through recycled water in FY17 compared with 6per cent in the previous year.

Keeping with the government’s initiative to increase share of renewable energy in the country’s total power consumption, companies are gradually raising sourcing from clean fuels such as solar power, wind, and natural gas. FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever increased the share of renewable energy to 28 per cent by taking measures such as converting agricultural waste into consumable fuel. HUL’s Sumerpur plant uses solar energy to meet 80 per cent of the power requirement. The carbon footprint of its manufacturing plants was down 13 per cent year-on-year in FY17.


Companies Cut Water Usage in Green Push
RIL has installed solar photovoltaic modules across manufacturing units. Out of the total energy requirement of Asian Paints, India’s largest paint company, 22 per cent is met by renewable energy. Maruti Suzuki meets nearly 95 per cent of the power requirement from the clean fuel such as natural gas.

Services sector companies are also taking green initiatives. Union Bank, for instance, has switched its 245 branches and their ATMs to solar power. Telecom tower companies which account for nearly 8 per cent of total diesel consumption are turning green. In the past two years, diesel consumption of Bharti Infratel dropped by 25 per cent, while 43 per cent of sites operated by Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel are now diesel free.

Turning more environment-friendly products can help companies expand their market size. For instance, Ceat, a leading tyre maker, moved to using more silica instead of carbon black due to the demand from vehicle makers and European market. Silica reduces carbon footprint of tyres. Arnab Banerjee, Executive Director at Ceat, said, “We’re working on developing products from non-petroleum raw material which are considered as green materials.”

A senior official at a leading FMCG company said that companies are willing to invest in energy efficient plants due to benefits to broader society even though it lowers internal rate of return in the short term.

Namrata Rana, director at Futurescape, a consultancy for sustainable development, said manufacturing companies are keen to reduce carbon footprint in their processes but they also need to focus on the supply side."

""This could result in increase in cost of providing the telecom service by approximately 10 per cent,"" TAIPA Director General Tilak Raj Dua said in a letter to Central Board of Excise and Customs Chairperson Vanaja N Sarna.

The Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA) has sought extension of some tax benefits that are granted to some non-telecom infrastructure firms and amendments in Goods and Services Tax.

Telecom infrastructure body, whose members include Bharti Infratel, Indus Towers, ATC etc has asked the government to apply same interest rate as paid on delay of tax refund by the government and charge by it for delay of tax payment made by the assessee.

Dua said that the mobile tower companies have invested over Rs 2.5 lakh crore to set-up over 4.5 lakh towers in the country and makes a direct contribution of more than Rs 5,000 crore annually in corporate income tax and service tax.

46,2018-01-12,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Telecom operators continue to face problems in installing mobile towers in states due to tough rules being imposed on them which are also not aligned with central government norms, industry body TAIPA said today.

""Except five states -- Haryana, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Kerala and Odisha -- none of the states have aligned their Right of Way rules for telecom infrastructure with that of the Department of Telecom (DoT).

""This is creating huge impediments in installation of mobile towers and in turn affecting quality of service,"" Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA) Director General Tilak Raj Dua told PTI.

The DoT had issued a RoW (Right of Way) policy in November 2016 which provides for no restriction on location of telecom towers, single window clearance mechanism, defined time-period for approvals, appointment of nodal officers, nominal administrative fees and deemed approval, extensively supporting the Digital India mission.

Dua said mobile tower firms are facing major problems in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra.

""Some state governments have given us the opportunity to express our view but some don't give us any chance. If (more) mobile towers are installed then call quality will increase in these states.

""The action by states will hinder government's visionary flagship program of Digital India, Smart Cities and financial inclusion,"" Dua said.

TAIPA, whose members include Bharti Infratel, ATC Towers, GTL Infrastructure, Reliance Infratel, Indus Towers and Tower Vision, said the industry players have been taking up their issues with the Punjab government since 2013, Himachal and Maharashtra since 2014 and with Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat governments since 2015 but there has been no resolution.

Dua said the draft policy of Madhya Pradesh is pending for notification since 2015 and imposes multiple fee levies of up to Rs 1 lakh, restricts location of towers and mast height, offers limited government lands, lacks single window clearance and provides permission only for five years.

""The draft of MP policy eventually hinders the momentum of tower installation across the state,"" Dua said.

He said Gujarat's policy focuses on installation of towers only for 4G technology rather than the holistic development of telecom infrastructure.

Dua said that even the existing 4G policy of Gujarat imposes multiple levies like annual renewal fee, security deposit, one-time charges for telecom infrastructure installation and escalation of annual fee by 10 percent after every three years.

""Additionally, the policy imposes exorbitantly high charges for laying optical fibre cable (OFC) ranging from Rs 1,000-1,500 per running meter which amounts to Rs 10 lakh per kilometre while the charges prescribed under the Indian Telegraph Right of Way (RoW) is Rs 1,000 per km for laying OFC and Rs 10,000 for deploying telecom towers,"" Dua said."

51,2018-01-16,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Norway’s Telenor is evaluating options to seek compensation from the Indian government in the wake of acquittals in the 2G case and will take a final call after completing the sale of its Indian unit to Bharti Airtel, two people aware of the matter said.

Bharti Airtel is awaiting approvals from the Department of Telecommunications and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for the acquisition. A key issue being debated is whether there is a case for the Scandinavian carrier to seek compensation, citing business losses. Telenor’s India venture had to buy spectrum afresh in an auction to continue services in seven circles after its mobile permits across India and the associated airwaves allotted to the company were cancelled in the 2G scam back in 2012, one person said.

A special CBI court acquitted all 18 individuals, besides related companies including the erstwhile Unitech Wireless — Telenor’s then Indian JV — accused in the 2G case last month for lack of proof of corruption in the 2008 allocation of licences. The Supreme Court had cancelled 122 licences in 2012, citing irregularities in the allocations. Telenor, in a joint venture with real estate developer Unitech, was one of the companies that lost its licences.

A Telenor spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would seek compensation. “The merger process is proceeding as per plan, pending approvals from NCLT and DoT. We do not have any further comments at this stage relating to the 2G verdict by the special court,” the Telenor spokesperson said in a written response to ET’s queries.

Telenor agreed about a year ago to sell its India business to Bharti Airtel, which would take on some of the Scandinavian carrier’s local liabilities, including outstanding spectrum payments estimated at almost Rs 1,650 crore and operational contracts, including tower leases with Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers.

The Rs 1,650 crore dues are linked to the spectrum Telenor purchased after its licences were cancelled. Telenor and Airtel declined comment on whether they would review Bharti’s need to shoulder the Norwegian carrier’s local spectrum liabilities. Telenor has had a rough time in India ever since it started operations in late 2009 with Unitech. After the cancellation of its licences, the company fell out with its Indian partner and resolved to continue its mobile services in the world’s second-biggest telecom market, taking sole ownership of its Indian arm in 2014.

Having purchased spectrum in separate auctions in seven circles, the renamed Telenor India played the price card and offered services at almost half that of its bigger rivals to gain subscribers. After Reliance Jio’s disruptive entry in September 2016, it struggled to compete as large operators slashed prices and it started losing subscribers, market share and revenue, posting operating losses as investments to upgrade and deepen its network increased."
55,2018-01-17,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi: Bharti Infratel’s net profit dropped 6% on year in the quarter ended December 2017, owing to rapid reduction in co-location of telecom sites as carriers undergoing consolidation remove overlaps in respective networks.

The telecom tower company’s consolidated net profit for October-December period came to Rs 585 crore, from Rs 620 crore in the same period the year before. Consolidated revenue rose 7% on a like-to-like basis to Rs 3,655 crore, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

“We are all aware that the Indian telecom industry is transforming with unprecedented consolidation. Inevitably and as anticipated, we saw exits of co-locations from such consolidating operators this quarter,” Akhil Gupta, Chairman, Bharti Infratel Ltd, said in the statement.

He added that while there would be more exits in the coming few quarters owing to consolidation, speedy nationwide 4G rollouts by remaining operators would lead to long-term growth.

“With our reach, financial strength and operational expertise, we are in the best position to capture what we believe is a big potential for our industry based on exciting data-based demand,” Gupta said.

India’s only listed tower company had a total tower base of 91,007, including its 42% stake in Indus Towers. In the third quarter, it lost 6,612 co-locations, taking the total count to 213,476 as of December-end. Co-locations are locations where it has deployed the mobile telecommunications antennas of multiple service providers on a single structure.

The exits reflected in the average sharing factor which fell to 2.38 from 2.41 in the previous quarter ended September 30, while sharing revenue per tower a month fell to Rs82,794 compared with Rs83,040.

India's No 2 and 3 carriers, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, are merging their operations, while market leader Bharti Airtel is merging operators like Telenor, Tikona and Tata Teleservices’ consumer business with itself. New entrant Reliance Jio has also decided to buy wireless assets of Reliance Communications. The rapid pace of M&A in the telecom industry will soon lead to a market of three major private operators plus state-run carriers.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margins for the third quarter contracted to 44.1% from 44.8%.

Consolidated expenses for the quarter totalled Rs 2,042.2 crore, up 7.2% on year. The largest components of the expenses were power and fuel, amounting to Rs 1,298 crore. The other key expenses incurred were rent of Rs 317 crore, repair and maintenance.

The company also incurred a finance cost of Rs 51 crore in the third quarter, compared to a finance income of Rs 94.7 crore the year before and Rs10.9 crore in the fiscal second quarter.

Bharti Infratel stock rose 0.26% to close at Rs 368 on Wednesday on the BSE, where the benchmark rose 0.89%. The results were declared after market hours.

During the quarter, Bharti Infratel's board decided to explore and evaluate acquisition of stake in one or more tranches in Indus Towers, with the aim of making it a subsidiary or wholly owned subsidiary of Bharti Infratel.

Parent Bharti Airtel though over 2017 sold 18.5% in Infratel, raising nearly Rs12,100 crore to pare debt. The Bharti Airtel board has authorized the company to continue evaluating selling further stake of Bharti Infratel in one or more tranches."

72,2018-01-18,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Stock market jumped from one record to another as benchmarks Nifty and Sensex extended their rally, powered by a spirited show by banking, FMCG and IT stocks and underpinned by positive global leads. 

Optimism around better-than-expected earnings and receding fiscal deficit concerns gave the rally a leg, which helped the Nifty and the Sensex scale 10,888 and 35,507 at one point during the day, respectively.

However, as the day progressed, markets cooled off, hurt by profit-booking in metals, oil and pharma counters. 

In the end, the Sensex settled at a fresh record of 35,260, adding 178 points, while the NSE Nifty index was up 28 points at 10,817.

Banking stocks hit a sweet spot on reports that the government is considering increasing foreign investment limits in the lenders. 

The rally was supported by the government's earlier move to scale down its borrowing requirement for this fiscal. 

Surging global shares on better growth prospects too made investors bolder.

Among the gainers of the day, ITC surged 3 per cent ahead of its earnings, lined up tomorrow. Indiabulls Housing Finance, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, YES Bank and ICICI Bank also stood tall.

65,2018-01-18,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: High telecom levies, sizeable customs duties on 4G network gear and connectivity devices used in new-age technologies such as internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication services coupled with anomalies in withholding taxes relating to the prepaid services business are key pain points that phone companies would like the upcoming Budget to address.

Telcos feel financial stress levels in the telecom sector could ease significantly if the Budget paves the way for cuts in key telecom levies such as spectrum usage charges (SUC), licence fee and Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) fees.

“The telecom industry is weighed down by hefty levies, and a potential solution could emerge if the Budget addresses systemic issues such as redefining the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) — the revenue stemming from licensed telecom services — reducing licence fee and SUC to a uniform 1% of AGR and lowering the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) contribution, which is also paid as a percentage of annual revenue to the government,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).

The COAI is an apex industry grouping representing telco biggies such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Reliance Jio Infocomm.

As much as 30% of every Rs 100 a telco earns is paid to the government as levies. A reduction in levies is likely to improve the financial health of the debt-laden telecom industry and allow telcos to deliver voice and data services at cheaper rates.

Mathews also said exempting 4G network equipment from the the 10.3% basic customs duty (BCD) would reduce the cost of rolling out high-capacity data networks, which according to him, will be the arterial backbone of Digital India, going forward”.

A cut in customs duty on 4G LTE equipment, he said, would boost 4G penetration, especially in rural areas and help bridge the digital divide. Such duty exemptions are also likely to encourage telcos to invest aggressively in rural areas where the returns are inadequate.

4G LTE network gear, typically, includes base stations/E-Nodes, IT Multimedia Systems/soft switches, microwave networks, and associated packet network nodes.

Phone companies, further, said similar BCD exemption on front-ending connectivity devices would help telcos rapidly venture into new-age technologies ranging from internet of things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M) communication services to smart cities. 

Such connectivity devices include IoT hops/sensors, IoT-enabled medical devices, customer premise equipment, vehicle tracking systems to set-top boxes.

Another key area of concern is the high withholding tax applicable on discounts extended to prepaid distributors.

A possible solution, according to COAI’s Mathews, is reducing the applicable withholding tax on discounts offered to prepaid distributors to 1% from the present 5%.

“We have suggested rationalisation of the withholding tax to 1% on discounts offered by telcos to their prepaid distributors as the latter are not agents and earn very low margins,” said the COAI director general.

Telecom tower infrastructure companies, in turn, have suggested that “telecom towers” be included within the scope of the definition of “plant and machinery” under the Central GST Act, 2017, to enable tower operators to get the benefit of input tax credits.

“Exclusion under GST law would be arbitrary and inconsistent with accounting and taxation principles as telecom towers are considered plant & machinery from direct tax and companies tax perspectives,” said Tilak Raj Dua, director general of Tower & Infrastructure Providers Association (Taipa).

Taipa represents Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel, ATC India, GTL Infrastructure, Tower Vision and Reliance Infratel.

Inter-state movement of telecom towers under these rules, he said, would lead to a cascading effect of GST.

Another area of concern for telecom tower companies is that carry forward of losses is limited to industrial undertakings that includes telecom operators but not tower companies.

According to Dua, a possible solution to the problem could emerge if the finance ministry extends the benefits of Section 72A of the Income Tax Act to telecom infrastructure providers in the upcoming budget.

Section 72A, he said, typically, allows the accumulated business losses of an amalgamating company to be carried forward and be set off in the hands of the amalgamated company.

Taipa has urged the finmin to include telecom infrastructure service companies within the definition of industrial undertakings, to “ensure parity” with telcos, and in turn, enable them to avail of the benefits of carry forward of business losses under Section 72A in cases of mergers and amalgamations. “Such a move would also encourage consolidation in the towers sector,” said Dua.

Tower companies also suggested inclusion of the telecom towers sector within the definition of “specified business” to enjoy tax benefits available under Section 35AD of the I-T Act for equipment manufactured in India, which is currently unavailable.

Extension of tax benefits under Section 35AD is slated to lower the cost of services offered by telecom infrastructure providers, especially since the towers industry invests more than Rs 10,000 crore annually in equipment and machinery manufactured in India."

77,2018-01-20,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal has said that the worst may be over for the company in terms of revenue erosion, but outlined aggressive capex plans to bolster its 4G networks and counter Reliance Jio. 
 

To fund the aggressive spending needs, the company indicated that it may sell a far larger stake in its listed tower unit, Bharti Infratel, than it has sold till now. 

“The board has approved divestment of a majority stake in Bharti Infratel, and the next block would have to be a sizeable amount, although there is no immediate decision yet,” Nilanjan Roy, global CFO of Bharti Airtel, said Friday on an earnings call. 

He was responding to an analyst’s query on a possible significant stake sale in the tower arm to generate fresh resources amid Airtel’s elevated capex requirements through FY19. 

The “impact on Airtel’s overall leverage and operating income (read: Ebitda),” he said, would be assessed before any potential stake sale in the tower arm, since the objective is “to build strategic value of our underlying telecom business, sustain revenue market share and grow the data market”. 

Bharti Airtel’s actual capex levels in FY18 are likely to overshoot the Rs 25,000 crore earmarked by around Rs 1,000-1,500 crore amid the massive expansion of 4G networks, and its FY19 capex guidance is likely to be in the same ballpark to sustain such expansion.

Bharti Airtel and its wholly-owned arms own 53.51% in Bharti Infratel. Late last year, the Sunil Mittal-led carrier had said it would consider a proposal from global investors keen to acquire its tower arm. 

In March last year, Airtel sold a 10.3% stake in its tower arm to a global consortium of private equity firm KKR and CPP Investment Board for $952 million and in August, another 3.65% stake in a secondary sale for Rs 2,570 crore. 

Thereafter, it raised another Rs 3,325 crore by offloading a 4.49% stake to global investors in a block deal to pare debt amid pressure on revenue. Vittal said the company’s immediate objective is “to grab a disproportionate share of 4G devices and 4G primary SIM slots on its network” to offset the impact of ARPU erosion in the telco’s running battle for market share with Mukesh Ambani’s Jio. 

“Over the next 9-12 months, we will fight aggressively with Jio for market share, and our immediate aim is to get a bigger chunk of the incremental share of 4G primary SIM slots on our network,” Vital said. 

He, however, said “the worst in terms of ARPU (average revenue per user) erosion is behind (us)”, adding that pricing “has to lift” as current levels are not sustainable. On rapid consolidation underway in the telecoms sector, the Airtel executive said mega mergers like the one between Vodafone India and Idea Cellular with very different cultures “would be very tough to pull off”. 

“When Vodafone and Hutch merged in Australia, the combined entity lost 13-14 market share points,” said Vittal, indicating that Airtel potentially could gain market share while Vodafone and Idea conclude their complex merger. Vodafone India and Idea, the country’s second >and third-largest carriers are merging their businesses."
79,2018-01-22,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi: India's largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel's weak earnings may have marked a low point for Indian telcos but some bit of pressure could lift this year as Jio-triggered market competition starts to ease, according to Fitch Ratings.

The statement comes after Airtel last week posted over 39 per cent fall in consolidated net profit to about Rs 306 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Fitch termed the current low industry tariffs as ""unsustainable"" and said it expects them to rise in 2018, as Jio switches gear from gaining customers to making reasonable returns on its investments in the sector.

""Bharti Airtel's rating headroom will narrow due to lower cash generation and high capex requirements in the financial year ending March 2018 (FY18),"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement.

That said, Fitch pointed out that pressure on Bharti and other incumbent Indian telcos ""should begin to fade this year"" as the competition triggered by Reliance Jio's 2016 market entry begins to ease.

It noted that Bharti is committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and intends to sell a larger stake in its tower arm, Bharti Infratel, in FY19. In the last one year, it has sold 18.5 per cent in Infratel for about USD 1.9 billion.

""We forecast annual negative free cash flow USD 600 million-800 million during FY18-19, as Bharti's cash flow from operations will be insufficient to fund large capex requirements,"" Fitch said.

Stating that the company has raised its capex guidance to bolster its 4G network, Fitch said that the proposal to allow telcos more time to pay for the spectrum they bought in auctions would ""only partially ease cash flow pressures"".

Fitch predicts that Bharti's revenue and Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) will ""rebound"" in FY19 driven by a likely improvement in the blended average revenue per user (ARPU) in the Indian mobile sector as data usage and tariffs rise.

Fitch said that the outlook for the Indian telco sector is ""improving"" and that the results in just-concluded quarter could have been the a low point for Bharti and other established players.

""We revised the sector outlook to stable in 2018 from negative in 2017, as we expect competition to ease now that industry consolidation is all but completed,"" it said.

The industry revenue growth is likely to be in the mid- single-digits, after a decline in 2017."

89,2018-01-29,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Indian stock market closed at fresh record highs on Monday after Economic Survey 2017-18 said the country is likely to register 7-7.5 per cent growth in 2018-19, up from 6.75 per cent expected in the current fiscal.

The Survey tabled by the government in parliament today said the GDP will grow on the back of major reforms which would be strengthened further in the next financial year.

""A series of major reforms undertaken over the past year will allow real GDP growth to reach 6.75 per cent this fiscal and will rise to 7.0 to 7.5 percent in 2018-19, thereby re-instating India as the world's fastest-growing major economy,"" the Survey said.

The survey bolstered India's position among the best performing economies in the world as it projected country's average growth during last three years as around 4 percentage points, which is higher than the average global growth rate and nearly 3 percentage points higher than that of emerging markets and developing economies.

“The positive sentiment in the market was given a boost after Economic Survey showed that Indian economy is expected to expand at 7-7.5% in 2018-19. However, it also highlighted that against the emerging macroeconomic concerns, policy vigilance will be necessary in the coming year, especially if high international oil prices persist,” said Karthikraj Lakshmanan, Senior Fund Manager – Equities, BNP Paribas MF.

Taking cue from the development, Sensex jumped 233 points to close at 36,283 on Monday, while Nifty50 climbed 61 points to settle at 11,130.

Both the key indices Nifty50 and Sensex scaled fresh record highs of 11,172 and 36,444, respectively, on Monday.

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty50 index, 28 closed in the green, while 22 in the red on Monday.

Positive global cues and buying in auto, IT and financials coupled with optimism on Union budget on February 1 created the upbeat momentum for markets.

Investors were seen enlarging their portfolios at the beginning of the February series in the derivatives segment.

Among the gainers, Maruti Suzuki India surged nearly 4 per cent after the company on Thursday reported 2.96 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 1,799 crore for the third quarter ended December 31.

HDFC also remained among the top gainers after the company on Monday reported over three-fold jump in standalone net profit at Rs 5,670.21 crore for December quarter.

Eicher Motors, UPL, Tata Consultancy Services and Bharti Infratel too cloaked significant gains on Monday.

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories emerged as the top drag on the Nifty50 index on Monday. The scrip plunged nearly 6 per cent on its poor earnings for December quarter. On Thursday, the company reported a 28.86 per cent YoY drop in net profit at Rs 334 crore for the third quarter of fiscal 2017-18.

Lupin, GAIL (India), Bharti Airtel, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and ITC were the other top losers of the day.

Asian peers extended their upward movement on Monday on the back of better earnings and global cues. European stocks were trading mixed with tech stocks gaining while utilities, food and beverage and real estate stocks tumbled, Reuters reported."
86,2018-01-29,Bharti Infratel,"The benchmark NIFTY50 index saw less volatility than what was expected on the expiry day of the December series. However, it did see a modest corrective move in the first half of the session. 

However, the Index saw a 60-point recovery to end the day with a modest loss of 16.35 points or 0.15 per cent. The market will go into Monday’s trade with a long weekend following a trading holiday on Friday. Though the indicators are overbought all over, we expect the market to attempt a modestly positive opening once again.

Asian Markets, especially the Hang Seng, ended with gains on Friday and we expected Nifty will follow suit. However, this said, we cannot ignore the overbought nature of the market at any point, and the fact that we will face one of the most important domestic events – that of the Union Budget – later this week. The 11,110 and 11,135 levels will play out as a major resistance area for the market. Supports will come in lower at 10,965 and 10,930 levels.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 80.5369 and it stays neutral against the price. However, it trades in the overbought territory. The daily MACD remains bullish even as it trades above its signal line. A candle with a long lower shadow has emerged. This has little significance at current position, but can temporarily halt the upward move.

Pattern analysis shows after breaking above the 10,490 mark, the Nifty has achieved its measured targets and is now expected to take a minor breather with the 11,110 level acting as an immediate resistance.

Overall, though some early positive movement in the market cannot be ruled out, we might see some intermittent bouts of correction at higher levels. The broader market may see some relatively more pain in the event of any correction from higher levels.

However, with the uptrend remaining firmly in place, we do not recommend creating any significant short position. Instead, all sharp upward moves should be utilised to protect profits at higher levels.

3,2018-02-01,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty closed steady on Thursday, but only after a big scare that saw the indices take a big plunge for a while and then come back. 

The fears had mostly to do with the government's decision to go in for long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on equities and retaining the STT.

The market's worst fears came true as soon as the Finance Minister announced the levy of LTCG in his Budget speech. Unnerved, the BSE Sensex dived as much as 400 points, but quickly got into shape as the finance secretary cleared the air subsequently. 

An (LTCG) tax of 10 per cent on stock market gains exceeding Rs 1 lakh kicks in while short-term capital gains tax stayed at 15 per cent.

Fiscal slippage was another factor that soured mood. 

The Nifty50 index settled 11 points down at 11,017, while Sensex declined 58 points to close at 35,907 on Thursday.The Finance Minister indicated that fiscal deficit was likely to slip to 3.5 per cent of GDP from his target of 3.2 per cent for the ongoing financial year and might be around 3.3 per cent of GDP, roughly around Rs 5.95 lakh crore, for the next financial year. 

The Union Budget for 2018-19 gave special emphasis to agriculture, healthcare, education and infrastructure. Out of total 50 stocks in the Nifty50 index, 27 closed the day in the green while 23 settled in the red.

Shares of tyre major MRF spiked over 5 per cent after the company today reported an 18.1 per cent rise in its standalone net profit.

10,2018-02-07,Bharti Infratel,"UK’s Vodafone is in the final stages of talks to sell its entire 42% stake in Indus Towers for about $5 billion, raising Bharti Infratel’s holding in the company to 84% through a share-swap deal.

This key step, leading to a consolidation of ownership, is also expected to revive investor interest in Bharti Infratel, said two sources aware of the ongoing discussions. The negotiations with a KKR-led consortium have been in limbo for months.

Vodafone’s stake is pegged at around $5 billion, said a person aware of the valuation exercise. However, the final number will be an outcome of the impact of tower cancellations that will arise once the different telcos consolidate the overlapping tenancies. Cancellation of tower rentals will significantly hurt operating profits of Indus Towers, which in turn could depress valuations.

Bharti Infratel, a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel, owns 42% in the Indus Towers joint venture. While Idea has a 16% share in it, the residual 42% is held by the UK-based telco. The no-cash transaction, involving a share swap, will see Vodafone getting a smaller pie of the combined Bharti Infratel.

“Both Vodafone and Airtel have run due diligence processes to find the overlap in tenancies and arrive at an accurate valuation,” said one of the two people mentioned above. The findings include around 55,000 telecom tower rentals that overlap between Idea and Vodafone, and around 12,000 among Bharti, Tata Teleservices and Uninor.

Vodafone and Bharti declined to comment. Last year, Vodafone and Idea announced a merger that will create the country’s biggest telecom services company. Bharti has taken over Tata Teleservices’ consumer mobile services and Norway-based Telenor’s Indian arm, Uninor. Along with these mergers comes the sector’s anticipated reduction in infrastructure and people overlaps. Indus Towers had 122,920 telecom towers at the end of June 2017, with 297,867 slots on rent. One way is for shareholders to accept a common number of cancellations, and the other is to pay an upfront fee to Indus Tower.

“If there is an offset or some such arrangement, it will lower the valuation of Indus Tower and Bharti Infratel significantly,” said an analyst who covers the telecom tower sector.

However, one of the two people quoted earlier said that regardless of a settlement, there is still a lump-sum payday coming up for Indus Towers. With the cash, the company can undertake expansion suited for 4G and 5G deployments.

Bharti, Vodafone and Idea have outstanding tenancy terms of two to five years, and termination of the rent agreements will mean that Indus would get about 80% of all future rent receivables upfront.

Tata Teleservices, which sold its mobile operations but not tower liabilities to Bharti, may have to pay as much as Rs 7,000 crore to American Tower Corp. for termination of rent agreements six years before they were due to run out. The penalty for rent cancellation will run into several thousand crores of rupees and will be shared roughly between Idea and Vodafone in the ratio of their shareholdings in Indus, the person quoted earlier said.

“Cash in the company should offset any impact from a short-term EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) drop.” Vodafone and Bharti Airtel are now trying to ascertain if a part of the cash settlement for premature termination of rentals can be offset among the three partners.

In its most recent financial results, Vodafone said, “We continue to explore options very actively to monetise the group’s 42% stake in Indus Towers.”"

13,2018-02-07,Bharti Infratel,"ET Intelligence Group: For retail investors seeking to navigate the choppy waters, largesized companies appear to be better bets now as appetite for risk assets diminishes in India.

Besides having relatively cheaper valuations compared to smaller peers, large-sized companies continue to record double-digit growth in earnings and revenues in the December 2017 quarter, given established business models and greater resilience against business cycles.

The BSE 100’s past three-year average price to earnings multiple is 22.2 and its current price to earnings multiple is 23.7, which is at a premium of 6.8 per cent. On the other hand, BSE Midcap’s past three-year average price to earnings multiple is 29.5 while its current price to earnings multiple is 38.7, a premium of 31 per cent.

Investors could look at large-sized companies that represent a combination of rural, defensive and infrastructure themes, which are less likely to see sharp corrections in their share prices because of greater visibility on earnings.

ETIG lists prominent names that represent the aforementioned themes: Dabur, Hero Motocorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, TCS, NTPC, Bharti Infratel, TCS, NTPC, Pidilite, Colgate Palmolive, ITC, and UltraTech Cement."

16,2018-02-08,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court Thursday adjourned hearing matters filed against Aircel Ltd, by GTL Infrastructure Ltd and American Tower Corporation (ATC), while assigning the next date of hearing to March 12.

Lawyers present in the court said that Aircel sought a week's time for filing a rejoinder in the matter, and a few weeks more have been granted by the court for the opposing parties to file counters. 

ATC has moved the court against Aircel to recover dues worth Rs 224 crore outstanding for lease of towers, while GTL Infrastructure is seeking recovery of about Rs 912 crore for outstanding payments and penalty for premature rent termination. 

The legal issues have added to Aircel's woes towards finding a suitable debt recast plan.

ET reported on Thursday that tower company Bharti Infratel is also considering moving court to recover its dues from Aircel. Troubles have only mounted for Aircel which faced suspension of inter-connection with Idea Cellular, due to payments of almost Rs 60 crore due to the Aditya Birla owned company. 

The Delhi High Court will hear the matter to decide if GTL Infra’s plea that Aircel should deposit money in court is valid."
15,2018-02-08,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: American Tower Corp. (ATC) has moved Delhi High Court against Aircel to recover dues worth Rs 224 crore outstanding for lease of towers, adding to the telco's woes towards finding a suitable debt recast plan. 

Tower company Bharti Infratel is also considering moving court to recover its dues from Aircel, said two people familiar with details. Earlier Wednesday, Idea Cellular said it has suspended inter-connection with the Maxis-owned operator due to pending payments. 

“ATC filed a separate suit to make note so that if others who have filed get a favourable outcome, ATC shouldn’t lose out,” said one of the two people. Aircel leases a substantial number of telecom towers from ATC-acquired Viom Network, and may cancel some towers as it scales down unprofitable operations. 

This comes after sparring partner GTL Infrastructure moved the Delhi High Court against Aircel for recovery of about Rs 912 crore for outstanding payments and penalty for premature rent termination. The ATC and GTL Infra cases come up for hearing on Thursday, February 8.

The Delhi High Court will hear the matter to decide if GTL Infra’s plea that Aircel should deposit money in court is valid. Bharti Infratel and ATC didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.

Intervening on the cases is State Bank of India that as a lead banker to Aircel’s strategic debt restructuring, that was initiated in January-end. A need to deposit money in court will negate restructuring process as cash strapped Aircel struggles to make vendor and interest payments alike.

The current orders issued to GTL Infra and ATC specifically permit ""bankers to take steps to exercise their rights as per the law.""

On Monday, Idea added to Malaysia’s Maxis-owned telecom firm’s woes, saying, “Despite several reminders for releasing the dues since November 2017, the operator has failed to meet its payment commitments, forcing Idea to suspend interconnect services, as per the terms of interconnect agreement between both parties"". 

This implies that calls between Idea and Aircel aren’t going through.

According to people familiar with the matter, Aircel – which has recently shut operations in six circles - owes Idea Cellular about Rs 60 crore, which is about three months of interconnect user charges. 

Kumarmangalam Birla-owned Idea added that the interconnect services will be restored by “Idea immediately upon Aircel making payment towards the outstanding dues”. While India’s third largest telco had 188.5 million customers as of December end, Aircel had 87.58 million customers as of November end. 

Aircel acknowledged its difficulties.

“The state of the industry is bad; we are in active discussions with all our stakeholders to do the best we can under the present difficult business environment and the ongoing SDR (strategic debt restructuring) process,” said a spokesperson from Aircel.

ET had reported last month that Aircel had entered a strategic debt restructuring (SDR) process. According to the report, Aircel has some Rs 15,500 crore of debt on its books, but the sustainable debt is estimated at Rs 5,500 crore. Banks will now take shares in Aircel to replace their loans and may recover their dues in an eventual sale of assets or of the company. Airtel, which had earlier bought Aircel’s 4G spectrum, has previously said it will be in the fray any time Aircel or its assets are on the table.

People in the know, however, said Aircel didn’t owe Vodafone and Airtel anything on account of IUC charges. Vodafone and Airtel didn’t respond to queries.

""The traffic of calls towards each operator is different. The call traffic towards Airtel and Vodafone from Aircel may be heavier than Idea and therefore those payments may have been cleared,"" one of the people said.

Though the telecom wars have seen the fall of Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices and Telenor India, Aircel has so far held its own?, focussing on the mass market offering mainly voice and some data services? on 2G and 3G.

But the scrapping of its merger with RCom was a setback. Since then, Aircel decided to focus on a few of its top revenue generating markets and shut six loss-making service areas."

50,2018-02-16,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel’s Africa business is being valued at $6.6 billion even as the Sunil Mittal-led telco’s international holding company for Africa operations explores an initial public offer (IPO) to dilute a minority stake, analysts said.

Bharti Airtel, they said, is likely to list its Netherlands-based subsidiary in a broad international exchange such as Nasdaq, Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam or the London Stock Exchange by zeroing in on a neutral country where capital markets and banking systems are well established and financial regulations are not archaic.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch values “Bharti’s Africa business at six times Ebitda (read: operating income), leading to an estimated enterprise valuation of $6.6 billion by FY19”. The US brokerage pegs Bharti Africa’s equity valuation at $1.1 billion after factoring in an estimated $5.5 billion net debt.

Bharti Airtel had said on Wednesday that the board of directors of its wholly owned arm Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV (BAIN BV) had authorised its management to initiate non-binding exploratory talks with banks/intermediaries to evaluate the possibility of listing its shares on an internationally recognised stock exchange.

BAIN BV is also the global holding company of Bharti’s telecom operations in 14 African markets. The US brokerage, however, expects “Bharti to remain the majority shareholder in Africa even after a potential listing” as it would lead to consolidation of the Africa business in the company's Indian numbers.

Bharti did not offer comment to ET’s queries on the valuation of its Africa business, its preferred international bourse for listing BAIN BV or the possible extent of stake dilution.

Bharti Airtel had recently showcased its Africa business and strategies to further turn around the asset during an analyst meet in Uganda. Airtel has been performing well in Africa, having reported a $76 million profit in the December quarter, compared with a loss of $93 million a year earlier, helped by a surge in data traffic and Airtel Money transactions.

Brokerage BNP Paribas said Bharti’s plans to separately list Airtel Africa made strategic sense as it would “provide visibility on its valuation and could also help Airtel deleverage its balance sheet”.

Bharti Airtel shares dipped 1.15% to close at Rs 429.20 on BSE on Wednesday.
Bharti Airtel shares dipped 1.15% to close at Rs 429.20 on BSE on Wednesday.
Analysts, however, said that post listing of the Africa business, Bharti Airtel could adopt a similar strategy that it has for its listed tower unit, Bharti Infratel, in that it could progressively cut its stake in the Africa business and invest the proceeds in the core India mobile business, which has significant growth potential but would require high network investments in the short term to counter Jio and Vodafone-Idea.

Brokerage PhillipCapital said listing the Africa operations would provide Bharti with “significant ammunition” to fight price wars in India. Bharti’s ability to monetise its Africa operations, it said, would not only provide a big war chest, but also send a signal to competition about its ability to sustain low tariffs for longer periods.

“Bharti is already looking at selling Bharti Infratel, and might do the same for its Africa operations, clearly showing its huge stack to its Indian competitors and its willingness to go all-in for its India wireless operations,” PhillipCapital said in a note seen by ET.

Bharti Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in Bharti Infratel to cut debt and free up cash and gird up for competition from Jio."

53,2018-02-19,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI | HYDERABAD: Telecom company Aircel will shortly file for bankruptcy at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and its board has been dissolved ahead of the move, said two people aware of the matter. That will mark the demise of the last small mobile phone company, leaving just four main non-state ones —soon to be three after a merger.

Malaysian parent company Maxis, run by businessman Ananda Krishnan, had earlier proposed a cash infusion to support the debt-laden company but has pulled the plug, said one of the people.

The company has been in negotiations with lenders since September but has failed to hammer out a recast of its Rs 15,500 crore debt.

“There is no cash to run the business and no visibility to free any more up,” said another person, adding that the company is likely to stop paying salaries by the end of the week.

Aircel declined to comment.

State Bank of India, which heads the group of lenders, didn’t respond to queries.


Bankers were Confident of Recovering Money
The decision was precipitated by the Reserve Bank of India scrapping all debt revamp schemes in favour of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and seeking to hasten resolution, one of the people said.

Having not made payments since September, banks can no longer restructure Aircel without provisioning for its debt.

They are currently in the process of nominating members to a new board and an insolvency professional to run the process. The application to NCLT is expected to be made in a few days.

The lenders are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to decide on appointments and the future course of action.



The company generates monthly revenue of about Rs 400 crore, of which Rs 100 crore is accounted for by termination charges to other operators and Rs 280 crore is for vendors and network uptime, said a person familiar with the numbers. The rest is for licence fees, taxes, and interest payments. Idea Cellular recently snapped interconnect services with Aircel with dues of Rs 60 crore for three months.

Aircel had recently stopped services in six circles to focus on its better performing ones. It will be the fourth company to stop services after Reliance Jio Infocomm launched services in September 2016, undercutting tariffs and nearly halving revenue realisations for the industry. Norway-based Telenor is transferring its assets to Bharti Airtel for almost no charge. Bharti Airtel is also taking over the wireless business of Tata Teleservices. The wireless assets of Reliance Communications are being acquired by Jio.

Bankers had been confident about recovering money from Aircel because of the support from its Malaysian parent, as were vendors.

A recent document submitted by bankers in court showed that Maxis had issued letters of comfort to bankers that it would meet any cash shortfall up to Rs 500 crore and pay licence fees for circles to the tune of another Rs 500 crore should it be needed.

“That limit has long since been met,” said one of the two people.

LEGAL BATTLES 
Those hit will be 5,000 employees, vendors and partners, including tower operators GTL Infra, Bharti Infratel, Indus Towers and ATC. Aircel currently leases more than 40,000 towers across all the companies. Some of them are already locked in legal battles with Aircel to recover dues. Network management vendors include Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE, which are negotiating recovery of dues from September onward, said one of the two people.

Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel, Ericsson and Nokia declined to comment. The others didn’t respond to queries. Aircel also uses outsourced technology and call centre services that have been unpaid since September. It is unsure how the NCLT will prioritise these payments, the person said.

In July 2016, before the launch of Jio, 79% of Aircel’s subscribers were active on the network and the company -had a quarterly operating profit of Rs 120 crore. However, Aircel bled during the six months that Jio offered free services starting September 2016. It has also been losing customers. Aircel had nearly 85 million users at the end of December, having lost more than 2.5 million users in one month.

“We have brought our prices to less than half, but it is still a hard sell in the face of free service,” a key regional executive had told ET in early 2017.

By July 2017, after Jio first started charging for its services, Aircel’s operating profit had dropped to Rs 5 crore.

By December 2017, Aircel’s active customers fell to 57% at nearly half the average revenue per person and a quarterly operating loss of Rs 120 crore.

The company had initiated talks for a merger with Reliance Communciations, an operator that was also languishing in same circumstances. However, delays in approvals and a Supreme Court order preventing a sale of Aircel’s spectrum frustrated the merger.

When it was called off, Aircel went to its lenders for a restructuring."

Big boys such as TCS (up over 3 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 3.54 per cent) and HCL Tech (up 4 per cent) were shining spots in the pack.




Sun Pharma catches cold
Shares of drug major Sun Pharma cracked over 6 per cent to settle at Rs 524 apiece on BSE. The stock dragged the Nifty Pharma index lower, which closed 2 per cent down at 8,843. Other culprits in the pack included Cipla (down 1 per cent), GlaxoSmithKline (down 1 per cent) and Aurobindo Pharma (down 1 per cent). 




Spurt in open interest
Shares of Bharti Infratel witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest at 65.05 per cent. Grasim Industries (46.42 per cent) and Godrej Consumer Products (46.14 per cent) grabbed the second and third slot, respectively.




Gruh Finance on a high
Shares of Gruh Finance, a subsidiary of HDFC, swelled over 7 per cent to settle at Rs 545 apiece on BSE. The company had reported a 28.3 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 82.16 crore for December quarter against Rs 64.04 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. In the intraday trade, the stock jumped 9 per cent to hit a high of Rs 554.90. 




Fear eases
India VIX, the fear guage, saw a sharp decline of 5.61 per cent to 15.92, suggesting normalcy is returning to the market. The India VIX index is a volatility index that is a broad measure of the market’s expectation of volatility over the near term.




Banks recover
After creating a kind of pandemonium among investors, financial stocks got back to recovery path. The Nifty PSU Bank index, which has seen relentless selloff in the last few days, today climbed over 1 per cent to settle at 3,170.70, with 7 out of 12 constituents ending in the green. Punjab National Bank, the root cause of the recent ruckus in the banking stocks, today settled flat at Rs 117 apiece on BSE.

I am Swati Verma who will get you a snapshot of the day's trading, peppered with views, cues and insights from top market analysts.

Three back to back sessions of loss came to a halt today as the market got back on its feet. But the most standout show came from IT stocks, which lifted the overall indices.

Rupee's continued weakness against the dollar, Nasscom's upbeat projection and CLSA's preference for IT large caps acted as tailwinds for the software pack.

The benchmark Sensex closed up 0.42 per cent at 33,845 and the broader Nifty 0.36 per cent at 10,397.

75,2018-02-25,Bharti Infratel,"BARCELONA: Closure of Vodafone and Idea's mobile tower sale deal, and raising FDI limit in the Aditya Birla group firm are holding the government's approval to the merger of two operators' to create the largest Indian telecom player, according to sources.

According to a senior official, the government is awaiting for closure of Vodafone and Idea mobile tower sale transaction with American Tower Corporation.

""Approval to Idea and Vodafone will be granted once their mobile tower sale is completed,"" the senior government official, who was here to take part in the Mobile World Congress starting tomorrow, told PTI.

People closely involved in the Vodafone-Idea merger process said the transaction closure is a procedural issue, and will be done very soon as ATC has already applied for government's permission to make the investment in towers assets of the two companies.

""Besides ATC deal closure, Idea has applied for raising FDI limit in the company to 100 per cent. The clearance on the same is awaited from the Ministry of Home Affairs,"" an industry source said.

ATC will pay a total of Rs 7,850 crore for purchasing Idea (Rs 4,000 crore ) and Vodafone's (Rs 3,850 crore) mobile towers.

When contacted, the Vodafone global spokesperson said ""The standalone tower sale is not a condition to completing the merger with Idea.""

The discussion around Idea and Vodafone exiting Indus Towers by selling stake to Bharti Infratel is not part of the process for government approval for the merger.

The merged Idea-Vodafone entity will have the second largest spectrum holding of 1,850 megahertz.

The amalgamation will also result in capex synergies, since it will eliminate the duplication of spectrum capacity and infrastructure related requirements.

Idea and Vodafone are separately paying rental for 6,300 mobile sites which will be synced for merged entity in two years.

However, the combined entity will breach the spectrum holding limit in five circles under the 900MHz band, one circle under the 1,800MHz band and two circles under the 2,500MHz band with the cumulative value of around Rs 9,000 crore as per the prices of latest auction.

This will be resolved if Cabinet approves raising of spectrum holding limit as recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and concurred by the Telecom Commission .

The regulator had recommended removing ceiling on spectrum held by mobile operators within a particular band. It suggested a 50 per cent cap on combined radiowave holding in efficient bands like 700 MHz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz.

Airtel will continue to be the largest spectrum holder with 1,976 Mhz after acquisition of Telenor, Tata Teleservices and Tikona airwaves.

The revenue market share of Vodafone-Idea merged entity will be slightly higher at 37.5 per cent compared to that of Airtel's at 37.3 per cent."

92,2018-02-28,Bharti Infratel,"BARCELONA: Sunil Mittal, chairman of India’s top telco Bharti Airtel, said operators have no choice but to move court against the regulator’s order on predatory pricing, which prevents them from retaining customers and conducting business, a right enshrined in the Constitution.

Mittal also ruled out an acquisition of Aircel and told reporters at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that the struggling carrier was shutting down operations across India after the promoters halted funding for the company.

Operators are bitter about the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s new regulations on predatory pricing, which they say favour Reliance Jio Infocomm, the latest entrant in the market. Jio and the regulator have termed the accusations baseless. Trai Chairman RS Sharma, who is also in Barcelona, said on Tuesday that the telcos are free to go to court and contest the order.

“We have heard Trai’s response and since the order binds us from conducting our business in an orderly manner, I cannot envisage anything other than a legal challenge to counter this order,” Mittal said. “We believe we must be provided with the rights to conduct our business in the marketplace. That is enshrined in the Constitution, under Article 14. We will agitate at the appropriate forums to have the freedom to do it.”

Mittal added that a telco cannot operate with its hands tied. His statement follows similar comments by Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao.

Trai’s order of February 16 gives pricing flexibility only to operators with less than 30% of the market’s subscribers or revenue. It said predatory pricing will be determined on the average variable cost of a carrier.

The regulator changed the definition of significant market power (SMP) to a company with more than 30% of the users or gross revenue share and junked norms including volume of traffic and switching capacity. It said telcos cannot offer pricing packages to individual subscribers to retain them and must offer all customers the same tariff plan.

“If you are my customer and I need to hold you back, then I must have the right to do so with whatever tools I have,” Mittal said.

The telcos say the order favours Jio and they would not be able to compete without falling foul of the new definition of predatory pricing and SMP. Jio has 13-14% share of revenue and users, while Airtel and the Vodafone-Idea Cellular combine would each have over 30% revenue market share.

Competitive pressures and near-zero tariffs following Jio’s entry have pushed the industry to consolidation, shrunk revenue and eroded profits, forcing promoters to pump in more money into operations. Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), the largest shareholder in Bharti Airtel, invested Rs 2,649 crore in the company earlier this month.

“SingTel, even in this otherwise difficult environment in the Indian telecom industry, has absolute confidence in Airtel and stands behind it like a rock. This should give lot of assurance, reassurance to lot of stakeholders,” Mittal said.

Airtel has been paring its stake in tower unit Bharti Infratel to raise funds and said it’s open to an exit as well. Merging Indus Towers, in which Infratel has a 42% stake, with Bharti Infratel was a possibility, although there is no time line for such a deal, said Akhil Gupta, chairman of Infratel.

On acquisitions, Mittal said there is no company left in India to buy, not even Aircel.

“Aircel is no longer an option for Bharti. It is shutting down, switching off networks everywhere. Banks will want to sell their assets at some point of time. But Aircel is no more an entity to be taken up. If you’ve heard, the promoters of Aircel have said, ‘We’re done, we’ve handed over the keys,’” he said. Mittal had previously said he would look to buy Aircel if its promoters wanted to sell.

Mittal hoped the new National Telecom Policy 2018 would look at ways to restore the financial health of the sector, which was almost down to three private operators, and reduce levies, which are among the highest in the world at a total of over 30%.

“I hope the government wants these three operators to have a sustainable business model. Telecom is one of the most heavily taxed sectors and levies, including licence fee, SUC (spectrum usage charges), remain way too high in India, and we hope government will take steps to bring these down through the NTP,” the top executive said.

On net neutrality – a concept that aims to provide free internet access to all– Mittal said telecom companies will never throttle speeds, never discriminate and never be the so-called gatekeepers of the internet."

The Nifty50 index opened with a gap down and remained highly volatile throughout Wednesday. It fell towards the 10,460 level, but recovered from the lows and formed a Doji candle on the daily chart.

The formation of a Doji candle after the decline of last session indicates that both the bulls and bears are fighting hard to get a grip on the market. 

Now, the Nifty50 has to cross and hold above 10,550 to witness a bounceback towards its major hurdle at 10,620 while holding below 10,500 could extend its decline towards the next support at 10,430, and then 10,400 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,400 followed by 10,300, while maximum Call open interest was at 10,700 followed by 11,000. Fresh Call writing was seen at strike price 10,900 followed by 10,500 while fresh Put writing was seen at 10,300 followed by 10,400. 

The option band signified a trading range between 10,400 and 10,630 marks. 

India VIX slipped 0.83 per cent to 13.80.

Bank Nifty opened with a gap down by more than 250 points and continued its weakness for the second consecutive session. It recovered partially from the day’s low but, the bears put pressure at higher levels.

The index formed a long-legged Doji on the daily chart, which implies indecision in the market. It also formed an Island Reversal pattern on the daily chart, which suggests that bears are in a powerful position to drag the market to lower levels.

Overall, candle patterns indicate limited upside and volatile swings in the coming days. As long as the Nifty50 holds below 25,350, further weakness can drag it towards 24,750, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 25,500 and then 25,750 levels.

Nifty futures closed with a loss of 0.42 per cent at 10,520. Long buildup was seen in Bharti Infratel, Apollo Tyres, Bharat Forge, IDBI, MRF, Ashok Leyland, Mindtree and Granules, while shorts were seen in Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Bank of India, Godrej Consumers, M&M Finance, BHEL, Grasim and Colgate Palmolive..

4,2018-03-02,Bharti Infratel,"All creditors of Aircel, including other telcos, tower companies and equipment suppliers, are preparing to head to the National Companies Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover their dues from the debt-ridden mobile operator that has filed for bankruptcy, said multiple people involved in discussions across various companies.

“It is now par for the course that everyone who wants to get back its money from Aircel will have to head to NCLT, once insolvency petition gets accepted,” said an executive of one of the operators.

The telecom department, which has bank guarantees equalling the dues that Aircel owes to the government, is awaiting Aircel's petition details before it decides whether to encash them as a means to ensuring that the dues are paid, senior officials said.

“If there’s no stay from the court (NCLT), then we can encash the bank guarantees,” a senior official from the telecom department said, adding that Aircel was yet to serve a notice or a copy of the petition to the government.

Aircel and its two units filed an application to be admitted into NCLT under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 
on Wednesday, underscoring the struggles of India’s smaller telcos in an intensely competitive market amid a crackdown on large loan defaulters.

NCLT will first need to accept the application, which needs to happen 
in two weeks.

Aircel said its talks with lenders and shareholders failed to yield a consensus on restructuring its Rs 15,500 crore debt and getting funding, leaving resolution under IBC 2016 as its only option.

Most of Aircel’s debt comes from loans raised to buy spectrum, including broadband wireless airwaves (BWA) back in 2010. As of early 2017, dues Aircel owed to local banks including State Bank of India, its leading lender, stood at Rs 12,627 crore, while foreign currency debt stood at about Rs 595 crore and debt from offering bank guarantees and letters of credit stood at Rs 3,232 crore.

While telecom companies will need to head to court to claim interconnect user charges (IUC), tower firms will do so for obtaining dues for operating sites and vendors will do for services and maintenance services.

“We are evaluating our options at this time and will not be in a position to provide any more information at this stage,” an Ericsson India spokesperson said.

Tower firms such as GTL and American Tower Corp (ATC), which are battling separate cases against the Maxis-owned operator in the Delhi High Court to recover dues worth Rs 912 crore and Rs 224 crore, respectively, will now see their cases clubbed along with Aircel's bankruptcy petition, said people aware of developments.

“We continue to remain in dialogue with them to ascertain the fate of all the outstanding issues including receipts of our payments and how to assist them to resolve their current challenges,” a GTL spokesperson said.

ATC, Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers did not respond to ET's queries as of press time on Thursday.

Operators too have dues remaining from Aircel. Idea Cellular and Vodafone India have stopped accepting calls to their users from those of Aircel due to non-payment of interconnection fees. Aircel owes some Rs 60 crore to Idea, while its dues to Vodafone aren’t known.

Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment as of press time 
on Thursday."

19,2018-03-07,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: The Bharti Airtel board will meet on March 12 to consider raising funds via debt instruments, including bonds, which will help fund its capex plans aimed at bolstering 4G networks to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm.

The Sunil Mittal-led telco in a regulatory filing to BSE late Wednesday evening said that the funds could be raised via “issuances of secured/unsecured, listed/unlisted , non-convertible-debentures, bonds or such other similar debt instruments either denominated in Indian rupees or in a foreign currency”.

Over the past one year, Bharti Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower unit, Bharti Infratel, to cut debt and free up cash and gird up for competition against Jio in 4G segment. It has raised nearly Rs 12,089 crore through multiple tiny stake dilutions in its tower arm.

The company recently indicated that it may sell a much larger stake in Infratel than it has sold till now to fund its aggressive funding needs to bolster its 4G networks. Bharti Airtel and its wholly-owned arms own 53.51% in the tower arm at present.

“Bharti Airtel’s latest plans to raise fresh funds through debt instruments is possibly aimed at addressing continuing financial stress in the telecoms industry, especially at a time when its Ebitda run rate is not commensurate with the telco’s sizeable capex spends for reinforcing 4G networks to counter Jio,” a sector analyst at a leading global brokerage told ET.

Airtel, he said, “may also possibly be keeping an enabling resolution handy to raise funds at a convenient point in the near future, given the likelihood of multiple payment obligations in the near term, with the potential closure of its Telenor India and Tata Teleservices mobile business acquisitions over the next three –to-six months”.

The market leader has been building its war chest for a while.

Back in December last year, the Bharti group sold a fifth of its DTH arm to an affiliate of global private equity firm Warburg Pincus, for around Rs 2,258 crore ($350 million), with most of the funds being consumed by Bharti Airtel to fight off intensifying competition from new entrant . Jio. 

India’s No 1 phone company recently boosted its capex guidance for fiscal 2018 to Rs 25,000 crore from the earlier Rs 20,000 crore. Gopal Vittal, Bharti Airtel’s managing director for India and South Asia, had earlier said the additional capex would be deployed toward bolstering its radio network and fibre capacity as it tries to expand market share and improve customer experience amid continuing price volatility. 

More recently, Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), the largest shareholder in Bharti Airtel, invested Rs 2,649 crore in the company. Bharti group chairman Sunil Mittal had said SingTel’s investment even in this otherwise difficult environment in the Indian telecom industry, depicted its absolute confidence in Airtel and that it stands behind it like a rock”

Bharti Airtel is not the only one aiming to reduce debt. Recently Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned Idea Cellular is raising Rs 6,750 crore to cut debt and free up cash ahead of its upcoming merger with Vodafone India."
29,2018-03-08,Bharti Infratel,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday approved Bharti Airtel’s proposed merger with the Indian unit of Norway’s Telenor.

A senior Airtel executive confirmed the same.

Bharti Airtel had entered into an agreement with Telenor South Asia Investments Pte back in February last year to buy Telenor India’s operations in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West) and Assam. These seven circles contribute about 35% to Airtel’s total revenue. Airtel will also take on some of the Scandinavian telco’s local liabilities.

Acquisition of Telenor India will bolster Airtel’s 4G spectrum holdings and revenue market share, reinforcing its hand in the battle against Reliance Jio Infocomm. Airtel will pocket 43.4 units of 4G spectrum in the 1800 MHz band once the Telenor deal is concluded.

Bharti Airtel’s proposed merger with Telenor India has already been cleared by the country’s antitrust regulator, Competition Commission of India (CCI), market regulator Sebi and stock exchanges, BSE and NSE. It is now awaiting approval of the telecom department (DoT).

Airtel will also take over Telenor India’s outstanding spectrum payments of some Rs 1,650 crore and other operational contracts, including tower leases with Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, besides employees and 44 million customers.

Airtel had said that the Telenor circles represent a high population concentration and therefore offer a high potential for growth.

Telenor had a rough ride ever since it rolled out operations in late 2009 in partnership with real estate company Unitech under the Uninor brand. Although it won licences to offer nationwide services, all of them were cancelled in the judgment on the 2G scam five years ago."
28,2018-03-08,Bharti Infratel,"Exclusive interview with Puneet Dalmia, Managing Director, Dalmia Bharat Group  What growth strategy have you employed at Dalmia Bharat to deliver results and build confidence with stakeholders?  We have driven growth through organic expansion and inorganic deals in each of our businesses, while maintaining rigorous financial discipline. We like to build when markets are optimistic and tend to buy when markets are pessimistic. Prudent capital allocation in a capital intensive industry is the differentiating factor which eventually determines the return on investments. Regarding building trust with our stakeholders, we believe trust is built over time through transparency and authentic communication. The key is to remain transparent in both good and bad times.  What have been the tenets you have followed while driving change and restructuring the diverse Dalmia group?  Our core values of humility, trust, team work and speed have helped us build a culture where people can realize the infinite potential within them. We like to trust people and drive decision making down so that our colleagues can think and act like owners and entrepreneurs. We like to take away the fear of failure, ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things if you remove the fear of failure. Our culture is our biggest differentiator and our most precious asset.  What is your vision for Dalmia Bharat in the next five years?   I would like to see Dalmia Bharat Group grow as a dynamic organization while preserving our traditions and Indian soul. We want to create a better tomorrow compared to what we are today. This philosophy creates a culture of continuous improvement for each individual and collectively, the organization. Sometimes we are ahead, sometimes we are behind but in the end our race is with ourselves.  How difficult was it for you to transition to a traditional family business after running a new age start-up like Jobsahead?  It was an interesting challenge to decide what to preserve and what to destroy. Some aspects of our culture, like traditional values of integrity, empathy and humility were the core and had to be preserved while new values were being embraced to stay contemporary and attract talent. We re-wrote our operating system by redesigning the role of the family, creating pure play companies in each sector and inviting private equity to partner with us. Professionalizing the family business by attracting the best talent, creating an ESOP pool to make them owners, and empowering them in decision making has helped us tremendously. We like to treat family members as professionals and professionals like family members.     Exclusive interview with Akhil Gupta, Executive Chairman, Bharti Infratel  What was the hardest part in persuading competitors like Vodafone and Idea to collaborate with you in setting up Indus Towers?  The hardest part in persuading operators like Vodafone & Idea to collaborate in setting up Indus Towers was a deep rooted belief that prevailed all across the telecom industry that telecom towers were a huge competitive edge. What helped in allaying the fear was the fact that Airtel had many more towers than them, and thus if at all somebody were to gain, it was them who would have got some competitive advantage by coming together.  You were a pioneer in outsourcing. Do you still see it as a growing trend?  The decision about outsourcing was never a fashion statement for us and was based purely on logic and practicality of getting better efficiencies in terms of quality and cost.  I do see it as a growing trend wherever efficiencies are achieved.  What is the biggest difference between an 'intrapreneur' such as yourself and an entrepreneur like Sunil Mittal?  Sunil can best be described as an entrepreneur who turned professional while conducting his business while I could be described as a professional who adopted entrepreneurship as the way to rapidly grow business. However, the biggest difference between the two was that while Sunil had the unique capability to bet his last penny in building Airtel from scratch, I was only able to contribute in building over the said foundation.  Tell us about diversification plans into transmission through optic fiber and microwaves.   As you are aware, towercos have now become the norm who share them with all the operators. I believe that the next in line is to share transmission through Optic Fibre and Microwaves, between the various operators to get significant savings in OPEX and CAPEX. This is particularly important because of the need to rapidly rollout fibre connectivity to cater to data explosion."

31,2018-03-09,Bharti Infratel,"Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned wary about the prospects of the Indian equity market since February following the introduction of long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on equity in Union Budget 2018, a Rs 12,700 crore scam in Punjab National Bank (PNB) and repeated signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates rapidly.

Several global financial services firms, including CLSA and Morgan Stanley, have since cut India’s weightage in their scheme of things.

FIIs have been offloading stocks in the cash market in the recent past. They offloaded shares worth a net of around Rs 12,000 crore between February 1 and March 7 after having pumped in Rs 13,781 crore in January and Rs 49,729 crore in the whole of last year. 

With clear signs of FIIs losing their conviction on India and the global liquidity squeeze posing a clear threat of capital outflow from emerging markets, including India, some analysts say FII-heavy stocks are likely to witness freaky fortunes in the coming months.

“There is a little concern for the FII-heavy stocks in the short term, as they have been selling Indian equities continuously and there are no positive triggers right now for them to change their outlook,” says G Chokkalingam, Head of Research at Equinomics Research and Advisory.

Domestic equity benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are already down about 9 per cent from their respective all-time high levels hit on January 29, 2018. 

On Friday, the benchmark indices traded with gains after staging a solid rebound in Thursday’s trade, when the Sensex leapt nearly 318 points, or 1 per cent.

FIIs hold huge clout in the domestic market, holding around 18 per cent of India’s total market capitalisation.

Within the BSE200 basket, they held more than 25 per cent stake at the end of December in as many as 58 companies, whose stocks appear to be at the maximum risk should the FII outflow becomes rapid.




Going by shareholding data available with Ace Equity, some of the top NBFCs face the biggest risk.

FPIs held substantial stakes in non-banking financial companies such as HDFC (74.76 per cent), Bharat Financial Inclusion (60.71 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (55.34 per cent) and Shriram Transport Finance (49.73 per cent) as on December 31, 2017.

In the banking pack, FIIs held 48.06 per cent, 47.34 per cent, 43.20 per cent and 40.57 per cent in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, YES Bank and HDFC Bank, respectively, at the end of 2017.

“FIIs are reacting to the news and developments happening on both global as well as domestic fronts. For India, both domestic and global news have not been too conducive. These are short-term disruptions, but they would not continue for a long time. However, it will continue at least for the coming few months,” said Himanshu Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst, Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

Amid the global sell-off, there has been risk aversion among the FIIs, which raising the risk of their pulling money out of emerging markets like India.

“Investors should understand that India is just one segment for FIIs. So if the country is not attractive for them, they can invest somewhere else,” Srivastava said in a chat with ETNow.

Stocks like Apollo Hospital, Hero MotoCorp, Zee Entertainment, Bharti Infratel, Mindtree, UPL, The Federal Bank, Crompton Greaves and Infosys have high levels of shareholding among foreign investors.

From across sectors, stocks where FIIs hold over 15 per cent stakes have risen up to 600 per cent over the past one year.

The list includes Indiabulls Venture (up 586 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (up 144 per cent), Edelweiss Financial Services (up 91 per cent), Tata Global Beverages (up 88 per cent), Jubilant FoodWorks (up 87 per cent) and Jindal Steel and Power (up 86 per cent), among others.

Nitasha Shankar, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities, said post the Union Budget, the Indian stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. In recent times, it has been hovering in the negative territory.

“This is largely related to the PSU banking stocks which have been ruffled with news flows and developments related to one of the largest PSU banks. This has had a negative impact on the headline indices, considering that banking stocks in general and PSU bank scrips in particular hold a substantial weightage in the benchmark indices,” she said.

NSE’s Nifty index is down 1,017 points to 10,154 as of March 7 from its all-time peak of 11,171 hit on January 29. The 30-pack BSE Sensex has pulled back over 3,410 points to 33,033 from 36,443 during this period.

Milan Sharma, Director, Rivergate Capital, says a trend reversal in FII flows is imminent.

India is not looking as attractive, as it was few months back. Going forward, there will be a reversal in the trend along with a fresh flow of inflows from domestic institutional investors, he said.

“Considering the Rs 12,000-13,000 crore inflow to the equity market through the SIP route, we do not think one needs to be too cautious. We will also see some reversal in FII flows soon,” Sharma said."

Bharti Airtel's stock was up 1.07 per cent to Rs Rs 405.5 on the Bombay Stock Exchange in beginning hours of trade on Friday. 

The funds will help fund its capex plans aimed at bolstering 4G networks to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm. The market leader has been building its war chest for a while.

Over the past one year, Bharti Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower unit, Bharti Infratel, to cut debt and free up cash and gird up for competition against Jio in 4G segment. It has raised nearly Rs 12,089 crore through multiple tiny stake dilutions in its tower arm.

The company recently indicated that it may sell a much larger stake in Infratel than it has sold till now to fund its aggressive funding needs to bolster its 4G networks. Bharti Airtel and its wholly-owned arms own 53.51 per cent in the tower arm at present.

It has also sold stake in its other entities. In December last year, the Bharti group sold a fifth of its DTH arm to an affiliate of global private equity firm Warburg Pincus, for around Rs 2,258 crore ($350 million), with most of the funds being consumed by Bharti Airtel to fight off intensifying competition from new entrant Reliance Jio.

More recently, Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), the largest shareholder in Bharti Airtel, invested Rs 2,649 crore in the company. 

India’s No 1 carrier recently boosted its capex guidance for fiscal 2018 to Rs 25,000 crore from the earlier Rs 20,000 crore. Gopal Vittal, Bharti Airtel’s managing director for India and South Asia, had earlier said the additional capex would be deployed toward bolstering its radio network and fibre capacity as it tries to expand market share and improve customer experience amid continuing price volatility."

39,2018-03-13,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel approved a plan to raise about Rs 16,500 crore through debt, including a fresh issue of $1 billion in overseas bonds, to help refinance loans and pay for spectrum, boosting the telco’s shares by almost 5%.

The board of directors approved the issue of foreign currency bonds of up to $1 billion (Rs 6,482 crore) and sought fresh shareholder approval for issuance of non-convertible debentures of up to Rs 10,000 crore on a private placement basis, Airtel said in a filing with the BSE on Monday. The bonds and debentures may be issued in one or more tranches.

“Any funds raised from issuance of aforesaid debt securities shall be used for routine treasury activities, including refinancing of existing debt and spectrum liabilities,” said the company, which is 39.5% owned by Singapore Telecommunications. Bharti Airtel’s consolidated net debt stood at Rs 91,714 crore at the end of December.

A company official said this is the largest fund-raising plan approved by the Bharti Airtel board in a single meeting. The funds, to be raised over a period of time, will help shore up the balance sheet of India’s largest telecom company striving to fight off brutal competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm, which has severely dented revenue and profit.

Airtel shares gained 4.7% to Rs 420.75 at the close on the BSE. The mobile phone operator said its previous approval for raising up to Rs 10,000 crore via NCDs was valid till March 13, 2018, and needed fresh shareholder consent.

“Airtel’s move could be aimed at rationalising treasury costs,” said Prashant Singhal, TMT head for emerging markets at EY, adding that the market leader’s plan to float overseas bonds made sense “since foreign borrowings would work out cheaper than domestic rupee loans, especially with a stable US dollar.”

Airtel’s preference to raise funds through debt “is possibly triggered by the fact that equity financing is more expensive, coupled with the fact that the equity raising process itself is more cumbersome,” said an analyst at a global brokerage who did not wish to be identified.

Banks, cautioned by the Reserve Bank of India, have been wary of lending to a sector that’s burdened with debt of almost Rs 8 lakh crore amid competition that has forced smaller telcos to exit the business and some to head for bankruptcy.

Bharti Airtel has so far “issued or guaranteed issuances of multiple long-dated bonds across the US dollar, Euro and Swiss franc to raise the equivalent of $6.2 billion,” according to the telco’s website. These bonds are spread across maturities ranging from five to 10 years.

Over the past year, Airtel has raised almost Rs 12,089 crore by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower unit, Bharti Infratel, to cut debt and free up cash and gird up for competition with Jio. The company said recently it may sell a much larger stake in Bharti Infratel, in which it owns 53.51%.

SingTel invested Rs 2,649 crore recently in the company, which plans to spend Rs 25,000 crore in this financial year to expand 4G operations."

50,2018-03-14,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Bharti Airtel’s shareholders approved the telecom operator's plan to raise Rs 3,000 crore by privately selling bonds. This is part of a proposal to raise Rs 16,500 crore of debt that its board cleared earlier this week to help refinance loans and pay for spectrum.

The company plans to issue 30,000 listed, unsecured, rated and redeemable non-convertible debentures at aface value of Rs 10 lakh each, Airtel said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.

“The proceeds of the issue will be used for general corporate purpose including routine treasury activities of refinancing of existing debt and spectrum liabilities, etc.,” it said.

Bharti Airtel has so far “issued or guaranteed issuances of multiple long-dated bonds across the US dollar, euro and Swiss franc to raise the equivalent of $6.2 billion,” the telco’s website showed. These bonds are spread across maturities of five to 10 years.

The latest fundraising will help shore up the balance sheet of India’s largest telecom company, which is striving to fight off brutal competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm.

ET had reported earlier that Airtel’s preference to raise funds through debt is possibly because of the fact that equity financing is more expensive and cumbersome. Bank financing, too, has become hard to come by, with the Reserve Bank of India cautioning lenders about the huge debt — almost Rs 8 lakh crore — that the telecom industry has accumulated, even as tough competition affected their profitability and forced small telcos to exit the business.

Over the past year, Airtel has raised Rs 12,089 crore by progressively reducing its stake in listed tower unit Bharti Infratel to cut debt, free up cash and gird up for competition with Jio. The company said recently it may sell more stake in Bharti Infratel, in which it owns 53.51%."

Shares of Bharti Airtel declined on reports that the telecom major is believed to be looking to sell a higher stake in Bharti Telemedia, its DTH arm, to raise funds for building a war chest to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm, as per a report by ET.

The BSE Telecom index was trading 0.93 per cent down at 1,391 around 12 pm (IST) on Wednesday. 

On the other hand, shares of GTL (up 12.45 per cent), GTL Infrastructure (up 9.92 per cent), Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) (up 4.97 per cent), Vindhya Telelinks (up 2.26 per cent), Reliance Communications (up 2.14 per cent), OnMobile Global (up 2.01 per cent), Tata Communications (up 1.03 per cent) and Idea Cellular (up 0.19 per cent) were trading with gains around that time.

44,2018-03-14,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel, India’s largest mobile phone company, is believed to be looking to sell a higher stake in Bharti Telemedia, its DTH arm, to raise funds for building a war chest to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm, people familiar with the matter said.

A precursor to such a sale was a board approval to transfer 19% additional stake in Bharti Telemedia to wholly-owned unit, Nettle Infrastructure Investments. This transfer will be in addition to a 25% block already transferred in January 2018, thus taking the block being transferred to 44%.

A part of the company’s “aforesaid stake (19% in Bharti Telemedia) shall be utilised for completion of stake sale of Telemedia to the Warburg Pincus Group,” Bharti Airtel said in a regulatory filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange Tuesday.

Part of the balance stake, people say, are for further stake sale to raise funds, though Airtel would continue to own a majority stake in its DTH arm. This move comes a day after the Airtel board approved a plan to raise about Rs 16,500 crore through debt, including a fresh issue of $1 billion in overseas bonds, to help refinance loans and pay for spectrum. Bharti Airtel did not reply to ET’s queries on whether routing 44% of its Telemedia stake to Nettle now similarly sets the stage for bigger stake sales in its DTH arm. The telco’s shares closed 1.22% at Rs 425.90 on BSE on Tuesday.

Back in December last year, the Bharti group had announced plans to sell a fifth of its DTH arm to an affiliate of global private equity firm Warburg Pincus, for around Rs 2,258 crore ($350 million). As per transaction details then disclosed, Bharti Airtel would directly sell 15% of its DTH arm to Lion Meadow Investment — a Warburg Pincus entity — for Rs 1,623.76 crore, while the balance would be sold by a Bharti promoter entity, which owns 5% in company.

""This is a clear signal from Airtel to the markets that it's open to selling stakes in valuable but non-core businesses to keep a war chest ready to combat Jio,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, telecoms analyst at PhillipCapital.

Another sector analyst at a leading global brokerage, who did not wish to be named, said Airtel transferring as much as 44% of its Telemedia shares to Nettle Infra throws up possibilities of additional stake sales in the DTH arm to global private players at the right valuations.

Airtel’s move, he said, “mirrors what the Mittalled telco did before selling a 10.3% stake in tower arm, Bharti Infratel,” to a global consortium, comprising KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB).

A year ago, Airtel had transferred upto 400 million shares in Bharti Infratel to Nettle Infrastructure Investments in tranches ahead of subsequent dilutions in its listed tower arm, starting with the stake sale to the KKRCPPIB consortium.

Over the past one year, Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower unit, Bharti Infratel, to cut debt and free up cash and gird up for competition with Jio, having taken a severe hit on revenue and profits in the past year or so. Airtel has raised nearly Rs 12,089 crore through multiple tiny stake dilutions in the tower arm. The company has recently said it may sell a much larger stake in Bharti Infratel, in which it owns some 53.51%.

In a separate development, Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) has concluded its Rs 2,649 crore investment in Bharti Telecom, taking its total stake (including affiliates) in the holding company of Bharti Airtel to 48.90% from earlier 47.17%. Bharti Enterprises will continue to own 50.1% of Bharti Telecom.

Consequently, Singtel’s economic interest in Bharti Airtel too has risen by 0.9 percentage point to 39.5% while the Indian promoter’s share stands diluted proportionately to 27.08% from 27.93% previously.

Last month, Singtel had announced plans to raise its stake in Bharti Airtel by investing Rs 2,649 crore in the telco’s holding company, Bharti Telecom, through a preferential share issue, proceeds of which would be used to cut debt."

53,2018-03-16,Bharti Infratel,"The domestic equity market in Thursday’s session headed nowhere for major part of the trade, while remaining in a capped range.

However, closing trades were more sluggish than expected, as the Nifty ended the day with a loss of 50.75 points or 0.49 per cent, while adding fresh short positions.

The market will consolidate and spend more time subdued before it prepares itself to move past the 100-DMA levels.

Nifty is likely to see quiet to mildly positive start on Friday. However, Nifty is neither expected to move past 100-DMA, nor it is likely to breach any major support area.

Friday will see the levels of 10,395 and 10,475 playing out as immediate resistance for the market. Supports will come in at 10,345 and 10,275 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 44.8813, and it continues to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish, as it continues to trade above its signal line. No significant formations were observed on candles.

Pattern analysis reveals the credibility of the resistance area of 100-DMA as the Nifty has resisted those levels. Also it has established the support zone of the 10,275-mark followed by the 200-DMA.

At present, it continues to trade in a rectangle formation, which translates into a broad trading range. All in all, it is all likely that the Nifty continues to oscillate and consolidate a bit more before it prepares for a fresh up move.

In this process, the support of 10,275-mark will be critical area to watch for. The F&O data, which continues to show addition of shorts, reiterates the limited downsides for Nifty.

Also, taking into account the performance of the broader indices and sector indices, it is evident that the market continues to exhibit positive bias.

We reiterate avoiding shorts in the present scenario. Minor downsides cannot be ruled out, but overall, this will be nothing more than some more consolidation, which is ultimately likely to resolve itself with a directional bias on the upside.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen in stocks such as IDFC Bank, Coal India, REC Ltd, DLF, ICICI Bank, L&TFH, Arvind, Nalco, Asian Paints, Equitas, Reliance Power and Bharti Infratel.

72,2018-03-20,Bharti Infratel,"Despite ending below the 200-DMA in the previous session, Indian market in volatile trade on Tuesday managed to keep itself afloat and avoid any serious breakdown.

The NSE benchmark Nifty saw itself in a capped range during the day, while struggling to keep its head above the crucial 10,040-mark. The market finally ended with a net gain of 30.10 points or 0.30 per cent.

As we approach Wednesday’s session, we can expect technical pullback by the market. A modestly positive start is expected, but in any case Nifty will have to move past the 10,166-mark to stay successfully afloat and avoid any major breakdown. The 10,166 level is the 200-DMA.

 Given the oversold nature of the oscillators, even if the Nifty does not immediately find its bottom, there are larger chances of a pullback than an outright breakdown from current levels.



 The levels of 10,166 and 10,245 will act as immediate resistance for the market. Crucial supports come in at 10,040 and 9,980 zones.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 36.0100, and it remains neutral showing no divergences against the price. The daily MACD is bearish, while it trades below its signal line. Pattern analysis shows that the Nifty has continued to resist to the 200-DMA on the upside while attempting to pullback. It will have to move past 10166-mark at the to have a sustainable and serious pullback.

 Until this happens, Nifty remains vulnerable to volatile oscillations, with 10,040 acting as support. Overall, Nifty is not completely out of the woods as yet, but it certainly remains oversold on some oscillators.

 This makes it likely that even if it remains in continuing downtrend, it gives some decent technical pullback. However, the moving past and closing above 10,166 will be crucial for the Nifty to avoid any major breakdown.

 We will recommend avoiding any major shorts at this juncture. Cash should be preserved and extremely select stock specific purchases may be made. Continuance of cautious outlook is advised until we see Nifty moving past 10,166 in a convincing manner.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Resilient technical is seen on stocks like Bharti Infratel, Tata Steel, CG Power, Vedanta, Tata Power, Mercator, Zee Entertainment, BEML, Maruti, Bharat Financial and Grasim.

66,2018-03-20,Bharti Infratel,"As equity benchmark Nifty slipped below its 200-day moving average (DMA) on Monday, momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence, or MACD, signalled downward crossovers on nearly 100 counters on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Among the stocks that witnessed this phenomenon were IndianOil (IOC), ICICI Bank, ITC, Tata Motors, PVR, Infosys, Indiabulls Real Estate, Bharat Gears, Vadilal Industries and Mahanagar Gas.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes in last few days, which add further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Other stocks that saw bearish crossovers included HPCL, Engineers India, Gateway Distriparks, Bharti Infratel, Indiabulls Real Estate, V-Guard, SJVN, Ujjivan Financial and BF Utilities.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward trend or vice-versa.



However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call. Market participants should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm such trends.

Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed that 24 stocks witnessed bullish crossovers on NSE to give a ‘buy’ signal. They included Hindustan Unilever, Tara Jewels, Jaypee Infratech, Bodal Chemicals, Hathway Cable and Sakthi Sugars.



The 50-share index settled 100 points, or 0.99 per cent, down at 10,094 on Monday and, in the process, formed a bearish candle on the daily chart.

“The index has broken the swing low of 10141 and has reached the trend line from previous swing lows where it has halted for the day. Breach of the swing low confirms wave extension on the downside with key targets placed at 10,000-9,800. Expansion in the daily Bollinger Bands is assisting the price action on the way down. Also, the daily KST, having triggered bearish crossover, is pointing towards further downside,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the chart of IndianOil (IOC) shows whenever the MACD line has crossed below the signal line, the stock has shown a downward momentum and vice versa.

87,2018-03-22,Bharti Infratel,"Consolidation is the key and the telecom industry has the right number of players and 5G will unlock value for consumers across sectors was the moot point at ET Telecom India Mobile Conclave. 

""5G is a natural evolution and India is at the negotiation table at world stage when it comes to 5G , so we have less time lag this time,"" said Akhil Gupta, chairman Bharti Infratel at the conclave. 

""The industry structure with four players is right size and with time there will be increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) and the sector is poised for good times ahead,"" said Gupta who was part of the panel discussion on the 'National Telecom Policy 2018 : A new revenue engine for telcos'. 

The telecom regulator called for more infrastructure sharing and network improvement and reiterated that India will be the 5G leader. ""India is ready for 5G . We will be the leaders and not followers . 5G will bring in IoT, high bandwidth for users,"" said SK Gupta, secretary for telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) who was one of the panelists. 

He added that policies need to be reviewed keeping in mind how the telecom industry has changed down the years. ""Telecom is now the backbone of all services. One needs to re look at spectrum allocation as well,"" said Gupta. 

Anchored by Supriya Srinate of ET Now, telecom industry's representatives also debated and discussed on taxes. 

""The telecom industry has responsible corporates. Investment surplus for the industry needs to go up.,"" said P Balaji, director for Vodafone India. 

Mathew Oommen, president of Jio Infocomm (Jio) too called in for reasonable taxes that will leave operators with more more capital available for investments in latest technology like 5G. He added that 5G ecosystem may come by 2020 and till then one needs to reinforce and develop technology like 4G -Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO). 

At the global level too many operators are working to bring in 5G said Qualcomm president Jim Cathey who said that 5G is expected to debut in 2019 and in India demand for data will bring in 5G faster than expected . 

The panel also discussed tariff prices, while deliberating upon issues such as sustainability and growth . Rajan Mathews, director general for cellular operators association for India (COAI) highlighted that while ARPU at global levels is $75, in India it is around $3 and more intervention is needed from regulators . 

 Mani Manimohan, senior director , global public policy for GSM Association said that while ultimately consumers will benefit, it will matter what policies like net neutrality are take up in the right manner."
86,2018-03-22,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The upcoming new National Telecom Policy (2018) should focus on infrastructure sharing on a deeper level, as sharing networks would lead to efficiency and cash conservation, said Bharti Enterprises vice chairman Akhil Gupta at ET Telecom’s India Mobile Conclave 2018.

Calling the telecom sector as one of the most taxed, the chairman of tower provider Bharti Infratel sought for consideration to lower license fees and remove double taxation in the new policy for the sector, which is considered as the lifeline of the country.

“New telecom policy needs to reiterate infrastructure sharing… we know the state of the health of the industry, I don’t think the operators would be in a position to put in the capex that is required, more over the opex they have to incur as exclusive networks will be prohibitive,” he said while giving his keynote address on Thursday. He added that the regulatory challenges in this should be resolved.

“Time has come to share complete networks and capacities as it will bring cost efficiency,” he said, adding that transmission, optic fibre and microwave should be shared as the next step.

The government has been working on NTP 2018 for nearly a year and plans to come up with the policy soon for public comments soon, before it takes it to the Cabinet. Telecom minister Manoj Sinha told audience at the ET Telecom’s India Mobile Conclave 2018 that the policy will be released soon. He said on Tuesday, that the government plans to bring the policy in the next session of Parliament.

Bharti’s Gupta went on to add that the government’s Bharat Net infrastructure should be given to the telcos at nominal costs, since the project has been funded by the Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) to which telcos have given a part of their revenue over several years.

“Rationalisation in license fee approach is needed, today in calculating AGR the bandwidth charges paid to another ILD or NLD operator are not deducted from AGR… industry is already taxed despite it being the lifeline for Digital India,” he added, underlining the paradox of a priority industry being over taxed. “The double taxation should not happen.” About 30% of every Rupee earned by carriers goes towards levies and taxes put by the government, which is far higher than international standards and the industry has been arguing to lower it.

He went to add that sharing of infrastructure should be considered as the modus operandi by operators in India, as all telcos have not more than 18 months to ramp up their networks to achieve full 4G coverage, from the present levels of less than half. About 50-55% of the country’s network was still covered by 2G, he highlighted. “Hundreds and thousands of sites will be needed when 5G comes, but we will need fibrisation (of towers) as well.”

“We will need a lot of wi-fi and in-building infrastructure, so we’re looking at some massive investments into infrastructure,” he said."

84,2018-03-22,Bharti Infratel,"The recent sell-off in domestic equity markets has dragged the NSE Nifty below its 200-Day Moving Average (DMA), signalling that the index is losing momentum. So far this year, the 50-share benchmark has already slipped over 2 per cent to 10,155 till March 21.

More than 30 stocks on the Nifty50 are trading below their 200-DMAs. The list included Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Bosch, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Hindalco, HPCL, Lupin, ONGC and SBI.

Even on the Nifty500, as many as 294 stocks that constitute nearly 60 per cent of the pack, are trading under their 200-DMAs. This shows that the market is facing selling pressure across sectors.

Stocks trading below this crucial support line include names like Aban Offshore, Advanced Enzyme Technologies, Asian Paints, Aurobindo Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Bank of Baroda, Cipla, Colgate-Palmolive, Corporation Bank, Cox & Kings, DCB Bank, Dewan Hosing Finance Corporation, Dish TV, ICRA and NMDC, among others.

Moving averages are a tool for analysing the trend of a stock or even an index. They provide useful information on the support and resistance points.







Usually, any trader or investor uses three major DMAs - Daily Moving Averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 DMA. When a stock is trading above all of its DMAs, it is usually said to be in a continuing uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks are often seen coming off their highs and are slipping below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks testing their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause the stock not only to test 200-DMA but also slip below it.

Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, said, “If any stock trades below its 200-DMA, that means it is undergoing a serious corrective action. However, just because a stock trades below its 200-DMA does not mean that it is in a major bear trend. It just implies it is undergoing a major corrective move.”

Vaishnav told ETMarkets.com: “Bear trend in a stock sets in only if shorter term averages start trading below the longer term averages. As long as 50-DMA trades above 100-DMA and 100-DMA trades above 200-DMA, the stock just remains in a major corrective activity without any bear trend being initiated.” 

The 200-day average, also known as long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for the index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. A 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks.

S H Kelkar, Shree Renuka Sugars, Siemens, SJVN, SML Isuzu, Snowman Logistics, Tata Coffee, Tata Power, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Va Tech Wabag and Vardhman Textiles are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs.

The NSE Nifty index was trading 49 points up at 10,204 in early trade on Thursday. 

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking, said, “We reiterate that traders should remain light within this consolidation and should rather focus on individual stocks with a proper exit strategy. Directionally, the market is still not done with the corrective phase and hence, booking timely profits in existing longs with a short-term view makes a good play for the momentum traders.”"

“The escalation of trade war between the US and China triggered selling pressure across the global including ours. After the gap down start, Nifty remained sideways and failed to see any significant recovery. The breakdown of major psychological support at 10,000 will further add to the worries. Traders have no option but to stay with the trend and use bounce to create fresh shorts. Nifty has next support at 9,900,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.

104,2018-03-27,Bharti Infratel,"Mobile operators and tower companies are engaged in a tussle with the latter demanding higher rentals citing a slump in the number of tenants — or, telcos that use their services — and the former resisting it saying the sector is already under a lot pressure.

“With the consolidation among telecom service providers (TSPs), we believe that the contracts between tower companies and operators would need to be relooked due to the ongoing hyper competition and financial stress leading to consolidation,” said Tilak Raj Dua, director general of tower industry body TAIPA.

Mobile operators reject this view, saying existing contracts cannot be breached and higher rentals for new contracts will be tough given the pressure on their revenues. The number of mobile service providers has fallen to four from ten just 16 months ago, courtesy a major consolidation in the sector triggered by the disruptive entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016 offering free calls and data at a fraction of prevailing rates.

Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI), which represents telcos in the country, said given the consolidation, either of the two parties will need to take the hit. “One of the two parties will have to pay more or the other will have to take a hit,” he said.

Market leader Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel and American Tower Company (ATC) are the three main tower companies that own approximately 85% of total telecom towers in the country. The consolidation among telcos is expected to hit them for the next 18-24 months due to further fall in their tenancy ratios, or the number of operators (tenants) that have put up their antennae and infrastructure on a tower.

Mathews said the tenancy ratio is around 2-2.5 on average currently and will drop to 1.5-1.8 in the next 18-24 months, following the completion of the Idea Cellular-Vodafone India merger.



He said the tower industry’s revenues have fallen 10-15% since consolidation started, but added that the exit clauses signed between operators and tower firms will mitigate the impact to a large extent.

According to reports, ATC has lost about 57,000 tenancies because of Tata Teleservices selling its operations to Bharti Airtel, shutdown of Aircel, and Idea Cellular-Vodafone India merger.

GTL Infrastructure, which had large exposure to Aircel, said in a regulatory filing in January that it had estimated 56,000 tenancies for FY18 but, because of ongoing consolidation, it may go down to 47,000.

Bharti Infratel, despite having about 93% of its exposure to Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, BSNL and Jio and only 7% to smaller players also expects a “soft” year ahead, keeping in mind consolidation.

In its third quarter ended December 2017, the tower company saw a net reduction of 6,612 co-locations on a consolidated basis.

Bharti Infratel in its analyst conference said the new tenants are getting signed on as per new rate cards.

Although tower rentals vary from metros to tier II, tier III and rural segments across circles, a telco typically pays Rs 40,000-50,000 per month in a prime location in a metro.

“Operators will have to pay more for new tenancies,” said the promoter of one of the tower firms. “With consolidation on, if operators want towers in specific locations that are premium, then they will have to pay more.”

But operators themselves are struggling with pressure on margins, revenue and high debt amid an ongoing price war, with Airtel, Vodafone and Idea trying to match Jio’s offers.

A top executive at one of India’s older telcos said, “I don’t think new rates will work as we are under pressure ourselves.”"

The Nifty50 index failed to hold above its crucial resistance at the 10,276 level and witnessed sustained selling till the end of the session.

The index wiped out the gains of previous two sessions and formed a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart, which implies complete dominance by the bears.

Now, as long as the Nifty50 holds below 10,180 level, weakness could be seen towards 10,050 and then the psychologically important 10,000 mark, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,222 and then 10,276 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,000 followed by 9,800 while maximum Call OI was at 10,500, followed by 11,000. Put writing was seen at strike price 10,000 and 10,200 while significant Call writing was seen at strike prices 10,300 and 10,400 marks, which could restrict the upside.

Options data suggested a broader trading range for the Nifty50 between 10,000 to 10,250 levels.

India VIX moved up by 7.64 per cent to 16.34. A sudden spike in volatility after consolidation of last six sessions has given the bears an upper hand. Volatility is at higher levels since last six weeks. We are expecting volatility to continue because of volatile global cues and RBI policy.

Bank Nifty opened on a flat note. However, it corrected by more than 400 points on weak global cues. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily chart, which indicated supply at every bounce. However, it respected the crucial vertical support trend line.

Now, if it sustains below 24,100 level, then it may slip towards 24,000 and then 23,750 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 24,350 and then 24,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed with a loss of 1.42 per cent at 10,139. Long buildup was seen in Page Industries, Bajaj Finance, Colgate-Palmolive and Eicher Motors while shorts were seen in Godrej Industries, Voltas, PC Jeweller, Amara Raja Battery, MindTree, Bharti Infratel, Hindalco, Tata Steel and NTPC.

3,2018-04-04,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: American Tower Corp (ATC) has paid around Rs 3,850 crores to buy 10,200 towers from Vodafone India, completing the first tranche of a deal where the US company will also pick up Idea Cellular’s towers for Rs4,000 crore, bolstering the two merging telcos with much needed cash to better compete in a brutal market. 

“Vodafone India has completed the sale of its standalone tower business in India to ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited for an enterprise value of Rs 3850 crore ,” Vodafone said in a press release 
Tuesday.

It added that both Vodafone and Idea – which are merging to create India’s largest telecom company – are selling their respective standalone towers “to strengthen the combined financial position of the merged entity.” The Idea-Vodafone merger is expected to be completed by 
June 30, though many expect it to close earlier in May itself.

“Completion of Idea’s sale of its standalone tower business to ATC is also expected in the first half of this calendar year,” Vodafone said. ATC is slated to pay Idea Cellular Rs 4,000 crore for its 9800 towers. 

ATC ruled out any delay in the Idea deal and expects it to be closed shortly. “The deal is currently going through the regulatory process which is now managed by the Department of Telecommunications (DOT). Now that Vodafone deal is complete, the Idea deal can happen shortly,"" Amit Sharma, president ATC Asia told ET. ""We have not heard of any delay and it is moving in its normal course. DoT said it (Idea deal) is in advanced stage of approval,” Sharma added.

For Idea and Vodafone, this deal is crucial since selling off their towers would help the loss-making telcos pare debt and be better equipped to take on new entrant Reliance Jio and leader Bharti Airtel. Vodafone and Idea are also exploring the sale of their respective 42% and 11.15% stakes they separately own in Indus Towers. Vodafone’s stake in Indus is not a part of the merger pact, unlike Idea’s 11.15%.

“We are pleased to acquire this (Vodafone) portfolio, which will complement our existing footprint and help us serve our tenants in India as they expand 4G services in the coming years,” said Sharma.

ATC Telecom Infrastructure, a majority owned Indian subsidiary of ATC, bought the towers from Vodafone Mobile Services Ltd. and Vodafone India Ltd.

These two tower deals will cost ATC $1.2 billion in cash, but is expected to generate approximately Rs 2,100 crore in property revenue and approximately Rs 800 crore in gross margin its first full year in ATC's portfolio, as per the announcement earlier made by the company.

ATC, one of the world’s largest independent tower companies, has been silently augmenting its towers portfolio in India ever since it bought a 51% stake in Viom Networks for Rs 7,635 crore in the largest inbound acquisition in FY16.

Buyout of Vodafone and Idea’s captive towers would boost ATC’s India towers portfolio to nearly 80,000, taking it closer to Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel with 1,23,00 and 91,000 towers, respectively. The tower firm, in a consolidation mode, is also in talks with Tata Teleservices to acquire the Tata Group company’s residual 26% stake in Viom as a fallout of Tata Teleservices selling its consumer mobile business to Bharti Airtel."

16,2018-04-12,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI | KOLKATA: The telecom industry, which completed one of its most turbulent fiscal years, may see 30-40% of employees go without a raise. 

This would be compounded by a sharp drop in bonus payouts – even up to 50% – as operators and tower firms under severe revenue and margin pressure cut costs and the mass layoffs in a shrinking industry leave little bargaining power in the hands two lakh still employed in the sector.

“At least 30% of the employees may see no increment this year and there will be a fall in their bonuses as the industry has a large talent pool available without jobs and those employed cannot call the shots,” said Navnit Sinha, chairman of search firm Korn Ferry.

Battling tariff wars since Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) entered in September 2016 will see telecom operators taking the main hit.

""The past one year has been a difficult period and as a result, about 40% of the work force may not get a raise, and even if they do, it will be a marginal one,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general at Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).



Mathews said while the top performers may get some raise, telcos will look at re-skilling employees keeping in mind the new technological needs of the sector.

“We are focusing on reducing the operating expenses in ground rental, maintenance, energy, security, and growing our productivity, exponentially,” said Eugene Valles; Head – human resources, GTL Infrastructure.

“Thus, it is not possible to give increment to every employee,” Valles added.

A senior recruiter with one of India's leading executive search firm, who works with some of these key telecom players, painted a gloomier picture saying 50% of the employees could end up with no hikes. Those on the retention list will get an average 5% increment and absolute top performers will get roughly a 9% raise.

Eight HR firms who work with the companies in the industry and whom ET spoke with say their clients have advised that only about 40-50% of bonus amounts are likely to be rolled out.

Increments come in typically in June for the sector and about 30-40% of a senior management's salary is the bonus component. The middle order and junior segment have 20% and 10% bonus weaved into their salaries.

The telecom industry comprising operators, tower firms, infrastructure providers and equipment makers shed at least one lakh employees in the past 16 months as tariff wars forced telcos to shut shop or merge, and those surviving take huge revenue hits.

According to HR experts, it will only be the top performers, which is typically about 10-15% of an organisation, and some others whom the company wants to retain, who will get high single digit increments.

“We have a situation that talent availability in the industry has significantly improved resulting in reduced bargaining power on pay etc from an employee’s perspective.

However, firms cannot completely do away with increments as it will pull down staff morale. So, in towers and infrastructure providers, in best case scenario the average hike would be around 9% or the same as last year,” said Anandorup Ghose, partner at Aon India Consulting, adding that bonus may come down very significantly.

However, for many, even a 9% hike is being optimistic. Arvind Usretay, director-rewards at global advisory Willis Towers Watson India, said compensation budgets were likely to see a 5-6% increase over last year compared to most of India Inc which would see a 9-10% hike.

GTL Infra told ET that their top performers who help them in cost saving may get more than the 5-9% range mentioned, however Airtel, Idea Cellular, American Tower Corp , Vodafone , Jio, Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel did not respond to ET’s queries."
17,2018-04-12,Bharti Infratel,"A lower base might just come to the rescue of India Inc, which thinks revival in earnings is taking hold. The results season is all set to start tomorrow, with Infosys getting off the block.

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities expects a 7 per cent year-on-year (yoy) rise in net profit from companies in its universe. Some of its peers, however, feel that not everything is fine with Corporate India.

Big names such as Infosys, RBL Bank, Gruh Finance and ICIC Securities are lining up their numbers. So, what is looking good, bad and ugly? 

Edelweiss Securities sees commodities, consumer discretionary, retail lenders and NBFCs would post over 20 per cent earnings growth during the quarter under review. Domestic investment and export-oriented companies including IT and pharma, and Tata Motors may log a flat growth — that's bad. The ugly will come from lenders with corporate focus and telecom, which may report losses in Q4 FY18.

Nifty companies are likely to post top line, Ebitda and net profit growth of 14 per cent, 23 per cent and 15 per cent yoy, respectively, implying 7 per cent FY18 EPS growth, said Edelweiss.

Let's see what key sectors have on offer insofar as the fourth quarter goes.


Energy: Kotak Securities believes that quarterly numbers are expected to be robust for upstream PSUs, given higher global crude prices and dividend receipts. Sequentially, it will be weak for oil marketing companies (OMCs) in general due to sharply lower adventitious gains and adverse forex movement. The brokerage house sees the quarter marginally better for RIL, helped by ramp-up of ROGC and likely improvement in Jio’s contribution. 

“We model RIL’s consolidated net income to increase by 1 per cent qoq to Rs 9,470 crore in Q4 FY18 as an increase in Jio’s net income to Rs 810 crore from Rs 500 crore in Q3 FY18 will likely be negated by lower other income from subsidiaries,” Kotak said.


Healthcare: The sector’s Q4 top line to jump around 11 per cent YoY driven by 10 per cent growth in hospitals and 17 per cent growth in diagnostics, according to Edelweiss. Performance in the hospital space is likely to be led by Apollo Hospitals, with its Ebitda expected to go up by a strong 28 per cent. However, overall Ebitda for hospitals is expected to be dragged down by Max India (Max) due to regulatory issues and Fortis Healthcare (Fortis), which is in the midst of a reshuffle. 


Financials: Market mavens see weak numbers coming in from banks due to elevated credit costs, weak NII growth and lower treasury gains. Brokerage houses also see high slippages due to recent RBI guidelines on stress recognition and resolution. 

“We expect most NBFCs to deliver 18-53 per cent yoy growth in core PBT supported by improving loan growth, margins and asset quality,” Kotak Securities said. 


Aviation: Elara Capital expects aviation firms including InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo), SpiceJet and Jet Airways to report 14 per cent yoy fall in their cumulative PAT due to anticipated flat yields of IndiGo and 13 per cent annual increase in unit fuel cost to Rs 1.4 per seat-km.

“Our air-fares analysis indicates that SpiceJet better managed its yields that is expected to improve 7 per cent yoy, following its higher exposure in lower demand quartile routes,” Elara Capital said in a report.


FMCG: There are expectations that FMCG companies will maintain their growth momentum, largely on the back of new launches, signs of rural recovery, price reductions post GST, rate cut across categories, early summer and strong focus on marketing activity by FMCG players.

“We expect our FMCG coverage universe to grow its top line, Ebitda and net income by 6.3 per cent, 11.5 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively on yoy basis,” Nirmal Bang Securities said.


Film exhibition: Nirmal Bang Securities expects a growth in revenues for PVR and Inox Leisure on an annual basis. This is largely because of new screen addition, increase in ticket prices, F&B and advertisement prices. The improvement in margins is expected to be led by input tax credit (ITC) on non-F&B items. 


Technology: Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects aggregate revenue growth of 3.5 per cent qoq (quarter on quarter) for tier-2 IT companies in dollar terms, 60 bps higher than tier-1. While cross-currency movements will rub off positively across the board, the rupee, a key determinant of margins, has not moved significantly. 

The brokerage firm expects Infosys to start the year by guiding for 6-8 per cent growth in constant currency (which will be higher in reported dollar). TCS’ commentary on BFS and margins will be crucial as softness in both is a downside risk to current valuations.


Automobile: While strong volumes are expected to impart operating leverage benefits, focus will continue to remain on elevated commodity cost pressure. Edelweiss believes that Tata Motors is likely to report the strongest margin expansion of 130 bps qoq as Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter for JLR. 


Metals: Gains from higher realisations is likely to be partially offset by increases in coking coal and iron-ore costs. Kotak Securities estimate Ebitda/tonne for domestic steel companies to increase by 11-27 per cent qoq. 


Real Estate: Low credit availability has led to small developers holding back launches or partnering with select developers. Softness in demand is putting further pressure.

“Channel checks suggest slower pace of re-financing from NBFCs during a seasonally strong quarter for lending. We expect debt to increase for Prestige (on account of acquisitions, consolidation and PE payoffs), DLF, Oberoi Realty and Brigade Enterprises. Sobha continues to outperform others on operations,” Kotak said.


Telecom: Jio’s pricing moves in January 2018, impact of international termination rate (ITR) cut effective February 1, 2018, and continued ARPU downtrading are likely to reflect in another quarter of sharp sequential revenue decline for the incumbents.

30,2018-04-22,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India’s hawkish stance, boiling crude prices and weakening rupee restricted strides of the bulls on Dalal Street, as the market’s gains remained capped in the week gone by.

 On a weekly basis, the 30-share Sensex gained 0.65 per cent, while the broader Nifty50 index added 0.79 per cent. The market logged fourth straight weekly gain.

 Q4 earnings and political developments will have a major say in influencing investors and traders ahead.

 Teena Virmani, Vice President – Research at Kotak Securities, said: ""Market will continue to focus on the upcoming election schedule coupled with earnings, yields’ movements and crude prices in the coming weeks.""

 Hardening of yields, both globally and back home, may have a negative impact on markets. Yields moved up recently after the RBI released minutes of April monetary policy meeting, stating upside risks to inflation, which may come from MSP increases, crude price rise and resulting fiscal slippage.

 Rising oil prices also pose a threat to the fiscal and current account deficit (CAD). Oil price direction will also be determined by Opec output cuts and the US decision to reintroduce sanctions on Iran by May 12, Virmani added.


Let's have a look at the key developments that will steer market in the coming week -

Next batch of earnings
A host of big-ticket names are lined up to release their March quarter results in the coming week. Bharti Infratel, LIC Housing Finance and Reliance Infrastructure will declare their results on Monday, while telecom major Bharti Airtel, ICICI Prudential Life and IDFC Bank will release their numbers on Tuesday. Ultratech Cement and Wipro will announce theirs on Wednesday, while Axis Bank, Biocon and YES Bank will unveil their report cards on Thursday. Bandhan Bank, Maruti Suzuki and Reliance Industries are scheduled to announce their numbers on Friday.


Rupee in pain
The rupee on Friday sank 32 paise to hit a 13-month low of 66.12 against the dollar on rising crude prices and fiscal deficit worries. It was the lowest closing level of the domestic currency since March 10, 2017, when it had settled at 66.60 against the greenback.

""Indian rupee fell for a fifth session as RBI minutes revealed that RBI's tone is more hawkish than what markets had previously gauged. FII selling and firm oil adds to pressure on rupee, while US dollar is also not expected to yield much ahead of May's FOMC meet,"" Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.


Simmering crude prices
Last week, both, Brent and WTI (West Texas Intermediate), hit their highest levels since November 2014, at $74.75 and $69.56, respectively, buoyed by geopolitical risk and a tightening market.

For the week, both the benchmarks gained over 1 per cent. However, the prices took a slide when the US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticise rising oil prices. “Looks like OPEC is at it again,” he tweeted. “With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!”


Political developments
A host of political developments in the country will have a key role in influencing market direction in the coming week. In a big blow to the ruling BJP party, veteran member and former finance and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha on Saturday quit the party saying country's democracy is in danger. This apart, opposition parties' move to impeach the Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra is likely to affect investor sentiment.

 In addition to these, investors will take cue from the upcoming state elections in Karnataka. Any change in political equations will affect market mood. 


What tech charts say
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed an indecisive 'Doji' candle on the daily charts. A Doji candle indicates that the decline is being bought into, as the Nifty50 got stuck in a range ahead of the expiry week.

""The index appears to have formed an Inside Bar kind of formation in three sessions, as price action of last two sessions was confined to the range of bearish candle formed on Wednesday. Unless the Nifty50 emerges out of this 10,594-10,509 range with a breakout on either side, trading shall remain listless,"" said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist for Technical Research & Trading Advisory at Chartviewindia.in.

 Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, says, ""While Nifty is still facing resistance at the pattern resistance area on the daily charts, it remains overstretched and it would be no surprise if there are bouts of corrections at higher levels.""


F&O expiry
Trading could be volatile next week, as traders will roll over positions in the F&O segment from the near month April series to May series. The April F&O contracts will expire on Thursday.

F&O stands for Futures and Options. Futures and Options represent derivatives of the stock market. These derivatives are the financial instruments deriving their values from underlying assets such as currency, gold, or the stocks of a company. 


Kim shuns dirty bomb
North Korea on Saturday announced it would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests, scrap its nuclear test site and instead pursue economic growth and peace, ahead of planned summits with South Korea and the US.

 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is scheduled to hold talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in next week and with US President Donald Trump in late May or early June, Reuters reported. The move, hailed by countries across the globe, is likely to boost markets when trading resumes on Monday.


ECB, BoJ policy meets
European Central Bank (ECB) is scheduled to announce its monetary policy on Thursday. Since the ECB’s March meeting, economic data has disappointed, inflation estimates have been revised lower and a global trade spat may loom. Economists anticipate that ECB steps towards winding down QE will come only in June or later. But ECB chief Mario Draghi will be pressed on what he thinks about the economic wobbles, trade wars and the euro, said a Reuters report.

Bank of Japan will announce its policy stance on Friday. While no policy change is expected, the BOJ’s forecasts on inflation will be crucial."
38,2018-04-23,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Infratel, India’s sole listed tower company, reported a 1.5% rise in net profit in the fourth quarter, helped mainly by reduced finance costs, although a sharp fall in colocation of telecom sites amid ongoing consolidation among carriers throttled growth levels. 

The consolidated net profit for the January-March period came in a tad higher at Rs 606 crore, from Rs 597 crore in the year-ago period. Quarterly consolidated revenue, in turn, rose 4% on a like-to-like basis to Rs 3,662 crore, the company said in a statement on Monday. Consolidated revenue for the full financial year ended March 2018 climbed 8% on-year to Rs 14,490 crore. 

Bharti Infratel’s stock fell nearly 1% to close at Rs 328.40 on the BSE on Monday. The results were declared after market hours. 

“The year gone by saw unprecedented consolidation in the telecom industry with five operators ceasing to exist either on account of mergers or outright shutdown of operations. Our company saw loss of 22,134 co-locations on this account during the year,” Akhil Gupta, chairman, Bharti Infratel, said in a statement. 

But despite this, he said, Bharti Infratel’s “overall performance for the year against last year has been robust, which bears testimony to a sound business model and our leadership position”. Gupta, however, said rapidly growing data demand would drive large network rollouts, creating opportunities for tower companies. 

“We are fully prepared to exploit this and meet all requirements of our customers for speedy rollouts.” In the run-up to the fourth quarter results, brokerage Morgan Stanley had reportedly said that Bharti Infratel is “best set to cash in on the boom in the telecom sector, amid consolidation and shutdowns”. 

Nevertheless, in the January-March period alone, the telecom tower company lost as many as 7,880 co-locations, reducing its count to 2,05,596 as of March-end. Co-locations are points where a tower company deploys mobile telecom antennae of multiple carriers on a single structure. The exits reflected in a lower average sharing factor, which dropped to 2.30 from 2.38 in the December quarter, while sharing revenue per tower a month, in turn, fell on-quarter to Rs 79,861 from Rs 82,794. The tower arm of Bharti Airtel ended the March quarter with a total base of 91,451 towers, of which as many as 39,523 were its own. Its total tower base include its 42% stake in Indus Towers. 

Bharti Infratel’s net finance costs, however, plunged 55% on-year to Rs 12.9 crore in the March quarter, also reflecting a near 75% sequential fall from Rs 51 crore in the December quarter. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin for the fourth quarter shrunk to 43.8% from 44.1% in the previous quarter. 

Consolidated expenses for the March quarter totalled Rs 2,056.6 crore, up 6.24% on-year. The largest cost components were power & fuel (Rs 1,314.8 crore,) followed by rent (Rs 323 crore) and repairs & maintenance (Rs 217.9 crore). Bharti Infratel’s board of directors approved a final dividend of .`14 per equity share for the year ended March, the company said in a regulatory filing to BSE."

The Nifty50 index formed a higher wave Doji candle as it traded in a wider range between 10,514 and 10,638 levels all through Monday after moving in a narrow range move for last four sessions.

The index witnessed buying interest in morning dips, but saw selling pressure at higher levels, as it failed to hold above the immediate hurdle of 10,630 in the last hour of trade.

The index got stuck in the grip of option writers ahead of the expiry of April series derivative contracts. Now, as long as it holds above the 10,480-10,500 zone, the immediate trend could continue for a potential upward move towards 10,630 and then 10,700 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,400 while maximum Call OI is at 10,700, followed by 10,600. There was Put writing at strike prices 10,600 and 10,550 while minor Call unwinding was seen at all strike prices, which are creating scope for further upside.

The option band suggests an immediate trading range between 10,500 and 10,700 levels.

India VIX moved up 1.15 per cent to 13.08. Overall lower volatility is supporting the major bullish bias of the market.

Bank Nifty opened flat and then corrected towards the 24,470 level. It has been making lower highs and lower lows from last four sessions. It formed a ‘Hammer’ candle on the daily chart, which implies that the decline got bought into and it recovered sharply from low.

As long as Nifty holds below 25,250, it can extend losses towards 24,750 and then 24,500 levels, while on the upside, major hurdles are seen at 25,250 and then 25,500 levels.

Nifty50 futures closed flat at 10,585. Long buildup was seen in NIIT Tech, Mindtree, Shriram Transort Finance, HCL Tech, LIC Housing Finance, Bharat Financial and Aurobindo Pharma while shorts were seen in Cummins India, Indiabulls Housing Finance, UPL, Tata Motors DVR, Hindalco and Bharti Infratel.

Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session:


Bharti Airtel: The telecom major is slated to release its March quarter results today, post market hours. There are expectations that muted ARPU (average revenue per user) on account of renewed competition from Reliance Jio will impact its India revenue. Brokerage firms Kotak Securities and Sharekhan believe that the telecom major may report losses in Q4 FY18 for the first time in many years. Sharekhan had predicted a net loss of Rs 72 crore during the quarter under review. On the other hand, Kotak Securities projected Airtel to report a consolidated net loss of Rs 380 crore.


Ruchi Soya: Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved has reportedly joined the race for debt-crippled Ruchi Soya. According to the Hindu BusinessLine report, the multi-discipline conglomerate has put in Rs 9,000 crore bid to acquire the edible oil manufacturer, which has been facing insolvency proceedings at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) since December 2017.


Hindalco, Nalco, Vedanta: Aluminium fell more than 8 per cent on Monday on news that the United States has extended the deadline for companies to wind down business with sanctions-hit Russian producer Rusal. Americans engaged with Rusal now have until Oct. 23 to close out their business with the aluminum giant, the US Treasury Department said on Monday in a statement extending the time period. Share prices of Hindalco, Nalco and Vedanta may react to the development. 


Srei Infrastructure: Srei Infrastructure, the highest bidder with an offer of Rs 215 crore for bankrupt Adhunik Alloy, has been disqualified from the bidding process after it was found that the company had a stake in Deccan Chronicle Holdings a firm that defaulted on nearly Rs 4,000 crore. However, the company spokesperson denied it had any stake in the latter. “We have no equity shareholding in Deccan Chronicle,” said a Srei spokesperson.


JSW Steel: JSW Steel has sought a fresh round of bidding from the debtladen steel major Essar Steel’s Committee of Creditors (CoC). JSW’s move comes a day ahead of a crucial CoC meet scheduled on Tuesday. It is significant as it indicates that the Sajjan Jindal company that joined the Russian VTB Bankled Numetal consortium in the second round, is keen to enter the fray for Essar on its own.


Fortis, Dabur: Sunil Kant Munjal’s Hero Enterprise Investment and the Burmans of Dabur group have extended the validity of their joint bid till May 4, 2018, to acquire stake in Fortis Healthcare, the hospital group told stock exchanges on Monday. The joint offer by Hero Enterprise Investment Office and the Burman Family Office is among the only two offers being reviewed by an external committee set up last week to help the Fortis board finalise a deal.


Bharti Infratel: Mobile tower firm Bharti Infratel on Monday posted a 2 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 606 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2018, impacted by some telecom operators closing or merging their businesses. The company's net profit for the January-March period of the previous 2016-17 fiscal stood at Rs 597 crore. The revenue of the company for the fourth quarter of 2017-18 was Rs 3,662 crore, 4 per cent higher over the year-ago period.


Reliance Infra: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) on Monday reported a 291 per cent rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March at Rs 160.14 crore on the back of higher revenues. The company had reported a net profit of Rs 40.92 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.


Reliance Naval: Reliance Naval and Engineering Q4 loss widened to Rs 409 crore in March quarter. The company had posted a loss of Rs 139.92 crore in the year-ago period. Standalone total income in January-March 2017-18 dropped sharply to Rs 34.7 crore from Rs 250.8 crore.


Orchid Pharma: Lenders to bankrupt Orchid Pharma have called for a second round of bidding for the drug maker after they found the offer from the only eligible bidder in the first round — Union Quimico Farmacéutica — to be too low, two senior officials said. The resolution professional who is in charge of the management of the Chennai-based company has set April 25 as the fresh date for submitting binding bids for the firm, said the officials who requested not to be named.


RBL Bank: HDFC Securities has initiated coverage on RBL Bank with a ‘buy’ rating and target price of Rs 573. Strategic clarity, tight execution and superlative growth off a low base make RBL Bank attractive for long term investors.


Ashok Leyland: CLSA has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Ashok Leyland and revised target price to Rs 185 from Rs 145. The brokerage has raised FY19-FY20 EPS estimates by 9-10 per cent on higher volumes and sees a strong 23 per cent EPS CAGR over the next years.


HDFC Bank: Edelweiss has maintained ‘buy’ rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,454. HDFC Bank’s core operating profit growth was softer in Q4 due to sharp moderation in loan growth. Best-in-class liability franchise, expansion of rural/semi-urban branches and improvement in productivity owing to digital focus will ensure the bank delivers above industry earnings growth of 25 per cent CAGR over FY18-FY20, and sustains superior return ratios.

55,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"Telecom giant Bharti Airtel got a thumbs-up from Dalal Street on Wednesday as its March quarter earnings topped expectations. 

The stock climbed a good 3.35 per cent to Rs 419.70 early on Wednesday.

The telecom carrier may have posted its lowest quarterly profit in nearly 15 years, but it's far ahead of analyst estimates.

Earnings of Bharti Airtel were a surprise even as its India business floundered, according to global brokerage firm Nomura. The brokerage firm maintained ‘Buy’ on the firm with a target price of Rs 505.

The numbers, which came in after market hours on Tuesday, saw the country’s largest telco take a hit from Reliance Jio-led low tariffs and a cut in international termination rates (ITR).

Airtel posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 82.9 crore in January-March of 2017-18 against Rs 373.4 crore in the year-ago period. Its India business turned out to be a damp squib as it reported its first net loss in 15 years and joined Idea Cellular and Vodafone India in the red.

“Overall, Q4 FY18 operating performance was more resilient relative to our expectations even though the India business turned unprofitable,” said Nomura in a report.

Net loss, before exceptional items, for the India business in the three months to March, stood at Rs 652.30 crore, compared with a net profit of Rs 770.80 crore a year earlier, the Sunil Mittal-led telco said in a statement on Tuesday. 

CLSA also maintained ‘Buy’ rating on Bharti Airtel, but slashed the target price to Rs 590, from Rs 640 earlier. 

About other operational parameters, Airtel said the mobile data traffic swelled to 1,616 billion megabytes (MB) in the quarter, up 505 per cent from a year ago. During the quarter, India revenue slipped 7.5 per cent year-on-year on an adjusted basis to Rs 14,796 crore even as that of Africa grew 10.7 per cent, fuelled by “strong growth in data and Airtel money transaction value”.

“Ebitda, down 11 per yoy to Rs 7,000 crore, surprised positively, led by the Africa margin,” said CLSA. The brokerage house, however, lowered FY19-21 consolidated revenue and Ebitda by 8-15 per cent.

Domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal also retained ‘Buy’ on Airtel with a target price of Rs 581.

Bharti Airtel’s India ARPU (average revenue per user) for voice and data — a key operational gauge — fell 5.9 per cent qoq to Rs 116 in the January-March quarter.

“This is the lowest ARPU for Bharti Airtel, but going forward, it should grow to Rs 140-145, maybe within one year, due to consolidation,” Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, markets and corporate affairs, at IIFL told ET.

Bharti Airtel on Wednesday also approved the merger of Indus Towers with Bharti Infratel. The merger ratio involves 1,565 shares of Bharti Infratel for every 1 share of Indus Towers.

The combination of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers by way of merger will create a pan-India tower company, with over 163,000 towers, operating across all 22 telecom service areas. The combined entity will be the largest tower company in the world outside China.

Nitin Soni of Fitch Rating in a chat with ET Now said, “Bharti Airtel has been gradually selling its stake in Infratel and the plan is to get private equity investors in Infratel and eventually use those cash proceeds to buy stake of Vodafone and Idea in Indus Tower and merge the two companies. The main synergies from the merger will come from the saving of the dividend distribution tax and greater economies of scale, which will really benefit these tower entities, given the current consolidation.""

He further said, “It's a positive step for the tower entities involved in this deal, but it is not going to affect Airtel in any way. From Bharti Airtel’s point of view, they are not getting any cash or not providing any equity for this combination. So, they are going to be unaffected. They eventually may become a minority shareholder in Infratel.”

Other telecom players Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications were trading 0.63 per cent and 1.67 per cent up at Rs 71.55 and Rs 18.25, respectively, on Wednesday. Idea Cellular, which has been in the red for the past five quarters, is expected to report wider losses when it announces results on April 28."
48,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"Indus Towers is all set to merge with Bharti Infratel to create the world’s largest telecom towers company piping the American Tower Corp, in a deal that may be announced as early as Wednesday, said three sources close to developments.

The merged entity will see Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Plc each holding around 33%. Kumar Mangalam Birla led Idea Cellular along with private equity fund Providence that jointly hold 16% in Indus tower will exit through a cash payout.

Private equity funds KKR and CPPIB that currently holds 10% in Bharti Infratel will be diluted to 6%. The remaining shares in the combined entity will be with the public shareholders of Bharti Infratel, the people said. Both Airtel and Vodafone are to be joint promoters of the new company.

The deal, that has been in the news for nearly a year has received its last few approvals earlier this week, one of them added.

As per the latest discussions the final entity will retain Indus Tower as its name rather than Bharti Infratel. “The objective is to show the final entity as an independent rather than a Bharti group company,” one of them said. The combined company will also be run by the current Indus Tower management, one of the sources mentioned added on condition of anonymity as the talks are in private domain.

Bharti Infratel announced its quarterly financial results on Monday and the Bharti Airtel board met Tuesday for the telco’s annual results, but also signed off on last formalities to allow this transaction, said one of people quoted earlier.

The potential merger will help the company save close to Rs 560 crore on account of dividend distribution tax and other corporate expenditures.

The Bharti Infratel board said on Oct. 30, 2017 that they are looking to buy stake in Indus Towers in one or more tranches with the aim to make it a subsidiary or wholly owned unit of the company.

Indus Towers is currently owned by Bharti Infratel (42 percent), Vodafone Plc (42 percent), Idea Cellular Ltd. (11.15 percent) and by private equity investor Providence (4.85 percent), while in Bharti Infratel, a listed entity, Bharti Airtel (53.51 percent) owns the majority stake.

The current market cap of Infratel is Rs 60,916.85 crore.

The combined valuation of the company could be as high as $16 billion according to investment banking sources, but this could not be independently verified and could pave the way for a potentially larger investment by private equity players in future.

Last year, the KKR-led consortium of investors were in discussions last year to buy a majority in the combine to set up an independent tower company. Talks went cold when the telecos and investors couldn’t arrive at an agreed valuation. The DDT savings can also be captured only via a merger. If Indus Towers were to have been converted into a subsidiary of Bharti Infratel, any dividend it pays to the parent would have still been liable to tax as per tax law.

ET did not receive response from Airtel, Vodafone, Idea or KKR till this went to print. ET had reported in February that Vodafone and Airtel had finally agreed on a share swap deal to consolidate Indus Tower’s shareholding.

Morgan Stanley is an advisor in the transaction.

At the end of the quarter to March 31 Bharti Infratel had 39,500 towers while Indus had 1.2 lac towers. On a consolidated basis Bharti Infratel, including its 42% in Indus, had revenue of Rs 6,726 crore for the just-eneded financial year, with net profit of Rs 2,494 crore.

Indus Tower is India’s most valuable tower company at the moment because all three of its major clients – who are also shareholders – are still in business. Competition triggered consolidation has pushed operators like Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices, Telenor and Aircel out of the market, putting pressure on tower companies like ATC and GTL Infrastructure that supported these networks.

Deal talks for this merger has taken many shapes before this. The most concrete of them was last year when a consortium led by KKR was scheduled to undertake a mega $15 billion investment to buy Bharti Infratel and fold Vodafone and Idea’s shareholding in Indus into the combine."

52,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: The upcoming Idea Cellular-Vodafone India merger may put as much as 14 per cent of telecom tower company Bharti Infratel’s tenancies and revenue at risk if duplication of all their base stations is removed, analysts said.

“We estimate 14 per cent of Infratel’s tenancies/revenues could have an Idea-Vodafone overlap, and therefore, could be at risk if the merger is approved,” Morgan Stanley said in a note seen by ET.

The Big 3 telcos – Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular – account for 85 per cent of Bharti Infratel’s tenancies. The company has more than 91,000 towers.

Deutsche Bank has “lowered Bharti Infratel’s profit forecasts for FY19 and FY20 by 13 per cent/14 per cent for the potential impact of the ongoing merger of its two key tenants, Vodafone India and Idea.”

BNP Paribas expects “pressure on Bharti Infratel’s rental revenue to accelerate further in the first half of FY19 as the Idea-Vodafone merger impact starts reflecting in tenancy.”

Brokerage CLSA has cut Bharti Infratel’s operating income estimates by 5-7 per cent over FY19-21 as operator exits accelerate amid consolidation, which has already resulted in the tower company losing a net 7,900-odd tenancies in the fourth quarter to March, which choked profit and revenue growth.

Bharti Infratel’s stock hit a fresh 52-week low of Rs 316.50 on Tuesday morning, a day after the tower unit of Bharti Airtel reported a 1.5 per cent increase in its March quarter net profit to Rs 606 crore. The stock gained 0.3 per cent to ?329.35 at the close on the BSE.

Goldman Sachs said the extent of the company’s tenancy exits “continued to surprise” and added that consolidation in the operator space would have an ongoing impact on Infratel’s tenancies.

CLSA, however, said the muchdiscussed merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers “is likely” and a “potential deal would improve the former’s capital structure and make it the dominant tower company.”

“A likely part-equity-part debt deal would dilute Bharti Airtel from being a majority shareholder in Bharti Infratel, and both these would be valuation catalysts,” CLSA said in its note to clients.

Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta had told reporters at the Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona that an Indus-Infratel merger “is always a possibility” but added that there “can’t be any timeframes to these kinds of things.” Bharti Group Chairman Sunil Mittal had said then that a committee had been set up to weigh the options of an Indus-Bharti Infratel merger."
53,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel dropped 2 per cent on Wednesday following the announcement of its merger with Indus Towers.

The merged entity will see Bharti Airtel and Vodafone each holding around 33 per cent. Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Idea Cellular and private equity fund Providence, which jointly hold 16 per cent in Indus Towers, will exit through a cash payout. The merged entity will change its name to Indus Towers Limited and stay listed on stock exchanges.

The merger ratio i.e. 1,565 shares of Bharti Infratel for every 1 Indus Towers share values the latter at an enterprise value of Rs 71,500 crore ($10.8 billion) or 9.3 times EV/Ebitda on trailing 12-month basis.

Following the announcement, the stock fell 1.51 per cent to hit a low of Rs 324.35. However, it pared the losses marginally and closed the day with a loss of 1.05 per cent at Rs 325.90.

The combined valuation of the company could be as high as $16 billion, according to investment banking sources, but this could not be independently verified. It may pave the way for a potentially larger investment by private equity players in future, ET reported."
54,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Sunil Mittal-driven mobile infrastructure company Bharti Infratel Wednesday said that it would merge its operations with Indus Towers that has Vodafone India and Idea Cellular as stakeholders to create 
a $14.6 billion company which will be one of the largest mobile tower entities worldwide with 1.63 lakh towers. 

“The combination of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers by way of merger will create a pan-India tower company, with over 163,000 towers, operating across all 22 telecom service areas in India. The combined company will be the largest tower company in the world outside China” the company said in a statement. 

ET had reported the deal details in its April 25 edition. 

Indus Towers is currently jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42%), Vodafone (42%), Aditya Birla’s Idea group (11.15%) and Providence (4.85%).
""The merger Ratio of 1,565 shares of Bharti Infratel for every 1 Indus Towers share is within the range recommended by the independent valuer. Based on the SEBI pricing guidelines for Bharti Infratel, in relation to the proposed scheme, as at 23 April 2018 (INR363 per share), the merger ratio implies an enterprise value for Indus Towers of INR71,500 crore (US$10.8 billion). This is equivalent to valuing Indus Towers at 9.3x EV/LTM EBITDA,"" the companies said.


The Bharti Infratel stock was down 0.9% at Rs 326.35 on the BSE in early trade.

The combined entity, which will fully own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, according to the statement, will change its name to Indus Towers Ltd. and will continue to be listed on the Indian Stock Exchanges.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone, according to the companies, will jointly control the combined company, in accordance with the terms of a new shareholders’ agreement. The transaction, however, is subject to regulatory and other approvals, including from CCI, SEBI, NCLT, DoT (FDI approval), and is expected to close before the end of the financial year ending 
31 March 2019.

As a part of combination modalities, Vodafone will be issued with 783.1 million new shares in the combined company, in exchange for its 42% shareholding in Indus Towers. 

The merger conditions also gives Idea the option to either sell its 11.15% shareholding in Indus Towers for Rs6,500 crore cash based on a valuation formula linked to the VWAP for Bharti Infratel’s shares during the 60 trading days prior to completion of the merger or receive new shares in the combined company based on the merger ratio. 

If Idea decides to sell, it will use the proceeds for the benefit of the entity resulting from the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Group.
Providence has the option to elect to receive cash or shares for 3.35% of its 4.85% shareholding in Indus Towers, with the balance exchanged for shares.

If Idea declines to sell out and Providence decides to part sell, the new entity will be 37.2% owned by Bharti Airtel, 29.4% by Vodafone Group, 1.1% by Providence with the rest belonging to public shareholders. If Idea and Providence decide to stay in the company, they will get a 7.1% and 3.1% holding, respectively.The stakes of others will be diluted proportionately to Bharti Airtel, 33.8%, Vodafone 26.7% and the public, 29.3%. 

The merger between the two tower companies has come at a time when revenues of incumbents — particularly Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and idea Cellular- face a cash squeeze on the back of Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio’s disruptive entry in September 2016."
56,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel will consider selling stake in the entity emerging from merger of its infrastructure company, Bharti Infratel, and Indus Towers, after the merger process is complete. 

The Sunil Mittal promoted carrier informed the stock exchanges of this decision taken by the board this morning, after announcing the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers to create the world's largest tower provider outside China. 

""The Board after due deliberations approved the proposal for merger of Indus Towers ltd into Bharti Infratel Ltd,"" the company said, after holding the board meeting on Tuesday. 

""The Board decided to engage with the potential investors for evaluating a strategic stake sale post the completion of merger,"" it added. The merger is expected to be completed within this financial year ending March 2019.

Airtel stock was up 4.1 per cent to Rs 422.75 on BSE on Wednesday morning. 

Airtel said that it took the decision after having received the recommendation from its Committee of Directors and accordingly reviewed the options with regard to its stake in its subsidiary Bharti Infratel and evaluated two options - one an offer for sale of significant stake in Bharti Infratel from a consortium of leading PE investors and the other a proposal for merger of Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel. 

As per the announcement made by Airtel this morning, Infratel will merge its operations with Indus Towers that has Vodafone India and Idea Cellular as stakeholders to create a $14.6 billion company which will be one of the largest mobile tower entities worldwide with 1.63 lakh towers. 

The combined entity, which will fully own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, according to the statement, will change its name to Indus Towers Ltd. and will continue to be listed on the Indian Stock Exchanges.

58,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"The merger of Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel will give Idea Cellular and Vodafone India the much-needed leeway to monetise their stakes to reduce debt in their merged company, analysts said, adding that the companies would, however, need to keep infusing more cash to compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel.

“The Indus-Bharti Infratel merger deal is a win-win for Idea Cellular as it gives them a potential cash exit option and retains their preferred access to the tower assets of the combined tower entity through its merger with Vodafone India,” said former Bharti Airtel CEO Sanjay Kapoor.

The mega tower company merger will also give more financial flexibility to Vodafone and a greater liquidity option as it will be free to sell its stake in the market as the merged entity would be listed, he added.

Idea, ranked No. 3, and second-placed Vodafone India are in the last leg of approvals needed to merge and form the largest telecom operator in India. With a combined debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore and a debt-to-equity of over seven times operating income – even after the recent cash infusions – any stake sale now or later could be used to improve the balance sheet of the merged entity.

“Their long desire to list Indus as a monetisable asset gets solved. From being just customers of Infratel, Vodafone and Idea move to having an equity interest in the company (at least till the merger concludes, in case of Idea),” Credit Suisse said in a report. Vodafone and Idea own 42% and 11.15% in Indus currently, but don’t hold any stake in Infratel, which is majority owned by their rival Bharti Airtel.

Some analysts said the Idea-Vodafone merger will need the Aditya Birla Group to continue to infuse more funds. Idea has already raised Rs 6,750 crore from promoters this year and and through a private placement of shares, while Vodafone is infusing Rs 7,390 crore. Besides, the two have sold or are selling their captive towers to American Tower Corp. for Rs 7,850 crore.

The merger conditions give Idea the option to either sell its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers for Rs 6,500 crore cash or receive new shares – equal to 7.1% stake – in the combined company. Idea, which is expected to cash out, didn’t respond to ET’s queries.

“Idea will have to keep pumping money in this loss-making venture through all possible means. And although not much can be said about closely held Vodafone Group, rationally, it should sell the stake in future,” said SP Tulsian, founder of Premium Investments.

A telecom expert at one of the Big 4 global consultancy firms said Idea can make more money from the deal. “Idea still has its fibre, which can be sold to the newly created merged tower company,” the expert said.

According to the tower company merger details, Vodafone will be issued with 783.1 million new shares, or 29.4% or 26.7% stake, depending on Idea’s choice, in the combined company in exchange for its 42% shareholding in Indus Towers.

“Vodafone may sell down the listed Bharti Infratel stake, if there are future capital needs at the mergedco (though we highlight that the long-term path of converging shareholding between Birla and Vodafone would mean that Vodafone may end up selling mergedco over time as well),” Credit Suisse said."
59,2018-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Infratel’s stock dipped by over 1% on a day it announced a merger with Indus Towers, with market watchers saying that the deal was largely priced in. The tower company’s parent, Bharti Airtel, though saw its shares rise over 3%, after it said it was evaluating a stake sale in the combined tower entity. The telecom market leader’s shares also received a boost with investors believing that its financials had hit the bottom with the loss in India business reported a day earlier.

Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets and corporate affairs at IIFL, said that the Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel, despite being a win-win for all stakeholders, was largely priced in. “We have the derivative expiry tomorrow, maybe there was some heaviness on the derivative side which got unbound. But these are everyday movements.” 

Brokerage houses and analysts further said that retail investors, that hold a tiny portion of the shares in Bharti Infratel, would not have been able to influence the price of the stock due to very limited liquidity and institutional and financial investors see the merger between Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers as simply status quo till new investors come in.

“Public shareholding in Bharti Infratel is right now 0.5%, 46% is held by institutional investors. So once Bharti Airtel will be keen to exit from the merged entity, that is when institutional investors - who want to buy more even now - will buy,” said market expert SP Tulsian, thus influencing the stock price. Public shareholding in Bharti Infratel is presently at 46.5%, the rest with promoters.

Indus’s merger into Infratel is expected to close by March 2019. Airtel said it may sell stake to potential private equity players post the deal closure. The combined entity, called Indus Towers, will continue to be listed on Indian bourses. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India will have joint control in the entity. 

Telecom and media consultancy firm Capitel added that the stock movement of Bharti Infratel reflected the continued non-visibility on total churn of tenancies from the Idea Cellular-Vodafone India merger, besides other weaker operators who were exiting the market. “Only when there is some confirmed indication from potential private equity investors for buyout would there be a (positive) effect on Infratel stock... right now, it’s only a merger,” said Pankaj Agrawal, partner at the firm.

Infratel shares closed 1.1% lower at Rs325.90 on the BSE, Wednesday. Airtel, in contrast, ended 3.4% higher at Rs 325.90, despite reporting the first loss in 15 years in its India business on Tuesday. 

Reports from several brokerage houses said that Bharti Airtel’s Rs 83 crore net profit on a consolidated basis for the quarter ended March 2018 were better with their beaten down expectations of a net loss. They added that the Sunil Mittal owned-carrier remained well positioned to benefit from the imminent turnaround of the Indian telecom industry that has been battered with fall in revenues, profits due to hyper competition and free voice and data offers from new entrant Reliance Jio.

Bharti’s numbers were already discounted as it was not as bad as it was expected and now there’s expectation that average revenue per user (ARPU) may have bottomed out, IIFL’s Bhasin said.

Bharti Airtel will benefit from the unlocking of value in Infratel, and it will also help them in getting better deal as they will be able to get easier borrowings on the balance sheet because of reduction in debt equity ratio, he added."

Weakness in global equities after the US bond yields rose above 3 per cent also kept bourses under pressure.

The Nifty50 index closed 44 points, or 0.41 per cent, down at 10,570, while the BSE Sensex shed 115 points, or 0.33 per cent, to end at 34,501.

“Indian markets traded in the red, dragged by banking and metal stocks as investors booked profits amid weakened global sentiment. Nifty IT remained the top performing sector, as the rupee hit a fresh 13-month low. Realty stocks were in focus today as the government approved the Mumbai development plan. Bharti Airtel remained the best performer on the Nifty Index after posting results which were above analyst expectations,” said Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan.

BSE Midcap and smallcap indices incurred more losses than Sensex, closing 0.52 per cent and 0.72 per cent down, respectively.

Clocking up a gain of over 3 per cent, Bharti Airtel was the top gainer in Sensex pack. The scrip rose over 5 per cent intraday after it beat analysts' forecast for March quarter earnings. The company on Tuesday reported a 77.79 per cent fall in consolidated net profit at Rs 82.90 crore for the March quarter.

Tata Consultancy Services and Mahindra & Mahindra rose 2.43 and 1.88 per cent, respectively.

77,2018-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: UK’s Vodafone and Bharti Airtel may jointly negotiate a block sale of their combined 66.6% controlling stake to a third-party, postclosure of the Indus-Bharti Infratel merger, with a mix of deep-pocket global investors such as KKR, Providence, Brookfield and American Tower Corp (ATC) as potential buyers, some analysts said.

“We do not believe either Vodafone or Bharti Airtel are long-term holders of the stock and would not be surprised to see a ‘block sale’ of this combined controlling interest to another party, once approvals for the Indus-Bharti Infratel merger have been gained,” brokerage Sanford C Bernstein said in a note to clients seen by ET. The likes of “KKR, Providence, Brookfield or ATC might all be potential buyers of this stake,” the global brokerage said. Bernstein also said neither “Vodafone nor Bharti Airtel are subject to any lock-in periods”.

Vodafone declined to comment while Bharti Airtel did not reply to ET’s queries. Both the telecom companies need to beef up their balance sheets to take on Reliance Jio amid an ongoing brutal price war. Airtel has a net debt of over Rs 95,000 crore while the Vodafone-Idea Cellular combine are estimated to have a net debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore, even after recent cash infusions. Vodafone India is merging its operations with Idea.

Bharti Airtel’s shares fell 2.61%, closing at Rs 408.85 on BSE, while the Bharti Infratel scrip was down 3.19%, closing at Rs 315.50.

Naveen Kulkarni, telecom analyst at PhillipCapital, said: “If Bharti and Vodafone completely exit the tower business, the Indus-Infratel merged entity would become a truly independent tower company, commanding higher valuations”.

Another analyst at a global brokerage, who did not wish to be named, said the “equity valuation of the merged tower entity could easily jump to $18-20 billion from the present $14.6 billion, if Bharti and Vodafone fully exit the Indus-Infratel combined entity.”

Brokerage CLSA, which also sees Bharti Airtel and Vodafone lowering their stakes in the merged tower company, said their holdings in the combined tower company “will be a stock overhang.”

After a 1.1% fall on Wednesday when the merger was announced, the Bharti Infratel shares fell a further 3.2% to Rs 315.50 on BSE Thursday. The Sunil Mittal-led carrier Wednesday said it would engage with potential investors to consider selling a stake in the combined entity.

Bharti Airtel has already sold a 10% stake in Infratel to a private equity consortium of KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and had been in talks with them to sell more, but those talks are in cold storage currently.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone – equal shareholders in Indus – will jointly control the merged company to be called Indus Towers Ltd, with equal board representation. The merger conditions give Idea Cellular the option to either sell its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers for Rs 6,500 crore or receive new shares – equal to a 7.1% stake – in the combined tower company. Kumar Birla-led Idea has said in the past it will exit Indus, and analysts expect the loss-making carrier to cash out to spruce up its balance sheet ahead of its merger with Vodafone India. Private equity player Providence will hold a minimum 1.1% stake.

The actual size of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone’s stakes in the merged tower company will hinge on Idea’s decision. Rajiv Sharma, HSBC director and telecoms analyst, however, does not immediately see Vodafone and Bharti Airtel completely exiting the tower business, but expects them to retain a 25-30% combined holding in the merged tower company.

“We see both Bharti and Vodafone bringing down their (respective) shareholdings meaningfully, but not down to zero, post-closure of the Indus-Infratel merger, and would expect them to (jointly) hold 25-30% at least,” Sharma said in a note, a copy of which was reviewed by ET.

Any sharp reduction in equity ownership by Bharti and Vodafone in the merged tower company, he said, would translate in the future-listed Indus Towers being perceived as an independent firm in the medium term in line with global peers.

The estimated 66.6% Bharti-Vodafone combined ownership in the merged tower entity is based on the assumption that Idea and Providence – who own 11.15 % and 4.85% of Indus respectively – will cash out in the run-up to the merger."

74,2018-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Global rating agency Fitch on Thursday said the merger of Bharti Infratel with Indus Towers (Indus) reflects fierce price competition in the Indian telecom market. There is heightened pressure for consolidation on incumbents to sell assets to raise funds, Fitch added.

""We do not anticipate any change in Bharti Airtel's 'BBB-' rating, as the deconsolidation of 54 per cent-owned Bharti Infratel's $300 million EBITDA and $1 billion in net cash will be offset by cash dividends and greater liquid equity value in the merged tower entity,"" it said in its press release.

Bharti Infratel on Wednesday agreed to merge with Indus Towers, in a deal that creates the world’s No. 2 telecom tower company with an estimated equity value of $14.6 billion, Reuters reported.

Top Indian telecoms carrier Bharti Airtel, the majority owner of Bharti Infratel, will be the biggest shareholder in the combined company followed by Vodafone Group, the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

The rating agency notes that Bharti Airtel, which owns 23 per cent effective stake in Indus through Infratel, has also been affected by Jio's entry, albeit less severely than Vodafone and Idea. The telecom major on Tuesday reported a 78 per cent YoY fall in its March quarter net at Rs 83 crore.

Revenue slipped 10.48 per cent year-on-year to Rs 19,634.30 crore during the quarter under review. India ARPU (average revenue per user) for voice and data combined –- a key operational indicator –- also 26.60 per cent on year-on-year basis to Rs 116 during the quarter under review.

Fitch says Bharti Airtel's revenue and ebitda will likely rebound in FY19, driven by a likely improvement in Indian mobile ARPU as data usage and tariffs rise. ""However, Bharti will continue to have negative free cash flow (FCF) during FY19, as cash flow from operations will be insufficient to fund the higher capex of around $4 billion needed to support strong growth in data traffic and to compete against Jio.

""Beyond the short term, we expect price competition in the Indian telecom market to ease following the emergence of three large telcos - Bharti, Jio and the merged entity of Vodafone-Idea - which we estimate to have a combined revenue market share of 90 per cent. We expect industry revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digits in 2018, following a decline in 2017,"" Fitch says."

69,2018-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"by Andy Mukherjee

His business model has been upended, profitability lies in tatters and the regulatory environment has turned against him. But billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, who controls India’s largest mobile company, has just signaled a $14.6 billion intention to fight to the finish.

Bharti Airtel reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss this week in its Indian operations – its first in 15 years. Yet to write off Mittal as a loser in the great Indian data war of 2016-2020 may be a mistake.

For evidence, look no further than the timing of the merger announcement between Bharti Infratel Ltd. and Indus Towers Ltd. The deal, which will create India’s largest operator of cellular towers, was unveiled a day after Airtel’s financial results. (Infratel didn't fare much better, reporting a steeper-than-expected drop in tenancies amid a scramble by incumbent operators to sell out, close down or file for bankruptcy.)

Mittal is agreeing to share control equally with Vodafone Plc in the merged tower business despite having a higher equity stake. The telecom tycoon is making his intention clear: He wants to monetize his real estate to invest in the battle against Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.

If the expanded tower company is able to negotiate better rates with tenants, finding a buyer for, say, half of Airtel's stake could easily add $3 billion to Mittal's telecom war chest.


Bloomberg
Nothing else matters. Bharti Airtel’s wireless market share of 26 percent has it comfortably ahead of Jio at 15 percent. However, the problem is that Jio, backed by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, added almost 9 million subscribers in February, compared with little more than a 4 million gain for Bharti.

Every second person in the country who took a mobile broadband connection last quarter opted for Jio’s plans that offer unlimited voice calls and as much as 2 gigabytes of data per day. Before Jio’s September 2016 entry with an expensive $31 billion 4G network, data was a sideshow in India.

The business model used to be about charging customers for voice conversations – and collecting money from smaller operators for terminating calls on their networks. Ambani killed the first avenue by offering lifetime free calls, and the regulator choked off the second.

Jio’s stated goals of making Rs 350 ($5.20) a month from an average user – and charging at least Rs 50 per gigabyte of data – are red herrings to confuse competitors into thinking the price war will end relatively soon, as Elara Securities’ analyst Ravi Menon puts it. Mittal, struggling with average revenue per user of 116 rupees, isn’t falling for the ruse.

What Ambani really wants is market dominance, which Menon translates as a revenue market share of 40 to 45 percent by the end of 2019. To get there, Jio could relentlessly undercut on price.



Currently, only 20 percent of India’s mobile subscribers have broadband internet. But that could change if the early success of JioPhone -- a 4G-enabled feature phone that Ambani is effectively giving away -- is anything to go by. While the smartphone market in India is showing signs of saturation, JioPhone is being lapped up by bottom-of-the-pyramid customers excited to go online for the first time.

To withstand Ambani’s triple play of carriage, content and commerce, Mittal will need to offer customers more than free Netflix. Given a net debt to Ebitda of more than 3 times, capital infusion into the network would need to come from equity. That’s why the tower merger, which will allow Bharti to cash in by selling a stake, is a good first step. Listing the promising Africa mobile business is another opportunity.

It’s hard to say what the 2020 landscape may look like. Assuming Jio and Bharti are close rivals that each have a substantial revenue market share, the prognosis must be bleak for Vodafone and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla.

Currently ranked second and third by subscriber numbers, Vodafone’s India operations and Idea Cellular Ltd. are merging. Their strategy beyond marriage, however, is unclear. No wonder Idea’s shares have 12 sell ratings from analysts, versus six buy recommendations, while 22 analysts say Bharti is a buy, and only four advise offloading.

Mittal is at least telling Ambani not to expect a walkover. Maybe the other two will be more obliging."
75,2018-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: After taking a day’s breather, Indian equity benchmarks were back to winning ways on Thursday, as better results from banks and improving sentiment in IT stocks lifted the market mood.

Investors turned to short-covering on the last day of April derivatives contracts, while mixed global cues offered some hope.

Asian markets remained mixed as strong corporate earnings helped Wall Street calm concerns over the surge in the US bond yields. The 10-year US bond yield rose over 3 per cent on Wednesday, triggered by concerns of a surge in the supply of government debt.

“Market remain range bound during most part of the day due to F&O expiry but better results from banks and improving sentiment on IT stocks lifted the index. Continued outflow of foreign money and surging oil prices added pressure on rupee and inflation trajectory.

Underperforming the benchmark Sensex, broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed 0.02 per cent down and 0.25 per cent up, respectively.

YES Bank ended the day with a gain of over 8 per cent, buoyed by robust earnings for the March quarter. The lender reported a 29 per cent YoY rise in profit at Rs 1,179.40 crore, which was higher than Rs 1,065 crore estimated by analysts in an ETNow poll.

Oil prices remain on a record-breaking spree as crude clambers towards $80 a barrel-mark in a market edgy over US bailing on Iran nuclear deal, outages in Venezuela and uptick in demand. For India, the rupee’s fall to one-year low against the dollar will amplify the impact unless the Centre cuts excise duty.

The bulls failed to push the Nifty50 into the positive terrain even for once in Wednesday’s session. The tough resistance at the 10,630 level proved too hard to breach, and the index eventually settled the day at sub-10,600 level. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily chart, similar to a Hanging Man pattern, and formed lower highs and lower lows. Holding above the 10,500 level is the key for the Nifty50 to retain the recent bullish setup, experts said.

60,2018-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel will consider selling stake in the combined company that will emerge after the long-anticipated merger of Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel.

The new entity, with a valuation of $14.6 billion, will be the world’s second-largest telecom tower company after China Tower, and will continue to be listed on Indian stock exchanges, the two firms said in a joint announcement on Wednesday. The merger is expected to close by March 31, 2019.

ET had reported the deal details and its expected announcement in its April 25 edition. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone — equal shareholders in Indus — will jointly control the merged company, to be called Indus Towers Ltd, with equal board representation.

Idea Cellular, which holds 11.15% in Indus, has the option to get 7.1% stake in the new entity or sell out for Rs 6,500 crore. Idea had earlier said it will exit the tower unit.





MERGER TO LET COS MONETISE STAKES
Depending on the option selected by Idea, Bharti Airtel will own either 37.2% or 33.8% in the combined entity, and Vodafone will hold 29.4% or 26.7%. Private equity major KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will together hold 6%.

Providence will retain a minimum 1.1% or opt to retain its full stake in the combined company, which will be 3.1%. Remaining shareholding will be in hands of the public. “It is intended that any cash consideration paid to Idea Group and/or Providence be financed through new debt facilities and the existing cash resources (Rs 6,800 crore) of Bharti Infratel,” the companies said.

The combined entity will have revenues of Rs 25,360.4 crore, with Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of Rs 10,901.4 crore, net profit of over Rs 4,000 crore and net debt of nearly Rs 5,600 crore. In a separate statement, Bharti Airtel said its board had decided to engage with potential investors for evaluating a strategic sale after the completion of the merger. 




The company had earlier considered both an offer for sale of significant stake in Bharti Infratel from a consortium of leading private equity investors as well as a proposal for merger of Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel.

“The board after due deliberations approved the proposal for merger,” said the company. The Airtel stock ended 3.4% higher at Rs 419.80, also boosted by hopes that its loss for India business and 78% fall in consolidated net profit in the fiscal fourth quarter was the bottom, and financials should improve from here on, said market experts.

Shares of Bharti Infratel, though, fell 1.1% to Rs 325.90. “The merger was in the offing. Stock of Infratel fell after news was confirmed as the potential gains had been priced in,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive V-P (markets & corporate affairs), IIFL. Analysts said the merger will enable the telcos to monetise their stakes in the tower company at a time when all of them are staring at losses in India operations. At the same time, it will enable them to retain some control over tower networks, which are critical to their operations.

“We wouldn’t be surprised if Bharti equalises the shareholding (with Vodafone) quickly by selling (the) surplus 8% stake,” Credit Suisse said in a note. “We continue to believe that cash requirements at the telecom business will force telcos to trim their stake in BHIN (Bharti Infratel) over time.”


SAVINGS FOR MERGED CO
Analysts added that the merger will help the combined entity save over Rs 500 crore on account of dividend distribution tax annually, besides some Rs 50-60 crore in operational synergies. Indus pays tax on dividend to shareholders, including Infratel, which in turn, also pays tax on dividend it pays out. “The merger will eliminate this element of double taxation,” said an analyst at a foreign brokerage.

The combined company is expected to distribute any excess cash flow to shareholders through dividend or share buyback, the companies said, adding that the deal needs to be cleared by Competition Commission of India, stock markets regulator, National Company Law Tribunal and the telecom department. Indus Towers is currently jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42%), Vodafone Group (42%), Aditya Birla’s Idea Group (11.15%) and PE player Providence (4.85%). Bharti Airtel owns 53.5% in Infratel, which also has PE funds KKR and CPPIB as shareholders with some 10% stake.

According to the terms of the deal, Indus shareholders will get 1,565 shares of Bharti Infratel for each share held, valuing the privately held tower market leader at Rs 71,500 crore ($10.8 billion). Bharti Infratel had a market cap of around Rs 60,279 crore at close of trade on Wednesday.

Vodafone will be issued 783.1 million new shares in the combined company in exchange for its 42% shareholding in Indus Towers, valuing its stake at some $4.3 billion, calculated at a 5% discount to the agreed valuation. “…any decision to sell or retain the Bharti Infratel shares following closing….would be taken in light of circumstances prevailing and investment considerations at the same time,” said the British company. Vodafone has previously said it would look at selling its stake in Indus and is open to using the money to strengthen the JV with Idea, which is close to being completed.

IDEA’S OPTIONS
Idea’s option of selling out completely would come at a 10% discount to the valuation of the merged company. Alternatively, it can choose to hold a minority stake of 7.1% in the combine, also calculated at a 5% discount to the agreed valuation. Shares in Idea, which didn’t comment on Wednesday on ET’s queries on the option it plans to exercise, ended the day 0.4% higher at Rs 71.35.

“Overall, the Indus-Infratel merger is a step in the right direction, since only 2-3 tower formations are required to serve 3-4 telecom operators left in India now. One can safely expect Idea to cash out fully from Indus as it needs money ahead of its merger with Vodafone India to strengthen both balance sheet and network,” said tower sector veteran and former Viom Networks CEO Syed Safawi.

Credit Suisse said the deal was at a 40% discount to the last tower M&A deal, in which American Tower Corp in November 2017 said it would be buy Vodafone and Idea’s captive 20,000 towers for Rs 7,800 crore, but with better terms. The new board of Bharti Infratel will comprise 11 directors, of whom three each will be appointed by Airtel and Vodafone, one will be appointed by KKR-CPPIB and four — including the chairman — will be independent."
82,2018-04-27,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Telecom major Bharti Airtel may face a rating downgrade in next 6-12 months if intense competition remains in the market and decreases its margins, Moody's Investors Service saidwhile affirming Baa3 ratings with negative outlook to the company.

""The ratings are likely to be downgraded within the next 6-12 months if heightened competition persists in its Indian wireless business, such that consolidated EBITDA or margins deteriorate further from current levels,"" Moody's said in a statement.

Moody's Investors Service has affirmed Bharti Airtel (Bharti) Baa3 issuer rating and senior unsecured debt ratings, as well as the Baa3 ratings on the senior unsecured notes issued by Bharti AirtelInternational (Netherlands) B.V., which are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Bharti.

""The outlook on the ratings is negative,"" the report said.

Credit ratings reflect an organisation's ability to repay debt.

The Baa3 rating means the entity is medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and has an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.

""The affirmation of Bharti's Baa3 rating and negative outlook recognises that the company's leverage metrics remain elevated as profitability continues to be under pressure,"" Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer, Annalisa Di Chiara said.

The negative outlook reflects the company's high leverage levels with adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 3.8 times on a consolidated basis at year-end March 2018.

The consolidated net debt of Airtel increased to Rs 95,228 crore at the end of March 2018 from Rs 91,714 crore at the end of December 2017.

The country's largest mobile operator Bharti Airtel reported its lowest quarterly consolidated net profit in at least 14 years, as competition with free voice calls and dirt-cheap data tariffs from new entrant Reliance Jio ate into its margins.

Airtel posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 82.9 crore (or 21 paisa per share) in January-March quarter of 2017-18 fiscal as compared to Rs 373.4 crore (or 93 paisa a share) in the same period of the previous fiscal.

Airtel's total revenue fell by 10.5 per cent to Rs 19,634 crore in the fourth quarter of 2017-18.

For the full fiscal year that ended in March 2018, Airtel's net profit came in at Rs 1,099 crore, over 71 per cent lower than Rs 3,800 crore logged in FY 2016-17.

""To that end, we believe the recently announced merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers provides a path for significant debt reduction with the possibility of an eventual sale of its stake in a larger business over the next 12-15 months,"" Di Chiara said.

Bharti is expected to have a 33.8-37.2 per cent stake in Indus Towers following the merger, Moody'ssaid.

""Based on the company's announcement, the equity value of the combined entity is estimated at USD 14.6 billion, making Bharti's stake worth around USD 4.9-5.4 billion, and thus providing significant potential for debt reduction within the next 12-15 months,"" the report said.

Moody's expect that with improvement in financial position of the African operations, Bharti will consider options to monetise a part of its stake in that operation as it focuses on measures to reduce consolidated leverage."

India, China Bid to Reset Ties, 2 Koreas Meet
The leaders of India and China are set to make their boldest attempt yet at rapprochement in talks this week just months after a dispute over a stretch of their high-altitude Himalayan border rekindled fears of war. Indian officials told Reuters that there was no agenda and the two would likely address “misunderstandings” that had festered for years and escalated into a 73-day military face-off last year. Chinese state television said in a commentary that often, more gets done at informal meetings, when people can speak their minds. Meanwhile, smiling and holding hands, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met at the heavily fortified demilitarised zone between the countries on Friday in the first summit for the two Koreas in over a decade.

On Thursday, petrol was being sold for Rs 74.63 per litre, and diesel for Rs 65.93 per litre in Delhi. State-run oil companies did not change prices of petrol and diesel on Wednesday and Thursday. In global markets, Brent crude continues to trade under $73.74 per barrel while WTI crude was at $68.08 per barrel today.


The Cost of Congestion
Traffic congestion during peak hours in four major cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata — costs the economy Rs 1.47 lakh crore annually, according to a study conducted by global consultancy firm. The peak hours for this survey were 7-9 am and 6-8 pm during which commuters spent one-and-a-half times longer to travel a given distance as compared to non-peak hours, said the report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The study across the four cities in January has found Kolkata to be the worst, followed by Bengaluru.


Gold Turns Weak, Silver Down
Gold prices turned weak at the bullion market yesterday on slackening demand from jewellers and retailers even as the metal strengthened overseas.

Four of six high-profile US tech companies were among the top 10 employers for approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in fiscal 2017, National Foundation for American Policy said in its latest report on work visa popular among Indian IT workers.

84,2018-04-28,Bharti Infratel,"Idea Cellular posted a lower-than-expected net loss in the fiscal fourth quarter, helped by lower costs and a higher other income, but the continuing price war and cut in interconnect and international termination rates dragged the telco to its sixth straight quarter in the red.

For the January-March quarter, the Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned telco’s net loss widened to Rs 930.6 crore from Rs325.6 crore a year ago but narrowed from Rs 1285.6 crore in previous quarter. The operator however fared better than what the markets had predicted, with an ET poll estimating a net loss of Rs 1449 crore. 

Revenue for the third-largest telco slumped 24.5% on year and 5.7%% sequentially to Rs 6,137.3 crore, Idea said in a statement Saturday. Idea, which ended the fiscal fourth quarter with 194.5 million users, added six million users on a net basis. 

Idea’s loss comes a few days after market leader Bharti Airtel reported its first loss in 15 years for its India business, and a day after new entrant Reliance Jio increased its sequential net profit by 1.2% to Rs510 crore.

""The super aggressive price plans including the deep discounted unlimited voice bundled data plans, offered by most of the incumbent operators to retain existing subscribers against abysmally low-priced plans offered by new 4G operator, exploded the voice and data volume growth multi-folds,"" the telco said. 

It added that the telecom regulator’s move to cut interconnect usage charges and international termination rates, further hurt existing operators and forced atleast five sub-scale -operators to exit or consolidate.

“However, these trends are not reflective of the emerging long term opportunities offered by the sector,” which include industry consolidation into three main players, multi SIM users consolidating their usage to a single operator and subscribers increasing their broadband usage, with nearly 300-400 million Indians, primarily in the rural hinterland, yet to adopt mobile telephony services. 

Idea is one of the telcos involved in consolidation, merging its operations with Vodafone India, which is in the final leg of regulatory approvals and expected to be closed by June 30, though some expect it in May.

But while the just-ended quarter was weak, it was better than expected.

Idea’s average revenue per user (ARPU) - a key industry parameter - dropped to Rs 105 from Rs 114 in the quarter ended December. In comparison, that of Bharti Airtel for the fourth quarter was Rs 116, its lowest ever, and Jio's was at Rs 137.1.

But the lower voice and data rates helped push average voice usage to 577 minutes from 509 minutes, and average data consumption to over 818 million MB from 571 million MB. Comparitively, Jio recorded 716 minutes per user per month on average voice usage and 9.7 GB per user per month on data usage, while the same for Airtel was 670 minutes per user and 6.6 GB respectively.

But Idea’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margins expanded to 23.6% from 18.8% in the previous quarter, helped by lower costs. Operating expected fell to Rs4,690.1 crore from Rs5,286.4 crore in the fiscal third quarter.


Jio’s operating margin was at 37.8% while that for Airtel’s India mobile business was 35.8%.

Idea’s bottomline was helped by other income of Rs31.6 crore, compared with Rs2.1 crore a year ago.

The overall capex spend for the year was for the Birla owned telco was Rs. 7000 crore, majority of which was utilised for 4G expansion. 

The telco in its statement on Saturday mentioned that the recent equity raise of Rs. 6750 crore has reduced Idea’s net-debt and as a result Vodafone net-debt contribution to the merged entity will also be reduced by a commensurate amount.

The operator also said that it expects to get Rs 4000 crore , from the sale of its standalone towers to American Tower Corp (ATC) by the first half of this calendar year, once the necessary FDI approvals are in place. 

The merger of Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel , will also give Idea the option to either sell its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers for Rs 6,500 crore cash or receive new shares – equal to 7.1% stake – in the combined company. 

"" Idea expects to benefit from faster than anticipated consolidation of industry and merged entity is expected to emerge as the largest Indian mobile service providers for both voice and broadband services across 2G, 3G and 4G platforms, "" said the operator."

85,2018-04-30,Bharti Infratel,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a neutral call on Bharti Infratel Ltd. with a target price of Rs 346.. The current market price of Bharti Infratel Ltd. is Rs 319.8 Time period given by the analyst is a year when Bharti Infratel Ltd. price can reach defined target. 

 Bharti Infratel Ltd., incorporated in the year 2006, is a large-cap company with a market cap of Rs 59529.64 crore operating in Infrastructure sector. 


Investment rationale by Motilal Oswal: We have built in zero tenancy growth in FY19 considering the downward pressure that could come from tenancy exits by Vodafone-Idea and smaller players. We maintain our DCF-based target price to Rs 346, implying EV/tenancy of Rs 2.7 m and EV/tower of Rs 6.1 m on FY20E. In our view, Indus Towers' acquisition could prove beneficial due to (a) lower valuation (a 14% discount to Bharti Infratel) and (b) improvement in capital structure and RoCE due to utilisation of surplus cash for Idea and Providence stake purchase. However, given the rich valuation of 9.4x EV/EBITDA, which builds in 7% EBITDA cut in FY19 (with downward bias), and growth headwinds for the next 4-6 quarters, we remain cautious. Maintain Neutral."
0,2018-05-01,Bharti Infratel,"American Tower Corporation (ATC) has cut its outlook for 2018 hit by the impact of consolidation in Indian telecom market and bankruptcy in mobile phone operator Aircel. 

The tower company, which has roughly 70,000 towers in India, said that it has reduced the midpoint of its full year 2018 outlook for property revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA by $60 million, $45 million and $35 million respectively. 

""These reductions are primarily attributable to accelerated Indian carrier consolidation-driven churn as a result of the bankruptcy of Aircel, which the company anticipates will more than offset increased expectations for Organic Tenant Billings Growth in its U.S., Latin America and EMEA segments, "" said the company in statement on its website Tuesday. 

ATC said that it expects the impact of this consolidation to last ""for several years and anticipates that churn rates in India will return to lower levels once the consolidation process is complete"".

The Indian telecom industry, which even some years ago was a nine-10 player market, is shrinking rapidly to become a three player one, after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) in 2016,which led to brutal price wars. While Reliance Communications (Rcom) has shut down its wireless division, Tata Teleservices (TTSL) and Telenor India are being picked up by market leader Bharti Airtel. Aircel has declared bankruptcy while Idea Cellular and Vodafone India are merging their operations. 

This consolidation has severely hit the tower industries including Bharti Infratel, Indus Towers and ATC, who are the three main players and have approximately 85 per cent total towers in India. The consolidation amongst the operators is expected to hit them at least for the next 18-24 months, as tenancies ratios reduce. 

The tenancy ratio refers to the number of operators (tenants) who have put up their antennae and infrastructure on the towers . ATC has moved Delhi High Court to recover its dues from Aircel. 

Keeping in mind the impact of India operations, ATC estimates in 2018, property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO in 2018 will be approximately $190 million, $115 million and $90 million, respectively, inclusive of an expected reduction in pass-through revenue of approximately $70 million. 

For the three months to March, ATC, saw consolidation in the telecom market reduce its overall property revenue by $20 million, earnings before interest , depreciation and amortisation (EBIDTA) by $14 million and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) by $11 million. 

ATC said it spent $673 million in Q1 on acquisitions of almost 10,600 sites, of which 10,200 in India, which was part of an earlier announced Vodafone deal. 

It has paid around Rs 3,850 crores to buy 10,200 towers from Vodafone India, completing the first tranche of a deal where the US company will also pick up Idea Cellular’s towers for Rs 4,000 crore. The Idea deal is expected to be closed in the second quarter of this year said the tower company. 

Buyout of Vodafone and Idea’s captive towers would boost ATC’s India towers portfolio to nearly 80,000, taking it closer to Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel with 1,23,00 and 91,000 towers, respectively. 

In an interview to ET last month , Amit Sharma, president of ATCAsia has said that 2018 will be a soft year for the tower sector in the country."
1,2018-05-02,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: India’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market Index is likely to fall 20 basis points as a result of inclusion of China A-shares, which would entail total outflows of around $540 million by passive funds, said Morgan Stanley in a report.

The MSCI will announce the results of its semi-annual index review on the morning of May 15 and the changes will be effective from June 1.

“Qualified A-share stocks will be included in the MSCI EM index starting in May with an inclusion factor of 2.5% applied to their free-float market cap. By August 2018, the inclusion factor will be increased to 5%... Subsequently, ceteris paribus, India’s weight in EM would likely fall by approximately 20bp (basis points) by August, implying total outflows of around US$540mn (million) by passive funds,” said Morgan Stanley’s Sheela Rathi and Ridham Desai in a report.

In June 2017, MSCI had announced that beginning June 2018, China A-shares will be included in MSCI EM and MSCI ACWI index. India’s weightage in MSCI EM index is 8.5% currently.

In specific stock inclusions, the firm said Pidilite Industries and Power Grid Corporation of India are high-conviction stocks that can be included in the MSCI India index. UltraTech Cement and Container Corporation of India could see an increase in their weightage in the index, which could lead to potential inflows of $49 million and $40 million respectively.

Avenue Supermarts, Future Retail, HDFC Standard Life Insurance and InterGlobe Aviation are also potential candidates for inclusion in the index but the conviction for addition of these stocks is less due to lower free float market capitalisation, said Morgan Stanley.

Tata Motors Differential Voting Rights and Vakrangee could be excluded from the index, said Morgan Stanley.

Sectoral classification changes are also likely. MSCI had announced in November 2017 that the telecommunication services sector will be broadened and renamed as communication services to include companies that facilitate communication and offer related content and information through various media.

Apart from the classification of telecoms sector stocks Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel into the communications sector, media stocks like Zee Entertainment would be reclassified into the MSCI India Communications sector from the consumer discretionary sector currently, the report stated."
2,2018-05-02,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta said the combined tower company that will emerge after the merger with Indus Towers will be more attractive structurally for deep-pocketed global private equity (PE) firms to buy into as it will not have a single majority shareholder.

“From a PE perspective, the structure of the proposed Infratel-Indus merged entity is better as there are two big shareholders (read: Airtel and Vodafone), but nobody has a majority stake,” Gupta said on Wednesday on an analyst call on the recently announced mega towers sector merger.

Last week, Bharti Airtel and UK’s Vodafone announced plans to jointly control the future merged tower entity, to be called Indus Towers, as equal shareholders with equal board representation. The merger is expected to close by March next year.

Gupta’s optimism about the Infratel-Indus combined entity’s ownership structure being attractive to global PE investors comes at a time when analysts expect the valuation of the combined tower entity to go up several notches if Airtel and Vodafone exit, especially since the tower company will then be perceived as an independent company.

Some brokerages such as Sanford C. Bernstein expect Bharti and Vodafone to sell their combined stakes in the Infratel-Indus merged entity to a third party, which could be deep-pocket global investors such as KKR, Providence, Brookfield and American Tower Corp.

Gupta said neither Airtel nor Vodafone would be shackled by any lock-in periods, in that, they would be free to sell their respective stakes in the Infratel-Indus combined entity, post-merger closure. However, he said that for Vodafone to maintain its equal rights and equal shareholder status in the combined tower company, “its stake could not fall below a certain percentage (in relation to Bharti Airtel)”, which he did not disclose.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Vodafone and Airtel will be equal shareholders of the Infratel-Indus combined entity, even though the Sunil Mittal-led telco will hold a larger stake in the JV. Airtel will own either 37.2% or 33.8% in the combined tower entity, while Vodafone either 29.4% or 26.7%, depending on whether Kumar Birla-led Idea Cellular sells its 11.15% stake in Indus for Rs 6,500 crore cash or retains a 7.1% stake.

In this context, Gupta said “even if Idea Cellular cashes out, it will continue to enjoy the benefits of the most-favoured nation or `MFN’ clause with the Infratel-Indus merged entity”. By virtue of the MFN clause, “Idea will be offered the same discounts offered to any other preferred customer by the merged tower entity in future,” he said.

Idea is widely expected to exit the tower company as it needs the Rs 6,500 crore cash to lower the debt of the new entity to be formed after its merger with Vodafone India. Idea though hasn’t officially disclosed its plans.

To analyst queries, Gupta said post-closure of the merger, it would be for “the newly constituted board of the Bharti Infratel-Indus merged entity to take any potential calls on share buy-backs from existing shareholders,” asserting that “it is premature” to speculate on such matters before closure of the merger."

17,2018-05-04,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel plans to raise as much as $1.5 billion by diluting about a fourth of its stake when it lists the holding company for Africa operations, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV (BAIN BV), in early 2019, said people with knowledge of the matter. 

The money will help bolster the telco’s efforts to stay competitive in the Indian market, where Bharti has just declared its first quarterly loss in contrast with profits in Africa. Work on the listing has picked up pace and is slated for early next year on the London Stock Exchange, leveraging financial improvements in the past few quarters.

Africa operations have started to make profits about seven years after the Indian telco entered the continent in 2010. “About 25% stake will be diluted… for roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion,” said one of the people aware of details. “Listing could be anytime early 2019.” At the upper end, this would mean a valuation of $6 billion for the holding company. Bharti Airtel declined to comment. The stock ended 0.9% lower at Rs 404.40 on the BSE on Thursday. 

The Netherlands-based wholly-owned unit of Bharti Airtel is the holding company of telecom operations in 14 African markets — Nigeria, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Madagascar, Niger, Kenya, Malawi, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Rwanda.




The holding company’s board authorised the management to initiate non-binding exploratory discussions in mid-February with various banks or intermediaries to evaluate the feasibility of listing its shares.

Airtel’s Africa operations completed their first full year of profitability in March this year.

Net profit amounted to Rs 1,827 crore on revenue of Rs 20,156 crore, marking a turnaround from previous years when losses mounted every quarter, dragging down consolidated numbers and casting a doubt on Bharti’s strategy of expanding into the continent.


ROLE REVERSAL 
The situation has reversed, with the India operations reporting its first loss in 15 years — RS 652 crore in the January-March quarter — dragged down by the continuing price war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm. It managed to stave off a loss at the consolidated level thanks to its Africa operations, which recorded a quarterly profit of Rs 698.7 crore, compared with Rs 26.3 crore a year ago. Airtel posted a consolidated profit of Rs 83 crore, down 78% on year. “Looks like Africa growth is sustainable, overall (financial) climate has also improved, commodities have bounced back and currencies have stabilised,” a senior industry executive said.

He added that Africa is likely to ensure Airtel remains profitable at the consolidated level going forward as well amid fears that the tariff war in India is set to continue.

Analysts said a global listing for the holding company will help Airtel get better value for its Africa operations in contrast with India, where free voice and cheap data tariffs have eroded profits and driven down average revenue per user for most carriers. The fundraising will provide Airtel with “significant ammunition” to fight price wars in India, one of them said.

The listing could also help Bharti Airtel deleverage its balance sheet, analysts said. Overall debt was Rs 95,000 crore at the end of March.


‘SAME STRATEGY’ 
“Post listing, Airtel could adopt the same strategy that it has for Bharti Infratel — progressively reducing the stake in the business and investing in the core, India mobile business, which we believe has significant growth potential but will need high network investments in the short term,” said analysts at BNP Paribas in a note to clients.

Bharti Airtel has been exploring various avenues to raise funds to strengthen its balance sheet as it takes on competition in India and also invest in networks.

The company has been steadily diluting stakes in Bharti Infratel to raise funds and recently announced the tower unit’s merger with Indus Towers. It also plans to sell stakes in the merged entity after the deal is closed, which is expected by March 2019.

Some brokerages such as Sanford C Bernstein expect Bharti and Vodafone to sell their combined stakes in the Infratel-Indus merged entity to global investors such as KKR, Providence, Brookfield and American Tower Corp.

“This listing would be a major positive for Bharti Airtel as it would not only help to unlock value, but would also open up multiple avenues for financing growth in Bharti’s Africa operations,” Phillip Capital said in a note to clients. “Apart from this, it would allow Bharti to have options to monetise operations, which would help bring down its overall debt.”"

19,2018-05-05,Bharti Infratel,"Disruptive entry of Reliance Jio in India's telecom sector has forced many players to close down, sell out or merge as it battered them with ultra-low prices. Its relentless race to the top is fuelled by deep pockets of parent Reliance Industries. Several regulatory changes too have given it an upper hand. 

Yet, Airtel—the besieged telecom leader of India challenged by Jio—shows no signs of giving in. It is ready for a long price war Jio is waging to gain new and poach old subscribers. Experts have said Airtel is unlikely to be toppled from its top spot by Jio. 

In March, global financial major Goldman Sachs said Airtel was likely to remain the market leader due to its strong balance sheet and wide spectrum footprint. Goldman had said Airtel could even sell non-core assets to stay competitive if the price war linger on. Since it does not need to buy or renew airwaves till 2022, it can afford to spend on expansion of its 4G network.

That's what Airtel plans to do. Since Jio's price war is fuelled by deep pockets of parent Reliance Industries, Airtel too is preparing to pour money into business. 

Airtel plans to raise as much as $1.5 billion by diluting about a fourth of its stake when it lists the holding company for Africa operations, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV in early 2019, according to an ET report. The money will help bolster the telco’s efforts to stay competitive in the Indian market, where Bharti has just declared its first quarterly loss in contrast with profits in Africa. Africa operations have started to make profits about seven years after the Indian telco entered the continent in 2010.

The Africa move shows that Sunil Mittal, Chairman of Bharti Enterprises, the holding company of Airtel, is in no mood to go down for want of money. 

“Post listing, Airtel could adopt the same strategy that it has for Bharti Infratel — progressively reducing the stake in the business and investing in the core, India mobile business, which we believe has significant growth potential but will need high network investments in the short term,” said analysts at BNP Paribas in a note to clients. The company has been steadily diluting stakes in Bharti Infratel to raise funds and recently announced the tower unit’s merger with Indus Towers. It also plans to sell stakes in the merged entity after the deal is closed, which is expected by March 2019.

Recently, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said Jio intended to keep its tariffs at a discount to peers, and it didn't see the company in a rush to raise average revenue per user as its primary focus remained on subscriber additions. By raising money for its core mobile business in India, Airtel seems to have anticipated the Jio strategy and is getting ready to counter it."

21,2018-05-07,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are likely to invest Rs 3,500 crore in operations as capital expenditure for 2018-19 as they continue to operate on 'business-as-usual' mode till their merger happens before the fiscal-end, sources said. 

The two companies, last month, announced a merger deal that will create a USD 14.6 billion firm with world's second-largest number of mobile masts. The merged entity will have, in its fold, more than 1,63,000 towers across India - largest after China Tower. 

The transaction is subject to regulatory and other approvals which the two companies will now pursue, starting with Competition Commission of India (CCI) and thereafter Sebi, NCLT and Department of Telecom (FDI approval). The companies have said the deal is expected to close before the end of 2018-19. 

A source privy to the development said the annual financial planning continues on course for both the companies as it is 'business-as-usual', and that Infratel's capex is expected to be in the ballpark range of Rs 1,200 crore in 2018-19. 

Similarly, Indus Towers - where Infratel holds 42 per cent stake - is likely to infuse roughly Rs 2,300-2,500 crore as capex this year, said the official who did not wish to be named. 

Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42 per cent holding), Vodafone (42 per cent), Idea Group (11.15 per cent) and Providence (4.85 per cent). 

The amount of investment is similar to last year's levels and will go into ""new towers, tenancies and replacement capital"", the official said adding that the investments are being funded from internal accruals of the two tower firms. 

A Bharti spokesperson declined to comment on a detailed e-mailed query sent to the company. Indus Towers did not wish to comment. 

""The capex amount will also be used for replacement of batteries, DG (diesel generators), power equipment...As the tenancies increase, the two companies will continue to increase their capacities of mobile towers ahead of their proposed merger,"" said the source. 

Last month, the two entities announced that, ""Indus Towers will be merged with and into Bharti Infratel through a scheme of arrangement."" The merged entity, which will be called Indus Towers, will remain listed. 

Bharti Airtel, which owns 53.5 per cent in Bharti Infratel, will get 33.8-37.2 per cent stake in the combined entity. Its final shareholding depends on what Aditya Birla Group's Idea and Providence do with their minority shareholding in Indus Towers. 

Vodafone India will get between 26.7 per cent and 29.4 per cent of the Indus-Bharti Infratel combine. 

The merger will help unlock value for the companies which are locked in a tariff war unleashed by newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm that has hurt earnings and triggered consolidation in the sector. Vodafone and Idea are already in the final stages to merge their mobile operations. 

Airtel had separately also stated last month that it plans to engage with potential investors to evaluate a stake sale in the combined tower company, which will have an equity value of Rs 96,500 crore (USD 14.5 billion). 

Under the mega tower deal, Idea has the option to sell its 11.15 per cent stake in Indus for cash at the merger ratio that values the stake at Rs 6,500 crore (USD 1 billion). Under the transaction, Infratel agreed to pay 1,565 of its own shares for each Indus Towers share. 

Vodafone India will receive 783.1 million shares in the combined company, valuing the UK-based firm's stake at Rs 28,400 crore (USD 4.3 billion). 

If Idea decides to sell all its stake and Providence sells 3.35 per cent of its 4.85 per cent shareholding, the new entity will be 37.2 per cent owned by Airtel and 29.4 per cent by Vodafone Group, while 1.1 per cent will be with Providence and the rest by public shareholders. 

In case Idea and Providence decide to continue to stay invested, Airtel would have a shareholding of 33.8 per cent in the combined entity. Vodafone, in such a scenario, would have 26.7 per cent while Idea Group would get 7.1 per cent and Providence would have 3.1 per cent holding. The remaining 29.3 per cent would be with public."

Bharti Airtel is looking to pare $4.6 billion from its net borrowings over the next three years by listing its African unit and potentially selling some stake in its tower business, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, in a bid to safeguard its investment grade ratings.

India’s top wireless operator plans to raise as much as $1.5 billion by listing a quarter of equity in its Africa unit by early 2019 in either London or South Africa, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The parent will also look to sell part of its stake in the $14.6 billion tower giant after Bharti Infratel Ltd. merges with Indus Towers Ltd.

The twin deals will help the billionaire Sunil Mittal-controlled carrier improve its balance sheet after net debt rose almost 45 percent to $14.6 billion over four years as the company borrowed to buy spectrum and defend its position against disruptive upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. The build-up, which came with an eight-quarter-long stretch of earnings declines, has put Bharti Airtel at risk of a downgrade to junk at both Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings.

“We see a high likelihood that Bharti can avoid becoming a fallen angel,” Anthony Leung, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. wrote in a report dated May 7. “We expect a majority, if not all, of Bharti’s tower business to be sold in a year’s time, which will meet the timeline target imposed by Moody’s to keep the credit at Baa3,” which is the lowest investment grade rating.


Bloomberg
Bankers for the listing of Bharti Airtel’s Africa unit will be appointed by September, according to the person. The unit will house about $2.3 billion of debt, pushing its enterprise value to $8.3 billion, the person said.

A Bharti Airtel spokesman declined to comment.

The pressure to provide 4G services across India and expand broadband before Jio roils this segment too, will imply capital spending of about 240 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) in the year to March 2019, the person said. The company invested 250 billion rupees last fiscal.


Ratings Concern
S&P Global Ratings put a negative outlook on Bharti Airtel’s BBB- rating on May 3 after “cut-throat pricing” led to weaker-than-expected earnings and given the need for high capital spending. There’s “a one-in-three possibility” of a ratings downgrade in the next 18 months if the financials don’t improve as expected “or if deleveraging does not materialize,” S&P said in a statement.

Moody’s affirmed the company’s Baa3 rating with a negative outlook on April 26, saying “demonstrated progress” toward debt reduction was necessary to maintain the investment grade.

Equity investors too are feeling the heat. Bharti Airtel’s shares have plunged 23.7 percent this year, compared with a 3.6 percent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex.


Bloomberg
The company’s continuing asset monetization push will allay some of these concerns. Bharti Airtel will engage with investors to evaluate a strategic stake sale once the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus is complete, according to an April 25 filing. It will own up to 37.2 percent in the new entity that will control more than 163,000 towers across India.

It sold about 8,300 towers in seven African countries for about $1.7 billion in 2015 and followed with the sale of its Tanzanian tower business for $179 million a year later. In 2016, Bharti Airtel also sold its Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone units.

India’s top carrier raised $2 billion through the sale of its African tower assets and $1 billion from the sale of its Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone businesses, the person said. Bharti Airtel in 2010 acquired the African assets of Kuwait’s Mobile Telecommunications Co., also known as Zain, for an enterprise valuation of $10.7 billion."

33,2018-05-09,Bharti Infratel,"The Thursday’s session saw benchmark indices advancing a bit, as Nifty ended the day gaining 23.90 points or 0.22 per cent despite making a tepid start. Bulk of the gains came in the second half of the session even as trading remained dominated with highly stock-specific activities.

However, despite logging modest gains, the Nifty still remains bit away from the immediate past high of 10,785.

As we step into Thursday’s trade, we expect a quiet start to the day. If there are no overnight surprises, Nifty may inch higher and attempt to test the 10,785-mark. However, this level continues to act as immediate resistance level, which is important enough to push stocks into some consolidation. The levels of 10,785 and 10,830 will act as immediate resistance area for the Markets. Supports are expected to come in at 10,710 and 10,660 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 65.0525. RSI shows bearish divergence against the price, as it did not mark a 14-period high while the Nifty ended on a 14-year high on the closing basis. No significant formations were seen on the candles.



Having a look at the pattern analysis, it becomes evident that the brief consolidation we witnessed after testing immediate past high level of 10,785 has in fact lent some strength to the market. Instead of facing an outright throwback and testing the breakout levels, Nifty has chosen to consolidate in a given range. We believe modest upmoves will continue in the market. Having said that, with Nifty still not able to move past the 10,785-mark, this level is supposed to be regarded as important resistance level for the market.

There are possibilities that the Nifty might show an upmove and attempt to test those levels. However, it still remains vulnerable to be pushed into consolidation once again from those levels. Fresh sustainable upmove shall occur only after Nifty moves past the 10,785-mark comprehensively.

STOCKS TO WATCH: Top stocks include ARVIND, Jindal Steel and Power, Rain Industries, Bharti Infratel, Kohinoor Foods, Oil India, Take Solutions, MCX and Gateway Drishtiparks.

34,2018-05-10,Bharti Infratel,"The upcoming Indus-Bharti Infratel merged entity will benefit from right of first refusal (RoFR) arrangements with key customers to protect its combined operations from tenancy losses and potential excess capacity risks in the tower industry caused by rapid carrier consolidation.

Indus Towers will enjoy a RoFR for any fresh tenancy roll-out from both Bharti Airtel and the future Idea-Vodafone India combined entity,” a person with direct knowledge told ET.

This RoFR arrangement, he said, would “continue after closure of Indus’s merger with Bharti Infratel”.

Bharti Infratel, in turn, has an RoFR with parent Bharti Airtel for new tenancy roll-out, which will further help it offset business risks triggered by excess capacity in the tower industry in the immediate term, asecond person aware said.

Analysts said these RoFRs would be particularly handy for the two merging telecom tower companies to hold on to tenancies, going forward, especially since Bharti Infratel is estimated to lose nearly 25,000-odd tenancies in the immediate term after the Idea-Vodafone India merger that is likely to close shortly.

“Tower industry excess capacity amid consolidation in the telecom industry will have negligible impact on Bharti Infratel and Indus’ performance from here on since Bharti Infratel has a RoFR for new tenancy rollouts by Airtel, while Indus enjoys RoFRs with both Airtel and the future Idea-Vodafone combine for fresh tenancy rollouts,” Sanjesh Jain, telecoms research analyst at ICICI Securities told ET.

The ROFRs, he said, would enable these tower companies to “protect tenancies by matching prices” even after their merger. At press time, Bharti Infratel, Indus, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea did not reply to ET’s queries.

Last month, Bharti Airtel and UK’s Vodafone announced plans to jointly control the future Indus-Infratel merged tower entity, to be called Indus Towers as equal shareholders with equal board representation. The merger is slated to close by March 2019.

Naveen Kulkarni, telecoms analyst at brokerage Phillip-Capital, said with a large combined tower base, “the bargaining power of the Indus-Infratel combined tower entity would rise in the long-term as the service levels and uptime of Bharti Infratel and Indus will not be easily replicable”.

Bharti Infratel and Indus will together have 41% of the tower market share."

37,2018-05-10,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: India Inc's mergers and acquisitions (M&As) tally rose eight-fold to USD 19.1 billion with 40 transactions in April, making it the highest monthly deal value recorded after March 2017, says a report.

According to Grant Thornton, relative easing of regulatory ecosystem and consolidation across sectors have significantly driven the deal activity in April this year, sealing deals (M&A and PE) worth USD 21 billion across 119 deals.

""April saw deals worth USD 19.1 billion across 40 transactions, marking the highest monthly values recorded after USD 23.8 billion recorded in March 2017,"" said the report released today.

There were 40 M&A deals in April this year worth USD 19,142 million, a 788 per cent jump in deal value, and 38 per cent rise in deal volume, it said.

With this, the total M&A deal value stood at USD 37,672 million so far this year.

The deal value grew exponentially compared to April 2017, driven by two billion-dollar deals and 10 deals valued at and above USD 100 million each, accounting for 97 per cent of the total M&A deal values. While April 2017 witnessed only six deals valued over USD 100 million.

""Deal activity witnessed a spurt in April. Internal and global group restructuring plans, consolidation and sale and merger of non-core businesses seem to be the underlying themes for the key M&A transactions,"" said Pankaj Chopda, Director, Grant Thornton India LLP.

Compared to March this year, April bounced back registering a whopping 11.8 fold increase in deal values on the back on of two billion-dollar deals, while volumes saw a 29 per cent month-on-month increase, the report said.

India continues to see a strong growth in deal activity, with the year so far recording 442 deals (M&A and PE) worth USD 44 billion, a 26 per cent increase in deal values, driven by a relatively stable economy, liberalisation of government policies and a continued interest from strategic and financial investors, the assurance, tax and advisory firm said.

M&A values recorded a robust 27 per cent increase y-o-y in the deal values. This was primarily on account of revived domestic and cross-border deal activity, witnessing an increase of over three times in deal values.

The year so far has registered six deals in the billion-dollar category and 21 deals valued at and over USD 100 million each. Compared to two billion dollar deals and 17 deals valued at and above USD 100 million each in YTD 2017.

Telecom, energy, banking, IT and ITES and manufacturing sectors led the deal activity, capturing 92 per cent of the total deal values. On the other hand, start-up and IT and ITES sector dominated the deal volumes with 35 per cent share.

Telecom sector led the deal activity, accounting for 77 per cent of the total deal value. This growth was driven by Bharti Infratel's merger with Indus Towers valuing at USD 14.6 billion, creating the largest tower company in the world outside China. This merger alone contributed to 76 per cent of total M&A values.

""Given that in the four months ended April 2017 the value of deals reported is already close to 75 per cent of the annual deal values reported in 2017, we expect the deal momentum to continue. Further, given that 2019 will be an election year, we expect the government to further accelerate policy reforms, which will further fuel the deal momentum,"" Chopda added."

42,2018-05-13,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers - to create a USD 14.6 billion firm with world's second-largest number of mobile masts -- is not expected to lead to any job loss given the ""disparate and largely non-overlapping nature"" of operations of both companies, a senior Bharti official said.

There will be an overlap at the corporate level for less than 100 positions but that too will be accommodated in anticipation of business growth and in new projects such as smart cities, said the official familiar with the blockbuster deal struck last month. 

The merged entity will have in its fold more than 163,000 towers across India - largest after China Tower. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone will jointly control the combined firm. 

The transaction, subject to regulatory and other approvals, including from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Department of Telecom (FDI approval), is expected to close before the end of the fiscal year. 

The merged entity, which will be called Indus Towers Ltd, will remain listed. Bharti Airtel, which currently owns 53.5 per cent in Bharti Infratel, will get 33.8 per cent to 37.2 per cent stake in the combined entity. Its shareholding is dependent upon what Aditya Birla Group's Idea and Providence do with their minority shareholding in Indus Tower. 

Similarly, Vodafone India will get between 26.7 per cent and 29.4 per cent of the Indus-Bharti Infratel combine.

Vodafone has 42 per cent stake in Indus Tower. Bharti Infratel too has an equivalent stake while the remaining is with Aditya Birla's Idea (11.15 per cent) and Providence (4.85 per cent). 

Bharti Infratel has 1,248 employees on a standalone basis while Indus Towers has 2,440 employees as on March 2018. 

""Over the years, Bharti Infratel has been successful in building a culture of innovation and excellence with a strong 'people' focus. We believe given the disparate and largely non-overlapping nature of operations of both the companies, the combined entity will be able to absorb current employees post the merger,"" the Bharti official said, responding to a specific query on the impact of the merger on existing jobs. 

The official added: ""A few employees with role overlaps will be offered opportunities in new projects like Smart Cities which is the next big focus for the company."" These positions at the head office adding up to 80-90 employees will be ""accommodated"" in view of business growth and incoming projects, the official noted. 

Bharti Infratel did not respond to an e-mail query. 

Indus Towers currently operates in 15 telecom service areas or circles while Bharti Infratel's operations are focused on the remaining seven circles. 

A statement issued on April 25 to announce the merger had stated the ""combination of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, with their highly complementary footprints, will create a pan-India tower company with the ability to offer high-quality passive infrastructure services to all operators on a non-discriminatory basis, needed to support the pan-India expansion of wireless broadband services using 4G/4G+/5G technologies""."

45,2018-05-14,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: More than 2,000 operational creditors, besides 11 financial lenders, have demanded their dues from Aircel and have filed their claims with the interim resolution professional, which is looking at ways to revive the bankrupt telecom operator. 

In the list of claims, a copy of which is with ET, the amounts include Rs 411 crore filed by Bharti Infratel, Rs 843 crore filed by Indus Towers and Rs 1,100 crore by some other operational creditors. American Tower Corp. and Bharti Airtel have filed claims of Rs 167.39 crore and Rs 60.34 crore, respectively. The Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) has claimed Rs 3.67 crore. 

The number of creditors claiming their dues could be more because some vendors of subsidiaries Aircel Cellular and Dishnet Wireless have filed their claims separately. Ericsson confirmed it is seeking to recover a total of Rs 246 crore from Aircel, Aircel Cellular and Dishnet Wireless. Nokia Solutions & Networks India’s recovery amount from Aircel is Rs 59.52 crore. Bharti Airtel, COAI and Indus Towers declined to comment on the matter and the rest didn’t respond to emailed queries. 

The bankruptcy court, while admitting Aircel’s petition for insolvency in March, had appointed Deloitte’s Vijaykumar V Iyer as the interim resolution professional. According to sources, the IRP’s main concern would be to first pay back the financial lenders – mainly banks, which together aim to recover about Rs 19,000 crore from Aircel. 

“We are bound by confidentiality obligations and are unable to comment on client-specific matters,” a Deloitte spokesperson said in reply to an email query from ET. During hearings, Aircel had told the bankruptcy court that it owes its financial creditors Rs 15,000 crore and its operational creditors Rs 35,000 crore. 

The telco, under debt of Rs 50,000 crore, has had a couple of meetings with its committee of creditors to discuss the option of restarting mobile phone operations in select circles and looking for funding from investors other than the promoters. The last time Aircel got funds was in April, when parent company Maxis Communications provided Rs 95 crore for paying salaries and meeting operational expenses. 

Earlier this month, chief executive officer Kaizad Heerjee resigned, marking the exit of the top management from the telecom company. Some other key management officials also left as the operator sank deeper into its debt crisis. Vipul Saurabh, who was national head, operations and customer services, and Anupam Vasudev, who was chief marketing officer, resigned in February. 


The bankruptcy court had said that there was potential to revive the business, given the telco’s revenue generation and assets worth more than Rs 32,000 crore, including spectrum. T Ananda Krishnan, owner of Maxis, who infused about $7 billion into Aircel over the past 12 years without any returns, decided to pull the plug on the telco after merger talks with RCom didn’t fructify."

52,2018-05-15,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Vodafone India’s service revenue dropped 29% on-year to 979 million euros (Rs 7,902 crore) in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 as the country’s second-largest telco reeled under the effects of cuts in local and international interconnect rates and price wars ahead of a planned merger with Idea Cellular.

The transaction with Idea Cellular will close in June, Vodafone Group Plc said. The combined entity will become India’s largest telco by revenue and subscribers.

“Vodafone and Idea have agreed on a joint branding policy, in that the architecture is ready and commercial planning for the joint brand will start once we have all regulatory approvals for the merger,” Vodafone Group Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao said on an earnings call on Tuesday. Colao is stepping down on October 1 and Group Chief Financial Officer Nick Read will take his place.

The combined entity “will focus immediately on capturing the sizeable cost synergies,” Colao said separately in a statement.

Losses for Vodafone India continued in the January-March quarter as a result of intense price competition and a significant reduction in interconnect charges, Vodafone said in its global results announcement Tuesday. Although Colao declined to hazard a guess on when the price wars in India would ease, he said “any positive movement in prices would lift back the situation.”



“We are getting into a three-player market in India and Vodafone is well positioned for recovery,” said Colao.

He said the planned merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel would “create a monetisable asset that would make the India business very self-supportive and solid.” Last month, the UK’s Vodafone and Bharti Airtel agreed to jointly control the merged tower entity, to be called Indus Towers, as equal shareholders. The merger of the tower companies is expected to close by March.

Vodafone India’s revenue was 1,379 million euros (Rs 10,547 crore) during the fourth quarter a year ago and 1,063 million euros (Rs 8,580 crore) in the October-December quarter.

Revenue for 2017-18 fell 18.9% to Rs 34,855 crore, while the loss for the year narrowed to 1,969 million euros (Rs 15,933.6 crore) from 4,107 million euros (Rs 33,235 crore), helped by an income tax credit of 925 million euros.

The results for FY18 “comprises a non-cash charge of 3,170 million euros (2,245 million euros net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of Vodafone India to fair value less costs to sell,” Vodafone Group said. The fair value of Vodafone Group’s interest in Vodafone India as of March 31, 2018, has been measured in part by Idea’s share price on that date of Rs 75.9.

“Our business managed costs extremely well, which helped mitigate the reduction in our EBITDA margin despite rolling out 50,000 3G/4G sites during the year,” Sunil Sood, managing director of Vodafone India, said in a statement.

The cost initiatives included active network site sharing, renegotiation of tower maintenance contracts and closure of sites with low usage, the company said.

Vodafone India’s average revenue per user (ARPU) in January-March fell to its lowest ever of Rs 105 from Rs 114 in the previous quarter, reflecting the intense pressure on pricing that has plagued the company and its peers – Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular – following Reliance Jio Infocomm’s entry in September 2016. Airtel’s ARPU in the quarter was Rs 116, Idea’s was Rs 105, lagging behind Jio’s Rs 137.1.

Idea’s net loss widened in the quarter while Bharti Airtel’s India operations posted their first loss in 15 years. Jio increased its sequential net profit by 1.2% to Rs 510 crore.

“Intense competition in India is a euphemism, in that there was an 86% decline in data prices year-on-year, while voice prices fell 40% on-year too. But the good news is that we got 10 million customers in the last quarter but there is a price to be paid for this success,” Colao said.

The company added 76 million data users in the year, taking its total subscriber base to 223 million.

“In India, data traffic quadrupled following a sharp decline in data prices,” Vodafone Group said. Data usage grew more than four-fold in FY18 and more than six-fold in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.

Net debt in India was Rs 62,100 crore, lower than a year earlier, due mainly to favourable forex rates and the sale of its standalone towers to American Tower Corp. for Rs 3,850 crore.

On the tax case arbitration under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty, Vodafone Group said the company will file its response to India’s defence in July and India will respond in December. India’s objections to jurisdiction and the company’s claims are scheduled to be heard together in February 2019.

“More recent attempts by the Indian government to have the jurisdiction arguments heard separately have also failed,” the company added."

Second, in addition to the turnaround stories, managers have been focusing on companies which have greater possibility of superior earnings growth. ET lists five companies which have become part of the portfolios of leading fund houses in April this year.


BHARTI INFRATEL
CMP: Rs 316 
Market cap: Rs 58,475 crore 
Bought by: ICICI Prudential MF

Several factors have ensured sustained interest in the stock of the tower company. First, the company’s merger with Indus Towers. The merged entity would have 1,63,000 towers across India, which will be second-largest in the world (China Tower is the largest). Besides this, the merged entity will save close to Rs 560 crore from dividend distribution tax and other corporate expenditures. Also, increase in acceleration of 4G and 5G rollout on high frequency bands are expected to boost revenues in the coming years.


TEAMLEASE SERVICES
CMP: Rs 2754
Market cap: Rs 4,709 crore
Bought by: Franklin Templeton

TeamLease’s leadership position in general staffing has been one of the key reasons why analysts and fund managers have interest in the stock. It enjoys close to 6% marketshare in the fragmented general staffing industry. With increasing preference for organised players in almost all sectors post GST, TeamLease is expected to be a key beneficiary given its consistently superior performance. Besides this, the company forayed into specialised staffing in high-margin sectors such as IT and telecom which is also expected to boost its revenues in the coming quarters.


HINDUSTAN UNILEVER
CMP: Rs 1,505
Market cap: Rs 3.26 lakh crore
Bought by: Kotak Mutual Fund

One of the key factors which has worked in favour of HUL is its stupendous growth in volume in the past seven years. For the past two quarters — December 2017 and the March 2018 quarters, the company has been clocking 11% volume growth which has beaten the expectations. A key aspect which analysts point out is the company has been able to increase prices in the range of 4-5% almost across all categories of products. Post GST, the shift in organised space of FMCG is expected to benefit the company.


SUPREME INDUSTRIESCMP: Rs 1,325
Market cap: Rs 16,385 crore
Bought by: IDFC Mutual Fund

One of the largest plastic processor in India, the company has a diversified revenue model. Additional revenue will accrue as revenue from new plants comes in this financial year. Analysts believe the company is the biggest beneficiary of shift from metals to plastic and higher GDP growth. With GST-led disruptions easing, analysts expect a revenue growth of 18-20% over the next 3 years. Margins are likely to improve as the company increases the share of value added products in its turnover.


MAHINDRA CIE
CMP: Rs 240 
Market cap: Rs 9,045 crore
Bought by: Franklin Templ MF

Mahindra CIE is a multitechnology automotive components supplier catering to Maruti, M&M, Tata Motors and Hero Moto Corp. It is one of the top manufacturers of forging parts in India (leader in crankshafts and stub axles) and the EU. It has used mergers and acquisitions as an integral tool to grow now under CIE parentage as well as prior to CIE’s entry. Given the growth opportunities across the globe, analysts believe valuations are reasonable."

69,2018-05-20,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: American Tower Corporation’s India operations may take a hit with the imminent loss of two key customers, Telenor India and Tata Teleservices, which may compel the independent tower company to resort to hefty price cuts for holding on to tenancies, according to analysts.

Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel recently concluded its Telenor India buyout and is poised to close the acquisition of Tata Teleservices’ wireless business.

Accordingly, sector experts said, ATC’s rivals Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel, which are merging to form the world’s second-largest tower company after China Tower, would be on a much stronger footing to protect tenancies, especially since they have the right of first refusal (RoFR) pacts for any fresh tenancy roll-outs from both Bharti Airtel and the future Vodafone-Idea Cellular combine.

“The formation of ATC India and its unit Viom Networks had over onethird of its tenancies through Tata Teleservices and Telenor India, both key customers for Viom. The contribution of these two telcos on Indus/Bharti Infratel, by comparison, would be high single-digit and, accordingly, the impact on ATC is significantly higher, nearly 2.5 to three times of the Indus/Infratel impact,” former Viom Networks CEO Syed Safawi told ET.

Sanjesh Jain, telecom research analyst at ICICI Securities, said the exit of Tata Teleservices and Telenor India “will have a huge impact on ATC in that many towers of the latter’s portfolio can potentially become unviable and see shutdowns”. Under the circumstances, ATC India, he said, might have to “under-cut the already low prices (amid multiple tenants), which could make its business irretrievably unviable”.

But ICICI Securities’ Jain warned that any bid on ATC’s part to engage in a price war could prove counter-productive since the towers industry has “negligible elasticity for price cuts to create any positive delta in revenue”. Analysts said that ATC may run the risk of a potential erosion in revenue from existing tenants as well if it resorts to aggressive price cuts.

Safawi said ATC would need to “reinvent itself and its business model” in India. “ATC needs to position itself as a truly independent tower company, with no telco ownership (post-Tata Teleservices’ exit) and become much more new age revenue focused, by looking at things such as smart cities and data offload solutions since traditional models alone will not work if it wishes to grow ahead of the market,” he said. ET’s queries to ATC India did not elicit any response till late on Sunday.

But people close to ATC India said the US company is unlikely to compromise on compensation and in enforcing early tenancy termination penalties as it has long-term master service agreements with key customers with five-seven year lock-in periods. ATC, which has more than 70,000 towers in India, recently cut its outlook for 2018, attributing the phenomenon to accelerated telco consolidation in India and the bankruptcy of mobile carrier Aircel.

Earlier this month, the company reportedly cut the midpoint of its full year 2018 outlook for property revenue, net income and adjusted Ebitda by $60 million, $45 million and $35 million respectively."

91,2018-05-23,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The telecom department has clarified that tower providers will be considered as licensees under right-of-way rules, addressing a major demand of the industry that had been kept out of the purview of these rules so far. The industry welcomed the move, which it said would help infrastructure providers to set up the base for future technologies including 5G.

The right-of-way rules allow online filing of applications in a bid to ease the pain that the sector faces in building infrastructure. They are expected to help companies get land from state governments and local bodies within a stipulated timeframe, with standard procedures set for telecom companies and government authorities to follow.

The Department of Telecommunications had issued rules on setting up of telecom towers and laying of cables in November 2016, providing a framework for granting approvals and settling disputes in a time-bound manner, as well as improving coordination between companies and government authorities. However, it kept tower and infrastructure providers outside the purview of the regulation even though they are the ones that set up the required infrastructure for telcos.

“It is clarified that under clause 2 (d) of the said rules, ‘licensee’ includes infrastructure provider category I (IP-I) authorised to establish and maintain dark fibre, right of way, duct space and towers and give them out on lease, rent or sale basis to telecom service providers on mutually agreed terms and basis,” DoT said in a notice on Wednesday.

“It is reiterated that IP-I registrants shall in no case work and operate or provide telegraph service, including end-to-end bandwidth as defined in the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, either to any service provider or any other customer,” DoT added.

The Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association, which represents companies such as Bharti Infratel, Indus Towers, ATC India, GTL Infrastructure, Reliance Infratel and Tower Vision, lauded the government’s decision. It said the move reinforced and recognised that infrastructure providers were an essential part of the overall telecom ecosystem.

Tower companies have set up more than 4.71 lakh towers mounted with 18 lakh base stations as of this month, extending seamless network connectivity to India’s 1.2 billion subscribers.

However, inadequate infrastructure is blamed for call drops and creating roadblocks to broadband penetration. The fear of radiation has led many people and municipal bodies to oppose the setting up of towers in their localities. There are also problems related to laying of cables, which often requires digging up of roads and private property.

“The clarification was long pending and much needed and timely, which will expedite the provisioning of telecom infrastructure in every nook and corner of the nation,” said Tilak Raj Dua, director general of association.

Local and state authorities will now have to appoint nodal officers for implementing the rules in order to improve coordination between companies and authorities. Companies setting up towers would have to pay a one-time fee of Rs 10,000 with their applications to meet administrative expenses. Companies that lay fibre networks will have to pay Rs 1,000 per kilometre.

To improve ease of business, DoT had mandated that an authority must not take more than 60 days from the date of application to grant permission or deny it, and if a response does not come within the timeframe, permission will be deemed as granted."

94,2018-05-24,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: It's a sweet and sour feeling the way March quarter earnings have panned out so far.

The short point is there were only a few positive surprises as the season enters its last lap. And the numbers at best are in line with market expectations. 

A few consumption-driven sectors continued with their recent volume-driven growth. But red flags are going up. Rising raw material costs could play a spoilsport for some of them, going ahead. PSU banks with record losses disappointed the most. 

Combined sales of 1,040-odd companies -- apart from PSU and private banks -- climbed 14.9 per cent while their net profit surged 37 per cent on a low base last year. The March quarter of 2017 turned out to be painful for India Inc because of the cash ban announced in November 2016.

Top line rose to Rs 11,55,547 crore compared with Rs 10,05,488 crore in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line for the universe swelled to Rs 1,06,437 crore from Rs 77,801 a year earlier. 

On a sequential basis, sales for these companies went up 7.62 per cent. Profit advanced 4.14 per cent, Capitaline data showed, as compiled by ETMarkets.com.

Banks, especially PSU ones, made jaw-dropping NPA provisions during the March quarter. The result: as many as 14 banks reeled under losses amounting to Rs 46,593 crore. This includes PNB's record loss of Rs 13,416.90 crore. SBI (Rs 7,542 crore), Canara Bank (Rs 4,860 crore) and Allahabad bank (Rs 3,510 crore) suffered huge losses too. 

To give you a perspective, these 14 PSU lenders had reported Rs 4,338 crore loss in the year-ago quarter. If private and public lenders are taken into account, the 1,070 firms reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 71,072 crore for January-March.

""So far, the earnings season has been on expected lines. The upgrades and downgrades are by and large equal to each other following which the earnings estimate for the next year has only been marginally cut by about a per cent,"" said Neelotpal Sahai of HSBC Asset Management India.

From the Nifty bloc, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints, SBI, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Vedanta, HCL Tech, Wipro, Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel fell short of profit estimates. Others such as Bajaj Auto, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Lupin, Zee Entertainment, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Yes Bank came out on top.

""Consumer-oriented sectors from paints to consumer staples delivered not only good results, but very strong commentary on revenue and margin expansion. In some ways, that bullish guidance actually surprised me because I felt that commodity price spike would make them a little more circumspect about margins. Both consumer discretionary and staples are doing fine. Energy companies too performed well,"" Manishi Raychaudhuri of BNP Paribas told ET Now.

For the FMCG sector, what worked is the revival in rural growth, which has beaten the figure for urban areas for three quarters now. 

Metal companies have been putting up a strong earnings show, buoyed by a pick-up in metal prices. This partly hurt outlook for automakers though, which points to further impact of raw material inflation in H1 FY19. They may partially try to offset it by passing on the cost to consumers, said Motilal Oswal Securities. 

The squeeze was on the telecom sector, which saw ARPU downtrading due to renewed competition. That means Ebitda margin for the telcos may remain under pressure, going forward.

""Earning have been mixed bag so for, with IT , Cement , FMCG, Metal, Select private sector banks performing better on revenue, margin and net profit parameters. Some of the high frequency economic data-points such cement production, air traffic growth, petrol/diesel consumption, automobile sales among others, suggest a strong recovery in the economy. Revival in urban demand along with good monsoon led recovery in rural demand would augur well for the economy and corporate earnings,"" said Hemang Jani of Sharekhan. 

For the IT sector, FY19 should see an improvement on a low FY18 base, but the outlook is not exactly euphoric, the brokerage noted. According to Raychaudhuri, the currency depreciation has been a tailwind for software firms.

""In oil and gas space, refining margins have been good. Marketing margins have also been good after a tepid Q3 FY18. Outlook remains uncertain in light of high oil prices, a depreciating rupee, unwillingness of the government to cut excise duties on auto fuels, and the upcoming elections,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said.

Results of cement companies came in above expectations, led by lower-than-expected price decline and a better cost curve. The impact of higher petcoke and diesel prices was mitigated by better operating leverage and other cost efficiency measures, the brokerage added.

Jani said that the outlook for cement sector remains neutral as players across regions except eastern markets will continue to experience pricing pressure.""Moreover high Fuel expenses & logistics cost will keep margins under pressure,"" he said. 

So, where does that leave us with? The market will continue to be more truncated in favour of companies that can grow with earnings visibility, said Dhananjay Sinha of Emkay Global Financial Services.

""A rise in crude prices which can put pressure on margins due to higher Input costs. It could havesome growth and revenue repurcusion for FMCG, Cement , automobile sector. A rise in metal prices can be dampaner for construction & automotive industry & electrical component industry. Most of the Managements have shown concern regarding higher commodity prices . However, they said they will take price hike if required to pass on the higher RM cost. But we believe price hike might be challenging,"" Jani said."

95,2018-05-24,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA | NEW DELHI: The telecom department (DoT) on Thursday cleared Idea Cellular’s sale of nearly 9,000 standalone towers to a local arm of American Tower Corp (ATC) for Rs 4,000 crore.

A top DoT official told ET the “Idea-ATC captive towers deal has been approved”. This marks the conclusion of the US tower company’s two-stage buyout of Vodafone India and Idea’s near 20,000-odd combined standalone towers for Rs 7,850 crore. Last month, the government had cleared Vodafone India’s sale of its 10,926 captive towers to ATC for Rs 3,850 crore.

As of press time, ATC and Idea had not replied to ET’s queries.

The government is learnt to have also assured that the Kumar Birla-led Idea Cellular would be granted approval on its crucial application for increasing FDI shortly, for its upcoming merger with Vodafone India.

India’s third-largest telco, Idea, and the second-ranked Vodafone India, which are combining to form the country’s biggest phone company by revenue and subscribers, are expected to close their merger next month.

Idea Cellular is learnt to have also put in an application for final DoT approval for its merger with Vodafone India, a person with direct knowledge said.

Back in March, Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan had said DoT is in the final stages of approving the merger between Idea and Vodafone India as clearances from Sebi and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) have already come. While the Reserve Bank of India and the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) have not raised any objections to the FDI increase by Idea, the DIPP has put the ball in DoT's court and asked the department to get clarification and documentation on whether all upstream and downstream companies that hold shares in the Indian entities of both companies are FDI compliant.

The final merger, however, will be subject to clearing of dues, especially the one-time spectrum charges (OTSC) of nearly Rs 6,000 crore.

Meanwhile, acquisition of Vodafone and Idea’s captive towers will boost ATC’s towers portfolio in India to nearly 80,000, taking it closer to market leader Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel who own over 1,23,000 and 91,000 towers, respectively.

The Boston-based independent tower operator has been steadily bolstering its India towers portfolio, having bought a 51% stake in erstwhile Viom Networks for Rs 7,635 crore in the largest inbound acquisition in FY16.

Last November, Vodafone India and Idea had announced plans to sell their respective standalone towers to a local ATC arm for Rs 7,850 crore ($1.2 billion) in cash, in a move aimed at paring debt in the run of their mega merger.

Vodafone India and Idea have also said that on conclusion of their merger, some 6,300 tenancies of both carriers co-located on the towers being sold to ATC would get converted into single tenancies over two years without the payment of exit penalties."

108,2018-05-26,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Idea Cellular and American Tower Corp (ATC) are likely to announce closure of their $615-million (Rs 4,000-crore approx) tower deal early next week following telecom department’s (DoT) approval for the sale of the Kumar Birla-led telco’s 9,900-odd captive towers to a local arm of the US tower company.

“Deal closure is likely to happen early next week once the transaction is concluded and ATC transfers the $615 million to Idea,” a person with direct knowledge told ET.

Under the terms of the deal, Idea will sell its entire stake in wholly-owned arm, Idea Cellular Infrastructure Services (ICISL) —which holds standalone towers —to ATC Telecom Infrastructure (ATC TIPL) for $615 mn in cash. Idea shares rose over 5% on the BSE to close at Rs 59.70 on Friday, a day after the DoT cleared its captive towers sale to ATC. At press-time Friday, Idea and ATC did not reply to ET’s queries.

Closure of the captive towers deal with Idea will conclude the Boston-based telecom tower company’s two stage acquisition of Vodafone India and Idea’s near 20,000-odd combined standalone towers for Rs 7,850 crore.

Last month, the government had cleared Vodafone India’s sale of its 10,926 captive towers to ATC for Rs 3,850 crore.

At a time when the Indian telecom market is seeing an upsurge in 4G network rollouts, the buyout of Vodafone and Idea’s captive towers will boost ATC’s towers portfolio in India to nearly 80,000, taking it closer to market leader Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel who own 1,23,639 and 91,451 towers, respectively.

The Boston-based independent tower operator has been steadily reinforcing its India towers portfolio, having bought a 51% stake in erstwhile Viom Networks for Rs 7,635 crore in the largest inbound acquisition back in FY16.

Last November, Vodafone India and Idea had announced plans to sell their respective captive towers to ATC for Rs 7,850 crore ($1.2 billion) in cash, in a move aimed at paring debt in the run-up to their mega merger.

Vodafone India and Idea, which are combining to form the country’s biggest phone company by revenue and subscribers, are slated to close their merger next month.

In November, ATC had said the three sides had established a preferred partner structure under which Vodafone and Idea would receive service-level and process efficiency benefits, while ATC TIPL would secure certain preferential rights for future new business commencements on its existing portfolio and on the sites being acquired in certain Indian markets."

110,2018-05-29,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA | MUMBAI: American Tower Corp (ATC) is likely to accept around $900 million (Rs 6,030 crore approx) as compensation from Tata Teleservices for prematurely winding up some 30,000-odd tenancies after deciding to sell its mobility business to Bharti Airtel. This will pave the way for the acquisition of the Tata group company’s mobility division by the country’s largest telco. “The overall compensation will include Tata Teleservices’ 26% stake in ATC-controlled Viom Networks — valued at Rs 4,500-5,000 crore — that ATC will acquire and the additional amount as the cash component,” a person with direct knowledge told ET.

This settlement is crucial for the Tata group to close its agreement with Bharti Airtel which made it clear that the conglomerate would need to clear all liabilities from earlier pacts. Bharti Airtel utilises the towers of its unit Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, its joint venture with Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. At press time, ATC had not replied to ET’s queries. A Tata spokesperson also declined to comment.

It is learnt that the Boston-based independent tower company originally wanted a little over $1 billion ( Rs 7,000 crore) as overall compensation from the Tatas for early termination of the 30,000 tenancies with ATC India and its unit Viom. ATC was known to be particularly averse to any compromise on early termination compensation as bulk of the Tata Tele tenancies were based on long-term master service agreements (MSAs) valid till 2025 with 5-to-7-year lock-in periods.



Accordingly, a potential $900-million settlement suggests ATC has offered Tata Teleservices an effective 10% discount as it is keen on an amicable and early settlement with an old client. Brokerage ICICI Securities had recently said the exit of (two key clients) Tata Teleservices and Telenor India would will have a huge impact on ATC, in that, many towers of the latter’s (India) portfolio could potentially become unviable and see shutdowns. ATC had acquired 51% in Viom from Kolkata-based Srei group and Tata Teleservices for Rs 7,600 crore in April 2016. After merging Viom’s 42,000 telecom towers with its India operations, ATC took a 65% stake in the JV and the Tatas had 26%. The remainder is held by IDFC and Macquarie. Viom was recently rechristened ATC Telecom Infrastructure.

Another insider familiar with the discussions said the Tata Group is particularly keen on an early settlement with ATC to hasten the pending takeover of its consumer mobility business by Bharti Airtel, which recently closed the Telenor India acquisition. Under the agreement signed last October, Tata Teleservices’ wireless business — with over 40 million customers, majority of 5,000 employees and about 178.5 units of airwaves — across 19 circles will be transferred to Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel on a cash-free, debt-free basis. The deal is slated to bolster the market leader’s 4G airwaves capacity.

Bharti Airtel, on its part, will also take care of Rs 1,500-2,000 crore of the Rs 10,000 crore that Tata Tele needs to pay the government over the next few years for spectrum acquired in auctions."

Their net outflow stood at Rs 7,818.94 crore on a month-to-date basis, compared with Rs 5,552.21 crore in April. 

In total, FIIs’ net investment so far in 2018 has been just Rs 1,027.20 crore against DIIs’ total net inflow of Rs 46,649 crore.

Weakness in emerging market currencies against the greenback, softer earnings growth, concern over corporate governance issues and political risk ahead of the general elections in 2019 are some of the factors that have been kept FIIs jittery.

Inderjeet Singh Bhatia, Head of Research at Macquarie Capital, said earnings are practically flat for the past three-four years. “If you look at the banking side, the entire resolution process has dragged on for some time. There have been issues around corporate governance. This is letting to a potential compression in premiums that the Indian stock market used to command over global peers.”

There are expectations that outflows may continue if corporate earnings do not pick up. “It is high time we start delivering at least in line or may be even better than earnings, otherwise this FII outflow might continue for longer periods,” Bhatia said in an interaction with ETNow.

The Indian rupee has plunged over 7 per cent to 68.26 against the dollar as of May 25 from 63.67 on January 1 this year, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data showed. On the other hand, crude oil topped $80 a barrel level recently for the first time since late 2014.

Overall, FPIs held stakes in double digits in nearly 275 of the BSE500 companies as of March 2018. Out of these, 67 per cent of stocks gave negative returns, slipping up to 91 per cent so far in 2018.

The Nifty50 index opened flat on Tuesday, but failed to hold above the 10,700 mark and wiped out its entire gains of the previous session.

It formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern on daily scale as it covered the entire movement of the last candle and closed below the opening price of previous session. The overall price setup suggests rangebound move with limited upside as well as downside. So it will have support at the 10,550 level to consolidate between 10,550 and 10,735 levels over the next few sessions.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was intact at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,600, while maximum Call OI was at 10,800 followed by 10,700.

Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices, while significant Call writing was seen at 10,700 and then 10,650 levels, which restricted the upside. Options data suggested a trading range between 10,550 and 10,750 levels.

India VIX remained flattish to close at 13.12 level. A lower VIX level even after a fall in the market suggests that the decline would get bought into again.

Bank Nifty failed to hold above 26,500 and remained under pressure for most part of the session. It formed a Bearish Belt Hold Candle on daily scale and negated the formation of higher highs and lows after three sessions. As long as it holds above 26,250, it could witness an upward move towards 26,500 and then 26,750 levels, while on declines major support is seen near 26,100 and 26,000 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a 0.57 per cent loss at 10,618. Long buildup was seen in M&M, Tata Power, GAIL, HCL Tech, Dabur, Idea, JSW Steel and BHEL while shorts were seen in Havells, M&M Financials, Coal India, Glenmark, Bharti Infratel and ZEE.

The sale was done via the Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned telco divesting its entire stake in Idea Cellular Infrastructure Services, a 100% subsidiary of Idea, to ATC. 

Closure of the captive towers deal with Idea will conclude the Boston-based telecom tower company’s two-stage acquisition of Vodafone India and Idea’s near 20,000-odd combined standalone towers for a total of Rs 7,850 crore. 

Vodafone's sale of its standalone tower business to ATC was completed for an enterprise value of Rs 3,850 crore in April. 

According to a regulatory filing, post the completion of Vodafone India and Idea merger, the 6,300 co-located tenancies of the two operators on the combined standalone tower portfolio will collapse into single tenancies over a period of two years without the payment of exit penalties. 

In the last leg of regulatory approvals, the merger of the second and third largest telecom companies in India is expected shortly. 



Idea Cellular added that both the telcos and ATC as a vendor ""have agreed to treat each other as long-term preferred partners, subject to existing arrangements"". 

At a time when the Indian telecom market is seeing an upsurge in 4G network rollouts, the buyout of Vodafone and Idea’s captive towers will boost ATC’s towers portfolio in India to nearly 80,000, taking it closer to market leader Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel who own 1,23,639 and 91,451 towers, respectively.

1,2018-06-03,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Global private equity firm KKR is buying a 60% stake in Hyderabad based environmental and waste management solutions provider Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd in a deal worth $600 million (Rs. 4,000 crore) that values the company at $1 billion, according to people aware of the development.

This will be KKR’s first India acquisition in 2018.

KKR will buy the stake from the promoter family as well as existing PE investors-—Standard Chartered IL&FS Asia Infrastructure Growth Fund and IL&FS PE-—which together hold a 10% stake. The deal will be signed by the last week of June, said one of the people cited above. Investment bank Barclays is advising Ramky.

“The management will remain the same and there will be no major changes for the time being,” said the person.

Ramky Enviro, part of the Rs. 4,500-crore Ramky Group, offers services in industrial waste management, municipal waste management, bio-medical waste management, integrated environmental services and consultancy.

With 7,800 employees, Ramky Enviro has a pan-India presence in 55 locations in 17 states and Union Territories. It has offices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Singapore and Gabon in West Africa. Ramky Enviro posted a revenue of about Rs. 1,900 crore in the year to March 2018. PE funds such as Brookfield, CDC and Blackstone are said to have been among those that also showed interest in Ramky Enviro.


The Ramky Group has diversified businesses in areas of infrastructure (Ramky Infrastructure Ltd) and pharmaceuticals (Smilax Labs, a Hyderabad-based active pharmaceuticals ingredient maker), besides its waste management business.

“Waste management is a fast-growing industry, which is also aligned with the Swachh Bharat campaign and the competition seems to be low as not many large players are operating in this space,” said a person close to the development.

There was no response to emails sent to Ayodhya Rami Reddy, chairman of Ramky Group, and Goutham Reddy, CEO of Ramky Enviro.

Spokesperson for KKR and Standard Chartered declined to comment.

Ramky Enviro will be KKR's first investment in the waste management space globally if the deal goes ahead.

ET had reported on KKR’s interest in the business in its March 13 edition.

“Waste management sector is poised for a revival with the advent of MSW (Municipal Solid Wastes) Rules, 2016; and continuing focus under Swachh Bharat mission,” said Manish Aggarwal, partner and head, energy and infrastructure, corporate finance, KPMG in India. “Considerable progress has been made over years in collection and transportation of waste with around 69% of waste-generated being collected.”

According to a joint study by Assocham and PwC, 10-15% of waste produced by industry is hazardous and the generation of hazardous waste is increasing at the rate of 2-5% per year in India.

Around 7.46 million metric tonnes of hazardous waste is generated annually from 43,936 industries in the country, according to the study.

“The health of the sector has traditionally been dependent on the health of urban local bodies (ULBs), which have historically been not so great,” Aggarwal said. “However, new sources of revenue like preferential tariff in the range of Rs. 7-7.90/unit for waste to energy (WtE) plants, viability gap funding for WtE plants and introduction of fee-collection from waste generators would act as catalysts for making the sector attractive.”

KKR will invest in Ramky from its Asia Pacific fund—KKR Asian Fund III, a $9.3 billion fund raised last year.

The PE firm’s last private transaction in India was in 2017 when it acquired a 49% stake in hospital chain Radiant Life Care for $200 million.

KKR’s India portfolio includes Avendus Capital, Cafe Coffee Day, Bharti Infratel, Max Financial Services, Emerald Media, Magma, Radiant Life Care and SBI Life Insurance. KKR, which has been investing in India since 2006, deployed about $4 billion through the PE route while $5 billion of financing was given through its corporate and real estate-focused nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs).

In India, buyout transactions by private equity funds are at an all-time high as global funds, sovereign wealth funds and pension funds are aggressively investing through the PE route."

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,600 followed by 10,200, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,700. There was Put writing at strike price 10,600, while significant Call writing was seen at 10,700 and 10,800 levels.

14,2018-06-08,Bharti Infratel,"Smart investors, who spotted the trend early and shifted focus to largecaps in early 2018, have not only managed to protect their wealth in the recent carnage, but have made money too! Some have done it even in midcap and smallcap stocks, and how! 

Nifty Smallcap100 and Midcap100 indices are down up to 20 per cent this year, while the benchmark Nifty50 is still holding its head above water. 

A couple of largecaps drew investors’ attention this year, with IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surpassing the $100 billion market capitalisation in April, and stocks like HUL, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints scaling fresh all-time highs over the past one month. The Infosys stock is hovering around its highest level in two years. 

The theme is pretty clear: it’s a year for fundamentally strong businesses and those that have been trying to tap demand revival.

Most analysts are bullish on the largecaps despite the depression in the broader market in recent times. They are advising investors to add some stocks from this segment to protect their portfolios against volatility ahead of the general elections in 2019.

There are expectations that the largecaps may provide some cushion to investor portfolios as their valuations are lower compared with those of midcaps and smallcaps.

As many as 21 stocks from the Nifty pack were trading in the green so far this year, with Tech Mahindra up 37.50 per cent till June 6, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 31.58 per cent), Tata Consultancy Services (up 30.46 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 25.21 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 22.78 per cent), Infosys (up 19.73 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 18.23 per cent).

The 50-share index moved from 10,435 on January 1 this year to trade at 10,684 on June 6. 

Largecaps look attractive compared with midcaps and smallcaps at this point of time, Sankaran Naren, Executive Director, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, told ETNow in an interview.

Brokerage Sharekhan prefers HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS. HCL Tech has advanced over 3 per cent on a year-to-date basis. Managements of most IT companies have indicated that CY2018 would be better year compared with the previous one, thanks to some large deal wins, improving macro environment in key geographies, demand in certain industry pockets, emerging demand in digital, higher outsourcing demand from European clients and benefits of a weaker rupee.

Shares of HUL, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints and HDFC have gained between 10 per cent and 17 per cent in this period.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse has a ‘buy’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,750. Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target of Rs 2,251.

“Largecap valuations are far more reasonable than the second-rung stocks. Select largecap companies with rich valuations are also among the top picks right now when it comes to future growth visibility,” said Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director, Ladderup Wealth Management.

Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says the margin of safety is better in largecap names than in midcaps and smallcaps.

“There is certainty in terms of how the numbers will pan out,” he said.

More than 70 stocks from Nifty Midcap100 index gave negative returns to investors in 2018. Vakrangee, PC Jeweller, Adani Power and Suzlon Energy have plunged up to 93 per cent.

On the other hand, select midcap names like Mindtree, Indiabulls Ventures, Jubilant FoodWorks, Mphasis and Gruh Finance have risen up to 67 per cent in the same period. Gruh Finance hit an all-time high of Rs 381 on June 7.

There are takers for quality in any market. “I think it is time to buy into some of the quality companies in the midcap space, where the comfort level is on the higher side. Forget the index, this correction is a welcome opportunity for investors,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Smallcap stocks like Gitanjali Gems, Diamond Power, Bombay Rayon and Electrosteel Steels have slipped up to 91 per cent. 

There are specific pockets in the midcap and the smallcap segments, which are qualitative in nature, and earnings growth in this space can still be far better over the next two years, said Joshi of Angel Broking.

Coal India, YES Bank, L&T, Titan Company, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, ITC, Power Grid and Eicher Motors are other largecap stocks, which have been trading in the green so far in 2018.

On the other hand, shares of Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, HPCL, Vedanta, Bharti Infratel, BPCL, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Wipro are down up to 30 per cent between January 1 and June 6."

Claims from financial creditors of Aircel amount to about Rs 19,074 crore, with the State Bank of India having the biggest share at 38 per cent.

According to the terms of loan resolution in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the first preference on recovery is to secured financial creditors, followed by unsecured financial creditors, and then operational creditors. Hence, claims by operational creditors may not be met with concrete recoveries, given the order of precedence.

One97 Communications, which owns Paytm, is seeking Rs9.6 crore in operational dues, and Wiprohas putin claimsfor Rs158 crore. Severalother tower and telecom companies such as Bharti Infratel, Reliance Infratel, Vodafone and Idea, have also made substantial claims as Aircel’s operational creditors.

Legal experts in insolvency law say that these companies run the risk of losing money sinceL&T, an operationalcreditor, also did not receive the Rs900 crore of claimed dues in the resolution of Bhushan Steel, instead having to pay Rs1 lakh as penalty.

According to the data collected by the resolution professional, Vijay Kumar Iyer, GTL has made a claim of Rs1,773 crore while GTL Infra structure claimedduesof Rs 1,704 crore — bothtotalling to Rs 3,477 crore.

Ironically, GLT Infra had acquired around 17,500 towers of Aircel in mid-2010 for Rs 8,026 crore. At that time, it was estimated that GTL Infra would earn revenues of Rs 720 crore per year, with provisions for a 3 per cent annual escalation.

38,2018-06-19,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: And you thought midcaps and smallcaps have been under pressure over the past three months because of the Sebi reclassification, requiring mutual funds to rejig their portfolios?

Mutual fund houses across the board exited several midcap and smallcap stocks over the past three months. As such, while the largecap equity indices have shown signs of stabilising in recent weeks, midcaps and smallcaps continued to be in turmoil. In fact, these stocks continued to bear the brunt of the selloff in market.

Data showed BSE midcap and smallcap indices were up 50-55 per cent in last three years, but are down 10-12 per cent year-to-date. BSE smallcap and midcap indices fell 6 per cent each in May.

Some analysts say there has been a structural shift among institutional and individual investors towards largecaps, amid near-term concerns on domestic and global fronts, which has put pressure on midcaps and smallcaps.

""Earnings is a concern. Resignations by auditors at some midcap and smallcap firms too may be weighing on sentiment. There could a general shift towards safe haven blue chips,” said AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital.

Portfolio analyses of mutual funds throw up some interesting trends.

BNP Paribas Asset Management exited 17 stocks, mostly smallcaps and midcaps, while adding only two new stocks from that basket. Among key exits were Shankara Building Products, Bharti Infratel, Galaxy Surfactants and Inox Leisure, among others.

HSBC Global Asset Management added six stocks, but exited 23 stocks during the month.

Axis Mutual Find exited Shankara Building Products, Can Fin Homes, Apollo Tyres and Ajanta Pharma, RBL Bank and 12 others. Shares of Shankara Building Products had doubled in last one year. Can Fin Homes rallied 150 per cent in last three years and 1,130 per cent in last five, but has not performed well in last one year. 

Canara Robeco Asset Management added three stocks and exited eight during the month. SH Kelkar, Parag Milk Foods and Lakshmi Vilas Bank were some of the smallcap scrips the fund house totally exited.

Birla Sun Life made five exits and added five. It sold off Reliance Naval, Just Dial, Narayana Hrudayalaya and Engineering and Jubilant FoodWorks.

Interestingly, the fund house added PC Jeweller in small quantity during the month even as many funds such as Edelweiss Asset Management, JM Financial Asset Management, L&T Investment Management and Axis AMC exited the counter.

HDFC MF completely exited Reliance Infra and Amara Raja Batteries; Reliance Nippon MF exited Maharashtra Seamless and Teamlease Services; Franklin Templeton moved out of Pidilite and Ujjivan Financial Services; DSP Blackrock exited Spicejet, Indian Terrain and KSB Pumps. SBI MF sold off Mahindra Holidays and Repco Home.

BOI AXA Investment Managers exited 15 and added 8 stocks. Among the key exits were Minda Industries (up 1,182 per cent in 3 years), Avanti Feeds (up 6,627 per cent in five years), Thirumalai Chemicals (up 1,124 per cent in 3 years) and Somany Ceramics (up 600 per cent in five years). Some of these stocks are 40-50 per cent off their 52-week highs, thanks to recent selloff. 

The fund house denied the exits had anything to with Sebi re-classification. “Normally, it’s good to take a relook at portfolio stocks after the end of the earnings reason to re-validate the investment hypothesis. If we find deviation from our initial understanding in terms of business model and valuation, we exit the stock,” it said.

Other fund houses said most of the recent exits were because of a change in their fundamental view about certain companies.

Many midcaps and smallcaps have gone off MF radar, partly due to high valuations and concerns over management transparency, said G Chokalingam of Equinomics Research.

Foreign brokerage UBS said the economic growth cycle in India is less strong now than in the historical tightening periods, and this is reflected in earnings cuts.

This could remain an overhang for smallcaps and midcaps. “Our analysis of flows suggests MF flows clearly had more relevance than foreign flows in last two years. We expect strong local MF flows to fade, as the demonetisation-led liquidity abates and interest rates rise,” UBS said in a recent note.

Many small and midcap firms have failed to meet expectations on the earnings front. UBS said corporates do believe the GST impact is over, but potential benefits like a shift in market shares from unorganised to organised sector is yet to be seen.

Investors continued to focus on buying opportunities when share prices dip, but relative valuations of smallcaps and midcaps suggest the optimism may be priced in but not the uncertainties despite the recent corrections, UBS said. 

Among largecaps, HDFC was the most favourite pick among domestic mutual funds during May. It was followed by IT firms Infosys and HCL Technologies and FMCG major ITC. Power Grid, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IOC and TCS were among the top stocks that saw selling by mutual funds."

The Nifty50 index is stuck in a broader trading range between 10,700 and 10,835 levels since last eight sessions. It failed to hold above the previous day’s high of 10,837 and slipped towards the 10,750 level.

It formed a bearish Harami pattern followed by a bullish Harami pattern, which indicates that the bulls and the bears are not ready to loosen their grip and follow-up buying is missing on both sides.

The index formed a Doji candle or a pin bar last week, but failed to hold above the same and again got stuck in a range. Now it requires a decisive range breakout above 10,835 or below 10,700 to commence the next leg of rally.

If it manages to hold above 10,835, only then an upward move could be seen towards 10,888 and then 10,929 levels, while a drift below 10,700 level could take it towards 10,660 and then 10,620 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,700 followed by 10,600 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,800 and 10,900. There was Put unwinding at all immediate strike prices while significant Call writing was seen at 10,800 and 10,900 levels. Options data suggested an immediate trading range between 10,700 and 10,880 levels.

India VIX moved up 4.68 per cent to 12.58 level.

Bank Nifty formed an Inside Bar as failed to continue last Friday’s momentum and traded inside the range of last session. It has to hold above 26,500 to witness an upward move towards 26,750 and then 27,000 levels, while a hold below 26,450 could make it dip towards 26,250 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 0.69 per cent at 10,759. Long buildup was seen in Bharat Financials, Ultratech Cement, Infosys, Tata Elxsi, HUL and Bharti Infratel, while shorts were seen in ZEEL, Hindalco, Hero MotoCorp, Hindalco, SRF, Idea, Tata Motors, Motherson Sumi, BPCL and L&T.

77,2018-06-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Fitch Ratings on Tuesday affirmed Bharti Airtel’s long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB-' while the agency said that its outlook on the IDR is stable.

Airtel’s shares rose 1.7 per cent on Tuesday to Rs 379.95 on BSE in afternoon trade.

However, a further increase in competitive intensity could weigh on the company's ratings, as it has low rating headroom. Fitch in its report said that Bharti will increase its Indian mobile revenue market share to around 35 per cent-36 per cent, subject to its successful acquisition of Tata Teleservices. The stable outlook reflects that revenue from Bharti's Indian mobile segment may recover on higher data volume and its African and enterprise business segments will continue to expand.

The report said that India's tariff levels are unsustainable in the medium- to long-term in light of the low return on investment for telcos where Bharti is committed to an investment-grade rating and may explore stake sales in non-core assets to support its balance sheet.

Furthermore, Fitch expects the company’s FY19 revenue and EBITDA to remain flat on sustained competitive intensity in India's mobile segment as Reliance Jio is expected to remain aggressively competitive in the short term and prevent any meaningful rise in industry tariffs.

Bharti's blended average revenue per user per month declined by 27 per cent in FY18, to Rs 116 and there’s a possibility that it may also face competition in its home and digital TV segments as Jio is to enter these sectors in 2018-2019.

One of the key rating drivers for the company is its diversified revenue stream which is likely to help it withstand intense competition in India's mobile segment. Fitch expects continuous growth in the company’s African and enterprise business segments to offset the challenging environment in India's mobile and home business operations.

 The EBITDA contribution from Airtel’s African and Indian non-mobile businesses has steadily increased to 22 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, in the financial year ending March 2018, Fitch reported. The agency further said that the incumbents’ (telcos excluding Jio) average net leverage to remain stable, as they monetise their tower assets and see a 2018 recovery in revenue and EBITDA on stable tariffs. 

In order strengthen credit metrics, Bharti may explore options to sell part of its stake in its soon-to-be merged entity, Indus Towers and subsidiary, Bharti Infratel, as well as to raise equity at its African holding company and evaluate the sale of other assets.

Fitch further said that the planned merger of Indus-Infratel and resulting deconsolidation of Infratel from Bharti's financials will be credit neutral for Bharti.

In comparison to other regional investment-grade telcos, Bharti is exposed to significantly higher price competition in its home market, which is offset by its solid market position in India's mobile industry as well as diversified and integrated operations. However, its FCF is likely to remain negative on rising capex requirements and intense competition in the country's mobile market, Fitch concluded."

72,2018-06-26,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel has reorganised the senior management at its growing enterprise business, naming Ajay Chitkara as its head. Chitkara replaces Ashok Ganapathy, who quit the company. India’s No. 1 telco has also integrated its domestic and global enterprise operations, ahead of Reliance Jio Infocomm’s widely-expected commercial foray into the segment later this fiscal year.

As director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Airtel Business, Chitkara will run Airtel’s local enterprise operations comprising services to corporates, governments, small and medium businesses, among others, and report into Gopal Vittal, CEO (India, South Asia), the company said in a statement Tuesday. 

Airtel’s global enterprise service, which consists of undersea cables and data centres – under Nxtra - besides bulk voice and data services, among others, will be headed by Pankaj Miglani as chief executive-Global Business. Miglani will report to Chitkara, who earlier led the global operations. Miglani recently quit as the chief financial officer (CFO) of Airtel’s tower unit, Bharti Infratel.

""Under Ajay’s leadership, global business grew in topline to become a billion dollar business, while EBIT margins jumped five-fold since 2013,"" Airtel said.

Airtel’s B2B business as an integrated entity will help Airtel “leverage our global reach and deep relationships in the enterprise segment,” Vittal said.

ET was the first to report on Ganpathy's exit and Chitkara's appointment on Monday morning in its online edition. 

According to people familiar with the restructuring at Airtel, the telecom company is making its hierarchy less top heavy, for speedier decision making, which could be key to taking on Jio in the market, which is expected to disrupt the segment like it has done in the consumer mobile business. Jio has indicated it will step up its activities around the fibre broadband and enterprise business fronts, with phased commercial roll-outs. 

Bharti Airtel’s enterprise business for India—Airtel Business—clocked a revenue of Rs 11,322 crore in FY18, up 3% on year. The segment, which typically has higher margins than the consumer business, has steadily gained traction and was 14.9% of India revenues in FY17 and, in a year’s time, became 17.6% of the telco's Indian revenue pie. This, even as the traditional mobile services, which account for about 70% of the revenue, faces huge revenue and margin pressure.

In FY18, the Airtel B-2-B business clocked 37.4% Ebitda margins, which expanded on year, compared with 32.6% in the India mobile telephony operations, which contracted from a year earlier.

Airtel, which is aggressively protecting its revenue and subscriber base, is one of the largest enterprise players in the country and competes with the likes of Tata Communications, Vodafone India and Bharat Sanchar Nigam.

ET in early June had reported that the market leader is in talks with US telecom major Verizon for a broad partnership around Internet of Things (IoT), as it steps the pedal on market expansion in the enterprise segment. 

Fitch Ratings expects continuous growth in the company’s enterprise business segment,

along with the Africa business, to offset the challenging environment in India's mobile and home business operations.

Ganapathy had joined Airtel in 2013 as the hub CEO for Mumbai, Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat circles and was appointed as director of Airtel Business in July 2016. Chitkara, on the other hand, has been with telco since 2001 and is credited with building brand Airtel in the global wholesale segment."

0,2018-07-02,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Infratel has received the clearance from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for its merger with Indus Towers, which will create a $14.6 billion company that will be among the largest mobile tower entities worldwide with 1.63 lakh towers.

CCI's approval is the first among several approvals that are required, including from the Securities & Exchange Board of India, National Company Law Tribunal and the department of telecommunications (DoT), which may also need to give a separate approval for foreign direct investment.

""Pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, we are pleased to inform you that approval of Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been received for the proposed merger of Bharti Infratel Limited and Indus Towers Limited,"" the tower unit of India's largest carrier Bharti Airtel said in a statement to the exchanges on Monday morning.

The merger is expected to close before the end of the financial year 2018-2019.

Bharti Infratel’s scrip fell about 1% to Rs 298.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange at the end of day's trade on Monday. Bharti Airtel owns 53.5% in Infratel, which also has PE funds KKR and CPPIB as shareholders with some 10% stake.

The mobile infrastructure company is merging its operations with Indus Towers that has Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular as stakeholders. The combined entity, which will fully own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, according to the statement, will change its name to Indus Towers Ltd., and will continue to be listed on the Indian stock exchanges.

Analysts said the merger will enable the three telcos to monetise their stakes in the tower company at a time when all of them are staring at losses in India operations due to brutal competition in India. At the same time, it will enable them to retain some control over tower networks, which are critical to their operations.

Vodafone India and Idea are in the process of merging their operations. All three shareholders have said they can monetise their stake and use the funds for their respective telecom businesses.

At present, Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42%), Vodafone (42%), Aditya Birla’s Idea group (11.15%) and Providence (4.85%).

According to the deal details, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone -- equal shareholders in Indus -- will jointly control the merged company with equal board representation. Idea Cellular, which holds 11.15% in Indus, has the option to get a 7.1% stake in the new company or sell out for Rs 6,500 crore. Idea had earlier said it will exit the tower unit.

Depending on the option selected by Idea, Bharti Airtel will own either 37.2% or 33.8% in the combined entity, and Vodafone will hold 29.4% or 26.7%. Private equity major KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will together hold 6%. Providence will retain a minimum 1.1% or opt to retain its full stake in the combined company, which will be 3.1%. The remaining shareholding will be in the hands of the public."

16,2018-07-05,Bharti Infratel,"In a technically significant session on Wednesday, the Nifty50 continued its pullback as the benchmark index ended yet another day gaining 70 points, or 0.65 per cent. The session can be termed as technically important because the Nifty moved past and ended above the 50-DMA and also the short-term 20-DMA.

The previous session was a step in the direction of failing the downward breakdown that the market suffered in the previous session. If we get a positive start on Thursday and if the Nifty moves past the critical 10,775-10,800 zone, it will, for the time being, fail the breakout that it suffered from the large symmetrical triangle on the daily charts.

Thursday’s session will be important for the Nifty in more ways than one. The 10,800 and 10,835 levels will act as important resistance, while supports will come in at 10,710 and 10,660 levels.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 53.6912. It continues to remain neutral and shows no divergence against the price. The daily MACD still remains bearish as it trades below its signal line. However, it is narrowing its trajectory and moving towards a positive crossover. Apart from a white body, no significant formations were observed on the candles.



Pattern analysis shows the likelihood of a failure of the downward breakdown that the Nifty suffered a couple of days back. If the index manages to successfully move past the 10,775-10,800 zone, the breakdown seen previously can be termed as a false one.

Overall, there are higher chances of the Nifty continuing the pullback. Its closing above the 50-DMA and above the short-term 20-DMA is positive for the markets. Subject to the Nifty moving past the 10,775-10,800 range, Nifty is likely to scale higher if the ongoing momentum continues. We recommend staying away from creating short positions. Value purchases may be made, and profits should be protected until the 10,800 level is surpassed. A positive outlook is advised for the day.

Fresh long positions were seen being added in stocks like RIL, CG Power, Granules, Coal India, Kotak Bank, Bharti Infratel, Axis Bank, Lupin, M&M, Gail, Bajaj Auto, ICICI Bank and HUL.

18,2018-07-06,Bharti Infratel,"In a relatively listless session on Thursday, the Nifty50 did not make any major headway.

It oscillated in a narrow range and finally ended the day with a modest loss of 20.15 points, or 0.19 per cent. Though the Nifty continued to face resistance at the falling trend line, it displayed strength as it chose to consolidate near the resistance area rather than giving up previous day’s gains.

The pattern area resistance trend line, given its falling nature, now poses resistance at 10,750. As mentioned often in our previous notes, unless the Nifty clears the 10,750-10,800 range, it will continue to face resistance in this area and will remain vulnerable to selloffs at higher levels.

On Friday, Nifty is likely to face resistance at 10,775 and 10,800 levels while supports will come in lower at 10,710 and 10,680 levels.



Unless and until the Nifty takes a directional call towards 10,750-800 and above, we still have no option but to approach trade with a great degree of caution.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 52.3130. It continues to be neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD is still bearish as it trades below the signal line. However, it is narrowing its trajectory and moving towards a positive crossover.

No significant formations were observed on the candles. In pattern analysis, Nifty showed a sharp technical pullback after a downward breach from a large symmetrical triangle. 

While pulling up, the index once again faced resistance from the falling trend line, which originates at 11,170 and joins the subsequent lower tops. As of now, it has managed to keep its head above the 50-DMA.

Overall, as long as the Nifty continues to track the falling trend line resistance, we need to approach the market with some degree of caution. Having said this, it is also important to note that compared with its global peers, Nifty has shown good amount of resilience.

We expect a modestly positive start to Friday’s trade. It would be important to see the market’s behaviour vis-à-vis the 10750-10800 range. Until this level is breached on the upside, maintain a stock-specific and cautious view.


STOCKS TO WATCH:
Resilient technical setup is observed in stocks like Yes Bank, RIL, Subex, First Source, Ambuja Cement, Reliance Capital, Srei Infra, PTC India, Bharti Infratel and CESC.

26,2018-07-09,Bharti Infratel,"The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has conditionally approved the merger of Vodafone India with Idea Cellular, the largest M&A deal in the sector, which will displace Bharti Airtel from the No. 1 spot after over 15 years.

The conditions for approval – given over a year after the deal was announced in March 2017 – include an upfront payment of Rs 7,268 crore. The demand is split between a bank guarantee of Rs 3,342 crore to cover what Idea owes on account of one-time spectrum charges and cash of Rs 3,926 crore by Vodafone towards the market price for non-auctioned airwaves, people familiar with the matter said.

Idea is widely expected to challenge the demand, since a similar claim on Bharti Airtel while acquiring Telenor India was stayed by the Supreme Court. Idea and Vodafone didn’t comment on the matter until press time. Legal moves and counters by DoT may further delay the merger, which was expected to be completed by June-end.

“Once the companies pay up, the department will begin the transfer of Vodafone India’s licences and Vodafone Mobile Services Ltd.’s licences to Idea Cellular, which will complete the merger,” a senior official said, asking not to be identified. Vodafone’s cash dues can be paid by Idea as well, one of the people said.

The conditional approval on Monday comes on the day ET reported that the Prime Minister’s Office had sought details of the merger of the No. 2 and No. 3 telcos, which had been pending with DoT for some months and was affecting the government’s bid to improve the ease of doing business.

Among other conditions, Idea needs to replace Vodafone’s bank guarantees worth Rs 6,452 crore held by DoT with its own. This is on account of spectrum payments that fall due over the next one year.




The KM Birla Group-owned Idea will have to pledge that the telco, as the licence holder of the merged entity, will be responsible for paying Vodafone India’s one-time spectrum charges – presently stayed in the telecom tribunal – if and when such a decision is reached.

For any future dues, including those from other pending cases around spectrum usage charges and licence fee, penalties will need to be paid by the merged entity, which will remain listed. The new entity will need to pay any dues arising from the completion of the merger of Vodafone’s six subsidiaries with VMSL in 2014 and 2015. The dues have been stayed by various courts.

DoT’s conditions have been fortified after two rounds of legal opinion. The merger will result in a new entity, Vodafone Idea Ltd., which is expected to be better placed to take on competition from moneyed Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel. On their own, Idea and Vodafone have struggled to take on Jio and Airtel, widening their losses and losing revenue and subscriber market share.

Together, Vodafone Idea will have 37.5% revenue market share and 39% customer market share, or about 440 million subscribers, making them a stronger entity.


CHALLENGES AHEAD
Even so, the merged entity will face a fair share of challenges. Experts said the delay in approvals has help up critical unlocking of an estimated $10 billion of cost and capital expenditure synergies that the combined entity needs to stay competitive on the 4G front, where Jio and Airtel have taken the lead.

To start with, the delay has begun to erode the opex savings of almost $1 billion that both companies expected to achieve from the amalgamation of operations by FY20, HSBC said. “We are concerned the market still does not fully price in potential post-deal market share loss. We expect the joint entity to lose 600 basis points in the next 6-7-quarters,” HSBC said.

With a combined debt of Rs 1,14,000 crore as of March-end, the companies would have to raise funds to reduce the high leverage and increase their 4G footprint to match that of their competitors. “Vodafone and the Aditya Birla Group need to collectively inject at least Rs 15,000 crore of fresh capital into the combined entity to boost the merged entity’s 4G network capacity and bring it on comparable levels with Jio and Airtel,” said Naveen Kulkarni, a telecom analyst at PhillipCapital.

Jio’s 4G network capacity is reckoned to be at least four times bigger than that of the combined entity, while Airtel’s would be almost double. “The additional capital infusions would also help the Vodafone-Idea combined entity manage their interest costs better and reduce leverage ratio too,” Kulkarni said.

Idea has already raised over Rs 10,000 crore from the sale of its captive towers, promoter equity infusion and private placement of shares, while Vodafone has said it will infuse over Rs 7,000 crore. The two companies may monetise their stakes in the merged Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers entity to raise more funds. Idea recently got approval to raise another Rs 15,000 crore via non-convertible debentures.

Vodafone Idea has already named the top leadership headed by CEO Balesh Sharma, besides the finance, HR, operations and circle heads. Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the $44.3-billion Aditya Birla Group, will be the non-executive chairman.

Vodafone Idea will need to reduce revenue market share in Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat to less than 50% within a year of the final approval, DoT said. Its customer market share will have to be lowered below 50% in Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and UP West in one year.

Estimates suggest about 14 million customers will have to be let go to abide by the merger and acquisition rules. As per the terms of the merger, Vodafone will initially own over 45% in the combined entity, with the Aditya Birla Group owning 26%, but both have equal ownership rights. Over time, their shareholding will be equalised."

28,2018-07-11,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI | KOLKATA: British telecom major Vodafone Group on Tuesday welcomed the government’s conditional clearance to Vodafone India’s merger with Idea Cellular and said the company is upbeat about the Indian market and will remain invested here.

Outgoing Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao and his successor Nick Read met telecom minister Manoj Sinha and secretary Aruna Sundararajan on Tuesday, a day after the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) gave a conditional nod to the merger that will create India’s No 1 telco, displacing Bharti Airtel.

“We have always been a strong investor in India. We will remain that,” Read told reporters after the meeting. He said the merged entity “would remain competitive” amid continuing price wars in Indian market.

The current Vodafone group chief financial officer, Read will replace Colao as CEO on October 1. Colao, on his part, expressed hope that the new merged entity, Vodafone Idea Ltd, would be in place before he remits office.

Under the conditional merger approval given on Monday, the telecom department has demanded Rs 7,268 crore upfront payment towards dues it said the two telcos owe it. It is split between a bank guarantee of Rs 3,342 crore on account of one-time spectrum charges claimed from Idea, and cash payment of Rs 3,926 crore towards market price for non-auctioned airwaves held by Vodafone.



Vodafone and Idea have not yet decided on whether to pay or challenge in courts the demands raised by the government, said a person aware of the development.

Another person said both companies have flagged some small discrepancies in the figures, and DoT has asked them to give it in writing. The differences, though, aren’t major and can at best make a difference of a couple of hundred crores in interest calculations, the person said.

Idea’s shares climbed 2.11% to close at Rs 55.70 on BSE on Tuesday, on hopes the Kumar Mangalam Birla–led company, when combined with Vodafone, will be far stronger and competitive.

Experts, however, said the merged entity will fall short of the $10-billion projected savings by way of cost/capex synergies since the ground realities of the telecom market have changed following sustained price wars over the past 15 months, which has eroded average revenue per user (ARPUs) and operating incomes (Ebitda) at both telcos.

Nitin Soni, director at global rating firm Fitch, expects the merged entity’s cost/capex synergies to be well below the projected $10 billion and likely to be realised over 3-4 years after merger closure, especially “since tower contracts are long term and site rationalisation cannot be concluded overnight”.

“Managements of merging entities tend to overstate the quantum of synergy benefits that are seldom fully realised,” Soni said. He pointed to sustained pricing disruption fuelled by Jio’s tariff aggression, which has led to a sharp reduction in Ebitda levels of both Idea and Vodafone between March 2017 and March 2018. Vodafone India’s Ebitda shrunk over 34% on year to Rs 7,766 crore in the year ended March 2018 while Idea’s operating income plunged nearly 32% on year to Rs 1,447.3 crore in the quarter ended March.

According to the Fitch director, a potent challenge for the combined entity “would be growing Ebitda level amid continuing price wars with Jio and Airtel”, especially since the present blended industry ARPU of $1.5-1.7 is “simply not sustainable in the long run for telcos to make money.” Harsh Jagnani, telecom sector head at ICRA, said the integration of Vodafone and Idea “may see some erosion of subscribers, giving an opportunity to other operators, amid continuing intense competition and pricing pressures”.

Fitch’s Soni, however, said the promoters of Vodafone and Idea “would not have much trouble in lining up cash to make fresh equity infusions in the merged entity to spruce up 4G networks” as they could easily monetise their stakes in the Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers merged entity."

52,2018-07-19,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel is in talks with Warburg Pincus to raise as much as $1.5 billion by divesting up to 15% in its holding company for African operations, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV (BAIN BV), two people familiar with the matter told ET. 

This will be followed by a listing that will help the company repay some of its debt and fend off competition in the Indian market.

“The proposed transaction is a precursor to its planned listing of the African business in the overseas market in which Bharti Airtel aims to raise a similar amount,” said one of the persons. The proposed deal between India’s largest telecom company and US private equity firm is expected to value Bharti Airtel’s Africa unit at $8-9 billion, the person added. 

The two are discussing a sale of 10-15% stake for $1.25-1.5 billion, said the two people cited above. Both transactions are likely to be completed by December, said the second person.

Warburg was Bharti’s first marquee investor in the early 1990s. The success of that investment kicked off the private equity boom in India.

More recently, it also picked up a minority stake in Bharti’s direct-to-home (DTH) operation.

The money raised will help Bharti Airtel pay down some of its Rs 95,000- crore debt at the end of March this year.



It had a debt of over Rs 91,000 crore a year ago. The proceeds will also help bolster the telco’s efforts to stay competitive in the Indian market, where Bharti Airtel declared its first quarterly loss in the January-March period in contrast with profits in Africa.

The telco is in the midst of a prolonged price war that intensified with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016, hurting revenue and profitability. “Since the African business has turned profitable, it does not need capital for investment,” said the second person cited above. Bharti and Warburg declined to comment.

The Netherlands-based, wholly-owned unit of Bharti Airtel is the holding company of telecom operations in 14 African markets—Nigeria, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Madagascar, Niger, Kenya, Malawi, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Rwanda.

The holding company’s board had authorised the management to initiate nonbinding exploratory discussions in mid-February with various banks or intermediaries to evaluate the feasibility of listing its shares.


AFRICAN SAFARI 
Airtel’s Africa operations completed their first full year of profitability in March. Net profit amounted to Rs 1,827 crore on revenue of Rs 20,156 crore, marking a turnaround from previous years when losses mounted every quarter, dragging down consolidated numbers and casting doubt on Bharti’s strategy of expanding into the continent.

The situation has reversed, with the India operation reporting its first loss in 15 years — Rs 652 crore in the January-March quarter — weighed down by the continuing price war. It managed to stave off a loss at the consolidated level thanks to its Africa operations, which recorded a quarterly profit of Rs 698.7 crore, compared with Rs 26.3 crore a year ago. Bharti Airtel posted a consolidated profit of Rs 83 crore, down 78% year-on-year.

An overseas listing will help Bharti get better valuations for the Africa business thanks to more advantageous profit margins than the India business, said an investment banker with a foreign firm.

“The domestic market is in the midst of a price war, which is likely to continue for some time, while the African operation has now more or less stabilised,” he said. The proposed transactions—private placement to a private equity firm and subsequent initial public offer (IPO)—will not only give Bharti cash to deleverage its balance sheet, it will also enable the company to raise funds at short notice by diluting stakes in the listed company, Bharti Airtel International, in future.

“This will be similar to Bharti Infratel, where Airtel had raised billions of dollars through an IPO and subsequent sale of shares while still holding significant stake that is being diluted to raise fresh capital in the holding company, Bharti Airtel,” said one of the persons cited above.

Bharti Infratel is a Bharti Airtel unit that has raised over Rs 12,000 crore by selling minor stakes in the tower company in separate tranches over the past year."

Post the deal, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone will jointly control the combined company, and the transaction is expected to close before the end of 2018-19, subject to statutory approvals.

66,2018-07-25,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi: Bharti Infratel, India’s sole listed tower company, reported a 4% drop in net profit in the fiscal first quarter, caused mainly by ongoing consolidation of networks and spectrum among carriers which led to 
a sharp fall in co-location of telecom sites.

The telecom tower company's consolidated net profit for the April-June period came in at Rs 638 crore, from Rs 664 crore in the year-ago period. Quarterly consolidated revenue, however, rose 4% on a like-to-like basis to Rs 3,674 crore, the company said in statement Wednesday.

The results, which were announced after market hours, followed the receipt of clearance from Securities Exchange Bureau of India (SEBI) for the company’s merger with India’s largest tower company Indus Towers. It will now approach National Company Law Tribunal for approval, which will create the largest tower company outside China, with 163,000 towers across India.

Bharti Infratel’s stock rose by 0.33% to close at Rs 287.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

“With the consolidation phase largely over, the Indian telecom industry is now witnessing an integration phase as operators consolidate their networks and spectrum before the next phase of rollouts,” said Akhil Gupta, chairman, Bharti Infratel.

The company's consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 4% on-year to Rs 1,521 crore for the quarter ended June 2018, while operating free cash flow was flat at Rs 991 crore. 

Infratel's total number of towers increased by 922 on-year and 308 on-quarter to 91,759 in the April-June period. Co-locations, however, dropped sharply by 17,623 on-year and 4,818 on-quarter, to 2.07 lakh in the same time. This resulted in a 3.6% on-year fall in sharing revenue per tower to Rs 80,014."

67,2018-07-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Vodafone India’s service revenue fell 31 per cent in the first quarter amid tariff wars and cuts in some charges as India’s No. 2 telco moved to close its merger with third-ranked Idea Cellular by next month.

In what may be its last set of results as Vodafone India, the company said service revenue fell to €955 million (Rs 7,666 crore) in the three months ended June from €1.38 billion a year earlier. The decline from the preceding quarter was limited to 1.4 per cent as monthly data usage quadrupled to 4.6 GB per user on average — the largest among its regions — “following a steep decline in data prices,” Vodafone said in a statement on Wednesday.



Vodafone, which along with Idea, paid the government dues of over Rs 7,200 crore this week, said it expects the merger to close in August, having gone past the earlier deadline of June end. The combined entity, to be India’s largest, will be called Vodafone Idea Ltd. Its CEO will be Balesh Sharma and the telco will remain listed.

“In India, where competition remains intense, we have now received conditional approval from the Department of Telecommunications for the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, which we aim to close before the end of August, allowing us to unlock substantial synergies,” Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said in the statement.


New Co Expects to Log $10b in Savings

CFO Nick Read succeeds Colao from September.

Colao said after the merger, Vodafone will continue to focus on the 12 circles that accounted for 90 per cent of its operating income. The company is traditionally stronger in the urban areas, while Idea is stronger in the semi-urban and rural areas.

Pre-integration work with Idea is “well advanced, ensuring a fast start on synergy capture,” Vodafone said in a separate presentation.

The combined entity will be the largest by number of customers — some 430 million — and by revenue market share, at over 37 per cent. The new company expects to clock $10 billion in savings over time — touching $2.1billion annually by the fourth year after the merger — making it stronger to face rivals Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Vodafone Idea will start with gross debt of some Rs 125,000 crore and may need to infuse cash to pare debt and expand 4G operations to catch up with Jio and Airtel, analysts said.

On their own, Vodafone and Idea had found the competition too hot to handle, with revenue falling and earnings getting eroded. Idea is expected to widen its loss when it reports first-quarter results on July 30. 

Airtel, India’s current market leader, reports results on Thursday, followed by Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio a day later.

In the first quarter, Vodafone India recorded its lowest-ever average revenue per user (ARPU) — a key performance metric — at Rs 102 compared with Rs105 in the quarter ended March. This was mainly because subscribers opted for lowerpriced plans with similar benefits as costlier packs as Vodafone responded to competition.

“We continued to retain our highvalue customers albeit at lower price levels,” Vodafone said.


SIM Consolidation

The telco said any further impact of the tariff wars was staved off because subscribers have started spending on a single SIM, following the increased penetration of ‘unlimited’ offers, which have now been adopted by 29 per cent of its pre-paid customers.

Its total user base declined by 3 million on quarter, reflecting the ‘SIM consolidation’ trend across the market, and now totals 219.7 million, of which 77 million used data, including 30.9 million 4G subscribers, Vodafone said.

Vodafone India has done well by “holding on to its postpaid ARPU at Rs 432 despite Jio’s pricing aggression and continuing customer migration to lower-priced bundled packs from higher ones is also a definite positive, indicating good customer retention,” said Naveen Kulkarni, a telecom analyst at PhillipCapital.

The merged entity would need to infuse at least Rs 15,000 crore as fresh capital to pare debt and generate funds needed to increase the combined 4G network capacity, currently several notches below Jio and Airtel, he said.

“This is absolutely necessary if they are to stop present customer and revenue losses to competition and grow their combined user base,” he added.

The company said it is making good progress in securing regulatory approvals for merging Indus Towers into Bharti Infratel, having received clearances from the Competition Commission of India and the Securities & Exchange Board of India. “…we expect the merger to close before the end of March 2019,” it said.

Vodafone and Idea can look at monetising their stakes in Indus and infusing the funds in the new entity, experts said. CFO Read said the Vodafone Group “will focus on supporting the JV management team”."

9,2018-08-07,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, on Monday showed bullish crossovers on 30 counters on NSE. 

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Exide Industries, InterGlobe Aviation, Jubilant Foodworks, Mahindra & Mahindra, Talwalkars Better Value Fitness, Jubilant Life Sciences, GRUH Finance, JMC Projects, J Kumar Infraprojects and Kiri Industries.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw this bullish crossovers included Ashoka Buildcon, Vipul, Swan Energy, Saregama India, RPP Infra Projects, Supreme Industries, Zydus Wellness, Electrotherm (India) and Healthcare Global Enterprises.



The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

It also signalled bearish crossovers on 19 counters on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. The stocks included Indo Count Industries, KEC International, Can Fin Homes, Bharti Infratel, Tejas Networks, NIIT, Triveni Turbine and Gravita India. 



MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Market experts say the MACD alone may not be a sufficient indicator to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

On Monday, the Nifty50 climbed to a fresh closing high of 11,387, but ended up making a small bearish candle on the daily chart that resembled a Doji pattern, suggesting that investors have turned indecisive at higher levels. 

The upside appears to be capped and the index may need to hold above 11,368 level for at least the first hour of Tuesday’s session for any limited gain, say analysts.

If the index consistently trades below the 11,368 level in the first hour on Tuesday, it may come under pressure, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

“In terms of wave structure, with Monday’s move, the index has entered into the fifth leg of an ‘Impulse’ on the upside. The internal structure of the fifth leg, however, shows that it is not yet complete. This means the Nifty has the potential to tap at the short-term target of 11,450,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

“If the bulls manage to surpass the 11,450 level on a closing basis, then they can ride the trend further till 11,640. On the other hand, the 11,368-11,336 range shall act as immediate support area with a crucial support placed at 11,234,” Ratnaparkhi said. 


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the Exide Industries stock chart shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa. 

Shares of the company closed 1.63 per cent higher at Rs 277.40 on August 6."

11,2018-08-08,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Singapore’s Temasek has purchased a large single-digit stake in taxi-hailing application Ola for around $225 million, said people directly briefed on the matter.

The stake was purchased from a group of early investors in the company though Temasek is also in discussions with Ola’s management to pump in more money into the company by way of subscription to new shares. As reported earlier by ET, Ola is in discussions with new investors to raise about $1 billion. The investment will enable Ola founder Bhavish Aggarwal to diversify the company’s shareholder base, according to people in the know.

“Temasek has come in as a white knight in the company both because this will help Bhavish ensure there is more bandwidth on the board and also because as a strong sponsor they have the ability to pump in more funds,” according to an industry executive. A spokesperson for Temasek declined comment. Ola did not reply to an email query seeking comment.

Avendus Capital has been advising the shareholders on the secondary sale.

Ola competes with Uber. Japan’s SoftBank, an investor in Ola, is also amongst the biggest backers of Uber. Ola was last valued at $4 billion when it raised $400 million from Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent in September 2017.

Some employees of Ola are also expected to sell some of their shares as a part of this round in addition to angel investor Rehan Yar Khan and VC investors who received shares in Ola after its acquisition of Taxiforsure in 2015. These investors include venture firms Accel India, Bessemer Venture Partners, Helion Venture Partners and the Taxiforsure founders Aprameya Radhakrishna and Raghunandan G, who are making a partial exit, as ET reported in February.

Ola’s operating loss increased 32% to Rs 3,731 crore in fiscal 2017 while operating revenue more than doubled to Rs 1,178 crore. While the company curtailed variable costs such as advertising and promotion expenses to Rs 285 crore from Rs 438 crore in the year before, fixed costs such as salary expenses increased to Rs 572 crore from Rs 461 crore, according to the company’s filings with the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). It had cash and bank balances of around Rs. 3000 crore during that period.

The company has launched new categories of services including inter-city travel over the past eighteen months and claims to be present in 110 cities across India.

It has struck corporate partnerships with a number of companies such as Reliance Industries, Cognizant, IBM, Bharti Infratel and Taj Hotels to provide services.

Ola has also started making money on each cab ride after taking into account expenses like driver incentives and customer discounts, ET reported in its edition on 12 July.

Ola charges a commission from drivers who use the application to ferry customers. It also needs to incentivize the drivers to use its application as the preferred mode of acquiring customers in the face of stiff competition from Uber, a reason that leads to huge cash-burn according to industry experts.

Ola has struck partnerships with multiple automobile manufacturers such as Maruti, Mahindra & Mahindra and BMW to help drivers acquire vehicles at better financing terms."

24,2018-08-14,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Telecom tower companies see public infrastructure projects becoming a growing proportion of their revenue in the future. With the ongoing consolidation in the telecom industry, tower companies face declining revenue from large telecom operators that are looking to cut costs.

Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) project between the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and Indus Towers, Bimal Dayal, CEO of Indus Towers said on Monday that public infrastructure projects will play a growing role in the company’s future. 

“My take is that such smart poles and such initiatives will pop up in every city. We are very keen to replicate it. We are engaged in multiple cities and the response we are getting is quite phenomenal.” said Dayal speaking about the launch of 55 smart poles that will provide Wi-Fi Access, live CCTV monitoring, LED Lighting and air quality information.

The tower industry is facing a decline in tenancy ratios due ongoing consolidation in the telecom industry. Tenancy ratio refers to the number of tenants or operators that have set up active infrastructure including antennae per tower. 

On the possibility of future decline in tower tenancy due to the merger between Vodafone and Idea, Dayal said, “It is true that when two companies merge you will see some kind of network reorientation. But I don’t see the demand going down. What will happen is a newer stream and set of towers or radiating points would emerge”.

Director general of industry lobby group Towers and Infrastructure Provider’s Association (TAPAI), Tilak Raj Dua said that tenancy would decline in the short term but was bullish about new opportunities.

“In the short term, though current consolidation may have some impact on tenancy ratio. However, we firmly believe that in the next 1-2 years with the growing data needs tower companies will have future business opportunities such as in-building solutions, Small cells, public Wi-Fi, fibre and new tower sites etc. which will lead to significant hike in tenancy ratio,” said Dua in an emailed response to ET's queries. 

The tower industry itself is seeing consolidation with Indus Tower set to merge with Bharti Infratel, which is awaiting regulatory approvals.

26,2018-08-20,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: A top official of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said that the 5G Congress 2018, organised by ETTelecom, is very opportune in the wake of recently suggested fifth-generation or 5G spectrum sale by the regulator.

“I understand that an event on 5G and related issues is being conducted on September 19 which is very timely, particularly in keeping a view in relation to the recently-recommended auction of 5G spectrum in both— 700 Mhz and 3300 Mhz-3600Mh range,” Trai Secretary Sunil K Gupta said.

Early this month, telecom watchdog has proposed a base price of Rs 492 crore per megahertz for 5G radiowaves in the 3300 Mh -3600Mhz band, and also cut down reserve price for airwaves in the 700 Mhz band by almost 43% to Rs 6,568 crore per unit.

Being highly efficient, spectrum in the 700 Mhz band which, however was unsold in 2016 auction, can also be used by telecom service providers to rollout 5G-based services.

“The ecosystem is being developed and this will be a platform for discussions on industry issues,” Gupta added.

ETTelecom, a telecom-centric news portal of The Economic Times, is organizing a two-day conclave – The 5G Congress 2018 — to be inaugurated by Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha on September 19 in New Delhi.

The day-long second edition of The 5G Congress to be attended by more than 500 delegates, would provide a deep dive into some of the existing challenges and showcase global developments in the area of 5G technology with participation from academia, industry and policymakers.

The broad topics to be covered during the event include— 5G, a reality; network infrastructure readiness; and cross industry applications, a new revenue opportunity for telcos.

The Narendra Modi-led NDA government is aggressively eyeing India’s 5G launch in tandem with developing countries worldwide, and has already formed a high-level 5G Forum headed by Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan.

Co-chaired by the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney and the Department of Science & Technology Secretary Ashutosh Sharma, the committee includes A Paulraj, Professor Emeritus of the Stanford University in the US, Abhay Karandikar, IIT Kanpur Director and Chairman of the Telecom Development Standards Society, India (TSDSI), Bharti Airtel’s (India & South Asia) Chief Executive Gopal Vittal and Reliance Jio’s Managing Director Sanjay Mashruwala.

The panel is tasked to create a roadmap including evaluation of goals and action plan to make 5G a reality in India by 2020. 

Some of the invited industry leaders include Reliance Jio’s President Mathew Oommen, Bharti Airtel’s Chief Executive Gopal Vittal, GSMA Public Policy Head (APAC) Emanuela Lecchi, BSNL Chairman Anupam Shrivastava, Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta, Vodafone India Director- Technology Vishant Vora."

The Nifty50 opened Tuesday’s session at 11,576, while the Sensex kicked off the day at 38,360. 

As the market traded higher, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled upward crossovers for 41 stocks on NSE, meaning possibility of more upsides on these counters. 

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Bharti Infratel, Larsen & Toubro, Sequent Scientific, India Cements, Cadila Healthcare, Escorts, Magma Fincorp, Tata Power Company and Hubtown.



Some of these counters have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bullish crossover included PTC India Financial Services, Sintex Industries, Can Fin Homes, Equitas Holding, Mold-Tek Technologies, Rolta India, Jamna Auto Inds, Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, MOIL, Texmaco Rail & Engineering, Ashoka Buildcon, ADF Foods, Bombay Burmah, Dalmia Bharat Enterprises, Oberoi Realty, BLB, Greenply Industries, APCL, Syngene International, Agri-Tech (India), JMC Projects (India), Pearl Global Industries, Swaraj Engines, Advani Hotels & Resorts (India), Cimmco, Aspinwall & Company, Jayant Agro Organics, Sagar Cements, Williamson Magor & Company, Ruby Mills, SPML Infra and MPS.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in a traded security or index.

At the same the time, the indicator showed bearish crossovers on 29 counters on NSE, giving ‘sell’ signals. The stocks included Infosys, Delta Corp, Nelco, Info Edge (India), Bharat Dynamics and Magadh Sugar & Energy. 



MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Market experts say the MACD alone may not be a sufficient indicator to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the Bharti Infratel chart shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always seen an upward movement and vice versa. 

Around 10:45 am on Tuesday, shares of the company traded nearly 1 per cent higher at Rs 287.20 on NSE."

Take this: Those who had shown faith on country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki in the early days must be sitting on healthy profit today. The stock, which got listed on the bourses in July 2003, has rallied over 5,400 per cent in last 15 years. One major milestone for the stock was its entry into the elite Nifty50 club in 2004.

There are 12 other stocks which all got listed after Maruti and have seen similar fortunes after entering Club Nifty. They include TCS (listed in August 2004), UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), YES Bank (July 2005), Tech Mahindra (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infratel (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013). 

Data suggested that one of every four debutants of last 15 years, which made it to Club Nifty, gave handsome returns to investors.

Barring Coal India (down 17 per cent), all other stocks from Club Nifty have delivered positive return to investors since their listing. YES Bank has rallied nearly 3,200 per cent since listing, UltraTech Cement 1,551 per cent and TCS 1,528 per cent.

The Nifty topped the 11,700-mark for the first time ever this week coming from sub-1,500 level 15 years ago, logging a 750 per cent rise.

Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, Power Grid, NTPC, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Bharti Infratel have climbed 396 per cent, 96.30 per cent, 86 per cent, 110 per cent, 357 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto have soared 1,300 per cent and 805 per cent, respectively, since their listing in 2008.

JSW Steel, which on Tuesday qualified to enter the Club Elite, advanced over 3 per cent in early trade on Wednesday. NSE Indices said it will replace Lupin in the Nifty 50 index from September 28, 2018. 

“Change is the only constant and index structure is no exception. Over the years, the representation in Nifty50 has undergone a sea change in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy: new sectors have evolved, while some have lost relative importance in the New India,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market experts are looking bullish on most of the above-mentioned stocks. Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) with a target price of Rs 10,805. The automaker expects double-digit growth in FY19, driven by continued strength in rural markets. The company remains fully committed to launching fully electric vehicles in India in 2020, supported by access to technology from Toyota. In the interim, it will launch a strong hybrid vehicle. Shares of Maruti Suzuki traded at Rs 9,413 on Wednesday.

Country’s biggest IT major Tata Consultancy Services is among the preferred picks of brokerage Sharekhan. TCS recently reported higher-than-expected margin performance in Q1FY19, while Infosys and HCL Tech delivered on expected lines, according to Sharekhan.

BofAML recently upgraded Tech Mahindra to ‘buy’ from ‘underperform’ and raised the target price to Rs 800 from Rs 600 earlier. “We expect operating profit to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 18 per cent over FY18-21. Such growth to provide more qualitative stock rally,” the brokerage said.

Phillip Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Ports with a target price of Rs 475. “The strong cargo growth story remains intact, driven by inclusion of new ports (Ennore in FY19, Vizhinjam in FY20) and growth in logistics business. We also expect strong cash flows in FY19 and beyond, with capex peaking out and operations stabilising across assets. We view the current price as an excellent opportunity to own a superior cash-generating asset portfolio,” it said.

Motilal Oswal also has ‘buy’ ratings on Bajaj Auto, Coal India, NTPC and Power Grid."

59,2018-08-31,Bharti Infratel,"Shares of Idea Cellular rallied over 3 per cent on early Friday after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved its merger with Vodafone India.

The approval removed the last hurdle to the creation of India’s largest mobile phone company with most subscribers and revenue share, knocking off Bharti Airtel, which has held the top spot for about 15 years. 

The scrip was 3.41 per cent up at Rs 51.55 at around 9.28 am (IST). The BSE Sensex rose 0.15 per cent, to 38,746 at around the same time.

A senior executive of the Aditya Birla group, which Idea Cellular is part of, confirmed the NCLT nod. He said “announcements would be made on Friday”. 

The new entity will come into place with 440 million subscribers, 34.7 per cent revenue market share (RMS), revenue of more than Rs 60,000 crore and combined debt of over Rs 1.15 lakh crore, according to a report by ET.

On the other hand, shares of Bharti Airtel came down 0.80 per cent to Rs 379.55.

Deutsche Bank downgraded Bharti Airtel to ‘Hold’ from ‘Buy’ and slashed target price to Rs 425 from Rs 475 earlier. However, it maintained ‘Buy’ on Idea Cellular with a revised target price of Rs 100 against Rs 105 earlier. 

It upgraded Bharti Infratel to ‘Buy’ from ‘Hold’ and also cut target price to Rs 345 from Rs 370 earlier. 

“India becomes a 3-player market. Fight is for next billion eyeballs and content is the new battle ground,” said Deutsche Bank.

JPMorgan maintained ‘Underperform’ on Idea Cellular with a target price of Rs 50. “Idea has received NCLT approval for the merger with Vodafone India. Post-merger math does not look good unless we see revenue recovery. Post-merger opex/capex reduction assumptions can get undermined if RJio maintains its current aggressive pricing and market share posture beyond FY19,” JPMorgan said."

Global Stocks extend fall
Major global markets fell on Wednesday, extending the losing streak to fourth consecutive day on lingering trade-war worries and an indecisive fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Strengthening US dollar also caught investors’ attention amid a sell-off in global stocks. A looming deadline in the US-China trade conflict kept the dollar near two-week highs on Wednesday, inflicting fresh losses on emerging markets and sending world stocks lower for the fourth day in a row, Reuters reported. US and Canada will resume their talks on Wednesday on revamping NAFTA norms amid speculation that Canada will stick to its stand. Any standoff between the two economies may not augur well to global markets.


Rupee extends fall
Rupee’s fall has become a norm it seems. The Indian currency touched a fresh record low of 71.965 against the US dollar. This year so far, the rupee is down over 10 per cent, only to emerge the worst performing currency in Asia. Rising crude oil prices, turmoil in emerging markets and strengthening dollar are the main reasons behind the plight of the rupee. 


India’s services PMI
India’s services sector activity grew at a slower pace in August, compared with July's 21-month high on account of a decline in business orders. The seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index fell from July's peak of 54.2 to 51.5 in August owing to weakest growth in new work in three months, PTI reported. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

Though the management of BEL mentioned that its existing order book of Rs 500 billion will not be impacted, this is a structural negative for BEL and all Defense PSUs, ET reported.

31,2018-09-09,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Infratel is likely to suffer declines in revenue and operating income for three years till 2019-20 following the first wave of tenancy cancellations by the Vodafone India-Idea Cellular combined entity, analysts said.

Swiss brokerage UBS has estimated that the tower unit of Bharti Airtel would see “a 10-12% decline in revenue and 15-18% fall in operating income or ‘Ebitda’ during FY18-20 to reflect the latest tenancy cancellations by Vodafone Idea”.

Last week, Bharti Infratel received notices from Vodafone Idea Limited to shut down a whopping 27,447 tenancies, effective September 1, which would translate in revenue losses of Rs 60-65 crore a month for the telecom tower company.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said it expects Bharti Infratel to receive more tenancy cancellation notices from Vodafone Idea as the latter had earlier indicated the existence of “73K overlapping sites”.

“As Vodafone Idea has just started networks integration, we do not rule out the possibility of further tenancy cancellations in the next 12 months,” the US brokerage said in a note, which was seen by ET.

UBS has said “it is unclear” whether Bharti Infratel would be able to claim the entire penalty for early exits by Vodafone Idea. “We estimate total exit penalties could be Rs 1,400-1,500 crore, but conservatively assume Bharti Infratel will collect only 25% of the sum, with the balance adjusted against future revenues,” it said.

Bharti Infratel has said in a regulatory filing that it expects the net reduction in consolidated revenue would be mitigated by exit charges and incremental revenues on account of anticipated new network rollouts by operators in future.

Edelweiss, however, said growth opportunities for Bharti Infratel “are limited,” especially with “Reliance Jio Infocomm rolling out its own towers and Vodafone Idea on consolidation mode”.

Bharti Infratel, it said, “needs to deploy capital in related businesses such as fibre optic networks and smart cities to optimise returns for equity shareholders”.

Brokerage IIFL Institutional Equities, however, said the Bharti group’s recent move “to float a fibreco” could limit potential upsides for Bharti Infratel.

“Fibre sharing would have been a natural extension of the tower sharing business, especially when telcos are planning large home broadband ramp-ups, but such upsides may be limited for the future Indus-Bharti Infratel merged entity as Bharti has moved its fibre assets to its subsidiary, Telesonic Networks,” Edelweiss said in a note to clients.

BankAm-Merrill Lynch, however, said India would require many more telecom towers to meet a sizeable “data requirement of (a potential) 700 million subscribers consuming 10 GB of data per month”. The Indus-Infratel combined entity, it said, is “best placed to address it”.

Analysts also said they expect the Indus-Bharti Infratel combined tower entity to emerge as a truly independent company with the likelihood of a core stakeholders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel jointly negotiating a block sale of their combined 66.6% controlling stake to a third party, post closure of the mega merger of the tower companies in March next year.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea will jointly control the merged tower entity, to be called Indus Towers Ltd, with equal board representation."

India’s technology industry will see more billion-dollar acquisitions as the next big battleground for foreign Internet companies, according to boutique advisory firm Raine Group LLC.

The e-commerce, financial technology and emerging media sectors will see strong deal activity, said Gaurav Mehta, the Mumbai-based country head at Raine, which advised on India’s two biggest tech deals this year. Companies have also started to see the logic of consolidation even in high-growth markets like India, Mehta said in an interview last month.

Walmart Inc. agreed in May to buy control of Flipkart Online Services Pvt for $16 billion in the world’s biggest e-commerce takeover this year. Last month, billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to invest in the owner of Indian digital payments leader Paytm.

“The largest companies in the world are playing a very active role in how the sector landscape evolves in India,” Mehta said. “M&A driven by more strategic, long-term factors is seeing record activity.”


Internet Penetration

New York-based Raine -- which focuses on tech, media and telecom deals -- ranks fourth among advisers on takeovers involving Indian companies this year, the data show. Its investment arm, which runs private equity and venture capital funds in addition to a hedge fund, has more than $2.5 billion of assets under management, according to its website.

The boutique advisory firm, which opened its Mumbai office last year, advised one of Flipkart’s backers on the internet retailer’s sale to Walmart, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It also worked with an Indus Towers Ltd. investor on the company’s merger with Bharti Infratel Ltd., which will create a $14.6 billion wireless infrastructure operator in the second-biggest Indian tech deal this year.

Global technology companies are being drawn to do deals in India as mobile internet penetration increases and digital payments boost consumer spending, Mehta said.

“For a number of years, global strategics sat on the sidelines,” he said. The “realization is setting in that India is too strategic a market to be underweight.”"

41,2018-09-12,Bharti Infratel,"The selloff in the domestic equity market has dragged the benchmark Nifty over 3 per cent down in September so far. The index slipped to 11,287 on September 11 from 11,680 on August 31.

In the process, more than 20 stocks in the Nifty50 index have slipped below their 200- day moving average (DMA). The list included Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Eicher Motors, Grasim, Hero MotoCorp, Hindalco Industries, HPCL, IOC, Maruti Suzuki, Power Grid, Tata Steel and Vedanta. 

On the Nifty500, as many as 344 stocks or as much as 69 per cent of the index pack, now trade below their 200-DMAs, reflecting intense selling pressure across sectors. 

Other stocks trading below this crucial support line include ACC, Aditya Birla Capital, Aegis Logistics, Ashoka Buildcon, Avanti Feeds, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bajaj Electricals, Birla Corporation, Emami, Engineers India, Finolex Cables, Godrej Properties, Indiabulls Housing Finance and MMTC, among others. 

Moving averages normally help market participants analyse an emerging trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance points.

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major DMAs or daily moving averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is said to be in a continuing uptrend. 

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections make stocks test their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause a stock not only to test the 200 DMA but also slip below it.







“Without doubt stocks quoting below their 200-day moving averages are sentimentally weak, suggesting that they are in a long-term downtrend. However, as the bull market remains intact at this point, if any scrip from the largecap space or midcap space with promising fundamentals is trading below its 200-day moving average, it can be considered as an investment opportunity,” said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

“We advise traders to read 200 DMA only as one a tool to gauge long-term trends, but not as a trading tool, unless a particular scrip has a history of testing its 200- day moving average and bouncing back. Often, we find scrips or indices yo-yoing around these averages which don’t help take a near-term trading call,” Mohammad said.

NSE’s Nifty index traded almost flat at 11,300 in morning deals on Wednesday. 

In the recent corrective move that the market has seen after marking a high at 11,760, there were many stocks ruling at or below their 200-DMAs. These stocks present an attractive opportunity for value purchase. While doing so, investors need to exercise some discretion, said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“Not all such stocks that rule below 200-DMA may offer value buying opportunity. While attempting to make a value purchase, one will need to remain highly sector specific and pick stocks only from those sectors which are showing an improvement on the relative momentum front,” Vaishnav said."

45,2018-09-17,Bharti Infratel,"The board of Vodafone Idea Ltd. (VIL) has approved the merger of its unit Aditya Birla Telecom Ltd. (ABTL) with itself, moving a step closer towards monetizing the company's 11.15% stake in Indus Towers to pare debt.

In a statement to the stock exchanges on Monday, Vodafone Idea said , “the move would strengthen the financial position and ability"" of VIL by ""raising resources against the assets"" owned by VIL such as mutual funds, Indus Towers Ltd. etc, including monetisation of such assets"".

Idea cellular’s stock ended 2.7% higher at Rs 47.65 on the BSE on Monday, outperforming a weak broader market. The announcement came after market hours.

British telecom giant Vodafone’s India subsidiary and the Aditya Birla Group company Idea Cellular last month merged to form the country’s largest telecom operator, Vodafone Idea Ltd. The merger between the giants was catalyzed by the onslaught of tariff war launched by Reliance Jio Infocomm which has already garnered over 20% revenue market share in just two years of launching its services.

As per an agreement between Indus shareholders, VIL can raise Rs 5,100 crore in cash from the sale of Idea Cellular’s 11.15% stake in the telecom tower company, which is a three-way venture between Idea, Vodafone and Bharti Airtel. Idea owns its stake in Indus through ABTL. 

Separately, Indus is itself merging with Bharti Infratel, a unit of Bharti Airtel. 

The new entity already has a debt of more than Rs 1.09 lakh crore and is expected to use the funds to pare its debt. 

The notice to the stock exchange further said that the move to merge the ABTL would lead to simplification of the corporate structure, efficient and economical management and control over the running of businesses of the subsidiaries and in creating better synergies across the group.

The filing said ABTL recorded a revenue of Rs 3.7 crore for the financial year 2017-18 while VIL (formerly Idea Cellular) registered around Rs27,829 crore for the same period.

While ABTL had a net worth of Rs 6,189 crore, VIL had a net worth of Rs 25,670 crore as of March 31, 2018.

In a separate filing on Monday, VIL also informed BSE that Tarjani Vakil, an independent director on the company’s board had resigned,citing personal reasons. Instead, Neena Gupta was appointed as independent director on the company’s board for a period of three years."

53,2018-09-25,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Weak global cues, rising crude oil prices and rupee's bumpy ride weighed on domestic equity benchmarks on Tuesday.

Sensex and Nifty opened in the green but failed to hold altitude in the absence of any positive trigger. 

The rupee on Tuesday slipped 32 paise to 72.95 against the US dollar in early trade after crude prices soared ahead of impending US sanctions on Iran.

As per Reuters, Oil markets opened strongly on Tuesday, with Brent crude remaining near a four-year reached the previous session. Global Benchmark Brent crude jumped more than 3 per cent on Monday to a four-year high above $80 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by US President Donald Trump for action to raise global supply.

56,2018-09-25,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: August was a tricky month for domestic equity fund managers, as there was a spike in redemptions and a marked slowdown in flows to equity-linked funds, thanks to fragile investor sentiment amid US-China trade war, emerging market contagion and a rupee depreciation.

Amid such volatility, fund managers were busy buying some of the Nifty stocks such as Adani Ports & SEZ, Vedanta, Tech Mahindra, Indiabulls Housing, HDFC and Asian Paints, data showed. 


Top MF picks in volume terms

Adani Ports, where each of 18 funds held 2 per cent or less, saw the holding of the institutional category rise 15.4 per cent by the end of August from that in July. MFs held 3.95 crore Adani Ports shares at the end of August.

Some 18 funds raised their cumulative holding in ITC by 11.9 per cent in August from that in July. Among others, Tech Mahindra (up 11.9 per cent), Indiabulls Housing (up 10 per cent), HDFC (up 6.6 per cent) and Asian Paints (6.3 per cent) witnessed good buying by MFs during the month.

Increase in MF holdings in value terms

BSE Bankex gained 2.4 per cent during the month, and BSE IT index 7 per cent. The Sensex gyrated in a 1,900-point range during the month, while Nifty50 swung in a 500-point range.

ICICI Bank saw net buying by eight of the top 20 funds. MFs collectively bought 40 lakh shares in the private lender. However, the change in mutual fund holding in the bank in value terms was largely in line with 12.7 per cent surge on the counter during the month.

In case of ITC, MF holdings increased by 7.2 million shares, or 0.8 per cent, to 924.4 million shares. The value of MF holding on the counter rose by 8.4 per cent, or Rs 2,280 crore, to Rs 29,570 crore. The stock rose 7.4 per cent during the month.

The BSE’s m-cap has now overall tanked by Rs 15.74 lakh crore since August 31. 

After taking a day’s weather on Monday, the benchmark equity indices again came under heavy selling pressure today on soaring crude oil prices and tumbling rupee.

The 30-share Sensex settled 550.51 points or 1.51 per cent lower at 35,975.63. The 50-share Nifty dipped 150.05 points, or 1.36 per cent, to 10858.25.

The rupee crashed below the 73-mark against the dollar for the first time ever in today’s trade on strong demand for the American currency from importers amid rising global oil prices and unabated capital outflows. Brent crude oil was hovering around $85 per barrel in the afternoon trade.

“Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee, as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to brent crude movements and with current pace 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels,” said Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities.

The core sectors had expanded by 7.3 per cent in July 2018.

Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research said, “Volatility continues to expand as Nifty pares its previous gain to end at 10,858, its lowest level in recent fall from 11,750 levels. Continuous rise in the oil prices with brent hitting $85 mark rose some eyebrows and worries. Crude was above $75 mark and worries over CAD and its impact of widening. Rupee depreciated to multi-year lows as it hit above 73 marks was, on the other hand, fuelled the sentiment.”"

26,2018-10-04,Bharti Infratel,"Thursday’s market mayhem wiped out Rs 3.31 lakh crore from equity investors’ wealth, as market capital isation of the BSE-listed firms declined from Rs 143.71 lakh crore to Rs 140.40 lakh crore.

Index-wise, market capitalistation of BSE 100, BSE200 and BSE 500 slipped by Rs 12,000 crore, Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 39,000 crore, respectively.

The BSE Midcap index declined 1.93 per cent, while the BSE Smallcap index plunged 2.07 per cent.

The Indian market has been seeing a sharp selloff on account of depreciation in rupee and higher crude prices. This negative sentiment was further reinforced by the fear of liquidity crisis to support credit growth following the IL&FS scare, said Nitasha Shankar, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities.

“We believe the long-term story of Indian market remains intact. Therefore, this fall should be treated as an opportunity to accumulate fundamentally strong companies where valuations have corrected to attractive levels,” she said.

The BSE Sensex tanked 2.24 per cent, or 806.47 points, to end the day at 35,169, registering its biggest fall since February 2, 2018. NSE’s Nifty50 dipped 2.39 per cent, or 259 per cent, to 10,599.

Earlier during the day, the local currency cracked to a fresh low of 73.77 against the US dollar following a surge in globe oil prices, growing worries about current account deficit and capital outflows.

Shares of oil marketing companies fell like ninepins after the government announced a Rs 2.50 per litre cut in petrol and diesel prices, factoring in an excise duty reduction of Rs 1.50 per litre and asking oil companies to absorb another Re 1.

Shares of HPCL, BPCL and IndianOil declined 22.44 per cent, 18.88 per cent and 18.24 per cent, respectively, while those of ONGC and Reliance Industries dipped up to 10 per cent. Following the weak performance of oil majors, the BSE Oil & Gas index fell over 6 per cent.

The BSE IT, Healthcare, TECk, FMCG and Telecom indices dipped between 1.50 per cent and 3.50 per cent. Other sectoral indices also ended the day in the red.

Going against the wind, shares of ICICI Bank, Bharti Infratel, UltraTech Cement, Axis Bank and L&T gained between 1 per cent and 4 per cent.

Rusmik Oza, Senior VP (Head of Fundamental Research), Kotak Securities said, “Sensex and Nifty slipped sharply on the back of selling witnessed across all Asian markets. Since most Asian markets are importers of crude the impact of rising crude prices and rising dollar Index will weigh on their trade balance. Among Asian markets, India is the highest importer of crude after China hence the impact on India’s trade deficit is very high.”

FPIs have also been selling in emerging markets whose impact was visible in Indian market too. The Nifty broke the 200-day moving average (DMA) placed at 10,777, which intensified selling by market participants.

“If Nifty sustains below the 200 DMA for more than a week, then the floor can shift to 10,000 on the downside,” said Oza."

The Nifty50 index opened in the negative and drifted toward the 10,550 level in Thursday’s trade, as it broke its 50% retracement of 10,850 and 61.80% retracement of 10,650 of the entire upward swing from 9,952 to 11,760 levels.

The index also slipped below its rising trend line on the weekly scale by connecting the swing lows of 7,893, 9,952 and 10,850 levels. The index witnessed sustained selling pressure for the entire session and formed a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the daily scale.

It also breached its 200-day EMA. As long as it holds below 10,850, the index may continue its weakness towards 10,500 and then 10,350 levels, while on the upside, the immediate hurdle is seen at 10,750.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,700 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,200. There was significant Call writing at 11,000 followed by 10,900 while Put writing was seen at 10,500 and 10,600 levels. The option band signified a shift in the lower trading range with its immediate hurdle at 10,850.

India VIX moved up 4.39 per cent to 18.91. Volatility is not cooling down, which is not giving relief to the bulls and suggests a tighter bear grip in the market.

Bank Nifty opened in the negative, but managed to respect its intraday support at 24,500 and witnessed some recovery from the lower levels. The index formed a Hammer candle on the daily scale, but the major trend was negative on the weekly scale. It has been forming lower top and lower bottom from last five weeks and every bounce is being sold into.

Bank Nifty breached its crucial support trend line formed by connecting the swing lows of 21,386, 23,605 and 24,678 levels. It finally broke its consolidation range of past six trading sessions. As long as it remains below 25,250, overall weakness could drag Nifty towards 24,500 and then 24,250 levels, while a medium-term hurdle is seen in the 25,500-25,650 zone.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 2.70 per cent at 10,599. Longs were seen in ICICI Bank, L&T, Indigo and Bharti Infratel while shorts were seen in RIL, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp and TCS.

Rupee's poor health, surging crude oil prices and firming US bond yields weighed on market sentiment.

Investors avoided riskier equities and turned to safe bets, including gold and treasury bonds.

The rupee hit a fresh record low of 73.77 against the American currency in early trade on Thursday after the dollar index stood tall, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.

Higher US yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets, however, as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies, Reuters reported.

Mood was decidedly cautious ahead of the RBI policy meeting decision tomorrow.


What dampened market sentiment? Here are five factors.


Rupee at record low: A falling rupee weighed heavy on investor sentiment. The local currency plunged to its fresh record low of 73.77 against the dollar early Thursday. The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever. The dollar index stood tall against other currencies, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.

“Dollar dominated the last 24 hours as the rupee collapsed to a fresh all-time low on spot. Policymakers tried everything, monetary intervention, and verbal steroids and even tried to circulate rumours about an ""oil window"". Nothing worked. The RBI added fuel to fire by denying any attempts to introduce special dollar window for the oil marketing companies. Oil was on the boil, local equity and bond markets were under the hammer. If that was not enough, rising Italian credit spreads whacked the euro, further pressuring the rupee,” Kotak Securities said in a report.


Boiling oil: Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel in morning deals while WTI crude was above $76 per barrel. Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities, said, “Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.”


Rising bond yields: Hardening bond yields are creating waves of panic in the domestic equity market. India’s 10-year bond yield was hovering above 8.18 per cent on Thursday against previous close of 8.11 per cent. Bond yields have spiked 84 basis points on a year-to-date basis.


Foreign capital outflows: Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far. They sold shares worth Rs 1,488.96 crore in September. However, their net investment stood at Rs 262.72 crore in August, as per data available with depository NSDL. 

According to the data released by the NSE, FIIs were net sellers of Rs 2,056.87 crore in index futures and options segments, according to Wednesday’s data. FIIs were net sellers of index futures to the tune of Rs 699.54 crore and net sellers of index options worth Rs 1357.33 crore.

US Treasury yields reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note's yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs after economic data on Wednesday bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December and beyond.


Weak Asian cues: Subdued Asian markets spoiled market sentiment too. Japan's Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Thursday morning as investors took profit from its recent rally to a 27-year high while automakers and technology heavyweights took limelight on news of technology tie-ups for self-driving cars. Nikkei225 was trading 0.46 per cent down at 23,999 while Hang Seng came down over 1.50 per cent at 26,628.64."

32,2018-10-06,Bharti Infratel,"India’s new telecom market leader Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL), which will present consolidated earnings for the first time, is likely to report a sizeable loss in the fiscal second quarter ended September 30, paced by low subscriber additions and rising 4G network expansion costs.

No. 2 carrier Bharti Airtel is also likely to post a significant consolidated net loss in the July-September quarter – a first in nearly 15 years – hit by a combination of factors such as mounting costs, rupee depreciation, and customer losses after the reduction in the price of JioPhones. Reliance Industries’ recent featurephone exchange offer had lowered the price of JioPhones.

Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm, though, is likely to yet again outshine older rivals by reporting a higher net profit, propelled by strong customer adds and healthy uptake of its 4G feature-phones.

For Vodafone Idea, brokerages IIFL Institutional Equities and ICICI Securities estimated a net loss in the vicinity of ₹2,600 crore, although Credit Suisse pegged it lower at ₹1050.5 crore. Revenue is estimated to be in the ₹7,813-8,106 crore range for the September quarter.

Brokerages expect Bharti Airtel to report a net loss in the range of ₹8.4 crore to ₹1,266 crore. The company had posted a ₹97.3 crore net profit in the June quarter, helped by a one-time exceptional gain, and a ₹343 crore net profit in the same quarter a year ago.

The wide variation in Airtel’s loss estimates is due to the possibility of the telco being hit by high depreciation and interest costs in the September quarter. Also, since 30 per cent of Airtel’s consolidated debt is dollar-linked, a 5 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the US currency in the quarter is expected to widen the losses by as much as ₹500 crore, said brokerage CLSA. Analysts also expect Airtel’s capex burden to rise since 50 per cent of the company’s $3-billion India capex is in dollars.

Jio is estimated to report its fourth successive quarter in the black, with analysts pencilling in a higher net profit in the ₹622-795 crore range, propelled by 33 million subscriber adds during the July-September period.

Shares in Vodafone Idea closed nearly 1 per cent lower on BSE on Friday at ₹33.55, while the Bharti Airtel scrip fell nearly 4.3 per cent to ₹296.75.

BNP Paribas expects VIL and Airtel to report another weak quarter, with revenue declines due to “loss of customers post the recent JioPhone price cut and seasonal weakness”.

Analysts said reduction in JioPhone’s pricing from an earlier ₹1,500 deposit to a flat exchange price of ₹501 has been the most aggressive move by the 4G entrant in the July-September period, which will particularly hit prepaid revenues of the two incumbent carriers.

Vodafone Idea, it said, might also have to shell out a hefty penalty for exiting tower contracts, which if fully provided, could be to “the tune of ₹3,000-3500 crore, but is likely to be treated as an extraordinary item”.

Bank of America estimates Airtel’s India cellular revenue “will decline 3 per cent on-quarter” due to the “Jio feature-phone impact on prepaid revenues, coupled with post-paid weakness”.

Brokerage CLSA, though, expects Airtel to report strong performance in Africa amid stable local currencies, and estimates 6 per cent sequential growth in quarterly revenues in the continent.

IDFC Securities said a combination of “weak seasonality, rising fuel costs and site rollouts would weigh on the operating income (Ebitda) performance of the incumbent operators”.

Credit Suisse said “timely completion of Airtel’s plans to raise capital by listing its Africa business, and later selling its stake in the Bharti Infratel-Indus (combined tower entity) would be important for the Sunil Mittal-led telco to sustain capex investments on a par with Jio”.

The Swiss brokerage estimates Airtel’s consolidated revenue in FY19 second quarter to fall 6.7 per cent from ₹21,777 crore a year ago. In marked contrast, Jio’s revenue is expected to jump 48 per cent from ₹6,147 crore a year earlier."
34,2018-10-09,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: A day after logging gains, the domestic equity market returned to the negative territory on Tuesday on losses in select auto, FMCG, bank and energy heavyweights amid a record-setting fall in the rupee and uninspiring global cues.

Cautious investors kept their bets restrained ahead of corporate earnings, while absence of any positive trigger kept sentiments subdued.

Analysts said the market may slide further due to concerns around rising crude oil prices after US sanctions on Iran comes into effect next month. 

Nomura (India) said a further 5-10 per cent downside in the Indian stock indices in the near term cannot be ruled out. 

International ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said the cut in excise duty on petroleum products will inflate fiscal deficit and reduce combined Ebitda margins of IOC, HPCL and BPCL by Rs 6,500 crore this financial year.

33,2018-10-09,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The government is working on a proposal that would benefit incumbent service providers and infrastructure firms to significantly increase fibre deployment that could facilitate Wi-Fi hotspots and enhance fourth generation or 4G coverage in the country.

“We are working on a scheme wherein service operators or infrastructure companies can take fibre from BharatNet to the towers. This is apart from taking fibre for mobile connectivity,” telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan told ET.

Currently, only 22% of the 4.70 lakh telecom towers in India are fiberised, which is an essential backhaul requirement for highspeed data network deployments.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is planning to provide access to optic fibre cable deployed under the ambitious Bharat-Net initiative to nearby telecom towers that would also eventually help in rolling out public Wi-Fi hotspots.

“Tower companies are keen to take fibre to the towers. Telcos want to upgrade to 4G, and for that they need fibre,” the top official added.

The department has recently held talks with telecom infrastructure firms led by lobby group Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (Taipa) to speed up fiberisation of tower infrastructure. The group has proposed free Right-of-Way (RoW) and monetisation opportunities for the governmentowned dark fibre.

Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta headed Taipa felt that the demand must come from the service providers, and tower firms, due to growing data demand, would take up fibre distribution in tier-I cities, to start with. “Due to public Wi-Fi rollout, all telecom service providers have agreed to fast-track 4G rollouts,” Sundararajan said, adding that there was a big acceleration in 4G play as the government mulls viability gap funding under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) for Wi-Fi initiative.

The industry estimates say fibreconnected towers would grow from 90,000 at present to 330,000 by 2020. “Tower companies should either deploy fibre at their own to existing tower base rapidly or use new BharatNet networks that are connecting rural India,” said Anand Agarwal, group CEO of Sterlite Tech. Agarwal said it would be a win-win situation as the initiative would improve service quality with a reduction in deployment time, and added that the ecosystem should achieve 4G network requirements and move faster towards 100% fiberisation."

The Nifty50 opened in the positive and witnessed a strong recovery of around 180 points to settle Wednesday’s session at 10,480. The index finally negated the formation of lower highs after six sessions and formed a bullish candle on a daily scale.

Recently, it had taken support at its rising trend line by connecting the major swing lows of 6,825, 7,893 and 10,200 levels on the weekly chart. Now an immediate hold above 10,350 can extend its bounce towards 10,500-10,550 zone and even higher, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,300 and then 10,200 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,000, followed by 10,500, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,800. There was Put writing at 10,400 and 10,500 levels, while Call unwinding was seen at all the immediate strike prices.

The option band signified a hold of support at lower levels with a broader trading band between 10,300 and 10,600 levels.

India VIX fell 9.38 per cent to 17.91. A decline in VIX from higher levels with a topping out formation has resulted in short-term stability and triggered an immediate bounceback. Now VIX has to further cool down below 16-15 levels to extend the market recovery.

44,2018-10-15,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Corporate India announced merger and acquisitions (M&As) worth USD 11.5 billion in the third quarter of this year, following which the January-September deal tally stood at USD 76.03 billion, says a report.

""Strong earnings, promising demographics and big ticket deals drove the M&A activity, clocking deals worth USD 76 billion from over 350 transactions,"" said Prashant Mehra, Partner Grant Thornton India LLP.

Moreover, large deals such as Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart, merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, UPL's acquisition of Arysta LifeScience and some other large deals in this space resulted in a two fold jump in deal activity compared to the same period in 2017, Mehra added.

According to the report, there were 130 M&A deals worth USD 11.5 billion in the third quarter of the current year, registering a five fold jump over last year, when transactions worth USD 2.14 billion were announced through 119 transactions.

The significant uptrend in the third quarter deal activity was driven by outbound activity, which was a result of domestic companies trying to establish presence in the international markets coupled with domestic consolidation, the report said.

Moreover, the July-September quarter recorded two deals in the billion dollar club and 12 deals estimated and valued at and above USD 100 million each together capturing 89 per cent of total M&A values.

A sector-wise analysis showed that, the agriculture sector led the deal activity in the third quarter of this year, accounting for 37 per cent of the total deal value, driven by UPL Ltd's acquisition of Arysta LifeScience Inc for USD 4.2 billion.

The pharma sector remained active during the July-September quarter, recording eight deals worth USD 1.3 billion, with Aurobindo Pharma's acquisition of the dermatology business and generic US oral solids portfolio of Sandoz Inc.

It was followed by Constellation Alpha Capital Corp's acquisition of Medall Healthcare for USD 212 million, marking the largest investment in an Indian diagnostics company till date, the report said.

The start-up sector meanwhile, led in terms of deal volumes, capturing a 22 per cent share as a result of revived domestic investors' interest in the FinTech segment followed by travel and on-demand services platform.

Going ahead, ""with the insolvency regime being the main catalyst, we expect an increase in restructuring activities, apart from also experiencing a new renaissance in the M&A and the restructuring horizon,"" Mehra said.

However, in the run-up to the elections, we could expect investors and corporates to adopt a more cautious approach over the course of the coming months, he added."

48,2018-10-16,Bharti Infratel,"Remaining invested with schemes that have a focused approach in selecting large-sized companies is one way to deal with the heightened volatility in markets. A key reason for this approach is that large-sized companies that have a long operational history have experienced differing demand and market cycles, which are better placed to contain the downside for investors.

Among the large-cap schemes, ICICI Prudential Bluechip focuses on bluechip companies. Launched in 2008, the scheme suits well for conservative investors who have reasonable expectations in returns. Besides consistency in its performance, the scheme is known to protect the downside in bear cycles over the past 10 years. This is largely due to keen focus on quality companies. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 10% and 15% returns while its benchmark index Nifty 100 TRI has given 10% and 13.7% returns.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers Priyanka Khandelwal, Rajat Chandak and Anish Tawakley have enhanced exposure in large-cap stocks across sectors which have reasonably good visibility of revenues and turned attractive in the recent fall in markets. A few prominent stocks in the scheme are: HDFC, Vedanta, and SBI Life Insurance.

46,2018-10-16,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company has teamed up with US-based alternative investment manager Oaktree Capital to buy Rs 4,000 crore which telecom tower company GTL Infrastructure owed a consortium of lenders in a transaction completed before September-end.

However, not all lenders have sold their loans to the ARC. Just before this deal was sealed, Canara Bank took GTL Infra to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) hoping to recover more. The company owes Canara Bank Rs 1,000 crore.

Edelweiss, along with Oaktree and some other US investors like Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, bought about 90 per cent of the total loans due to lenders paying .Rs 2,400 crore in cash which represents about 60 per cent of the value of the loan, Edelweiss ARC chief executive officer RK Bansal said.

Of the Rs 2,400 crore invested to buy GTL Infra’s loans, 15 per cent has been put in by Edelweiss while the rest has been invested by foreign investors, led by Oaktree. Purchase of this debt makes Edelweiss a creditor to GTL Infra and hence making it a party to the NCLT proceedings against the company initiated by Canara Bank. However, Edelweiss is confident of attracting a good price for GTL’s telecom infrastructure.

“We may have to invest in the company initially to ensure that some dues are paid and the towers are in running condition. After that we expect demand for this company because, with the expansion of the telecom business, both new and old companies will need a good tower network,” Bansal said talking of the logic for loan acquisition.

GTL Infra, with 28,000 towers across all 22 Telecom Circles in India, is one of the largest independent tower firms. The aggressive expansion of Reliance Jio forced a consolidation in the telecom sector.

In April, Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group announced an agreement for the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel to create the largest mobile tower operator in the world outside China with 163,000 towers. GTL’s loans were earlier restructured under a strategic debt restructuring programme through which its Rs 8,000-crore loan exposure was reduced to half."

50,2018-10-21,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The week gone by induced further pessimism in the market, as the benchmark indices saw deep cuts amid concerns over financial health and liquidity crisis in the NBFC sector, rising oil prices and a fast weakening rupee.

The BSE Sensex dropped 417.95 points, or 1.20 per cent, for the week to settle at 34,315 on Friday, while the Nifty50 tanked 168.95 points, or 1.61 per cent, to end at 10,303. Friday’s selloff wiped off Rs 1.60 lakh crore of equity investors’ wealth.

Even some solid earnings numbers from blue chip firms like Reliance Industries and Infosys failed to lift the mood. Sustained capital outflow has created a gloomy atmosphere, dealing a body blow to risk-appetite. Every rise in market is meeting with a wave of profit-booking. Overseas investors have pulled out roughly over Rs 20,000 crore from the domestic markets so far in October.

Going into a new week, things do not look any better. Going by analyst observations, here is a list of factors that will influence market movement next week.


Liquidity and NBFC issuesA perceived liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) has made investors wary despite a slew of measures from the government and RBI to address the issue. After the IL&FS crisis, even the slightest indication of problem in an NBFC has led to a selloff. “RBI is trying to inject liquidity, but confidence needs to be restored in the system to ensure that it continues to function,” Sudip Bandyopadhyay, group chairman, Inditrade Capital, said in an interview with ET Now. “If the liquidity crunch is allowed to continue unabated, it may lead to solvency issues and that will be disastrous. We will have to see how that gets handled over the next 10-15 days,” he said. The efficacy of RBI’s decision to relax liquidity norms and allow more bank lending to NBFCs will be assessed in the coming days. 


F&O rolloverOctober series futures and options will expire on Thursday and rollover of positions will dominate proceedings through the week. “Friday's data showed maximum Put open interest was at 10,000 followed by 10,200, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,600,” said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. “There was meaningful Call writing at 10,400 followed by 10,600, while Put writing was seen at 10,200 followed by 10,100. The option band signified a trading band between 10,200 and 10,500 levels. On Friday, Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,314 with a loss of 1.24 per cent,” he said. F&O rollovers may increase volatility in the market.


Rupee remains a big worryThe rupee settled 29 paise higher at 73.32 against the dollar on Friday, amid selling of the US currency by exporters and foreign fund inflows. The domestic unit has been on a bumpy track of late owing to unstable crude oil prices, a stronger dollar, capital outflow and rising bond yields in the US. The rupee will remain a key factor to watch in the coming days. 


The course of crude oilCrude oil prices rose in international markets on Friday. Brent crude futures rose 49 cents to settle at $79.78 a barrel amid a surge in demand in China. The market is now focussing on US sanctions on Iran, which will come into force on November 4. Crude has a direct impact on the rupee’s health and ultimately it influences the mood of the market, as higher crude oil prices raises worries of a spike in current account deficit and fiscal deficit, distorting country’s macroeconomic mathematics. As per RBI estimates, every $10 a barrel rise in oil price reduces country’s GDP growth by around 0.15 per cent. 


Key Q2 earnings aheadThe earnings season is on in full swing now. ITC, Asian Paints, Adani Ports, Ambuja Cements, Kotak Mahindra Bank, YES Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Wipro, HCL Tech, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are among the heavyweights that will release their September quarter numbers during the week. The earnings numbers have been mixed so far. Any positive surprise should prove a booster dose for the market. 


ECB’s rate decisionThe European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday amid chaos around Brexit. While no change in monetary policy is expected as of now, the ECB will have to calculate the risk that Brexit poses to eurozone economy. “Brexit is the big elephant in the room for the euro area’s economy. A lot of people are trying to guess the nitty-gritty of interest rate increases that are still about a year out, but are ignoring one of the region’s key economic risks,” Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J Safra Sarasin in Zurich, told Bloomberg. 


Global macro-meterThe Bank of Japan’s core CPI will be out on Tuesday. The US new home sales report for September will be out on Wednesday. Besides, markets will closely watch third quarter GDP growth numbers of the US on Friday. On the same day, data on US’s real consumer spending will also be released. Italian budget will also be in focus this week. 


Technical outlook weakOn the technical charts, the bears appear on the driver's seat. “As per the weekly timeframe chart, Nifty has formed a negative candle with a long upper shadow, which indicates a sharp negative reversal from the recent highs. The weekly RSI is also sending out negative signals,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. Technical indicators still show more scope of downside, though in between a short bounce cannot be ruled out. The support for Sensex/Nifty during the week is seen at 33,350/10,000 and resistance at 35,100/10,550. Bank Nifty would have a range of 24,150-25,860, said Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher."
51,2018-10-22,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel’s non-mobile businesses, which generate more than a 10th of its India revenue, are under threat after Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries acquired controlling stakes in two national cable TV operators, which may spur the rollout of its telecom arm’s countrywide home broadband service.

The buyout of DEN Networks and Hathway Cables will give Reliance Jio Infocomm “a headstart” in the ultra-fast fibre-to-home service turf, which “we see as a real threat to Bharti’s non-mobile businesses —namely, home broadband and digital TV — which garner as much as 12 per cent of Bharti’s India revenues, excluding Bharti Infratel revenues,” brokerage Credit Suisse said in a note seen by ET.

The home broadband and digital TV businesses, it said, generate as much as 17 per cent of Airtel’s India operating income, excluding tower company Bharti Infratel’s contribution. Reliance acquired 66 per cent and 51.3 per cent stakes in DEN Networks and Hathway Cables, respectively, in deals aggregating Rs 5,230 crore last week, when Jio reported its fourth straight profitable quarter, with an 11.3 per cent sequential growth in earnings to Rs 681 crore in July-September.

The Swiss brokerage said Jio’s parent Reliance will overnight “gain access to 24 million cable homes and leapfrog Bharti’s modest 2.1 million fixed-line homes, very few of which have fibre connectivity.” Almost 16 million out of the 24 million cable homes are in the top 100 cities.



Kotak Institutional Equities said it would be difficult for Airtel’s DTH arm (Airtel Digital TV) to counter Jio’s combination of wired broadband and internet TV services and hold on to its home service users, although it expects DTH operator Tata Sky to be hit harder, given Airtel’s strength in the urban markets. Airtel did not reply to ET’s queries as of press time.

Airtel’s India business posted a loss, before exceptional items, of RS 940.4 crore in the quarter ended June amid mounting pricing pressure, compared with a profit of almost Rs 835 crore a year earlier. Ahead of the launch of Jio’s home broadband service — GigaFiber — Airtel had reduced prices, which shrank its home service revenue 14 per cent on-year for the quarter ended June 30.

Sunil Mittal-led Airtel has been revving up its pan-India wired broadband act to protect turf ahead of Jio’s GigaFiber service. It is said to have set aside a chunk of its Rs 24,000-crore spending planned in this financial year to expand its home broadband network to at least 100 key cities, targeting big data consumption zones. The telco plans to connect another 10 million-plus homes by FY21.

Analysts expect that access to a combination of 24 million cable homes and 252 million 4G mobile broadband customers would give Reliance Jio more bargaining power in content negotiations with broadcasters.

However, Jio has faced resistance from some local cable operators (LCOs) in getting crucial access to homes in key markets. LCOs provide cable TV feed from DEN and Hathway to homes. Kotak said getting access to 27,000-odd LCOs is the prime driver of Reliance’s DEN/Hathway acquisitions.

“Last-mile reach to homes is still tightly controlled by LCOs who can be nuisance value for anyone trying to get into these homes. Jio said as much when it indirectly indicated ‘accelerated FTTH rollout’ as the strategic driver behind this acquisition,” the brokerage said.

Brokerage Nomura does not expect Jio’s estimated home broadband spending of $120-140 per home to reduce drastically as “the last-mile network infrastructure of DEN and Hathway will need to be upgraded.”

Ambani had unveiled Jio’s Giga-Fiber home broadband service plans in July, targeting 50 million homes across 1,100 cities. He had not specified the launch date or pricing. People close to Jio have said availability of the service will hinge on consumer registrations, which started on August 15."

59,2018-10-23,Bharti Infratel,"Overseas portfolio investors started the current round of major selloff on Dalal Street towards the later part of the September quarter, which turned the market highly volatile.

While foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been withdrawing from most emerging markets ever since the US economy started firing and bond yields there turned more attractive, soaring crude oil prices and a falling rupee only hastened this selloff. 

FPIs offloaded stocks worth Rs 6,000 crore in the domestic market in Q2, and at least double that amount in September and October.

Curiously, at the same time, they were busy picking stocks from sectors like chemicals, abrasives, auto ancillary, select private and public banks, pharma and information technology.

Within the BSE500 basket, FPIs raised stakes in almost half or over 200 stocks during the quarter. Among notable names, Aarti Industries saw FPI holding go up to 4.20 per cent at the end of September quarter from 3.80 per cent at the end of June quarter.

Among others, FPI holding went up from 4.02 per cent to 4.11 per cent in Gujarat Fluorochemicals, from 5.47 per cent to 5.59 per cent in Atul, 2.36 per cent to 2.45 per cent in Himadri Speciality Chemicals, 23.95 per cent to 24.41 per cent in Jubilant Life Sciences and 11.83 per cent to 11.87 per cent in Pidilite Industries. 

Shares of Aarti Industries and Atul have rallied 10 per cent and 17.78 per cent, respectively, so far in 2018, whereas those of Himadri Speciality Chemical and Jubilant Life Sciences are down 19 per cent and 13.51 per cent, respectively.

As many as 489 companies from the BSE500 index reported their shareholding patterns for the September quarter till October 21, according to corporate database Ace Equity. 

Foreign portfolio flows into equities turned positive in July and August after an outflow of more than Rs 20,000 crore during the first quarter of 2018-19. However, FPI outflow of Rs 10,824 crore in September against net investment of around Rs 4,040 crore in July and August set the clock back, resulting in net outflow for second quarter. 

Several banks also saw FPI holding go up during the quarter. AU Small Finance Bank, DCB Bank, The Jammu & Kashmir Bank, The Karnataka Bank, Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, Central Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Union Bank of India all recorded increase in FPI holding during the quarter.



Select beaten-down construction and real estate players also managed to attract overseas investors money during the quarter. Among them were included Dilip Buildcon, DLF, Indiabulls Real Estate and Sunteck Realty. These shares, incidentally, were down up to 53 per cent on year-to-date basis till October 19.

61,2018-10-24,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel’s Africa unit is raising $1.25 billion (over Rs 9,200 crore) by issuing fresh shares to six global investors including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International in the first part of a two-stage fund raising exercise aimed at paring debt, propelling the telco’s stock nearly 15% intra-day.

The second part will be an initial public offer of Airtel Africa through which the company could raise a similar amount, moves which analysts say, will help the Sunil Mittal-led mobile phone operator bring down its over $15 billion consolidated debt and free up cash to take on bitter rival Reliance Jio effectively in its main India market, and grow in Africa.

ET had reported on the two-stage fund-raising exercise by Airtel Africa back in its July 19 edition.

In a statement Wednesday, Airtel Africa Ltd, a UK-based subsidiary of Bharti Airtel Ltd, said post investment, the deal pegs its equity value at around $4.4 billion and its overall enterprise value, including debt, at $8.15 billion.

“The equity infusion provides a fair benchmark value for the planned IPO of Airtel Africa in CY19,” brokerage Nomura said in a report. Bharti Airtel has reportedly mandated UBS, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup to coordinate its IPO likely on the London Stock Exchange.

After the pre-IPO primary share issue, Bharti Airtel’s stake in its Africa unit will stand at around 65%, a dilution of over 28%. SingTel, which owns 39.5% in Bharti Airtel, will invest $250 million for a 5.7% direct stake in Airtel Africa.

“Our investment into Airtel Africa reflects our confidence in the long-term growth potential of Africa with its young and growing population,” Arthur Lang, CEO of Singtel’s International Group, said in a separate statement.

Airtel Africa said the transaction will not involve any sale of shares by existing shareholders.

The Bharti Airtel stock jumped 10.8% to close at Rs 316.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange Wednesday, outperforming a positive broader market, with market watchers pegging the deal as a positive for the company.

Airtel operates in 14 African markets—Nigeria, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Madagascar, Niger, Kenya, Malawi, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Rwanda. The company is the second largest telco in the continent with a customer base of 91 million, and ranks among the top two operators in most of its 14 markets.

""Raising fresh resources via stake sale in its profitable Africa operation is clearly the best way for Bharti Airtel to raise money at a time when the cost of money has shot up in India amid continuing rupee weakness and the liquidity challenges being faced by NBFCs (non-banking financial companies),” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president, markets and corporate affairs, IIFL.

“Besides reducing debt, Bharti can also use a portion of the cash raised to bolster its 4G networks and build a war chest to fight Jio's continuing pricing aggression,"" he added.

Airtel Africa has seen a turnaround of its business in recent years, completing its first full year of profitability in March, marking a turnaround from previous years when losses mounted every quarter, dragging down consolidated numbers and casting doubt on Bharti’s strategy of expanding into the continent back in 2010. The situation has reversed, with the India operations reporting losses in recent quarters, weighed down by a brutal price war triggered by Jio’s entry back in late 2016. The Africa numbers in fact have been supporting Airtel’s consolidated financials.

Raghunath Mandava, MD and CEO, Africa, Bharti Airtel, said the pre-IPO transaction will help the company further deleverage its balance sheet – reduce net debt by some 8% - and boost its capacity to upgrade networks, expand coverage in different markets and achieve rapid growth of Airtel Money across the African operations.

“On a consolidated basis, Bharti's net debt/EBITDA would fall from 3.6x to 3.3x. We believe the deal is positive for Bharti and Singtel,” Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients. “The deal implies a FY20 EV/EBITDA of 7x. The valuation is likely to set the floor for a potential IPO of the African operations.”

Bharti Airtel has been monetising stakes in its various units such as tower subsidiary Bharti Infratel, as well as its DTH business.

“We believe Bharti will also monetise it fibre network in the mid term,” said Nomura."

64,2018-10-24,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: Bharti Infratel, India’s sole listed tower company, reported a 6% on-year fall in net profit in the fiscal second quarter, hit by a sharp fall in co-location of telecom sites, largely triggered by the recent merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular amid big-ticket consolidation in the sector.

The telecom tower company’s consolidated net profit for the July-September period came in lower at Rs 600 crore, from Rs 638 crore a year back. Quarterly consolidated revenue, however, rose 1% on a like-to-like basis to Rs 3,668 crore, the company said in a media statement Wednesday.

The company’s results were announced after market hours. Bharti Infratel's stock fell nearly 1% to Rs 263.10 on BSE.

“The quarter witnessed much anticipated major exits of nearly 55,000 co-locations at Infratel and Indus due to consolidation and merger of operators, particularly the merger of Vodafone and Idea,” Akhil Gupta, chairman, Bharti Infratel said in a statement.

With the merger of Vodafone and Idea and the resultant co-location exits, he said, “the uncertainties in this respect are broadly addressed”.

The telecom industry, he said, is embarking on the next phase of rollouts, and “we remain confident of the sector’s long term growth potential,” driven by rising “data demand, introduction of new technologies and availability of cheaper handsets and rich content”.

The company’s consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortisation (Ebitda) though fell 8% on-year to Rs 1,506 crore for the quarter ended September 2018, while operating free cash flow plunged 18% on-year to Rs 998 crore during the period.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base, however, increased by 1,168 on-year and 364 sequentially to 92,123 in the fiscal second quarter. But the tower company alone lost a whopping 45,576 co-locations on-year and 26,266 on-quarter, reducing its total count to 1,74,512 as of September-end. Co-locations are points where a tower company deploys mobile telecom antennae of multiple carriers on a single structure. The exits, accordingly, reflected in a lower average sharing factor, which dropped to 2.04 from 2.22 in the June quarter, while the sharing revenue per tower a month, in turn, fell nearly 4% on-quarter to Rs 76,865.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base includes units by virtue of its 42% stake in Indus Towers.

The company's board of directors declared an interim dividend of Rs 7.50 per equity share of Rs 10 each for FY19.

Consolidated expenses for the September quarter, in turn, totalled Rs 2,162.3 crore, up 7.32% on-year. The largest components were power & fuel (Rs 1,436.7 crore), followed by rent (Rs 316.8 crore) and repairs & maintenance (Rs 213.9 crore). Finance costs rose 4.34% on-year to Rs 74.5 crore."

The panel including telecom minister Manoj Sinha, DoT secretary Aruna Sundararajan, US FCC chairman Ajit Pai, Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta, BT’s chief regulatory officer Cathryn Ross and Stanford University’s professor Arogyaswami J. Paulraj shared the government perspective on 5G.

Sinha shared about the government’s ongoing work with states to remove constraints of rolling out optic fiber. He further said, “we are looking to create a legal framework for 5G and it is our aim to support ecosystem that promotes investments.”

US FCC chairman Ajit Pai shared how 5G will bring about tremendous transformation. “What we recognized in United States is that fiber is the future,” he added. He further explained how 5G use cases need to be made understandable for the common person.

Bharti Infratel’s chairman Akhil Gupta shared things that are critical in India and need to be addressed to make 5G a reality. “Traditionally investments have gone more into spectrum which will have to change. We need reasonable spectrum cost to promote more network rollouts and digital innovation,” he said.

He further stressed upon the importance of Right of Way and how there are some Indian states that have less alignment in this regard.

Internet of Things puts pressure on 4G which is where role of 5G becomes crucial, shared British Telecom’s chief regulatory officer Cathryn Ross. She stressed on the importance of minimizing bureaucracy, making high frequency bandwidths available, fibre-rollouts and stimulating the demand to make 5G a success.

“Technology neutrality and timeliness are critical to prevent delay of 5G services to end users,” added Ross.

5G will become a fabric of our society as it will connect both people and machines. “ I can’t see India growing at a rate of 6-7% without the contribution of mobile,” said Stanford University’s emeritus professor Arogyaswami J. Paulraj.

“5G will become virtual infrastructure of our country and we have to make sure this does not end up becoming technology limited to urban areas,” added Paulraj."

Nifty on Tuesday managed to hold Monday’s low and gradually extended its gains towards the 11,960 mark. On daily chart, the index formed a small green-bodied candle with a lower shadow, as we saw buying interest from lower levels.

However, it continued to move in a broader trading band between 11,785 and 12,034 level since past 14 sessions and requires a decisive range breakout on either side to commence the next leg of rally. Till the time Nifty holds above 11,850 level, we maintain a positive stance on the market for an upward movement towards the 12,000 -12,050 zone. On the flipside, support remains intact at 11,850 and then 11,780 levels.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,800 followed by 11,900 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200. Some Put writing was seen at 11,900 and 11,800 levels while Call writers exited some of their short positions at 12,000. Options data suggested a broader trading range between 11,800 and 12,200 levels.

India VIX fell 2.20 per cent to 15.41 level. It needs to hold below 15 level to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty opened on a flat note and managed to hold above previous day’s low. It continued to make higher highs as the day progressed and eventually concluded the session a tad above the 31,200 mark. The banking index continued to outperform the benchmark indices and formed a green-body candle on the daily scale.

Bank Nifty sustained above its crucial hurdle at 31,200 mark; and thus we may see continuation of the ongoing optimism towards 31,500 and then 31,800 levels; while 30,800 and 30,400 levels remain key supports for the index.

Nifty futures closed positive at 11,985 level with a gain of 0.54 per cent. There was long buildup in Tata Elxsi, Bharti Infratel, Canara Bank, Bharti Airtel and Castrol while shorts were seen in CESC , ZEEL, Hero Moto, Muthoot Finance and Torrent Pharma.

Nifty50 opened positive on Wednesday on the back of a gap-up opening in selective index heavyweights. The index extended the gains towards the 12,038 mark. However, it failed to sustain at higher levels and closed a tad below the 12,000 mark. 

The index formed a Doji candle on the daily scale, which indicated indecisiveness at higher levels. But it managed to hold above the previous day’s high throughout the session and formed higher highs and lows for the second consecutive session.

Support for Nifty is now inching higher towards the 11,900 and then 11,850 levels; while the immediate hurdle remains intact in the 12,100 – 12,150 zone.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at strike price 11,900 followed by 11,800, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200. There was some Put writing at 12,000 and 11,900 levels, while marginal Call writing was seen in the 12,100 – 12,200 zone, followed by unwinding of Call options at strike price 11,900. Options data suggested a broader trading range between 11,800 and 12,200 levels.

India VIX fell 1.62 per cent to 15.16 mark. It needs to hold below 15 level to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty managed to hold above 31,200 level throughout the session and formed a Small Green-bodied candle on the daily scale. It continued to trade between 31,200 and 31,500 levels, but ended with a marginal gain of 100 points.

The index has been forming higher highs and lows for past four sessions and till it holds above 31,200 mark, it could extend the gains towards 31,500 and then 31,750 levels, while on the downside supports are seen at 31,000 and then 30,800 levels.

Nifty futures closed positive at 12,014 level with 0.38 per cent gain. Long buildup was seen in Sun Pharma, NCC, RBL Bank, BPCL and Cadila Healthcare while shorts were seen in Bharti Infratel, Siemens, IOC, Oil India and Muthoot Finance.

The government approved a two-year moratorium on payment for spectrum won in auctions, giving immediate relief of Rs 42,000 crore to Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm. However, the lack of relief on Rs 89,000 crore of AGR dues for Airtel and Vodafone Idea in the government’s decisions on Wednesday was a big setback, they said.

“Due to M&As in the sector and no relief on AGR, the impact on tower companies persists,” said TR Dua, director general of the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA). “Once the issue surrounding the AGR is clear, we may have further discussions with the operators to revisit the existing contracts, if required.”

A senior official in one of the telcos said that if one operator shuts down, the impact on a tower company’s revenue would be about Rs 10,000 crore annually.

“With the relief package as announced by the finance minister based on the Cabinet approval, the cash flow of operators may improve. However, without any relief on AGR payments, there will certainly be some impact on the tower companies and further investments in infrastructure,” said Dua.

TAIPA represents India’s major tower companies including Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel and American Tower Corp., which count loss-making Vodafone Idea and Airtel as their main clients. Bharti Infratel is owned by Bharti Airtel. Indus Towers is a joint venture between entities of Bharti Group and Vodafone Idea.

Some of the master service agreements (MSA) between tower companies and telcos, which include rentals and exit clauses and are typically valid for 5-10 years, may be reviewed and renegotiated if Vodafone Idea and Airtel don’t get any substantial relief on their AGR dues.

“The chances of any potential reviews happening would be stronger for existing MSAs close to expiry as opposed to those having significant remainder validity periods,” said a senior tower industry executive.

ATC, Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Indus Towers did not respond to ET’s queries, while Bharti Infratel declined to comment.

Some experts said that although Airtel and Vodafone Idea will not reduce their expenses for 4G expansion, payment terms between telcos and tower companies can be revisited.

Each new tenancy typically “comes with a five-year lock-in, as in entailing committed payment. That can be waived or reduced in desperate times,” said Syed Safawi, a telecom sector veteran and ex-CEO of Viom Networks.

Bharti Infratel shares gained 0.3% to Rs 241.80 at the close on the BSE on Thursday, a day after the government cleared the moratorium on spectrum payments. The company’s stock has fallen almost 7% year to date."

The new derivatives series kicked off on a negative note on Friday, as Nifty saw selling pressure due to unfavourable cues from Asian bourses. The benchmark indices started correcting from initial trades and continued to make lower lows in the first half of the session.

However, due to some bounce in the later half, Nifty ended the session a tad above 12,050 and formed a Red body candle on the daily chart.

The index concluded the week with gain of 1.19 per cent and formed a green body candle on weekly chart.

A positive momentum after the formation of three consecutive Doji candles on weekly chart is a positive sign for the market. Thus, till the time Nifty holds above 11980–12000, we maintain our positive stance on the market for an upmove towards 12,250.

On the December monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest was at 12,000 followed by 11,500 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,500 followed by 12,600 strike. Call writing was at 12,100 and 12,300 strike, while marginal Put writing was seen at 11,800 strike. Option data suggests a shift in trading range between 11,900 and 12,300 levels.

India VIX eased 0.66 per cent to 13.89. Till VIX remains below 15 zone, then we may see continuation in the ongoing optimism in coming days.

Bank Nifty started the session on a negative note and corrected in the first half of the session. However, some buying interest was witnessed in the later half and it formed a small red body candle on the daily chart. The banking index took support around its previous swing high of 31,783 and rebounded piercingly, which is a positive sign for the index. It made a higher high for the seventh consecutive week and formed a big green candle on weekly chart, which clearly shows strength in the index. Until it sustains above 31,783, an upmove toward 32,500 and 32,800 cannot be ruled out.

Nifty futures fell 0.44 per cent to 12,092. Builtup of long positions were seen in Bharti Infratel, L&T Finance, NBCC, PVR and Tata Global Beverages, while shorts were seen in YES bank, Motherson Sumi, Apollo Tyre, Tata Motor and ZEE.

0,2018-12-03,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: The ongoing consolidation in the telecom space is a ""threat"" to tower companies, which are staring at a margin contraction of up to 7.5 percentage points by FY20, as operators exit co-locations.

Despite the ongoing troubles, the tower industry has been able to hold on to its margins till now.

Largest telco Vodafone Idea is in the process of exiting as much as 27,500 co-locations or 3 percent of the telecom masts industry post-merger and will be looking at closing more, a report by rating agency Crisil's said Monday.

It said the shutting down of operations by smaller telcos like Aircel and Telenor will also result in shutting down of towers. So will be the impact after Airtel integrates Tata Tele with itself.

The rental per tower is expected to decline 7-9 percent owing to the co-location exits and lower tenancies, it said, adding increase in the number of towers and exit penalties will limit the decline in rental revenue of the already troubled industry.

The co-locations alone will cost up to 4.50 percentage points of margin for tower companies, it said, adding the gaps have been maintained at 43-44 percent levels for the last four years.

It said the April-September period has already seen Bharti Infratel and other tower companies witnessing a 3.50 percentage point reduction in operating margin.

The report said these mergers have emerged as a ""threat"" for the tower companies, pointing out that the top three telcos are estimated to hold 94 percent of revenue by FY20 as against 67 percent in FY18.

Commenting on tower additions--it expects the number of tower towers to touch 4.9 lakh by FY19 from 4.63 lakh a year ago--the report said it is unlikely to yield good news for the tower industry because the base trans-receiver stations (BTS) will come down due to migrations from 2G and 3G."
1,2018-12-04,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel is open to creating a company with rival Vodafone Idea to jointly own their fibre networks, which could be monetised to raise funds to drive growth as it seeks to regain revenue leadership by March-end, senior company executives said.

“We will be delighted to share and create one company. We have already built a lot of fibre with Vodafone Idea and over the past two years, a lot of sharing has happened between the two companies,” a top company official said.

Although the fibre network company offers an opportunity for monetisation, the official said the plan is essentially to co-own it with the competition, along the lines of Indus Towers, India’s largest telecom tower company that is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel and Vodafone Idea.

A Bharti Airtel spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

Both Vodafone Idea and Airtel are seeking funds for expansion as they recover from intense competition that has eroded earnings and revenue over the past two years in a sector that has now consolidated into three private operators.

Telecom market leader Vodafone Idea, which was formed in August with the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, recently spun off its fibre assets to a wholly owned unit with the intent to monetise it.

Airtel has been selling stakes in tower unit Bharti Infratel and placing shares privately in its Africa business ahead of an initial public offering. The company plans a rights issue of up to Rs 15,000 crore, as reported by ET last month.

The Sunil Mittal-led Airtel reckons the worst of the competitive pressure – unleashed with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016 – is behind it. The telco has been able to increase tariffs by small margins in some plans without denting demand.




Airtel increased the price of its Rs 99 plan by Rs 20. “No problem at all – every customer has taken it,” the official said.

The telco has also lured subscribers to higher tariff plans by dangling incentives such as free subscriptions to Netflix and Amazon and both factors will help it increase revenue from the current quarter.

Airtel’s focus is to regain its top slot by revenue market share (RMS) from Vodafone Idea by the end of this financial year.

Vodafone Idea led with an RMS of 32.8%, followed by Bharti at 30.9% and Reliance Jio at 26.1% in the September quarter, according to an ICICI Securities report based on data from the telecom regulator.

Airtel officials said only three rounds of price increases every six months are needed to reach an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 200 a month and recover from the fall triggered with Jio’s entry.

“However, we doubt Jio will let tariffs rise in the next 12 months,” the official said.

Airtel is willing to lose 60-70 million low-end subscribers in its chase for higher ARPU. This is why Airtel recently took its minimum recharge plans pan-India.

In home services, Airtel is trying to converge broadband and direct-to-home in a bid to take on Jio, which is set to enter the segment. Jio recently bought majority stakes in cable TV companies Den Networks and Hathway Cable & Datacom, getting access to homes in 1,100 cities and towns.

Airtel has about 2.2 million customers for its wired broadband service generating an ARPU of Rs 800, the official said, optimistic that Jio’s entry won’t affect this figure.

“In this game, Jio is now an incumbent and they have a large customer base. So why would they hurt their own business by lowering tariffs?” the official asked."

4,2018-12-10,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: In the world of business, if there’s one trend that has stood out and is making people jittery on the jobs front, it is consolidation. Beginning with the mega merger between Vodafone and Idea Cellular last year, the trend has further accelerated this year following the coming together of Walmart and Flipkart, and the proposed deal that will see GSK Consumer Healthcare amalgamating with Hindustan Unilever.

A merger between similar businesses can result in redundancies and an oversupply situation than can impact the bargaining power of candidates. While consolidation makes good sense on the financial front, the same may not augur well for jobs. 

Siddharth Reddy, MD & CEO of BI Worldwide India, a global employee engagement and recognition solutions provider, said, “Given the spate of consolidations over the last two years, there could be job losses in the range of 7-20%, depending on how identical the businesses are. It could impact compensation levels if the supply exceeds demand and this is driven by market forces. However, it would also depend on the sentiment of growth in the economy, which is unpredictable right now.”



Other M&As over the last two years include Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers as well as Bharti Airtel-Tata Teleservices & Tata Teleservices Maharashtra (consumer telecom business), taking the total value of deals in domestic mergers and internal restructuring, according to Grant Thornton, to around $44 billion since 2017.

Reddy said cross-border deals seldom see job losses. However, when there are identical businesses that get consolidated, redundancies come up. “Job losses then become inevitable as several positions are common and companies look to drive efficiencies and economies of scale with common brand messages. This was the case in Myntra-Jabong,” said Reddy.

There’s always a bit of uncertainty when M&As happen. “They unnerve people,” said Ronesh Puri, MD of Executive Access India. “When there’s a new ecosystem in place, there are adaptability issues that lead to job losses. But apart from that, a flight of talent takes place even before an M&A comes through,” said Puri. 

Sunil Goel, MD of recruitment firm GlobalHunt, said while such M&As may not depress the job market, they would certainly reduce bargains. “One person has at least four opportunities in hand today and he/she selects the best one. This situation could change with more people entering the job market,” said Goel. He added that such consolidations usually have a major impact on people employed in last-mile jobs, that is, the salesforce. 

Such an impact could come with a time lag when FMCG firms consolidate and integrate their distribution networks. However, given that there is a shortage of trained resources, Goel said talent from the FMCG salesforce can get easily absorbed not only within the same sector but by other sectors as well. 

On the flip side, while more people would be looking out for jobs, it would offer an opportunity for other companies to get this talent that was not available earlier. Whether or not this could have a negative impact on compensation, according to Puri, would depend on the talent and the job situation. “Employers certainly tend to negotiate harder, which will be the case now as well, but that does not mean it is all over for candidates. If they have a good record to show, they will leverage that experience and can have a good bargaining position. Companies are always on the lookout for exceptional talent,” said Puri.

The spate of M&As indicates there could be further consolidation in mid to top levels across sectors. “I see it as the beginning of a trend and it will only accelerate further,” said Puri."
5,2018-12-11,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: The Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) board has cleared hiving off the telco’s tower and fibre assets into two separate units, a move that will make it easier for the mobile phone company to monetise them in future as it competes with rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India in a capital intensive industry.

“The Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting held today, accorded its approval to: (i) a scheme of arrangement for transfer of its fibre undertaking, on a going concern basis, to a separate company (ii) a scheme of arrangement for transfer of its tower undertaking, on a going concern basis, to a separate company,” Jio said in a notice to stock exchanges on Tuesday.

The decisions will need to go through necessary regulatory approvals, the Mukesh Ambani-owned operator added.

The new entrant has over three lakh route kilometers of fiber, and uses about 2.2 lakh towers – including over a 100,000 of its own towers and those from Reliance Communications (RCom) and other third party tower companies - for its operations, according to people familiar with the matter. 

But as of now, only Jio’s own towers will be transferred into the new unit. The people added that RCom’s fibre and towers will also be a part of the new units eventually. RCom has already sold its 1,78,000 route kilometres (route km) of fibre assets to Jio and is set to also sell its 43,000 towers to the new telecom entrant.

According to analysts, this move will help Jio in multiple ways. “By hiving off into units, it will make the operating company asset light, increase its ability to leverage and open up the units for monetisation,” said a senior industry executive, who did not want to be named. Another analyst added that the monetisation opportunities could include leasing out the assets to other companies and even selling stakes in the units.

Jio, along with Bharti Airtel – and Vodafone Idea to a lesser extent – has been investing top dollars into expanding their 4G infrastructure amidst an intense fight for market share.

The executive added that going ahead, the move will also increase Jio’s profitability.

The latest entrant, which started commercial operations just over two years back, has already racked up over 252 million users, and has been rapidly closing in on market leader Vodafone Idea and second ranked Bharti Airtel in terms of subscriber base and revenue market share.

Jio, which is the only telco posting profits compared to losses for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s India operations, is in fact following the example of its two rivals in hiving off these two assets into separate units. 

Recently, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea hived off their fibre assets – 246,000 route kms and 156,000 route kms respectively – into separate units. While Vodafone Idea, in desperate need for cash, plans to monetize the fibre assets, Airtel is looking to form an independent fibre company and could also monetize its holdings in the unit at a later stage.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea also jointly own tower company Indus Towers – with over 123,000 towers. Indus is in the process of merging with Bharti Infratel, India’s only listed telecom tower company which owns over 39,000 towers on its own. Airtel holds its stake in Indus through Bharti Infratel, its unit.

Airtel has also been selling parts of its stake in Infratel to raise funds to be competitive against Jio, while Vodafone Idea is also expected to monetize a part of its stake in the merged entity created through the Indus-Infratel merger."

15,2018-12-20,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel has decided to sell a further 32% stake in Bharti Infratel, valued at close to Rs 15,500 crore, to create a war chest to bolster its countrywide 4G networks and counter Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Separately, the Sunil Mittal-led telco on Thursday also appointed a panel to explore various other fundraising options, and named Badal Bagri as its CFO effective March 1.

Bagri will replace global CFO Nilanjan Roy, who has resigned to join technology major Infosys.

The Airtel board has “approved the sale/transfer of up to 591.87 million equity shares (32%) of Bharti Infratel, to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd, to explore a potential monetisation of its (Bharti) Infratel stake, subject to the approval of shareholders,” India’s second-largest phone company said in a regulatory filing on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Thursday.

Post-transfer of the shares, Airtel’s direct holding in Bharti Infratel will drop to 18.33% from 50.33% while Nettle Infra Investments’ holding will rise to 35.18% from 3.18%.

At Infratel’s closing stock price of Rs 261 on BSE on Thursday, the parent company can garner nearly Rs 15,450 crore from the stake sale.

Bharti Infratel is in the process of merging Indus Towers with itself. Insiders though said the Infratel stake sale by Airtel is likely post-closure of the Indus-Bharti Infratel merger, which in turn, would lead to changes in the ownership structure of the combined tower entity. The new entity will be co-owned by Vodafone Idea. 

“Given the big strides that Jio has made in cornering revenue market share and customers from the incumbents in the September quarter, Airtel is clearly trying to defend turf by building a war chest to fight the Mukesh Ambani-led telco,” said Rohan Dhamija, head of India & Middle East at telecom and media consulting firm Analysys Mason.

“The towers business is a relatively stable one, which is why the planned Infratel stake monetisation can generate the requisite cash for Airtel to deploy in its struggling core telecom business in India,” Dhamija said.

Bharti Infratel shares fell just over 1% on BSE on Thursday whereas Airtel’s scrip dropped nearly 2% to close at Rs 316.15.

Over the past 21-odd months, Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower unit to cut debt and free up cash to gird up for competition with Jio in the fiercely competitive 4G turf. It has already raised well over Rs 12,000 crore through multiple stake dilutions. But in March this year, the company said it might sell a much larger stake in its tower arm to fund 4G expansion plans.

In a separate exchange filing, Airtel said its board had formed and authorised “a special committee of directors to comprehensively explore/evaluate various fundraising options to strengthen the company’s capital structure and balance sheet”.

ET had reported in its November 28 edition that Airtel planned to raise Rs 12,000-15,000 crore to create a war chest to cut debt and meet 4G capex needs, and that the telco was examining the option of either a rights issue to existing shareholders or a private placement to institutional investors and promoters.

Airtel’s consolidated debt is upwards of $15 billion, or about Rs 1,05,000 crore.

Airtel’s Infratel stake sale and fundraising plans come on the heels of its Africa arm raising $1.25 billion, or about Rs 9,200 crore, last month by concluding a placement of shares to six global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group. This will be followed by Airtel Africa’s initial public offer (IPO) around May-June next year, through which the telco plans to raise additional $1.25-1.5 billion."
14,2018-12-20,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: A sharp drop in crude oil prices and a bounce in the rupee helped Dalal Street fight a global depression over a less-than-dovish posturing by the US Fed and pare early losses. 

Nifty ended the day 16 points down but formed a bullish candle on the chart, signalling that early Thursday’s blip has not damaged the winning momentum too much.

At one point during the session, BSE Sensex slipped as much as 281 points, but pared most losses. The 30-pack eventually settled 53 points, or 0.14 per cent, down at 36,431 while Nifty closed 16 points, or 0.14 per cent, lower at 10,951.

Midcaps and smallcaps managed mild gains, with BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices ending 0.07 per cent and 0.12 per cent higher, respectively. 

Let’s have a look at the stocks that created maximum buzz during the session: 


Sensex almost evenly poised
Out of the 31 components (including Tata Motors DVR), 16 Sensex stocks settled in the green and 15 in the red. YES Bank (up 3.93 per cent) led the index gainers, followed by Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra and Asian Paints, while the SBI (down 2.18 per cent) lost the most, followed by Wipro, Vedanta, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki. 


Telecom, metal worst hit
With a 1.17 per cent loss, the telecom pack emerged as top loser among the sectoral indices on BSE. It was followed by the BSE Metal index, which slipped 1.10 per cent. Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and Sterlite Technologies proved top drags on the telecom index. Similarly, Vedanta, Hindalco, Tata Steel and JSW Steel were top drags from the metals pack. 


ONGC board approves share buyback
Shares of ONGC logged a nominal gain of 0.13 per cent at Rs 148.65 on BSE after the company’s board on Thursday approved buyback of 25.29 crore shares, or 1.97 per cent of equity shares, for Rs 4,022 crore. In a regulatory filing, the company set the buyback price at Rs 159 apiece. 


Bharti Airtel falls 2%
Shares of the telecom giant slipped 1.89 per cent to Rs 316.15 on BSE after the company in a BSE filing said its board formed and authorised a 'Special Committee of Directors for Fund Raising' to comprehensively evaluate various options of fund-raising. Besides, the company also announced some management changes.


Bank recap plan fails to lift PSU stocks
Most PSU bank stocks did not react positively to the government’s capital infusion plan. The Nifty PSU Bank index closed 1.80 per cent down, with eight components declining out of 12. Major PSU lenders SBI, Canara Bank, PNB and Bank of Baroda all ended the session lower. Analysts said the ongoing political obsession with farm loan waiver has dented investor confidence on this basket.


GST cut hope sends tyre stocks soaring
Tyre stocks Govind Rubber (up 6.43 per cent), JK Tyre (up 5.88 per cent), Goodyear India (up 2.31 per cent), TVS Srichakra (up 1.56 per cent), Krypton Industries (up 1.27 per cent) gained across the board after reports that the GST Council is likely to slash tax rates on automobile tyres to 18 per cent from 28 per cent at its next meeting on Saturday. A drop in crude oil prices also proved a sentiment booster on the counter, as crude-related products are a key raw material in tyre manufacturing. 


Overbought and oversold stocks
Momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 43 stocks slipped into the oversold zone on BSE. They included GTL Infrastructure, Arvind, Rolta India, Regency Investments and Ganesh Films India. While 35 stocks, including Zenith Healthcare, Alexander Stamps, Shriram AMC and Adi Rasayan, turned overbought. 


96 stocks show potential upside
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 96 counters on BSE, signalling bullish setup on these counters.

The stocks included Bharat Forge, Lupin, L&T, Gati, Dilip Buildcon, Pidilite and Apollo Hospitals. However, 50 stocks including Infosys, Nalco, Mindtree, Natco Pharma and Ramco Systems showed bearish crossovers, indicating that they may slide further. 


Nifty forms a bullish candle
The Nifty index negated the formation of higher highs and higher lows that it had formed in last two sessions and formed a bullish candle on the daily chart. Before closing 15.60 points, or 0.14 per cent, down at 10,951, the index scaled an intraday high and low of 10,962 and 10,880, respectively."

11,2018-12-20,Bharti Infratel,"The Bharti Airtel board will meet on Thursday to finalise its mega fundraising plans as it seeks to reduce debt and financing costs, bolster cash flows and meet capital expenditure to fight the price war unleashed by Reliance Jio Infocomm.

ET had reported on November 28 the company was looking to raise around Rs 15,000 crore through issue of fresh shares in the current fiscal and was examining the options of either a rights issue to existing shareholders or private placement to institutional investors and promoters. Two people familiar with the development said it is possible the company might take an enabling approval for a bigger amount as it explores various options. A Bharti Airtel spokesperson declined to comment.

The promoters of Bharti Airtel — Sunil Mittal and Singtel, who together own 67.14% stake — are likely to participate in the fundraising exercise.

In its annual report for the fiscal year ended March 2018, Singtel had said it would continue to take a long-term strategic view of the future of digital India.

In 2017-18, the Singapore company had increased its stake in Bharti Telecom, which is Airtel’s key holding company. This stake hike by Singtel led to its effective interest in Bharti Airtel rising to 39.5% in 2017-18 from 36.5% in the previous fiscal year, the annual report said.

In India, Airtel is navigating a brutal price war triggered by Jio that has seen the number of telecom operators shrink to just four from more than a dozen in two years. “While this is painful in the short term, we have arrived at a more sustainable market structure. Given the right regulations and fair policies, this can be expected to deliver benefits as industry earnings normalise,” Singtel said in the annual report.



The bulk of the proceeds from the share issue will be used to repay debt and bring down borrowing costs. Bharti Airtel has net consolidated debt of Rs 1,14,557 crore, of which the Indian operations’ borrowings amount to about Rs 80,000 crore. This includes outstanding spectrum payments of nearly Rs 46,000 crore.

Besides the issue of fresh shares in Bharti Airtel, the company also plans to raise funds through equity dilution in group companies. It has already announced that Airtel Africa Ltd, its UK-incorporated subsidiary, intends to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in mid-2019 on an international stock exchange. The IPO aims to raise $1.25-1.5 billion and the funds would be used to reduce the African subsidiary’s debt.

Bharti Airtel also plans to dilute equity stake in Bharti Infratel, which is in the midst of a merger with Indus Towers. Post merger, Bharti Airtel will hold up to 37.2% in Bharti Infratel, which will own more than 163,000 towers across India. Depending on market conditions, Bharti Airtel will dilute stake in the tower business in the latter half of 2019, sources said."

Let's find out what might matter on Dalal Street today:

SGX hints at weak start
Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 34.50 points or 0.31 per cent lower at 10,959.50 around 7.55 am indicating a weak start for the Nifty50 back home.

Tech View: Nifty attempting breakout
“Nifty witnessed a fine upside recovery on Thursday, after opening lower and closed the day on a slight negative note. A long bull candle has been formed at the lower levels, which is indicating the emergence of buying interest from the lows. Currently, Nifty is making an attempt to stage a breakout on the upside crossing the resistance at 10,950. Nifty’s underlying short-term trend is positive, and the next upside resistance to watch is at 11,095 level,” Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst.


Global stocks under pressure
Global stocks were sailing into Christmas on a sea of red on Friday as the threat of a US government shutdown and of further hikes in US borrowing costs inflamed investor unease over the economic outlook. The S&P 500 was heading for its worst quarter since the dark days of late 2008, with a loss of 15 per cent so far. The Nasdaq has shed 19.5 percent from its August peak, just shy of confirming a bear market. South Korean stocks slipped 0.3 per cent and Japan's Nikkei 0.5 per cent.


Oil gains some footing
Oil prices climbed on Friday after tumbling 5 percent in the last session, with OPEC production cuts that start next month seen being deeper then previously expected. Benchmark Brent crude futures were up 1.51 per cent at $55.17 per barrel at 0112 GMT, recovering from losses of $2.89 per barrel the session before.

The money will be infused strategically — to support lenders under the Reserve Bank’s prompt corrective action (PCA) regime that have shown improvement and to shore up others that are at risk of slipping into the programme.

DoT refuses to approve RCom-Jio deal
The telecom department has told Reliance Communications (RCom) and Reliance Jio Infocomm that it can’t enforce the Supreme Court order for clearing their spectrum deal, as the buyer is unwilling to accept the responsibility for Anil Ambani-owned RCom’s arrears, thus violating a key clause in the spectrum-trading rules.

22,2018-12-21,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel’s stake in the future Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers combined tower entity will drop sharply to 12.7% after it sells 32% in the listed tower unit, brokerage Credit Suisse said.

The country's second-largest telco on Thursday announced plans to sell a further 32% stake in its tower arm, Bharti Infratel, which is in the process of merging Indus Towers with itself.

Bharti Airtel and UK Vodafone Plc, who will be co-owners of Bharti Infratel-Indus, are to hold 37.2% and 29.4% stakes, respectively, in the combined tower entity.

But analysts now expect the ownership structure of the combined tower firm — to be called Indus Towers — to radically change, following Airtel’s decision to sell a sizeable stake in Bharti Infratel.

The Bharti Airtel board on Thursday had cleared sale/transfer of up to 591.87 million equity shares (32%) of Bharti Infratel to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nettle Infrastructure Investments, to explore a potential monetisation of its Infratel stake, subject to approval of shareholders.

The sale could generate Airtel nearly Rs 15,500 crore at current prices.

Credit Suisse also expects the UK’s Vodafone Plc to monetise its 29.4% stake in the combined tower entity and use the proceeds to undertake planned equity funding in Vodafone Idea.

Last month, Vodafone Idea’s promoter shareholders, Vodafone Plc and the Aditya Birla Group, agreed to contribute up to Rs 11,000 crore and Rs 7,250 crore, respectively, towards a planned Rs 25,000-crore equity fund raise to fight competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel.

In this context, Credit Suisse estimates post-monetisation of Vodafone Plc’s stake in Infratel-Indus, its stake in the combined tower entity will fall to 13.6%, a scenario that would help maintain the company’s “equal rights” stakeholder relationship with Bharti Airtel in the combined tower entity. Industry insiders expect the Bharti Infratel-Indus merger to close before March next year.

Accordingly, Credit Suisse estimates the combined Airtel-Vodafone stake in Bharti Infratel-Indus will decline to 26.4% from 66.6%, which will provide the combined tower entity “independence from ownership” of its two largest operator shareholders.

Bharti Airtel shares fell nearly 3% on Friday to close at Rs 307.5 on the BSE, while Vodafone Idea and Bharti Infratel scrips were largely unchanged at Rs 38.20 and Rs 261.40, respectively.

Credit Suisse expects upcoming monetisation of Airtel’s Infratel stake to help the Sunil Mittal-led telco “maintain leverage (net debt to Ebitda) current levels at 4.5x.” “If not for this (monetisation), (Airtel’s) consolidated leverage would have increase 20% due to the need to deconsolidate Bharti Infratel on completion of Infratel-Indus merger,” the Swiss brokerage house said in a note to clients."
17,2018-12-21,Bharti Infratel,"Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 33 points, or 0.30 per cent, down at 10,941, indicating a weak start for the Nifty50 on Friday. 

Asian peers Hang Seng, Nikkei and Shanghai were also trading in red in morning deals.

US markets declined on Thursday, with the Nasdaq on the cusp of confirming bear market territory, as the Federal Reserve’s plan to continue its balance sheet reduction and the threat of a partial government shutdown fuelled investor anxieties.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 464.06 points down at 22,859.60. The S&P 500 slipped 39.54 points to 2,467.42. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 108.42 points to 6,528.41.

Pessimism in US markets has extended to the Indian market now, analysts said. “Domestically, things are looking fine, but there is a slight uneasiness in global markets, which is influencing stocks back home,” said Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICIdirect. 

""Even though the US President has said the Fed chief will not be fired, the market is slightly uneasy as to what will happen if Fed hikes rates again at its next meet,” he said.

30,2018-12-29,Bharti Infratel,"Imagine driving a car in Jodhpur, sitting miles away in Kolkata. Or a fleet of airborne drones engaged in remote surveillance much like self-driving cars in the sky. If these scenarios don’t blow your mind, picture a chronically ill patient in a village in no position to travel being diagnosed and treated remotely using virtual reality controllers.

These are some futuristic use cases that will ride on 5G – or fifthgeneration – networks once this ultra-high-speed wireless broadband technology arrives in India. 5G is slated to transcend smartphones and connect anything from cars, homes and machines to household gadgets with an internet connection at speeds that are 50 to 100 times quicker than 4G networks.

Indian government though expects initial 5G rollouts by late 2020. But sector experts say the country is running late and could be at least three years behind South Korea, Japan, Australia, the US, China, France and Germany in rolling out 5G networks. 5G services are likely to be rolled out in these pioneer markets by late 2019 or early 2020.

Some of the key reasons why India is slipping behind in 5G – after having missed the 3G and 4G busses - include dismal state of fibre network infrastructure, absence of relevant use-cases and a very modest presence of household electronics plugged to the internet.

Financial stress in the industry and a missing handset ecosystem have already delayed a 5G spectrum sale to late 2019.



Further, high debt levels and the prospect of high reserve prices could further kill the appetite of telcos even when 5G airwaves are auctioned, especially for older carriers Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, whose India operations remain in the red, say experts.

Problems related to setting up and maintaining fibre networks and poor 4G internet availability in the villages and small towns, they say, could further scale down the business case for early 5G rollouts in India. Small wonder, 5G smartphones won’t come to India before 2020, although they will be available in early adopter markets next year.

Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel said recently that the current wave of popular 5G use-cases such as “driverless cars to remote surgery are not practical in the Indian context,” which is why it expects deployments are four years away. He also said the company is in no hurry to bid for 5G spectrum.


Dismal fibre connectivity
Experts say a major deterrent to India’s 5G ambitions is lack of adequate fibre connectivity – less than 20% of the country’s telecom towers are linked by fibre. This can limit the capacity to connect the core of a mobile network to nodes and then on to towers for transmitting data. A reliable fibre-based network is critical to support 5G data speeds of 10 Gbps and next-gen applications such as video-on-demand and internet of things (IoT) to smart cities.

“If 5G is to succeed in India, at least 70-80% of mobile towers will have to be fiberised, failing which, severe data speed limitations will continue as present backhaul networks in India use microwave spectrum,” says TR Dua, director general of Tower & Infrastructure Providers Association, an industry grouping representing Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel, American Tower Corporation, GTL, Reliance Infratel and Tower Vision.

TV Ramachandran, president of the Broadband India Forum, agrees, saying, “Most 5G use-cases would fall if we don’t provide strong fibre connectivity.” The forum counts Huawei, Qualcomm, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Hughes and Intel among its members.


China streets ahead
In comparison to India, China already has 75-80% of its mobile towers fiberised.

Moody’s Investors Service expects China to commercially deploy 5G services in late-2019 or by 2020, with pilot trials already under way. The Chinese government allocated 5G spectrum this month to the country’s top 3 telcos – China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom – to conduct field trials in the run-up to the commercial rollout of 5G services.

By contrast, India’s telecom department said that the 5G spectrum sale would take place in the secondhalf of 2019. It though recently invited telcos, equipment vendors and other stakeholders to partner with the government for 5G trials. Sources say trials are still some time away.

Nitin Soni, director (corporates) at global rating company Fitch, does not expect 5G to arrive in India before 2022 at the earliest because the telecom industry balance sheet – saddled with Rs 7 lakh crore in debt – is in no shape to support a 5G spectrum sale in the next one year.



“Even if 5G spectrum is auctioned by late-2019, I don’t foresee enthusiastic bidding, especially if reserve prices are high as older carriers are still struggling. Besides, India is nowhere near having ubiquitous fibre connectivity or a devices ecosystem comparable with China or Korea, which could delay 5G rollouts by another three years,” says the Singapore-based Fitch director.

Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, which represents Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm, says the primary reason South Korea, Germany, Japan or the UK have been able to brace for 5G early is due to the strong “financial condition of their telecom operators.”

The reserve price of 5G spectrum recommended by India’s telecom regulator, he said, “is much higher compared to Germany, South Korea or UK.”

In August, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) set Rs 492 crore per unit as the minimum rate for 5G spectrum (in the 3.4-3.5 GHz bands), compared with Rs 131 crore per unit and Rs 66 crore per unit in South Korea and the UK, respectively.

A key global learning, Rajan says, is “pricing the spectrum at reasonable rates” to allow telcos to bid aggressively and roll out 5G services.

Fitch’s Soni says China has stolen a march over India as “it’s streets ahead in developing data-intensive 5G content coupled with music, movie and sport apps in regional languages,” which is slated to drive consumption once 5G services get rolled out there.

Experts also say that unlike India, China already has a buzzing internet of things ecosystem, wherein cars, machines and ordinary home appliances are plugged to the internet, providing the perfect springboard for 5G to rapidly gain traction.

The Modi government, though, doesn’t want India to miss the 5G bus – like the country did on 3G and 4G – as the economic impact alone of this superfast wireless broadband technology is estimated at over $1 trillion by 2035.

The government has set up a highpowered 5G Forum to advise on the path forward, which has suggested that most rules on regulatory matters be promulgated by next March to pave the way for early rollouts.

US chipmaker Qualcomm has downplayed concerns around 5G ecosystem challenges, saying that although the global infrastructure ecosystem is diverse, the vendors overseas and in India are the same.

“Different countries are at different stages of mass deployment of fibre and so on,” says Durga Malladi, senior vice president, Engineering & GM (4G/5G), at Qualcomm Technologies."

While M&HCV and I&LCV segments are witnessing a drop, the passenger vehicle business has bounced back, the Tata firm said in a release.

The Nifty50 index had a volatile session on Friday as it bounced back sharply from lower levels and recovered more than 100 points from intraday lows to close at 10,628. It formed a Hammer candle on the daily scale followed by Bearish Engulfing Body on the weekly scale, which indicated that both the bulls and the bears are having a tug of war.

The formation of a Hammer candle on the daily chart suggests a bounceback while the formation of a bearish candle on the weekly scale suggests multiple barriers at higher levels. It has been making lower highs and lower lows since last three sessions and needs to negate the same by holding above the 10,750-10,777 zone to witness a short-term bounce towards 10,850 and then 10,929 levels, while a hold below the same could drag it towards its next crucial support in the 10,650-10,600 zone.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,000 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels. There was Call writing at 11,300 followed by 10,700 level, while Put writing was seen at 10,400 followed by 10,700 levels. The option band signified a broader trading range between 10,500 and 10,900 levels.

India VIX fell 3.74 per cent to 16.16. It needs to hold below 16 to again trigger a bounceback in the market.

Bank Nifty negated the formation of lower highs and witnessed buying interest towards the 27,250 mark. It formed a bullish candle on the daily scale followed by a Doji candle on the weekly scale, which indicated that followup action was missing on either side. Now, it has to hold above the 26,950-27,000 zone to extend its gains towards 27,350 and then 27,500 levels, while on the downside, supports are placed at 26,850 and then 26,666 levels.

Nifty futures closed positive at 10,782 with a gain of 0.59 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Torrent Pharma, Canara Bank, Bharti Infratel and Bank of India while shorts were seen in Mindtree, Hexaware, Hero MotoCorp and L&T Finance.

9,2019-01-04,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Gains in most Asian peers infused positivity back home as the domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty kicked off Friday's session on a firm note.

Other than Nikkei, that traded with a loss of 3 per cent in the wake of a strong selloff in US stocks, China's SSE Composite Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed up to 2 per cent on a fresh spell of buying in most sectors. 

US stocks fell after a new data showed signs of major slowdown in world's largest economy. The Institute for Supply Management's December data released on Thursday signalled the broadest US slowdown in growth in more than a decade. 

However, media reports suggested that the US and China may hold vice-ministerial level talks next week on their trade dispute which lifted Chinese stocks. 

Softer crude oil prices and stronger rupee, too, influenced the sentiment. 

The benchmark Sensex surged over 190 points in the early deals, while the Nifty index hovered near 10,730.

However, both pared some gains on selling in heavyweights such as ICICI Bank, TCS and Reliance Industries. 

Around 9:30 am, BSE Sensex was 99 points, or 0.28 per cent, up at 35,612, while Nifty was 37 points, or 0.35 per cent, up at 10,709. 

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.44 per cent and 0.22 per cent up, respectively, around that time.

Barring energy, IT and consumer durables, all sectoral indices were trading with gains on BSE. 

The BSE Telecom jumped nearly 2 per cent, leading the pack of sectoral gainers, backed by healthy buying in the shares of Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Communications.

In the Sensex kitty, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Axis Bank and ITC were leading the pack of gainers. ICICI Bank, HCL Tech, Reliance Industries, TCS and Sun Pharma were the losers in the Sensex index. 

Shares of Sun Pharma slipped after the drug major on Thursday said it had completed the acquisition of Japan-based Pola Pharma to strengthen its presence in the dermatology segment across the globe."

Investors cheered the news and a fresh spell of buying emerged in most sectors, barring IT, to lift Sensex 230 points in intraday trade. It, however, cooled off and settled 181 points, or 0.51 per cent, higher at 35,695, with 22 stocks ending in the green and nine in the red.

Although the regulatory response to the proposal would decide the fate of the transaction. “Bandhan Bank has a problem of getting its shareholding pattern in order but Gruh Finance is a key NBFC to acquire. So, it will turn out to be a very good marriage and it may have very good repercussions in the long run,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, to ET Now. 


IL&FS Transportation defaults on dividend payment IL&FS Transportation Networks today said it had defaulted on dividend payment of Rs 7.12 crore due on redemption of cumulative non-convertible redeemable preference shares.

The Nifty50 opened in the positive but failed to hold its opening gains and drifted towards the 10,750 level. It negated formation of lower highs and lower lows of last three sessions and closed near to its 50-day EMA.

The index got stuck in a wider trading range in which dips got bought into, but follow-up buying was missing at higher levels. Nifty has been forming higher swing lows, but at the same time, it has been facing multiple hurdles in the 10,925-10,985 zone. Now, it has to hold above the 10,750-10,777 zone to witness an upward move towards 10,850 and then 10,929 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 10,650 and then 10,600 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,000 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,500. Call writing was seen at strike price 11,200 followed by 11,000 while Put writing was seen at 10,700 followed by 10,800. The option band signified a broader trading range between 10,500 and 10,900 levels.

India VIX moved up marginally by 0.88 per cent to 16.30 level. VIX needs to hold below 16 to again see a bounce back in the market, else the roller-coaster ride would continue.

Bank Nifty made a fresh four-month high of 27,477, but witnessed a decline from higher levels towards 27,300 level. It has been witnessing buying interest near the 27,000 mark, but finding it tough to get a decisive move beyond the 27,400 mark. Now, the index has to hold above 27,150-27,200 zone to witness an upward move towards 27,500 level, while on the downside, support exists in the 27,000-26,950 zone.

Nifty futures closed positive at 10,803 level with a gain of 0.24 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Marico, BEML, Dish TV, Repco Home, Bharti Infratel, ONGC, UBL, Tata Motors and Kajaria Ceramics while shorts were seen in Berger Paint, Tata Elxsi, CEAT, VGuard, Bharat Forge, Petronet LNG and Ashok Leyland.

Sensex surged about 270 points in the early deals, but cooled off a little on selling in select heavyweights, including IndusInd Bank, HCL Tech, Tata Steel, State Bank of India and YES Bank. 

An extended rally in crude oil prices in global markets dragged the rupee lower roiling the sentiment slightly. 

Around 9:30 am, the Sensex was 207 points up at 36,188, with 23 stocks in the green and eight in the red.

The Nifty pack was 53 points up at 10,856 at that time, with 37 stocks advancing and 13 declining.



The BSE Midcap and Smallcap, too, rose about half-a-percent.

Among the sectoral indices on BSE, telecom pack slipped on losses in Bharti Infratel, Vodafone Idea and HFCL. Out of 16 components in the pack, nine were in the green and seven in the red. 

BSE IT, rising over 1 per cent, was leading the pack of sectoral gainers. Heavyweights Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Wipro were trading with gains amid rupee's depreciation against the US dollar.

Infosys, Axis Bank, Tata Motors, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC and Sun Pharma were leading among the Sensex gainers.

Shares of IndusInd Bank slipped nearly 1 per cent ahead of its December quarter results. 

Analysts believe while recognition of non-performing loans by companies under the IL&FS group would begin across banks, IndusInd Bank may take the biggest hit. This could put pressure on the lender's net interest margin (NIM)."

33,2019-01-09,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Infratel, the tower unit of Bharti Airtel, expects to complete its merger with Indus Towers in the first quarter of the new financial year, starting April 1, 2019. The company's management, in an analyst meet, also chalked out the new growth areas which include fibre sharing, small cells, data centres and wi-fi offloading. 

The “deal is expected to be completed latest by April-May-19,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report.

Anlaysts said that while the merger may drive profitability and lower capex for the combined entity, the benefits are limited. “We believe the two companies already operate on a large scale and had practically no overlap in terms of areas of operations. Hence, merger benefits will be marginal,” said Edelweiss in its report. 

The Infratel stock closed 2.6 per cent lower at Rs 290.75 on the BSE Wednesday.

The merger to create the largest tower firm in India is awaiting regulatory approvals from National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the telecom department. Analysts expect the two major telcos – Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea – who will co-own the merged entity to bring down their respective stakes to strengthen their respective balance sheets. 

“Bharti and Vodafone will have equal governance and management rights in the merged entity with no lock-in which should pave the way for eventual independence,” said UBS in its report. The brokerage company added that the merger is expected to be 14-16 per cent accretive to earnings per share (EPS) for Infratel, along with improvement in capital structure and return ratios. 

Last year, Bharti Airtel, erstwhile Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group agreed on merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel to create the largest mobile tower operator in the world outside China. It is estimated to have 163,000 towers across 22 telecom service areas in India.

At present, Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42 per cent ), Vodafone (42 per cent ), Aditya Birla’s Idea group (11.15 per cent ) and Providence (4.85 per cent ). After the merger, Bharti Airtel and UK’s Vodafone Plc are set to hold 37.2 per cent and 29.4 per cent stakes, respectively, in the combined tower entity. 

Infratel’s management is optimistic that growth of mobile data could lead to demand for additional tenancy, which in turn will add to opportunities for the tower firm. “Management expects strong mobile data growth to lead to tenancy demand. Demand could come across macro towers for coverage and densification in the near term, and through small cells over long term,” said Credit Suisse in its report.

The analysts of the brokerage firm also highlighted that the company’s management estimates the top three telcos to cross 300,000 tenancies respectively from a current 180,000-220,000 each. 

In the longer term, the company sees multiple new growth opportunities - fibre sharing, small cells, data centres, wi-fi offloading, among others. Its strong balance sheet position would be handy for inorganic growth into these opportunities.

The Sunil-Mittal led tower company is also mitigating pricing risk arising from renewal of large chunk of tenancies between FY20-23 by offering telcos similar Master Services Agreements (MSA) terms provided that the operators renew at least 33 per cent of tenancies expiring in any given year for a period of at least 5 years, said UBS.

Brokerage firm Jefferies estimates that pressures will continue on tower firms as telcos remain under stress and expects “margins to see gradual moderation as increments and loading charges are negotiated”."

The merger to create the largest tower firm in India is awaiting regulatory approvals from the National Company Law Tribunal and the telecom department. Analysts expect Bharti Airtel and the parents of rival Vodafone Idea, who will co-own the merged entity, to bring down their stakes in the tower firm. “Bharti and Vodafone will have equal governance and management rights in the merged entity with no lock-in, which should pave the way for eventual independence,” said UBS in its report.

It is estimated to have 163,000 towers, covering all of India’s 22 telecom service areas. Idea and Vodafone India later merged to form Vodafone Idea.



At present, Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42%), Vodafone Plc (42%), Aditya Birla Group (11.15%) and Providence (4.85%). After the merger, Bharti Airtel and UK’s Vodafone Plc are set to hold 37.2% and 29.4% stakes, respectively. While the Aditya Birla Group is expected to hold 7.1%, it is likely to cash out.

49,2019-01-15,Bharti Infratel,"The Sensex looked all pumped up on Tuesday, rallying 465 points, led by buying in select index heavyweights and rate cut hopes. 

The NSE Nifty too reclaimed the 10,850-mark. 

Asian shares set the ball rolling as China signalled more stimulus measures to revive its slowing economy. 

December quarterly results and management commentary are up in focus.

As many as 47 stocks on the Nifty were in the green, with YES Bank, Wipro, Infosys, TCS and Zee Entertainment gaining 2-4 per cent. On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, PowerGrid, Bharti Infratel, Maruti Suzuki and NTPC declined 0.15-1.10 per cent.

Let's see which factors are at work.

1) 
Rate cut hopes: Sentiment remained upbeat after government data showed that retail inflation dropped to an 18-month low of 2.19 per cent in December 2018, creating more space for the RBI to cut interest rate in its monetary policy review next month.

2) 
Firm Asian cues: On the global front, Asian markets are rallying at this point of time as markets recovered from the impact of weak economic data in Europe and China on Monday that sparked concerns about slowing global growth. Hang Seng, Nikkei and Shanghai advanced up to 1.50 per cent in the morning trade.

3) 
Buying in heavyweights: Buying in select bluechips lifted the benchmark indices too. YES Bank was trading over 4 per cent up at Rs 203.90 while Infosys and Reliance Industries went up over 2 per cent. Global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Buy’ on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,500. Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley upgraded Infosys to ‘Overweight’ from ‘Equal-weight’ and raised target price to Rs 775 from Rs 759.

4) 
Robust DII inflows: Sustained buying by domestic institutional investors (DII) added to risk-on appetite. On a net basis, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) offloaded shares worth Rs 732.46 crore on Monday while DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 527.49 crore. DIIs have poured nearly Rs 1,800 crore in domestic equity market in the past five trading sessions till January 14. On the other hand, FIIs offloaded shares worth Rs 867 crore during the same period."
50,2019-01-16,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel is locked in a tussle with Vodafone Idea over a sum of Rs 4,500 crore that it claims the mobile operator needs to pay it and Indus Towers for vacating tower slots ahead of their contracted tenure. Indus Towers is a three-way joint venture between Bharti Infratel and the two biggest shareholders of Vodafone Idea — Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone Plc.

Vodafone Idea has exited these tenancies as the merged entity does not require as many slots as were needed by the two companies independently.

A person familiar with the matter told ET that Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers have together raised a demand of about Rs 4,500 crore, which is being disputed by Vodafone Idea, over vacating tenancies prematurely. “Vodafone Idea is saying that it need not make any payment since it wasn’t completely exiting the tenancies but converting two tenancies into a single tenancy with higher loading on the same sites,” the person said.

A Vodafone Idea spokesperson said the company would not make any public comments as the matter is between the carrier and its business partners.

The company has already set aside Rs 1,000 crore as contingent liability to cover for any exit penalty that it may have to pay.

Bharti Infratel, too, declined to comment on ‘ongoing discussions with partners’. “Vodafone Idea is a valued partner, and we continue to strengthen our longstanding relationship,” said the company’s spokesperson. Indus Towers is in the process of being merged with Bharti Infratel.

The dispute comes at a time when both sides are under severe financial pressure.


Vodafone Idea clocked losses to the tune of Rs 4,950 crore during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 and its revenues fell sequentially by 7% to Rs 12,023 crore. The company has cited cash flow issues and sought government permission to defer payment of spectrum-related dues of Rs 5,000 crore. It is also currently involved in a complex and costly exercise of integrating the networks of Vodafone and Idea, which it believes will yield cost synergies of Rs 14,000 crore by 2021.

Bharti Infratel, India’s only listed tower company, and Indus Towers are also facing financial pressure due to the consolidation of telecom carriers and the subsequent reduction in the number of private players to just three as compared with the seven-toeight, a couple of years ago.

Vodafone Idea is believed to have given the example of some other telcos which have vacated their slots without making any exit payment to tower companies. The tower firms, however, said an exception was made for only those telcos that had become bankrupt and in turn cite the example of Tata Teleservices having to pay American Tower Corp (ATC) $320 million (Rs 2,400 crore) as a one-time cash settlement for prematurely winding up some 30,000-odd tenancies after deciding to sell its mobility business to Bharti Airtel.

Another source said the exit penalty being demanded by Infratel and Indus has risen to Rs 4,500 crore — from an initial estimate of Rs 3,000 crore — since Vodafone Idea now plans to vacate 88,000 tenancies, against the initially announced 66,000. Bharti Infratel had said in 2018 that it would take Rs 780-crore hit annually due to the exit of Vodafone and Idea Cellular from about 28,000 mobile tenancies. This number is only expected to grow with Vodafone Idea vacating a greater number of tenancies than originally announced.

Most of Vodafone Idea’s tenancies reside on towers of Bharti Infratel and Indus. Typically, a siteleasing contract is for 10-15 years with penalties built-in for premature exits. Vodafone Idea and Bharti Infratel shares closed at Rs 36.25 and Rs 280.50, respectively at the BSE on Tuesday. The telcos’ shares have dropped by 30% since the merger in late 2018, while the tower company’s stock has dropped by 25 % in the last 12 months."

HUL settles with minor lossesShares of FMCG heavyweight Hindustan Unilever finished 0.37 per cent lower at Rs 1,743.70, a day after the company reported a 9 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 1,444 crore for the quarter ended December 31. The stock failed to perform even as some brokerages were upbeat on the company's earnings.

Global brokerage CLSA maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 2010. “HUL should grow earnings organically at over 15 per cent with upside in FY21 from the GSK deal. The commentary was fairly positive as demand conditions seem stable including in rural,” CLSA added.

Cyient settles lower after a dull Q3Shares of IT consulting and software firm Cyient declined 1.52 per cent to close at Rs 618, a day after its earnings numbers failed to excite Dalal Street.

60,2019-01-20,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Healthy macroeconomic numbers in terms of softer retail inflation and narrower trade deficit, along with improved global sentiment helped Indian equity benchmarks log decent gains last week. 

However, Dalal Street did witness bouts of choppiness during the week, as third quarter earnings failed to provide any decisive move to the market, and the weakness in rupee, following rise in global crude oil prices, continued to weigh on sentiment. 

Still, thanks to gains in select heavyweights, including Reliance Industries, headline index Sensex climbed about 377 points, or 1.05 per cent, to 36,386.60, while the NSE Nifty50 clocked a gain of 112 points, or 1.04 per cent, to 10,907, last week. 

Going into next week, corporate earnings, global sentiment, macro triggers and fund inflows will dictate market mood. 


Let's take a look at factors that will influence Dalal Street next week: 


Earnings pick up pace: Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Bharti Infratel, ITC, Ultratech Cement, YES Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, HDFC Standard Life Insurance and InterGlobe Aviation are among companies that will report their December quarter earnings this week. 


Global sentiment: US stocks rose last week, giving a fillip to their global peers, amid buzz that Sino-US trade tussle may see an amicable resolution soon. However, the road to a trade deal looked bumpy. On Saturday, a Bloomberg report suggested that the Donald Trump administration is preparing an executive order that could significantly restrict Chinese state-owned telecom companies from operating in the US over national security concerns. Global markets would hope such a move does not jeopardise the prospects of a trade deal between the two countries. 


The Brexit saga: After facing a crushing defeat on her Brexit deal, British Prime Minister Theresa May will present her new deal before the lawmakers for their approval. But, experts are skeptical that her plan, which has just minor modifications, will be cleared easily. As per Reuters, markets now reckon the March 29 deadline of leaving the European Union will be extended to give parliament more time to negotiate the manner of exit or even to organise a second referendum. Markets may have factored in the standoff on Brexit, the growing chaos may dent investor sentiment globally. 


China's GDP numbers: All eyes will be on China's fourth quarter GDP print as well as investment and retail sales for December. Weak factory output data and export data prompted China to announce fiscal stimulus measures. Now, another weak set of numbers may make investors run away from riskier equities, triggering a selloff in emerging markets. 


Crude's course: Oil prices are on an upward trajectory, underpinned by Opec-led supply cut. Opec on Friday issued a list of oil production cuts by its members and other major producers for six months starting on January 1 to boost confidence in its oil supply reduction pact, Reuters reported. If crude oil prices continue to rise, it will put pressure on the Indian currency, raising the risk of inflation. Market will certainly not take it lightly at a time when it is hoping a rate cut from the RBI in its next monetary policy meet just weeks away. 


Davos meet: The annual World Economic Forum in Davos is scheduled during January 22 to 25. Although experts are not expecting any major trigger for markets, it will surely remain in the limelight as trade dispute, Brexit and outlook on the global economy may heat up the Alpine meeting. However, the US President Donald Trump, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and British PM Theresa May will not be in Davos, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte will be there along with global political and business leaders and civil society figures to discuss the theme of this year's meet- the fourth industrial revolution. 


Technical outlook: The Nifty50 on Friday settled flat to form a small bearish candle on the daily chart. The index seems to be forming a multi-week Ending Diagonal, whose last leg is unfolding on the upside, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. 

“At this juncture, technical oscillators are looking mixed. Traders can retain their positive stance as long as Nifty sustains above the 10,800 level on a closing basis and look for a directional move to emerge on a close above 10,980 level,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in."

61,2019-01-21,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: In a shot in the arm for Bharti Airtel, Delhi High Court has quashed income-tax department’s move to reassess income of its subsidiary Bharti Infratel beyond four years for 2008-09 for transfer of towers to Indus Towers.

The court allowed the company’s writ seeking relief and quashed notice for reassessment, saying all primary facts were disclosed, stated and were known and in knowledge of the assessing officer.

“….this would be a case of change of opinion as the assessee had disclosed and had brought on record all facts relating to transfer of passive infrastructure, its book value, fair market value as was mentioned in the SOA (statement of account) as also that the transferred passive assets to become property of Indus Infrastructure Ltd, including the dates of transfer and the factum that one-step subsidiary Bharti Infratel Ventures Ltd was created for the said purpose,” the High Court order said.

These facts were within the knowledge of the assessing officer when he had passed the original assessment order for the assessment year 2008-09 on December 20, 2010, it said.

The I-T department had sought to reopen the company’s 2008-09 assessment order to re-examine the transfer of some of the towers owned by Bharti Airtel to Bharti Infratel and then to Indus Towers.

Tax authorities had contended that the scheme of transfer of assets was examined in the assessment proceedings for AY 2008-09 of Bharti Airtel in light of the scheme of arrangement approved by the Delhi High Court. However, during examination of the scheme it was seen from the relevant portion of shareholders agreement, annual report of Bharti Infra for 2007-08 and the 2008-09 annual report of Bharti Airtel that neither of the two disclosed full and true intention in the scheme approved by the High Court.

“SOA had mentioned transfer of passive infrastructure of BAL to BIL, a wholly owned subsidiary, and that there was no transfer of assets to a company outside the group,” the department submitted. It was stipulated that shares were not to be issued and no consideration was to be paid to the shareholders for transfer of assets, but contrary to the scheme approved by the High Court, within 15 days of the approval, a shareholder‘s agreement on December 8, 2007 was entered into by Bharti Infra whereby the passive infrastructure was transferred by it to a third party, Indus Tower Limited,” it said.

“Bharti Infra had not for even a single day used the passive infrastructure, contrary to what was stated in the scheme of arrangement filed before the high court… The entire purpose behind the scheme was evasion of taxes, as passive infrastructure assets of Bharti Airtel having written down value of Rs 5,739.60 crore were transferred at nil value to Bharti Infra and were immediately re-valued at Rs 8,218.12 crore,” it said.

The difference between the written down value of the assets transferred by Bharti Airtel to Bharti Infra and the re-valuation of investment had been taxed in the hands of Bharti Airtel."
63,2019-01-22,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: Shares of Britannia Industries is likely to be included in the Nifty in the upcoming index review in February as its free float market cap has increased, said analysts. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation or Bharti Infratel are likely to be excluded from the Nifty with probability being higher for exit of HPCL, they added. 

The changes are likely to come into effect from the April series, with announcement likely sometime in February. 

""Considering the average free float market capitalisation since August 1, 2018, Britannia is most likely to replace Hindustan Petroleum Corporation from the Nifty 50 stocks,"" said retail brokerage ICICIdirect in a note. 

According to guidelines, a stock may be replaced from an index in case there are compulsory changes like corporate actions, delisting etc, in which case, stock having largest free float market capitalisation and satisfying other requirements related to liquidity, turnover and free float will be considered for inclusion. The second condition is if a better stock is available in the replacement pool. The stock which is to be included in the Nifty should have at least 1.5 times the free float market capitalisation of the stock that is to be included."
71,2019-01-23,Bharti Infratel,"By P R Sanjai
Vodafone Idea plans to raise as much as Rs 25,000 crore ($3.5 billion) via a rights offering to help India’s largest mobile-phone carrier fend off Asia’s richest man, who continues to roil the industry by providing 4G Internet at prices that would drive most carriers bankrupt in other countries.

Vodafone Group will contribute as much as Rs 11,000 billion, while India’s Aditya Birla Group will pump in as much as Rs 7,250 billion, according to a statement on Wednesday.

The plan underscores how Indian carriers have yet to figure out how to compete against billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, which offers packages with enough data to watch 46 hours of YouTube videos for about $2 a month. Vodafone Idea itself was formed last year after a couple of the industry’s biggest players merged to create an operator big enough to withstand Jio’s low prices.

“We expect the rights issue to get priced at a discount, given hyper competitiveness in the segment,” said Rohan Dhamija, head of South Asia and Middle East at consulting firm Analysys Mason. “Vodafone Idea will use the funds to make network investments in 4G and for warding off competition from Reliance Jio.”

Separately, Vodafone Idea is also planning to sell its 11.5 percent stake in Indus Towers Ltd., a cell-phone tower company it jointly owns with Bharti Infratel Ltd and Aditya Birla Telecom.

Jio stormed into the world’s second-largest phone market in 2016 by offering free wireless services for months. Today, the company has already signed up 280 million subscribers and turned profitable -- even bringing connectivity to remote Indian villages."
69,2019-01-23,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel reported an 11% on-year rise in net profit in the fiscal third quarter, helped by a net finance income and lower taxes, even though co-locations on its telecom sites continued to fall amid consolidation in the sector.

India’s sole listed tower company’s consolidated net profit for the October-December period came in at Rs 648 crore, up from Rs 585 crore a year back. Net finance income for the quarter came in at Rs 601 crore compared with an expense of Rs 510 crore a year ago.

Quarterly consolidated revenue, however, was flat at Rs 3,640 crore, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

The company’s results were announced after market hours. Bharti Infratel's stock closed flat at Rs 277.90 on BSE Wednesday.

“The consolidation and integration phase in Indian telecom industry along with exits of co-locations is largely over,” Akhil Gupta, chairman at Bharti Infratel, said in the statement. “We are now looking at the next phase of network and related infrastructure roll outs by operators—first for 4G and subsequently for rapidly evolving 5G—to cater to ever growing demand for data.”

“These would require large investments, thereby presenting potential for sizeable growth for passive infrastructure companies going forward,” he added.

For the quarter though, the rapid shrinking of the industry—primarily the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular—continued to weigh on the tower company’s operational income.

The company’s consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortisation (Ebitda) fell 6% on-year to Rs 1,513 crore for the quarter ended December 2018, while operating free cash flow rose 13% on-year to Rs 1,093 crore during the period.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base increased by 1,294 on-year and 178 sequentially to 92,301 in the fiscal third quarter. But the tower company alone lost a whopping 39.027 co-locations on-year and 173 on-quarter, reducing its total count to 174,449 as of December-end.

Revenue from operations included exit charges—or charges paid by clients to exit locations ahead of a contracted term—of Rs 55.3, the company said.

Co-locations are points where a tower company deploys mobile telecom antennae of multiple carriers on a single structure.

The exits, accordingly, reflected in a lower average sharing factor, which dropped to 1.89 from 2.04 in the September quarter. The sharing revenue per tower a month, in turn, fell nearly 1.4% on-quarter to Rs 75,775.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base includes units by virtue of its 42% stake in Indus Towers. The two companies though are in the process of merging their operations, a deal which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the financial year starting April 1, 2019. The new entity, which would create the largest mobile tower operator in the world outside China, is estimated to have 163,000 towers across 22 telecom service areas in India.

Quarterly Ebitda margin expanded to 41.6% from 41.1% in the previous quarter.

Consolidated expenses for the December quarter totalled Rs 2,127.4 crore, up 4% on-year. The largest components were power & fuel at Rs 1,418.4 crore, up 9% on-year, followed by rent at Rs 305 crore, down 4%, while repairs & maintenance fell 11% to Rs 202.1 crore."

Prior to the mega merger, both entities - Vodafone and Idea - had tenancies on the same tower of various infrastructure service providers, including Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel.

""Post the merger, these two tenancies on a single tower have been converted to a single tenancy with a higher loading as per the terms of the Master Service Agreement. Both Bharti Infratel and Indus have raised demands for exit charges on the company on account of this change and for which the company is in negotiation with them,"" it said in a regulatory filing.

67,2019-01-23,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel is likely to report tepid financial results for the quarter ended December 2018.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the company may report 2.7 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 601.50 crore in Q3FY19 over 585.40 crore in Q3FY18.

The brokerage house also projected 0.20 per cent YoY dip in net sales at Rs 3,655.30 crore in December quarter. Kotak believes that EBITDA, EBIT and PBT of Bharti Infratel (BHIN) may slip 11 per cent, 12.80 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, on year-on-year basis.

“For BHIN, we expect sequential EOP tenancy increase of 4.2 per cent QoQ driven by Bharti Airtel and R-Jio. We are baking in zero exits for the quarter. LTE rollouts continue to drive solid growth in loading revenues for BHIN. This quarter will see the full impact of Vodafone Idea exits,” said Kotak in a report.

Brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial Services sees 5 per cent YoY growth in PAT for Bharti Infratel in Q3FY19. The brokerage house is of the view that the company may report 3 per cent and 17 per cent year-on-year dip in net sales and EBITDA, respectively.

“We estimate consolidated tower addition of 242 and a net tenancy increase of 5.7k vs a decline of 26.2k in Q2FY19, resulting in a tenancy ratio of 1.94x vs 1.89x in 2Q. Energy margins are expected narrow to 6.4 per cent from 7.2 per cent in Q2FY19. Rental/month/tower will have the positive impact of aggressive loading from telcos,” Emkay said in a report.

Shares of the company closed 0.65 per cent up at Rs 279.55, while the BSE Sensex closed down 336.17 points, or 0.92 per cent, at 36,108.47."
85,2019-01-24,Bharti Infratel,"Telecom tower firm Bharti Infratel Thursday said it has reached a settlement with four operators, including Vodafone Idea, that exited from its cell sites before the expiry of their contracts at a payment of around Rs 3,800 crore.

The payments include one-time charge of Rs 2,000 crore and rental of around Rs 1,800 crore.

Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta during the company's earnings call said that all the charges with Airtel, Tata, Telenor, Vodafone Idea have been settled for all exits that were received up to November 30, 2018.

""As a snapshot, on a consolidated basis, of the the total exit charges approximately Rs 20 billion, which related to Rs 37 billion on 100 per cent basis, we had cash settlement against Rs 20 billion ...,"" Gupta said.

He said that operators have jointly paid Rs 55 crore in cash to Bharti Infratel during the October-December 2018 period and rest of the payment will made in monthly installments with interest spread over period of 36 months.

""In line with our accounting policy Rs 550 million accounted for revenue in this quarter. Instalment amounting to approximately Rs 900 million per quarter shall be accounted for from next quarter as the revenues for the next 12 quarters,"" Gupta said.

He said that the third quarter of ongoing financial year recorded the highest gross tower and co-location additions in last five quarters.

The company on Wednesday posted an 11 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 648 crore for the December quarter.

Consolidated revenues, however, marginally dropped to Rs 3,640 crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at Rs 1,513 crore, 6 per cent lower than the year-ago period.

""With completion of Vodafone Idea merger, we believe the consolidation phase is largely behind us and so are co-locations exits that we have been witnessing. Between Indus and Infratel, there were exits of over 57,000 on a consolidated basis till December 31, 2018 spread over six quarters. We believe industry will now move to higher network roll out,"" Gupta said.

He said that the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers is on track and there will be meeting on February 2 to get approval of Bharti Airtel shareholders.

Gupta said that the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers is expected to be completed in April-June 2019 if there are no unexpected delays at NCLT and Department of Telecom."
84,2019-01-24,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty snapped their two-session losing run on Thursday, thanks to gains in select heavyweights even as tepid gains in Asian markets kept the momentum positive.

The market wound up the day’s choppy trade on a positive note, as RIL, YES Bank, TCS, Infosys, HDFC and ITC gave the index a leg up in late afternoon trade.

Global stocks improved, as better corporate earnings broadly assuaged concerns of global economic slowdown. 

Weakness in crude oil prices and the rupee’s gain against the US dollar also boosted investor mood. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 24 paise higher at 71.08 against the greenback. 

Sensex settled 87 points, or 0.24 per cent, higher at 36,195, with 14 stocks advancing and 17 declining. Nifty rose 18 points, or 0.17 per cent, to end at 10,849, with 27 stocks ending in the green and 23 in the red.

Midcaps and smallcaps failed to toe the line of Sensex, as their sectoral indices fell up to 0.59 per cent.


Let’s take a look at the key highlights of Thursday’s session:


RBI says yes to new YES Bank CEOThe stock rose 14.32 per cent to Rs 225 on NSE after the bank received RBI's approval for Ravneet Gill to replace Rana Kapoor as MD and CEO. Gill, CEO of Deutsche Bank’s India operations, will join the domestic lender on or before March 1, 2019. Meanwhile, the bank reported a 6.96 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit at Rs 1,001 crore for December quarter. Gross NPA rose to 2.10 per cent from 1.60 per cent in September quarter and 1.72 per cent in December quarter last year. 


ITC logs nominal gainsShares of FMCG major ITC closed 0.43 per cent higher at Rs 278 on BSE after reports that it has hiked prices by 3-5 per cent on premium brands with immediate effect in order to ease the margin pressure. The company’s margins missed Street estimates in December quarter. They came in at 37.80 per cent against 39.80 per cent on a yearly basis. Analysts in an ETNow poll had projected 40 per cent margins for the quarter under review. 


ICICI Bank ends lowerShares of ICICI Bank ended 0.72 per cent lower at Rs 365 amid reports that CBI has booked former ICICI Bank CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon group MD Venugopal Dhoot in connection with alleged cheating and irregularities in loans sanctioned by the bank to the group in 2012. 


UltraTech falls on drop in Q3 profitUltraTech Cement on Thursday reported a 13.59 per cent drop in consolidated profit at Rs 394 crore for December quarter. The company said its numbers were hurt by 11 per cent rise in costs, largely due to higher fuel expenses and a depreciation in the rupee. The stock closed 1.54 per cent down at Rs 3,790.25 on BSE. 


NIIT plunges 7% post Q3 numbersShares of NIIT plunged 7.09 per cent to Rs 86.50 after the company reported a 1.5 per cent fall in its consolidated net profit for the December quarter. The company said it saw an adverse foreign exchange (forex) impact of Rs 5.2 crore in the quarter under review, ""predominantly due to the restatement of receivables"". 


Edelweiss drops 5% despite rise in Q3 netShares of Edelweiss Financial Services plunged 5.33 per cent to Rs 151 after it reported an 18.16 per cent increase in consolidated profit at Rs 258.35 crore for third quarter. Its total income increased 25.46 per cent to Rs 2,790.69 crore in the quarter under review against Rs 2,224.23 crore in the December quarter of 2017-18, it said in a BSE filing. 


IndiGo flies 6% higherThe stock closed 6 per cent higher at Rs 1,174 as its Q3 profit crashed 75 per cent due to weak operating performance. Analysts said numbers reflected successful implementation of a carefully crafted strategy of gaining market share – up 3 per cent in past two quarters – with a slight consideration for gaining pricing power in the industry.


Spurt in OIKPIT Technologies, with a change of 104.81 per cent, led the pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest (OI) on NSE.

100,2019-01-25,Bharti Infratel,"HDFC Securities has a buy call on Bharti Infratel with a target price of Rs 344.

The current market price of Bharti Infratel is Rs 279.85.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Bharti Infratel price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage-
Bharti Infratel’s (BHIN) 3QFY19 results were better than estimates. 

BHIN rental revenue and EBITDA ex energy was -9.7 per cent/-11.9 per cent YoY. PAT was up 11 per cent YoY owing to higher finance income. 

A 7.3 per cent QoQ improvement in rental/tenant (13 per cent YoY) was a key positive surprise. 

We believe this is due to the reset of rentals for existing tenants. BHIN witnessed loss of 39k tenants YoY to 174k or 18.3 per cent decline. Despite high operating leverage of tower business, EBITDA decline has been of a modest 12 per cent YoY; a key positive. This is owing to (a) increase in rental for surviving tenants as weaker players exited (b) high loading of 4G BTS and (c) cost rationalization (opex ex-energy declined by 3.5 per cent YoY).

We remain positive on BHIN with a target price of Rs 344 at 25x Dec-20E EPS (for merged entity). Key reasons are (a) stock has corrected by nearly 45 per cent from peak (b) on account of savings on DDT (nearly Rs 5bn) and earnings accretion from Indus acquisition (c) healthy dividend yield of nearly 6 per cent (d) uncertainty receding from Voda-Idea merger impact (e) growth resumption owing to robust data usage and (f) prognosis for rental renegotiations is weak in near term."

The Nifty50 index opened flat but witnessed sustained selling pressure for most part of Monday’s session. It has broken the rising support trend line that connects the recent swing lows of 10,004, 10,333 and 10,700 levels. It has also broken the formation of higher swing lows as it slipped below the recent swing low of 10,692 level. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and has been forming lower lows for past five sessions.

As long as it holds below the 10,750-10,777 zone, Nifty50 can slip towards the next swing low support at 10,630 and then 10,535 level, while on the upside, a major hurdle is seen at 10,777 and then 10,850 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,700 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900 levels. Meaningful Call writing was seen at 10,700 followed by 10,800 levels, which will restrict its upside move. Put writing was seen at 10,600 followed by 10,500 levels. The option band signified a shift in lower trading range to 10,550-10,777 zone.

India VIX moved up 6.83 per cent to 18.90 level. A sudden spike in VIX with lower a Put-Call Ratio indicated limited upside for the market, as the index has broken the immediate support zone.

Bank Nifty opened negative and continued to form lower lows for the fifth consecutive session. It slipped below the 50-day EMA and broke its consolidation band in the 27,150-27,200 zone with extended weakness towards the 26,600 level. It has made the biggest Bearish Candle in last many sessions and indicated that the bears have taken a tight grip with the possibility of limited upside. 

Now, as long as Nifty holds below 27,000, it can continue to see selling pressure towards 26,400 and then 26,250 levels, while on the upside, a medium-term hurdle is seen at 27,150 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,695 with a loss of 0.84 per cent. Long buildup was seen in ZEEL, HCL Tech, Bharti Infratel, Dish TV, TCS and TechM while shorts were seen in PEL, Idea, Motherson Sumi, Canara Bank, DHFL, MFSL, Bajaj Finance and Indiabulls Housing Finance."
106,2019-01-28,Bharti Infratel,"Monday blues came back to haunt benchmark stock indices as the Sensex and the Nifty tanked 369 points and 119 points, respectively. 

As many as 36 stocks of the Nifty turned red. Adani Ports plunged over 12.53 per cent, followed by Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 6.51 per cent), Bajaj Finance (down 5.45 per cent), YES Bank (down 5.28 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (down 4.30 per cent).

On the other hand, some buying in Zee Entertainment, Bharti Infratel, Larsen & Toubro, TCS and Coal India capped the downside.

Here are key reasons that put pressure on domestic equities on Monday. 


Weak Q3 numbers: Subdued quarterly numbers by select heavyweights dampened sentiment on Monday. Maruti Suzuki on Friday posted its second successive decline in quarterly net profit with a 17.21 per cent fall for the third quarter ended December, also the steepest fall in nearly five years. 

India's largest carmaker said its net profit for Q3 came in at Rs 1,489.3 crore as against Rs 1,799 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.


Financial stocks bleed: ICICI Bank alone shaved off more than 100 points from the Sensex during the late afternoon trade. The scrip was down 4.84 per cent at Rs 339.80 at around 11.45 am. 

India's biggest mortgage lender HDFC, IT major Infosys and largest lender by assets State Bank of India together dragged the Sensex down by more than 100 points. HDFC and Infosys were down 1.50 per cent and 1.34 per cent, respectively, at around the same time. SBI was trading 2.37 per cent down at Rs 278.50. 

The CBI has transferred the investigating officer in the ICICI Bank case as its “discreet inquiry” suggested his role in leaking information related to searches, according to a report by PTI.


FII selling continues: Foreign investors offloaded nearly Rs 5,000 crore so far from the domestic equity markets in January and experts believe this trend will continue in the coming months as well. Prior to that, they had sold shares worth Rs 28,900 crore in October. Their net inflows stood at Rs 5,980.89 crore and Rs 3,143.22 crore in November and December, respectively.


Populist measures: Traders were also concerned with Bloomberg report stating that Indian bonds are pitted against a familiar foe: likely record debt sales by the government to finance populist measures before national elections due by May.


US-China trade talks: Uncertainties over the high-level trade talks between the US and China were another major overhang."

Nifty50 had a volatile session on Tuesday as it fell towards the 10,583 mark but recovered sharply from lower levels in the last hour of trade. The index managed to recover most of its intraday losses and formed a candle similar to a Dragon Fly Doji, as it closed near its opening level on the daily scale.

The index has been making lower lows from last six sessions and has been holding below its 50-day EMA, as it hit the lowest level for this month. Now it has to hold above 10,650 and cross the 10,700 mark to form a short-term reversal pattern. Else, the market could continue to show weakness.

If Nifty manages to hold above 10,690 level, then a bounceback could be seen towards 10,777 and then 10,820 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 10,580 and then 10,535 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,600 level while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900 level. Call unwinding was seen at 10,900 followed by 11,000 levels, while there was Put unwinding at 10,800 followed by 10,900 levels. The option band signified a shift in the lower trading range to 10,550-10,777 zone.

India VIX fell 2.50 per cent to 18.42, as overall higher volatility restricted the upside.

Bank Nifty continued its weakness towards the 26,440 mark and it has been forming lower lows for last six sessions. It recently broke its rising support trend line and held below its 50-day EMA. As long as it holds below 27,000 level, it can continue selling pressure towards 26,400 and then 26,250 levels, while on the upside, a medium-term hurdle is seen at 27,150 level.

Nifty futures closed positive at 10699 level with a gain of 0.21 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Bank of India, PVR, Bharti Infratel and Sun Pharma while shorts were seen in TechM, Motherson Sumi, Eicher Motors and Indiabulls Housing Finance.

There are expectations that the Finance Minister may announce some populist measures on Friday.

The 30-share Sensex closed 64.20 points, or 0.18 per cent, down at 35,592, while NSE’s Nifty settled 9.35 points, or 0.09 per cent, lower at 10,652.

Let’s a look at the key highlights of Tuesday's session: 

Cobra bites DHFLShares of NBFC player Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) closed 8 per cent down at Rs 170. Earlier in the day, the portal known for investigative journalism alleged the company had siphoned off Rs 31,000 crore into promoter companies to create private wealth through a network of shell companies. The scam has been pulled off mainly by sanctioning and disbursing astronomical amounts in secured and unsecured loans to dubious shell/pass-through companies, related to DHFL’s own primary stakeholders Kapil Wadhawan, Aruna Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan through their proxies and associates, which have in turn passed on the money to companies controlled by the Wadhawans, the web portal alleged. “The money was used to buy shares/equity and other private assets in India and abroad, including in countries like the UK, Dubai, Sri Lanka and Mauritius,” the news portal said on its website.


FACT drops on doubts over networth Shares of Fertilizers & Chemicals Travancore (FACT) plunged over 4 per cent after the auditor said the company’s net worth has been fully eroded. The company reported a net loss of Rs 49.77 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 against a net loss of Rs 4.41 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The scrip settled 4.45 per cent down at Rs 38.65.


Adani Gas rallies 5%Shares of Adani Gas rallied over 5 per cent after reports that the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the company in connection with two city gas networks and said the petroleum regulator should issue free orders to Adani Gas. The scrip settled 5.08 per cent higher at Rs 93.


HDFC slips on drop in profitHDFC, the country’s biggest mortgage lender, reported a net profit of Rs 2,113.80 crore on the standalone basis for the third quarter ended December 31, 2018 against Rs 5,300 crore profit reported for the year-ago quarter. The scrip settled 1.53 per cent down at Rs 1918.80.


Bajaj Finance rises 3% on good Q3The company posted 54 per cent rise in consolidated net at Rs 1,060 crore, the highest-ever quarterly profit, for December quarter against Rs 690 crore reported for the same period last year. Shares of the company closed 2.27 per cent higher at Rs 2,511 on BSE.

109,2019-01-29,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Vodafone Plc is planning to raise $1.5 billion as a three-year loan facility from global banks to finance its India operations through a unique structure that’s likely to see the company pledge cash flows from the local business, said at least four independent sources aware of the matter. They said banks aren’t too enthusiastic because they will have no recourse to the parent’s balance sheet or its equity shares in case of a default, thereby increasing the risk profile of their exposure in a sector already embattled by the intense ongoing competition.

The UK telco’s India investments include a 45.2% stake in Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL), the telecom joint venture with Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular, and 42% of Indus Towers, a three-way alliance with Bharti Infratel and Aditya Birla Telecom.

Vodafone Plc has proposed an offshore orphan special purpose vehicle (SPV). It will have no corporate or shareholding linkage with Vodafone Plc, hence the term orphan. This ‘borrower’ SPV will enter into a total return swap (TRS) agreement with Vodafone Plc in lieu of its economic interest in Vodafone Idea and Indus as the underlying security for the facility.

The economic interest could be any cash received through from operations by any means like dividend income, or return on capital or proceeds from any equity stake sale. Whatever cash the borrower SPV receives from the underlying Indian operations will go into loan payments. The SPV will be obliged to pay a 6.5% coupon rate to the lenders or a higher rate of 7.5% if it does not have adequate cash to service the loan. For example, if it gets $97.5 million (6.5% of $1.5 billion), all of it goes to the lenders. If the amount is less than that, the SPV will have to repay at 7.5%.

Despite the stature of the corporate concerned, bankers are nervous because Reliance Jio Infocomm’s aggressive growth strategy has put the telecom industry under pressure.

Vodafone India, which merged with Idea to stay competitive, has written off 6.3 billion euros because of the tariff war. Vodafone Plc is said to be negotiating with the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley among others.

At least four marquee lenders from the US, Europe and Asia are believed to have passed on the proposal, added senior banking industry executives on condition of anonymity. Concerns also stem from not having access to Vodafone Plc’s balance sheet or the underlying shares of its Indian operations as collateral in case of default.

Vodafone Plc is not keen to pledge any shares with the banks, said sources close to the telco.



“We are a very large group and are often testing new alternative financing structures, as we are currently doing in India, to give us strategic flexibility,” a Vodafone Plc spokesperson told ET. “Any repayment terms will be purely at our discretion and we don’t recognise the details of what you are describing.”

Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL), India’s biggest phone company by subscribers, said last week it had finalised a rights issue to raise Rs 25,000 crore to help bulk up its balance sheet for countrywide 4G coverage and take on Bharti Airtel and Jio. Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group will pump in up to Rs 11,000 crore and Rs 7,250 crore, respectively, as part of the rights issue. The orphan SPV structure is part of Vodafone Plc’s efforts to raise resources to fund its share of the issue. Further, VIL has said, in case the rights issue is under-subscribed, each promoter shareholder “reserves the right to subscribe to part or whole amount of the unsubscribed portion, subject to applicable law.”


LENDERS CAUTIOUS
VIL reported a consolidated loss of Rs 4,973 crore for the September 2018 quarter, its first financial results after the merger that was completed on August 31, 2018. VIL’s gross debt stood at Rs 1.26 lakh crore at the end of September 2018.

Analysts expect the company to report losses in the December quarter on higher costs although they estimate a slower sequential revenue dip, helped by a likely turnaround in average revenue per user (ARPU).

VIL’s market capitalisation of Rs 27,167.05 crore at the end of trade on Monday won’t be a factor, analysts said.

“The telecom joint venture is not expected to generate any cash or dividends and will remain loss making for the foreseeable future,” said an analyst. “Indus can generate dividends but post its merger with Bharti Infratel, Vodafone Plc’s stake will go down to 29% in the merged company, thereby reducing its influence on strategic issues like dividend decisions.”

The ballooning debt in India and at its parent, spectrum auction costs and competitive pressures could put dividend payout potential under a cloud. Vodafone Plc has dropped by a fifth in the past year allowing activist shareholders like Elliot Advisors to come in.

“Vodafone Idea’s Ebitda and cashflow are under severe pressure which has led to an increase in net debt to Rs1,121 billion (29x 2QFY19 annualised Ebitda). As we factor in the opex synergy, we forecast Vodafone Idea’s Ebitda to rise over 4x during FY19-21 to Rs160 billion, yet Vodafone Idea’s FY21 net debt will still be higher, at Rs1,141 billion, and gearing will still be uncomfortable at 7x Ebitda,” said Deepti Chaturvedi and Akshat Agarwal, analysts with CLSA.

A total return swap is an agreement in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In total return swaps, typically popular with hedge funds, the underlying asset, referred to as the reference asset, is usually an equity index, loans or bonds. The asset is owned by the party receiving the set rate payment."

116,2019-01-30,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Airtel Africa will raise $200 million, or around Rs 1,420 crore, from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) through an issue of primary shares, Bharti Airtel said in a statement on Wednesday.

The funds will be used to reduce the Africa unit’s debt, thereby also strengthening Bharti Airtel’s consolidated books. It will help the UK-based holding company of Airtel’s Africa operations cut its net debt to roughly $3.5 billion, the mobile phone operator counted among the world’s top three by subscribers said.

“We are excited to welcome Qatar Investment Authority as a longterm strategic equity partner… This transaction will not involve any sale of shares by existing shareholders,” said Airtel Africa, which operates in 15 countries in the continent. QIA said it looks forward to “supporting Airtel’s vision in building a world class business in the African continent”.

In November, Airtel Africa had raised $1.25 billion, or about Rs 9,200 crore, through a placement of shares to six global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, in the runup to an Airtel Africa IPO likely around June this year, through which the telco plans to garner an additional $1.5-1.6 billion.

The follow-up fundraise is estimated to dilute Airtel’s stake in its Africa unit to 67.24% from roughly 71.6%, said a senior sector analyst who did not wish to be named.

Bharti Airtel — facing severe pressure on revenue and profitability at home in India owing to intense competition triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm — is trying to build a war chest to fund its 4G network expansion across the country.

It has been selling stakes in tower unit Bharti Infratel, and plans to sell another 32% — valued at close to Rs 15,500 crore —in that company. Airtel is also planning a Rs 15,000-crore rights issue.

Bharti Airtel’s net debt was at Rs 113,204 crore at September-end.

Its shares closed 1.22% lower on the BSE at Rs 303.35 on Wednesday.

The latest developments come at a time when the Sunil Mittal-led telco’s Africa business has continued to put on a robust show in the September quarter, with Africa net income (before exceptional items) rising to Rs 232.3 crore from a net loss of Rs 207.9 crore a year back. Total revenue of Airtel Africa rose nearly 13% to Rs 5,647.2 crore.

Airtel Africa is the second largest telco in the continent with customer base of more than 94 million. It is one of the top two operators in most of its 14 markets.

In November, Airtel Africa had also constituted a board of directors that includes representatives from Airtel and the global investors.

The combined strength of the board is expected to bring a wealth of industry and governance experience to further drive Airtel’s Africa operations.

Airtel Africa has essentially seen a turnaround of its business in recent years, completing its first full year of profitability in March, after continuously losing money in previous years."

QIA said it looks forward to “supporting Airtel’s vision in building a world class business in the African continent”.

In November, Airtel Africa had raised $1.25 billion, or about Rs 9,200 crore, through a placement of shares to six global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, in the runup to an Airtel Africa IPO likely around June this year, through which the telco plans to garner an additional $1.5-1.6 billion.

The follow-up fundraise is estimated to dilute Airtel’s stake in its Africa unit to 67.24 per cent from roughly 71.6 per cent, said a senior sector analyst who did not wish to be named.

Bharti Airtel — facing severe pressure on revenue and profitability at home in India owing to intense competition triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm — is trying to build a war chest to fund its 4G network expansion across the country.

It has been selling stakes in tower unit Bharti Infratel, and plans to sell another 32 per cent — valued at close to Rs 15,500 crore —in that firm. Airtel is also planning a Rs 15,000-crore rights issue. Bharti Airtel’s net debt was at Rs 113,204 crore at September-end. Its shares closed 1.22 per cent lower on BSE at Rs 303.35 on Wednesday.

The latest developments come at a time when the Sunil Mittalled telco’s Africa business has continued to put on a robust show in the September quarter, with Africa net income (before exceptional items) rising to Rs 232.3 crore from a net loss of Rs 207.9 crore a year back. Total revenue of Airtel Africa rose nearly 13 per cent to Rs 5,647.2 crore.

Airtel Africa is the second largest telco in the continent with customer base of more than 94 million. It is one of the top two operators in most of its 14 markets. In November, Airtel Africa had also constituted a board of directors that includes representatives from Airtel and the global investors.

The combined strength of the board is expected to bring a wealth of industry and governance experience to further drive Airtel’s Africa operations.

Airtel Africa has essentially seen a turnaround of its business in recent years, completing its first full year of profitability in March, after continuously losing money in previous years marking a turnaround from previous years when losses mounted every quarter, dragging down consolidated numbers and casting doubt on Bharti’s strategy of expanding into the continent back in 2010."

2,2019-02-01,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: Bharti Airtel expects its average revenue per user (ARPU) -- a key performance metric – to improve from the fiscal fourth quarter onwards, as the full impact of its minimum recharge plans kick in and more 2G and 3G users upgrade to 4G.

Chief executive Gopal Vittal said Friday the biggest ARPU growth drivers for Airtel would be higher contributions from the minimum recharge plans, benefits accruing from the recent price hike of the Rs 99 base bundled pack to Rs 119, rapid 2G customer upgrades to 4G and growing uptake of post-paid plans in the Rs 399 and Rs 499 range that come bundled with content from Amazon and Netflix.

“We are seeing the first signs of ARPU climbing and as more 2G customers upgrade to 4G and get on to a bundle, there will be an immediate ARPU upside,” Vittal said.

He was speaking on an earnings call, a day after Bharti Airtel’s consolidated net profit slumped 72% on-year to Rs 86 crore in the fiscal third quarter, as a one-time gain helped the telco surprise the market which had expected a loss. Analysts said that the 4.1% sequential ARPU expansion to Rs104 and largely flattish India revenue in Q3 is signal that the worst could be behind the telco. 

India’s second-largest telco’s shares closed 1.35% higher on BSE at Rs 311.30.

The carrier isn’t ruling out more marginal customer losses in coming quarters with the full impact of the minimum recharge plans and re-classification of Airtel customers as only those that transact and generate revenues for the company.

The telco lost 58 million mobile phone customers in the December alone following the modification in its customer base measurement benchmarks.

Sanjesh Jain, telecoms research analyst at ICICI Securities, estimates that “the clean-up of non-paying customers will trigger a jump in Airtel’s ARPU to Rs 118-120 in the fiscal fourth quarter, FY19”.

Vittal said Airtel in its efforts to drive its core 2G user base to go 4G is rapidly refarming its 900 Mhz band spectrum for LTE services and will do the same with its arsenal of 2100 Mhz airwaves that are being currently used for 3G services.

The company’s immediate target, he said, is maximising 4G customer acquisitions in the country’s top-1,000 cities, following which it will focus on expanding its 4G act to the next 5,000 cities.

The Airtel CEO though said demand for smartphones and overall pace of feature phone users upgrading to smartphones would only rise if top device makers launch high quality smartphones in the Rs 4,000-5,000 price-range.

At present, some 100 million smartphones get incrementally added into India’s mobile system every year, of which the most popular segment are devices priced in the Rs 6K-10k range.

Vittal signalled that capex would start falling from next fiscal as site expansion would be more disciplined and purely linked to revenue and customer experience. “I don’t see the elevated level of capex that we saw this year, and investments (in FY20) will be largely in radio networks and transmission with reduced spends on core networks”.

The company spent around Rs25,000 crore as capex in FY18 and is expected to spend another roughly Rs26,000 crore this FY.

To fund its capex needs, the company has been raising funds through stake sales in its tower unit, Bharti Infratel, among others. The company’s board is set to meet on February 28 to consider the recommendations of a special panel constituted to explore further fund-raising options. ET has reported that Airtel is exploring a Rs12,000-Rs15,000 crore rights issue."
1,2019-02-01,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel’s board will meet on February 28 to consider the recommendations of a special panel which had been set up to explore options for raising funds, which the mobile phone operator will use to pare debt and free up cash for 4G expansion to take on Reliance Jio.

“…we wish to update you that the Board in its meeting held today, noted the inputs / recommendations of the ''Special Committee of Directors for Fund Raising' and accordingly, decided to convene a meeting of the Board on February 28, 2019 to consider the recommendations of the Committee,” India’s second largest telco said in a notice to the exchanges late Thursday.

The company’s stock was up 1.5 per cent at Rs311.80 on the BSE Friday.

In an exchange filing on December 20, Airtel has said its board had formed and authorised “a special committee of directors to comprehensively explore/evaluate various fundraising options to strengthen the company’s capital structure and balance sheet”.

ET has reported that Airtel was planning a Rs 12,000-15,000 crore rights issue to create a war chest to cut debt and meet 4G capex needs.

Net debt at December end rose to Rs 10,63,674 crore from Rs 9,17,139 crore a year earlier but was lower than about Rs 11,32,042 crore in the fiscal second quarter.

Over the past 21-odd months, Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower unit Bharti Infratel to cut debt to gird up for competition with Jio in the fiercely competitive 4G turf. It has already raised well over Rs 12,000 crore through multiple stake dilutions.

In December, Airtel said it will sell a further 32 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel, valued at close to Rs 15,500 crore.

Airtel’s Infratel stake sale and fundraising plans come on the heels of its Africa arm raising $1.25 billion, or about Rs 9,200 crore, last month by concluding a placement of shares to six global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group. It recently also raised $200 million from Qatar Investment Authority, to also pare debt. This will be followed by Airtel Africa’s initial public offer (IPO) around May-June next year, through which the telco plans to raise additional $1.25-1.5 billion."

4,2019-02-04,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel is likely to raise at least $3 billion from its planned asset sales in the next 12 months, which along with an imminent mobile tariff recovery in India, will ease pressure on its leverage and support its stable (BBB-/stable) outlook, global ratings agency, Fitch said.

""Bharti Airtel’s planned asset sales, including a potential initial public offer (IPO) of its African entity and sale of its stake in the (future) Indus-Bharti Infratel tower company, will relieve pressure on its funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net leverage, which is nearing the 2.5x threshold, above which we will consider negative rating action,” Fitch said in a media statement Monday.

The global rating agency also expects the recent introduction of minimum recharge plans by incumbents, higher data usage and easing competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm will “drive an increase in average industry tariff by at least 10 per cent to $1.6 in calender 2019.

Fitch estimates Bharti Airtel’s revenue and Ebitda for FY20 to rebound as data usage and tariffs rise.

Bharti Airtel shares were down nearly 2 per cent in afternoon trade on BSE at Rs 305.20.

The Sunil Mittal-led telco had reported a consolidated Rs 86 crore net profit in the December quarter, which was 72 per cent lower from a year ago, but the company’s revenue decline was arrested by the initial effects of the telco’s minimum recharge plans which pushed up its India mobile ARPU 4.1 per cent on-quarter to Rs104.

Bharti Airtel, which faces severe pressure on revenue and profitability in India owing to brutal competition, is trying to build a war chest to fund network expansion and take on Jio. It has been selling stakes in tower arm Bharti Infratel, and plans to sell 32 per cent more in that company to unlock funds to bolster its countrywide 4G networks to counter Jio.

Last November, its Africa arm raised $1.25 billion (Rs 9,200 crore approx) through a placement of shares to six global investors -- and an additional $200 million (Rs 1,420 crore) earlier this month from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) -- in the run-up to an IPO likely around June, through which Airtel plans to garner an additional $1.5-1.6 billion.

“We believe Bharti’s management is committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and is seeking to deleverage the company’s balance sheet,” Fitch said.

Fitch expects Bharti to “raise about $1.1-1.2 billion” through its upcoming Africa IPO in mid-2019, and “additional funds through the sale of its stake in the future Indus-Infratel merged tower entity”.

The global ratings agency expects the Indus-Bharti Infratel merger to get concluded by April, subject to regulatory approvals.

According to Fitch, Airtel’s Africa business has “performed better than expected,” and the agency has forecast that FY19 (Africa) revenue and Ebitda will increase by around 10 per cent and 30 per cent respectively, driven by stable tariffs, rising data usage and growing adoption of e-wallet services.

Fitch also reiterated that it sees a stable outlook for the telecom sector, which “reflects expectations of ARPU recovery as Jio would have less incentive to keep tariffs low once it achieves revenue market share of around 30 per cent by mid-2019, similar to Bharti’s share of around 32-33 per cent. 

Fitch also reiterated that it expects market leader Vodafone Idea’s RMS to slip below 30 per cent 30 per cent as it attempts a push through a complex integration of its dual networks."

6,2019-02-05,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: Moody's Investors Services lowered Bharti Airtel’s senior unsecured rating to junk on worries about weak cash flows for several quarters ahead, prompting a brief slump in shares. Bharti was cut to Ba1 from Baa3, the lowest in the investment grade, possibly increasing the cost of borrowing, especially overseas, by around 30-50 basis points, analysts said.

The company brushed aside the rerating move.

“The company continues to be rated as investment grade by two global rating agencies – Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor’s,” Bharti Airtel said. With “Africa debt already reduced to $3.5 billion, as also the fact that $6 billion of debt in India is under 16-year deferred spectrum payments, the overall debt situation is comfortable and planned initiatives will further benefit.”

Moody’s also downgraded “backed senior unsecured notes” issued by Bharti’s wholly-owned Dutch arm, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV to Ba1 from Baa3.

This is the first rating below investment grade by an international agency for Airtel, which has been singed by tariff wars following the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016.



Profitability to remain stressed

Tariff wars have taken a toll on revenue, profitability and cash flows in the industry.

Annalisa Di Chiara, vice president at Moody’s, said the downgrade “reflects uncertainty as to whether or not the company’s profitability, cash flow situation and debt levels can improve sustainably and materially, given the competitive dynamics in the Indian telco market.”

A significant recovery in cash flow from the core Indian mobile segment, she said, is needed to strengthen the “company’s credit quality” and support greater financial flexibility.

Moody’s also estimates the profitability of Bharti’s Indian mobile segment will remain low over the next several quarters in the absence of a fundamental change in the pricing of mobile services, together with a proportional shift in the composition of the company’s subscriber base to high-end 4G customers.

The news unnerved investors at first but they subsequently appeared to take it in their stride. Bharti Airtel dropped 4.3 per cent in early trades on the downgrade but recovered to close 0.41 per cent higher at Rs 307.85 on BSE. The company eked out a profit in the fiscal third quarter, thanks to one-time gains. Profit dropped 72 per cent to Rs 86 crore in the October-December period ––its 11th straight quarter of declining profit –– though its India business continued to post losses.

Operating free cash flows were a negative Rs 261 crore in the December quarter, compared with a negative Rs 1,341.2 crore in the fiscal second quarter and a positive Rs 1,121.4 crore a year ago. Net debt at the end of December fell to Rs 1.06 lakh crore from Rs 1.13 lakh crore in the fiscal second quarter, but was higher than Rs 91,714 crore a year back.

The carrier said its capital structure has already benefitted from “recent equity infusions via the marquee investors in its Africa business as also the infusion in India DTH (direct-to-home) business, totalling $1.7 billion.”

Airtel Africa has already raised $1.25 billion through a placement of shares to six global investors –– and an additional $200 million earlier this month from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) — ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) likely in June, through which it plans to raise an additional $1.5-1.6 billion.

“The upcoming Africa IPO and a stake sale in the future Bharti Infratel-Indus merged tower entity, would provide further robustness to capital structure,” Airtel said.

Naveen Kulkarni, telecoms analyst and head of research at Reliance Securities, said the Moody’s downgrade would not materially hurt Airtel since the bulk of the company’s debt relates to spectrum payments to the government. Its Africa debt, currently at a manageable $3.5 billion, is likely to shrink further, after the IPO around mid-2019.

One analyst, however, didn’t rule out a potential 30-50 bps rise in Airtel’s international borrowing costs following the Moody’s ratings downgrade.

Fitch on Monday said it expected Airtel to raise at least $3 billion from its planned asset sales over the next 12 months, which along with an imminent mobile tariff recovery, would ease pressure on its leverage and support its stable (BBB-/stable) outlook. Last October, S&P Global Ratings had reportedly said Airtel Africa’s $1.25-billion fund-raise would ease some pressure on the parent telco’s rating. S&P had pegged Airtel’s rating at BBB-."

12,2019-02-07,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA/MUMBAI: Vodafone Idea expects capital infusion of Rs 25,000 crore to come in by April and plans to kick off the sale of its stake in the entity being formed by the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel early in the next quarter as India’s top telco gears up to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel.

Senior company officials including CEO Balesh Sharma and CFO Akhay Moondra told analysts on an earnings call that it had started approaching potential investors for its fibre network.

The company, born out of the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in August, needs to deleverage to free up funds to spend on 4G network expansion and catch up with Jio and Airtel. Its net debt was Rs114760 crore in December.

Vodafone Idea plans to spend Rs 20,000 crore over the next five quarters, compared with Rs 1,170 crore in the October-December quarter, the executives said, several analysts present on the call told ET.

Vodafone Idea expects subscribers to continue leaving in the January-March and April-June quarters because of the higher pricing of its minimum recharge plans before stabilising. It lost 35 million users in the October-December period and was left with 387.2 million.

However, the executives emphasised that the company’s base model would be better off as the average revenue of 85% of the subscribers lost during the December quarter was less than Rs 20, the analysts said. The telco’s average revenue per user rose for the first time in several quarters to Rs 89 in the third quarter from Rs 88 in the previous three-month period.

Vodafone Idea did not immediately respond to ET’s queries. The company’s board had approved the Rs 25,000 crore rights issue in January.

Shares of the telco surged almost 11% on the BSE and closed with a gain of 8.2% at Rs 32.25 on Thursday. A day earlier, it reported that operating income (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased over 16% sequentially to Rs 1,140 crore in the third quarter, indicating that operational synergies due to the merger have started kicking in.

The company’s quarterly net loss widened to Rs 5,005.7 crore, while revenue declined 2.2% to Rs 11,764.8 crore, compared with a 7.1% fall in the previous three-month period.

Goldman Sachs forecast a 1% sequential revenue growth in the current quarter, which could be the first increase in seven quarters.

“However, without an increase in (industry) tariffs, we believe revenue for Voda-Idea could stagnate at current levels” and assuming maximum opex synergies, VIL’s annual Ebitda would be around Rs 9,900 crore, it said in a report, which flagged the telco’s stretched balance sheet as the biggest concern.

Brokerage JM Financial said VIL’s funding requirements would be a “staggering (Rs 40K-50K crore through end-FY21) in the context of its Rs 26K crore market-cap.”

It added that VIL’s cash balance at end of December was Rs 8,900 crore, and with Rs 5,000 crore expected from the sale of the 11.15% stake in Indus, the business can barely be funded till June (without raising equity or debt financing), based on negative free cash flow of Rs 5,000-6,000 crore per quarter and about Rs 5,000 crore of principal repayments.

Accordingly, “some form of government intervention/support many be needed to ensure a three-player mobile market over the long-term,” the brokerage said.

Top company officials recently met government officials seeking deferral of Rs 9,500 crore due towards spectrum charges this year, a request that was rejected."

13,2019-02-08,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA | MUMBAI: Vodafone Idea expects a capital infusion of Rs 25,000 crore to come in by April and plans to kick off the sale of its stake in the entity being formed by the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel early in the next quarter, as India’s top telco gears up to fight Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.

Senior company officials, including CEO Balesh Sharma and CFO Akshaya Moondra, told analysts on an earnings call that it had started approaching potential investors for its fibre network.

The company needs to deleverage to free up funds to spend on its 4G network expansion and catch up with Jio and Airtel. Its net debt was Rs 1,14,760 crore in December.

Vodafone Idea plans to spend Rs 20,000 crore over the next five quarters, compared with Rs 1,170 crore in the October-December quarter, the executives said, several analysts present on the call told ET.

Vodafone Idea expects subscribers to continue leaving in the January-March and April-June quarters, because of the higher pricing of its minimum recharge plans before stabilising. It lost 35 million users in the October-December period and was left with 387.2 million.

However, the executives emphasised that the company’s base model would be better off, as the average revenue of 85% of the subscribers lost during the December quarter was less than Rs 20, the analysts said. The telco’s average revenue per user rose for the first time in several quarters to Rs 89 in the third quarter from Rs 88 in the previous three-month period.

15,2019-02-08,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Brookfield Asset Management, one of the world’s top infrastructure and private equity investors, is in early talks to buy controlling shares in Reliance Jio’s telecom towers and fibre assets valued at over $15 billion (Rs 1.07 lakh crore), people directly aware of the matter said. The deal, if it happens, would be the largest private equity action, besides being one of the largest M&As in India.

Jio, the telecom arm of India's most valued company Reliance Industries (RIL), recently said it was spinning off tower and fibre into two separate entities, as part of an anticipated de-leveraging exercise. RIL is keen on retiring and refinancing a chunk of its Rs 3 lakh crore, or $40 billion, debt mostly soaked up to finance Jio's disruptive roll-out.

Jio operates with a network of over 2.2 lakh towers, including third party ones, and around three lakh route kilometre of optic fibre, in serving a subscriber base fast approaching 300 million.



Canada-based Brookfield, managing assets worth more than $330 billion globally, has been eyeing telecom infrastructure assets in Asia’s third largest economy for a while. Brookfield had purchased the loss-making East West Pipeline—a 1,400km pipeline connecting Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Bharuch in Gujarat—entity owned by Mukesh Ambani and family for $2 billion last year.

“Jio plans to take certain infrastructure assets out of the balance sheet as part of the de-leveraging exercise. It is exploring a deal with Brookfield to spin off assets which has the ability to carry huge debt when backed by long-term operating agreements,” aid a person familiar with the matter. Brookfield, which has built a rapport with RIL, along with its global sponsors are keen on a full acquisition, but details would be flushed out only as talks move forward.

A potential stake buy in Jio’s assets could make Brookfield the largest telecom infrastructure player in the country. Brookfield was unavailable for comment. RIL didn’t respond to an email query sent on Wednesday till the time of going to press.

Indus Towers, majority-owned by rival telcos Vodafone and Airtel, is merging with Bharti Infratel creating a $14 billion combine with 1.63 lakh towers. Private equity investor KKR and one of its sponsors Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board will hold 6% in the combined entity. KKR had bought into Bharti Infratel to trigger a $5 billion share purchase in the eventual combine, but the deal-making hasn't progressed.

Jio’s infra assets could be valued anywhere between $12-15 billion depending on how it consolidates towers spread between its own, third party and those of the bankrupt Reliance Communications (RCom), which it was expected to buyout. Incidentally, Brookfield was close to acquiring Anil Ambani-owned RCom’s tower unit before the deal collapsed.

If the transaction with Brookfield gets completed, it will be a rare private equity deal within the broader RIL. In the past, the group has had a joint venture with New York-based DE Shaw for financial services. 

The transaction with Brookfield will help Jio take a chunk off its debt from its books and lower the leverage ratio as it continues the ramp up in telecom, targeting a 50% market share in the near future. Jio’s move to hive off the tower and fibre businesses is in sync with the trends in the telecom industry where players split their infrastructure assets into separate entities. 

Analysts said any de-leveraging deal would only intensify Jio’s marketplace battles with rivals in a hemorrhaging Indian telecom sector. Rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have reported record losses and is in the midst of multiple fund-raising activities to face the Jio heat.

Jio has been making healthy contributions to RIL’s revenues and profits in recent quarters. But the heavy capital expenditure ensures it will burn cash for some time to come. The telecom unit reported a profit of Rs 831 crore on an operating revenue of Rs 10,383 crore in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. 

Ambani’s ambition is to make Jio as big as RIL’s traditional businesses in the future. The energy business—refining and petrochemicals—currently contributes the bulk of RIL’s revenues and profits, though subdued margins there would also hasten the proposed de-leveraging moves."
18,2019-02-08,Bharti Infratel,"Nifty opened in the negative and witnessed sustained selling pressure till the end of session and headed towards the 10,925 mark on Friday. The index wiped out most of the gain of the week and formed a High Wave candle with a long upper shadow, which signalled that selling pressure was intensifying at higher zones.

Nifty negated the formation of higher lows of last seven sessions and witnessed profit booking after logging gains of last six consecutive sessions. It formed a Doji candle followed by a bearish candle on the daily chart, which suggests a short-term pause in the positive momentum as it failed to hold its gains after a consolidation breakout above the 10,985 mark.

Now Nifty has to again cross and hold above 10,985 to witness an upward move towards 11,080 level, while on the downside, support exists at 10,880 and then 10,820 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,700 followed by 10,400 and 10,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,300 level. Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices from 11,100 to 10,700 levels, while Call writing was seen at 11,000 to 11,200 levels. The option band signified a shift in trading range to 10,800-11,100 zone.

India VIX moved up 0.87 per cent to 15.58 level. It needs to hold below 16 mark to extend its positive momentum with a hold above the 10,985 mark.

Bank Nifty failed to surpass the 27,500 mark and corrected towards the 27,220 level. It has negated the formation of higher lows of last four sessions and has found multiple hurdles between 27,500 and 27,750 levels in last five weeks. Now it has to cross and hold above 27,350 to extend its move towards 27,500 and then 27,750 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 27,000 and then 26,850 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10944 level with a loss of 1.35 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Bharti Infratel, Kotak Bank, Hexaware, Divi’s Lab and Siemens while shorts were seen in Tata Motors, NHPC, KSCL and Bank of India.

19,2019-02-11,Bharti Infratel,"There is widespread abhorrence towards Pigs for wallowing in mud, but most do not appreciate that they wallow in mud because they have no sweat glands. However, they are the smartest animal on the earth and cleanest in their natural habitat.

Drawing this analogy about the perception of Pigs, Hong Kong-based broker CLSA, in a note titled “Pigs That Might Fly,” lists 22 stocks in Asia region where valuations are at record low levels due to perception concerns, but offers significant upside if valuation reverts to the mean. Of the 22 stocks, six are from the Indian market including ONGC, Coal India, Bharti Airtel, ACC, ICICI Pru and ZEE Entertainment.

The rationale for ONGC appearing attractive is that the government hiked oil subsidy budget allocation by 22 per cent in the interim budget, which suggests realisation of the company could be much higher than implied by current stock prices. ONGC is one of the cheapest exploration and production companies in the world and as the subsidy overhang subsides, it offers sizable earning improvement.

Coal India, one of the largestcoal producing companies in the world, offers a dividend yield of 9 per cent based on FY20 earnings, the third-highest dividend yield in the Asia ex-Japan region. Coal India stock is available at nine times of FY20 earnings with 70 per cent return on equity.

India’s largest telecom company by revenue and market share Bharti Airtel’s focus on deleveraging due to the stake sale in Bharti Infratel, an initial public offering of African IPO could potentially bring down debt by 24 per cent. CLSA has a price target of Rs 410 on Bharti Airtel, which suggests a 34 per cent upside from the current level. ICICI Pru Life is trading at 40 per cent discount to HDFC Life, therefore narrowing of valuation discount could offer upside for the stock.


Other prominent stocks included in the list are Standard Chartered, Robot maker Fanuc, Singtel, Baidu and Nintendo. CLSA also listed 10 piglet stocks — basically smallcap companies — in the note. However, no Indian company figure in the list."

India’s CPI inflation rose at a milder pace than anticipated in January and remained well below the Reserve Bank of India’s target for the sixth straight month, which strengthened views that the central bank could again cut key interest rates at its next policy review in April.

Sensex dropped 140 points and Nifty touched 10,750 on the downside in early deals. However, both the indices soon trimmed losses as around 9:30 am, the BSE Sensex was 56 points or 0.16 per cent down at 35,978 and Nifty was 29 points or 0.27 per cent down at 10,765.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.24 per cent and 0.29 per cent down, respectively, at that time.

Technical charts indicate market is in bearish mood. The Nifty50 index on Wednesday settled below the 10,800 level and as per analysts, a drift towards the 10,720-10,700 range looks highly probable in the coming sessions.

Shares of YES Bank surged nearly 29 per cent after RBI cleared the lender of any disparity in reporting bad loans, known as divergence in market parlance.

Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto and Maruti were also among the gainers in the Sensex kitty. On the flip side, Bharti AIrtel, Coal India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, NTPC and Bajaj Finance were among the top losers in the Sensex index.

Among the 31 stocks (including Tata Motors DVR) in the Sensex pack, 13 were in the green and 18 were in the red.

Gains in shares of Hero MotoCorp, Maruti, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors and Tata Motors were keeping the BSE Auto index up while other sectoral indices were either down or flat.

The BSE Telecom pack fell over 3 per cent on losses in shares of index majors, including Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Vodafone Idea, Reliance Communications, Tata Communications and HFCL. 

Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 673 crore worth of domestic stocks on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 713 crore, data suggested.

31,2019-02-18,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market’s bearish momentum continued on Monday, as benchmark Sensex slipped over 200 points in early trade amid selling across most sectors.

While rupee’s weakness was cited as the immediate trigger for the selling spree, uninspiring December quarter earnings, a spike in crude oil prices, geopolitical tension on the Kashmir front and political uncertainty ahead of the general elections kept investors away from the market. 

Technical analysts see stock-specific opportunities in this market. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks. 


Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

Torrent Pharma | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,870-1,920 | Stop loss: Rs 1,725This stock has been witnessing a bullish trend since April 2018, as it has been trending above its short-term moving averages. The recent correction has created an opportunity for the stock to enter the established trend. “We expect the stock to move higher from its support placed at Rs 1,750,” said Nadeem. 


Bharti Infratel | Buy | Target price: Rs 340 | Stop loss: Rs 287Bharti Infratel reversed recently after a bearish trend, as the stock has been making higher tops and bottoms. A sustained close above key resistance levels with higher volumes and internal strength is favouring the bulls.


Aditya Agarwala, technical research analyst, YES Securities (India)

Bajaj Holdings & Investment | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,450-3,650 | Stop loss: Rs 2,950On the weekly chart, this stock is on the verge of a breakout from the neckline of an ascending triangle pattern placed at Rs 3,230. A successful breakout and sustained trade beyond the neckline resistance can extend the upward movement to the Rs 3,450-3,650 levels. Moreover, the stock witnessed volume-backed buying in the previous week, confirming the bullishness. The RSI has also turned upward, after taking support at the lower end of the bull zone i.e. 48 level, and has formed a positive reversal on the daily chart, suggesting bullishness on the counter. 


AIA Engineering| Buy | Target price: Rs 1,800-1,900 | Stop loss: Rs 1,630The weekly chart suggests AIA Engineering is on the verge of a breakout from a triangle pattern. On the daily chart, the stock has broken out of a sideways consolidation, triggering a bullish breakout. A sustained trade above Rs 1,700 will extend the rise to Rs 1,800-1,900 levels. The RSI has turned upward from the 40 mark, after forming a positive reversal, affirming bullishness.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

Reliance Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,350 | Stop loss: Rs 1,200This stock has shown a higher bottom formation on the daily chart and formed a positive candle to signify strength. It has the potential to rise further with a positive bias in the coming days. “The indicators are looking favourable. With good volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy on this stock for an upside target of Rs 1,350, keeping a stop loss of Rs 1,200,” Parekh said.


YES Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 280 | Stop loss: Rs 180This stock has witnessed a huge spurt with a positive bias and strength. “The RSI shows a steep rise with a trend reversal and with favourable indicators supporting and with good volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy on this stock for an upside target of Rs 280, keeping a stop loss of Rs 180,” Parekh said.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Oberoi Realty | Buy | Target price: Rs 511 | Stop loss: Rs 449This counter appears to be on the verge of a breakout, as it has registered a bullish engulfing formation on the weekly chart in a week, when the rest of the market was under fire. For the last couple of weeks, this counter has been consolidating in the Rs 475–432 range and a breakout above the said range shall open it up for a lucrative target towards Rs 520. 


Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail | Buy | Target price: Rs 257 | Stop loss: Rs 209For the last six sessions, this stock has been moving in a narrow range of five points. It, however, appears to have emerged out of this range in the last session on relatively much higher volumes. The stock can head to retest its lifetime high placed around Rs 263. “Positional traders should go long and look for a target of Rs 257 with a stop below Rs 209 on a closing basis,” Mohammad said.


Kkunal Parar, Senior Technical Research Analyst, Choice Broking 

Balrampur Chini Mills | Buy | Target price: Rs 160 | Stop loss: Rs 94On the daily chart, the stock has given a breakout of the neckline of its ""cup & handle pattern"" formation with an increase in volume. This suggests a bullish run and the stock may surge from its current level. The stock has strong support of 200-days exponential moving average which is placed at Rs 94.


Dilip Buildcon | Buy | Target price: Rs 515 | Stop loss: Rs 414On the daily chart, this stock has given a breakout of its upper band of “downward falling channel” formation which indicates upside movement in the counter. The volume activity is gradually picking up with the rise in price which shows an accentuated buying activity in the counter. The stock has started to trade above its 50-day moving average which indicates further upside movement in the stock.

Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here are the key factors that fuelled the rally in domestic stocks.


Trade war worries ease

Most Asian markets rallied after US President Donald Trump said he would postpone a March 1 deadline for a US tariff hike on Chinese imports following weekend talks on Beijing’s technology ambitions. Shanghai Composite index closed 5.60 per cent higher at 2,961. Hang Seng and Nikkei settled in green. Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities said, “Trump on Sunday postponed sanctions on $200 billion worth of goods from China which caused the dollar to weaken and rupee to gain strength. On the line of Asian markets, Indian indices opened in the green rose through the day.” 


Rupee gains strength

Rupee extended its rally. The domestic currency was trading over 13 paise higher at 71 against the dollar in afternoon trade after the greenback came under pressure against indexed currencies amid foreign fund flows and a higher opening for domestic equity market. On Friday, the rupee settled 10 paise higher at 71.14 against the US dollar. 


Robust FII inflows

Foreign investors on Friday pumped in a net of Rs 6,311 crore into domestic equities, the highest inflow in a day this month so far, exchange data showed. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said: “The market rally was fuelled by signs of progress in US-China trade talks and a gradual turnaround in FIIs liquidity. Market has factored the negatives cues from quarter earnings while a strengthening rupee is boosting investor’s sentiment.”


GST push & other factors 

Dalal Street also cheered the GST tax cut on under-construction flats to 5 per cent and affordable homes to 1 per cent effective April 1. Robust buying in banking and IT counters further lifted the benchmark indices. YES Bank closed 3.24 per cent higher at Rs 229, while TCS and Infosys gained 3 per cent and 2.94 per cent, respectively. “Nifty traded buoyant and ended around the day's high, taking cues from firm global markets and upbeat local cues. The GST tax cut on real estate added to the positivity. IT, banking and auto stocks were the top contributors from the sectoral front while the broader indices managed to end marginally higher,” said Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking.



PM Kisan Samman Nidhi launched

Market participants also got some booster after the government launched the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) to provide an assured income support to small and marginal farmers. This programme is expected to boost rural consumption and give stimulate demand for FMCG goods."

50,2019-02-25,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Strong global sentiment on signs of a possible US-China trade deal helped equity indices Sensex and Nifty close with healthy gains on Monday. 

Equity benchmark Sensex opened higher and built on the gains gradually on a fresh spell of buying across sectors, led by IT, bank and auto. 

Rupee's rise against the US dollar also boosted risk appetite as investors awaited key macro numbers, including GDP and infrastructure output prints.

Midcaps and smallcaps rose but trailed Sensex in terms of percentage gains. The BSE Midcap index closed 0.43 per cent higher, while BSE Smallcap index gained 0.74 per cent. 


Let's take a look at the highlights of Monday's session: 


Investors get richer by Rs 96k crore
Monday's rally added Rs 96,000 crore to investor kitty as cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms jumped to Rs 1,40,42,922 crore from Rs 1,39,46,745 crore on Friday. 


215 stocks hit circuits
As many as 215 stocks hit their upper circuits on BSE even as the same number of stocks also hit lower circuits. Among those that hit upper circuits included Swan Energy, Kwality, Orient Press, Dharani Sugars & Chemicals, Magadh Sugar & Energy and SORIL Infra Resources. Atlas Jewellery India, Niyogin Fintech, Tinna Trade, Adroit Infotech, Darshan Orna and Adroit Infotech were among the stocks that hit lower circuits. 


Wipro jumps to 19-year high 
Shares of IT major Wipro closed 1.86 per cent higher at Rs 386, its highest close in 19 years. The stock rallied after the company said it had received approval for an increase in authorised share capital and issue of bonus shares from majority of its shareholders.


RCom shares crack 8%
Snapping the winning run of two days, shares of Reliance Communications closed 8.10 per cent down at Rs 6.01. The stock came under a fresh spell of selling pressure after Axis Trustee said more shares of Reliance Communications have been pledged with it, taking the total to 9.18 per cent. 


BEL gains on order win
Shares of Bharat Electronics (BEL) closed 2.73 per cent higher at Rs 80.85 after it confirmed export orders valued about $33 million from Elbit Systems ElectroOptics Elop for manufacture and supply of next-generation EOIR payloads and another variant of EOIR payload for airborne applications. 


Jet Airways stock falls 3%
Shares of Jet Airways fell 3.19 per cent to Rs 229, breaking the winning streak of three consecutive sessions. The stock fell after reports that SBI was planning to approach NCLT to recover its loan from the beleaguered airline. However, a Reuters report said SBI denied any such move and termed the reports speculative. 


Adani Ports tanks 8%
Shares of Adani Ports and SEZ plunged 8.26 per cent to Rs 324.85 after several brokerages pointed out that if company's arm Adani Logistics acquires Adani Agri Logistics from Adani Enterprises in an all-cash deal, it will weigh on the stock performance in the near term. “Historically, APSEZ has had related-party transactions involving loans and advances towards other group companies. Even good assets are getting bought out in this transaction, it would still weigh on the stock performance in the near term,” Edelweiss Securities said. 


Realty stocks lose steam
The optimism over GST rate cut on under-construction properties gave realty stocks a boost in early trade. But the rally fizzled out and most realty stocks closed the day in the red after analysts points out that the GST rate cut would only benefit customers but developers will not gain from it as the input tax credit policy remains unchanged. The BSE Realty index fell 0.86 per cent, with Oberoi Realty (down 3.21 per cent), Prestige Estates (down 1.30 per cent), Sunteck Realty (down 0.87 per cent) and DLF (down 0.68 per cent) all ending in the red.

51,2019-02-25,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: The Bharti Airtel board will meet Thursday to finalise its ambitious fundraising plans as the second-largest telco aims to create a war chest to contain debt and meet capex needs for bolstering its 4G networks to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm.

“A meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled on February 28, to inter alia, consider recommendations of a special committee of directors for fund raising,” the Sunil Mittal—led telco said in a regulatory filing on BSE on Monday.

The Airtel board, it said, would also consider “a proposal for raising funds by issue of equity shares, bonds/debentures, or other securities, including through qualified institutions placement, rights issue, preferential issue or through any other permissible mode or a combination thereof, subject to regulatory/statutory approvals as may be required and determination of issue price, if any”.

ET had reported last November that Airtel planned to raise over Rs 15,000 crore via a rights issue to build a war chest to cut debt and meet 4G capex needs. 

Over the past 23-odd months, Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower arm, Bharti Infratel, to reduce debt and free up cash to fight Jio. It has already raised well over Rs 12,000 crore through multiple stake dilutions. Last December, it decided to sell a further 32% stake in Bharti Infratel, valued at close to Rs 15,500 crore, to build its 4G war chest. 

Last November, Airtel’s Africa arm raised $1.25 billion (or Rs 9,200 crore approx), through a placement of shares to six global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, in the runup to an Airtel Africa IPO likely around June this year, through which the telco plans to garner an additional $1.5-1.6 billion. More, recently, it did a follow-up $200 million fundraise via a fresh shares issuance to Qatar Investment Authority (QIA)."

Speaking on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Mittal said Airtel is hoping to form a fibre JV with Vodafone Idea and that the company should gradually raise the minimum ARPU levels from the current Rs35.


Can you give an overview of the telecom industry?
The situation now is mixed, some good and some not so great. I would say still a mixed thing, but overall, I remain optimistic and we have to look forward and not look back. We have had 2.5 years of real difficult period in Indian telecom.

It is time to look forward. 3 players in a country of 1.3 billion, per capita consumption highest in the world, 12 gigabytes a month is absolutely awe inspiring. Market remains very large, lots of people are migrating, getting squeezed out. If you look forward, what does any investor or market player looks for, big market. We have smaller markets in Africa and we see Seychelles - whatever you may do or ARPUs you have in the end, it is a small business. From their point of view India is a large market. Then, per capita consumption should be more. People are now hooked onto smartphones, getting 10-12 gigabytes a month, so that usage pattern is now settled as well. The third part is you want a market structure which is sustainable and you do not want competition in an infrastructure where there are too many players. Twelve operators were unsustainable and you see where that has gone now. 

It has come at a cost, moneys have been written off, bankruptcies have happened, but that is in the past. Looking forward, these 3 ingredients as market corrects itself now whenever it does, will be a huge upside. 

Let us look forward and be positive. 


Vodafone Group CEO Nick Read said all three telcos should sit together and discuss tariffs. Your comments?
No question of sitting together. All have to do their own things. I agree with regulator that it is the operators who have to decide. Even at GSMA we have discussed that more than regulation, it is the operator worldwide in their quest to have dominance and superior market share have been killing each other. It is not India but we have seen all over the world that return on telecom investment has been low. 

Everybody has realised that it is unsustainable and unlike other utilities, you cannot reap the benefits. The evolution of tech is so fast you have to keep buying spectrum. This is not utility based infrastructure project and has to be based on innovation. This means return on capital needs to be good, otherwise you will go bankrupt. 

We have done minimum ARPU plans, have done Rs 35. If you look at before Jio entered the industry, the revenue was Rs 200 ARPU and all we need to do is get back to that. We are not saying India needs to go levels where the world is. But can India be at 3$ a month, what is was before Jio came in? If you get back from RS 100 today, if you get back to Rs 200, the industry will become sustainable. But Rs 300 will be an ideal situation if you are consuming 10-12 gigabytes of data. Customers can comfortably pay Rs 300, everybody does not need to pay Rs 300. Eventually market has to correct itself and this is not wishful thinking, it will happen. No one can be against it for too long, but question is when. 


Your views on the next spectrum, auctions…
Spectrum pool is one of the highest. In the last 3 auctions and lot of trading and acquisitions including the one of Tatas, which will complete now. Applications have been filed to the DoT. All this spectrum takes care of the immediate needs for next few years. Only spectrum we need to have is in some circles to top up where we need a little bit more. That is small amount of money that will get spent. 

Then, question comes on 5G, and the 5G spectrum which will come up. Most likely scenario around India seems to be developing around 3.5 Ghz. My view is 3500 MHZ is one where India will enter but you need 100 Mhz for an operator and the current pricing is unacceptable. 


The regulator said the price was fine ...
Fine from what point of view? What has been fine so far? The fact is renewal spectrum was gun to the head and operators did not have a choice and those prices are taken as base for future auctions and what logic does that make? 


DoT had approached the regulator but...
DoT can keep trying, they had two failed auctions and do they want to have five more failed auctions after them? Spectrum is required, spectrum will be bought, India will get into 5G but only thing that will stand in the way is right pricing for spectrum in India. Government can decide if they want to do in one go or 3 go’s. 


Will you participate in 5G auctions at these prices?
We can but we will not at these prices because it makes no sense. Pricing has been recommended, but we are saying it is not appropriate. Eventually, we will get into 5G, India will get into 5G, will be in step with the world. My recommendation will be the government of India must recommend 5G coming to India early, rather than late. For that, 3 ingredients are required - infrastructure, equipment and their readiness is most important. Second is devices and in 12-18 months, we will see devices. 

Verizon is putting a hotspot for the whole of Manhattan, Korea telecom, we have conversations with them and they are now having commercial use cases and my friend Massa San in Softbank are rolling out. Operators in Europe will also roll out, so why will India stay behind. Devices will come in 12-18 months, so you have to get ready. Then, there is spectrum which is most ready and available in India. Entire milimetre wave and 3500 MHZ is out there, so there is no hurdle to spectrum. The government needs to sit down with the industry, call players, have a discussion and give a commitment to roll out 5G in country. 

Can you have 10 gigabit of speed on mobile phone and broadband? India does not have it. Regulator has said India needs more fibre, 5G can mitigate it. You can use for backhaul, home broadband, industrial application and yes, commercial retail cases is some years away but we need to work on it now. 

We need to start on auctions now and in 18-24 months, you get to ready. 


Isn’t the government reluctant to reduce price?
Government's hands are tied by recommendations of TRAI. What can they do? They can send it back to TRAI, TRAI will again send back. 


Is that a stalemate situation?
I don’t think so, we have been putting the cart before the horse. I don’t think we are late for 5G. It’s not that 5G has left the train. It’s just that chugging out of the station…. India wants 5G, India must get 5G. All the equipment being currently deployed by Airtel is 5G ready.


Legal tussles are only increasing in the industry…
Given the environment, I think there is no choice but to go through the legal route. Who will take a decision on not – if the government loses, they go to the court, and if we lose, we go to the court. Who is going to give up?


What about the various levies on the telecom sector?
I heard that regulator statement that he has made recommendations on lowering the levies on telecom companies. So, the regulator says, lower the fee, the govt says we need to encourage Digital India, and seeks more telecom networks, yet somehow, they are not able to…


Do you think you need more support from the government, as the pain is visible now? You are in losses, need more investments, tariffs are unsustainable?
Where can the govt help? The government can give more spectrum at reasonable prices. Govt can also ensure that levies in the segment are not punitive. Today we are sitting at 18% GST, 8% license fee, 5% SUC…Plus on top of that, there is customs duty, so it’s one of the heaviest taxed sector. And that is where we have said that you cannot have a situation where you want Digital India, the benefits of a digital deployment of infrastructure, and yet you tax it the most. So, this is one area where we need the support of the government, and where the government needs to walk the talk. 

The new policy clearly says revenue maximization is not the motive, and we will lower the burden on the industry. All we are saying is – let’s not go into new dialogue, just do all that you have committed.

Senior analysts in industry say privately if it goes on like this, we will see more collapses in the telecom industry. Do you think that existence of some of the players is in question?

I don’t think so. I would say that three players will be there. We will thrive. Why are you asking whether we will survive?


Will Airtel be looking at any stake in the Vodafone optic fibre unit? There are lot of talks…
We always talk to each other. Our fibre company is being formed. I think the court separation is expected any time now. We had filed for a demerger of the fibre unit. It may have already happened. It was in the last stages. So, we will have a fibre company in place no later than end of March. Telesonic – in that we have invited Vodafone to come and join.


Is a fibre JV possible?
Yeah. We have made an invitation. We did that in towers. If you remember Indus Towers was created. And on the same lines, we have asked Vodafone to come and join the fibre company.


Would this be a subsidiary of Bharti Infratel-Indus merged company?
No no. Currently, Telesonic is a subsidiary of Airtel and if Vodafone wants to come, obviously a new structure will be created. 


What is the response from their side?
Warm response. But till it happens…


Can you give some idea about Telesonic?
It has an existing fibre and all our fibre is being transferred to Telesonic.


Will it be 2 lakh kms of fibre?
Yes


Will it be a 3-party agreement like in towers?
It will be 2-party now. We are starting with our own fibre company and if Vodafone Idea brings its fibre assets, then they will get appropriate shares.


What is the potential of the fibre unit? 
There is a tower company, and there is a fibre company.


Will it be the largest fibre company, because Jio has 80,000 kms? 
They have a lot of fibre, we have a lot fibre. But when you combine fibre, it does two things – you get a lot of fibre though we have lot of overlaps. Both will gain about 25% capacity, and new routes which we don’t have. But importantly, the future build of all fibre starts getting common. So, you stop wasting money on two fibre on each track.


What about BSNL?
It’s always hard to do anything with BSNL.


What about Jio?
From my point of view, the more the merrier.


Have you approached them?
They have also decided to form a fibre company.


You don’t intend to talk to them, considering that in the tower company, there were Airtel, Vodafone and Idea?
From our point of view, one fibre company is going to be a perfect. There is also going to be BharatNet. There will be two fibre companies.


Will you talk to them?
First lets get the Voda thing going, then we will see after that. 


Are you leasing some fibre from BharatNet?
We have already taken some from them, we will take more from them.


Board meeting is on the 28th. Fund raising is on?
Yes, it is on the agenda. 


Some more details?
I can’t give you colour. 


Six months ago, Airtel was number one in profits, subscribers. And you were leading. Now that 1-2-3 is shifting, and Voda-Idea has more subscribers and it is making losses. Jio has been growing. You have lost the leadership.
I personally feel – I always give the example if Kotak bank. Can you tell me which number is it? Do you think it’s a good bank? I would personally rate it as the top private bank. So, is he at 1-2 or 3? Airtel has been number 1 for 22 years. So, have you give me something special?


We always write - the country’s number one telecom company? 
We will remain largest in the sense that you must understand. Like in UK there are three ops – almost equal in market share. Some may be up or down by half a percent. Some quarter some goes down, some up. Same is the case in Germany and France. So, unless you have a big market share gap. So right now, we are all in the thirties – 31%, 30.5%, and that’s where everybody is.


But it’s a matter of time? You are going down, they are going up.
We are not going down.


We mean in terms of subscriber market share?
Subscribers we can even reduce by 50 million more. That’s ok. We want revenue, and very high-end customers, well-paying customers. People who buy Netflix, or Amazon Prime. Our purpose is to have a better offering in the market place. 


So, these two companies – Aircel and RCom – are on the block? Rcom, Jio is not happening right now. If Rcom spectrum is available, would you be keen to buy it?
Some spectrum we will bid here and there. We will bid for any spectrum that comes up. First of all, my fundamental thing is that the spectrum belongs to DoT and how will it be sold by anybody else. I can’t understand this. The licenses are gone. When the license finishes and no payments are being made to DoT, the license is over. 


So, will you bid for the spectrum?
It will eventually go into the government auctions. That’s my view. It cannot be sold by the RP. How can the RP sell a sovereign asset? I personally feel that all these auctions being planned by the RPs and all – they are barking up the wrong tree. In the end, it’s DoT’s spectrum, and the money still needs to be paid to the DoT. My view is, why is the DoT not expatriating, and taking the spectrum back, and pool it into the auction


But under spectrum trading, it can be given?
But you need to have the asset. The license has expired. The asset is gone. There is a rollout obligation, there is no network today. There is no network running today – Aircel, Rcom or Telenor. Tatas are running the network until the last day. So, you have to run the networks, pay license fees, pay spectrum charges. Is that happening in those cases? The answer is no. My view is that these auctions will be meaningless, and this will go back to DoT.


Your IPO plans on Africa?
It will happen sometime this year. Africa business is doing well and you have seen the previous quarters. 


Any planned investments there?
That’s a continuous process. In fact, we are leading in the LTE space in Africa. 


Overall investments in India and Africa?
We invested Rs 23-24,000 crore in India when we close this March. Investments carry on.


Will you make similar investments this year?
I think the large capex cycle is behind us. We have done three years of high capex investments and that’s why we have been able to hold on to the market share. My own view is that in the coming years, the capex intensity will go down, other than when you go in for 5G in the next few years.


Tariffs? What makes you confident that Jio will raise tariffs?
We are confident about ourselves. Our customers are ready to pay us a little more. We have raised it to Rs 35 and we have seen ARPUs go up. My view is that trend will continue and we should take the minimum ARPUs up. 


What levels? You have hinted at Rs 75?
There is no timeline. You have to keep on experimenting, you have to keep on working on tariffs. My view is that going to Rs 2 per day and providing such large amounts of data, is imminently doable. So Rs 60 a month should not be a problem. Even Rs 3 per day should be attempted eventually. 


Is that legally tenable? Minimum threshold?
You heard the regulator say we can fix tariffs.


What are the big challenges that you foresee?
A lot of investments, spectrum bought. We just need better mix of customers, better offerings, better innovative plans, bundling of content, more banking services.


When do you see monetisation of content?
They are not free, they are in different packages. Example, for Rs 399 you get Netlfix, Amazon Prime.


Will Airtel enter into content creation?
Not at all. We have no ambition, no expertise.


What do you expect the government to do?
The government needs to walk the talk. They have committed in the document that this industry is overburdened. There’s no debate on that. All they need to do is just implement what they are saying. Why are they not doing it? Government must be concerned about this sector. It’s an important sector. You don’t want to take it to a point of no return and then start to wake up. We are seeing that happening in the aviation industry. You don’t want a situation where you take it too far. You need to take action timely. This is a heavily taxed sector. The government acknowledges that. They acknowledge that something needs to be done about it. All we are saying is do it early. 


Do you think defaults by telcos is a possibility?
I can’t speak for anyone else. We will not default under any circumstances.


The Bernstein report talks about huge losses for Jio if all accounting practices were same. Please it also says that you are following the right strategy by not subsidising handsets.
We are a company of alliances. We have done alliances with device players also. Where we have bundled some free data and airtime. There are lots of device companies who want to have their businesses continue. Karbonn, Lava and Micromax etc. they work with us. So, we are a company of partnerships. 


Is this plan working? Are people buying handsets?
We are holding on to our market share, means we are. But that’s a section where subsidies are very strong, especially the feature phone segment where we are not participating. In the smartphone side, we are doing fine. 


Jio is now the largest feature phone company…
Not many others are participating in that segment. But you are talking about a 4G feature phone. 


Did you ever think the situation would be so bad?
It’s not so bad. Three players. 1.3 billion people. 12 GB. Realisations were going down but they are stable now. Last four quarters are absolutely stable. It’s not profitable and it’s not sustainable but the fact is, future looks very promising. We just have to hang in there, hold on to our market share, ensure that your customers are happy and things will turn around. 


Have high ARPU customers shifted to Jio?
I can tell you that mid- and high-end customers have not gone from our side. ARPUs have come down but people who were paying 8 or 9 rupees are paying more. 


Quality of service continues to be bad…
There are always pockets where you can do better but by and large, network scores are good. I am the big critic of my network but I can tell you service is reasonably good now. 

4G and 5G will coexist. Unlike 3G which had short life. Investments are all in 4G. 


What’s your take on the global situation and Huawei?
We are doing trials with Huawei as well. Huawei is a big player in telecom. They’ve gone through a rough patch in US. Europe has by and large said they will use Huawei. We will track the space closely, especially from GSMA.

We are not at that stage (from Indian government side) where we see alarm bells ringing.


Can you talk about the changing nature of telcos?
Over a period of time, from pure connectivity, we have become digital machines now. On the back of telecom, you are now providing financial inclusion, entertainment, vital government services. You have to keep on going up the value chain to ensure that you are not merely connectivity provider. That’s where everybody is going. Telcos will be the one stop provider for customers. You will see a plethora of services being bundled, some of their own, some through alliances. Let’s see where it (Jio’s plan e-commerce) goes. If it’s a successful model, then we are clearly part of it. Amazon of Flipkart, if that model is successful, they will need a telecom player and we are open to partnerships. 


What could be initial revenue streams from 5G?
Too early to say. Home broadband is clearly there. Industrial applications will develop as India’s other infrastructure develops.

52,2019-02-26,Bharti Infratel,"Barcelona: Vodafone Group CEO Nick Read sought a level playing field in India, pointing out that the outcomes of the telecom regulator’s decisions over the past two years have hurt all carriers, except Reliance Jio Infocomm, adding to the acrimony between the country’s older carriers on one side, and the regulator and the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco on the other.

“I think it’s fair to say that for the last two years, we’ve had many regulatory outcomes that have worked against everyone in the market, except Jio, and we only ask for a level playing field in terms of regulation,” Read said, on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress on Monday.

Vodafone’s top executive appeared to be alluding to a clutch of contentious regulations issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) over the past two years.
Trai and the new entrant though have rejected all such allegations.

Some of the controversial decisions and regulations include a 57% cut in interconnect usage charge (IUC) to 6 paise a minute that had hurt revenue of older incumbents, while lowering costs for Jio. Then, the regulator’s recommendation to slap penalties of Rs 3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular for allegedly denying adequate points of interconnect (PoIs) to Jio, has been challenged by Vodafone in court.

Then, a Trai order that changed the rules to identify predatory pricing, and also mandated reporting of all segmented offers, was decried by older telcos as one which would stymie their competitiveness against Jio. Late last year, the telecom tribunal junked the order.

Vodafone’s Read said telecom sector pricing in India remained “artificially low” and won’t be sustainable, in that, at some point, all three (dominant) players — Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Jio — would need to sit down and discuss the matter.

“The pricing environment is artificial as all three operators are haemorrhaging cash, and therefore at some point, pricing needs to return to a more normalised level,” he said.



‘Blocking Huawei not Good for Industry’
The telecom industry is weighed down by nearly Rs 8 lakh crore debt and still battling price wars triggered by Jio, which entered the market over two years ago and disrupted it with free voice calls and low data prices.

Older carriers were forced to match rates to retain customers, putting immense pressure on revenue and profit. Fringe players exited while erstwhile Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, then the second and third-largest carriers, were forced to merge, leaving only three major private players in the market.

The merged entity as well as Airtel have been posting losses for their respective India businesses, with Jio the only profitable telco. But all three have run up substantial debt levels, and uncomfortable leverage ratios and looking to raise cash by selling assets such as towers and fibre.

The Vodafone Group CEO said India had gone through tough times, although the long-term situation appeared better, with post-sector consolidation and emergence of three evenly strong players.

“Pricing is lowest in the world for data. Average consumer is consuming 12 GB at price points you don’t see anywhere else. Ultimately pricing will go up, that does not mean it jumps, it will moderate. Now heavy discounting is going on,” Read said.

He reiterated that it was too early to auction 5G airwaves in India, amid continuing financial stress in the industry.

In fact, he does not envision healthy industry participation in an early 5G spectrum sale, given that “people are in a very challenged economic environment”, adding that it’s critical for the “industry to get into a healthier place” first.

Vodafone Idea, he said, is making “really good progress” on its dual networks integration, which has been accelerated from “four to two years”.

“We want to invest in and integrate networks because there is a lot of data traffic and we need performance,” he said.

He added that the mega Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel merger will close by May. The company may sell its stake in the combined entity to raise funds to invest in networks.

Read also said it’s too early to deploy 5G networks amid low compatible handset availability. “If we bring in 5G services now, we won’t be using high amounts of handsets, whereas in another 2-3 years, that would be the right way.”

UK’s Vodafone Group also feels blocking Huawei would not be good for the telecom industry, amid the bitter clash between the US and China over network security and accusations from President Donald Trump’s administration that the Chinese networks vendor had enabled state espionage by Beijing.

“Huawei plays a major role in the supply chain within our industry. We have three major clients providing equipment now, and if we concentrate down to two players, that is an unhealthy position not just for us as an industry but also national infrastructure in the country,” Read said.

57,2019-02-27,Bharti Infratel,"By Chandan Taparia 
The Nifty50 index had a highly volatile session on Wednesday, as it traded in a wider range of around 190 points through the day. It headed towards the 10,940 mark in the early trade but fell sharply towards 10,750 level and finally closed with a loss of around 30 points.

The index formed a bearish candle on the daily scale, as it has got stuck in a trading range. Follow-up action was missing on both sides, as every dip got bought into, while every bounce is being sold in the market.

Now, it has to hold above 10,750 to extend its move towards 10,888 and then 10,929 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 10,720 and then 10,650 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,400 followed by 10,700 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900 level. There was Call writing at 11,000 followed by 10,950 levels, while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. The Option band signified a trading range between 10,720 and 10,929 levels.

India VIX moves up sharply by 10.45 per cent to 18.90 level. A sudden spike in VIX has caused a pause in the positive momentum and VIX has to cool down below 16-15 levels to get a smooth ride in the market.

Bank Nifty remained highly volatile throughout the session, as it traded in a wider range between 26,700 and 27,200 levels. It formed a bearish engulfing candle on the daily scale, as there was selling pressure at higher levels. It has been stuck between 26,666 and 27,200 levels since last 11 sessions. Now it requires a decisive range breakout from the current trading band to commence fresh momentum.

On an immediate basis, the index has to hold above 26,850 to witness an upward move towards 27,000 and then 27,150 levels while on the downside major support exists at 26,666 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 0.24 per cent at 10,802 level. Long buildup was seen in TCS, Ultratech Cement, NTPC and M&M Finance while shorts were seen in HUL, Bharti Infratel, Titan and BPCL.

56,2019-02-27,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Around 21 stocks fell to touch their 52-week lows on NSE in Wednesday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows were Dynacons Systems & Solutions, The Grob Tea Company, Igarashi Motors India, Kitex Garments and N R Agarwal Industries.

Radha Madhav Corporation, Raj Rayon Industries, Thomas Scott and W S Industries also featured among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows on NSE.

On the other hand, AstraZeneca Pharma, Cantabil Retail India, Odisha Cement, Power Finance Corporation and Seamec were the stocks that hit their fresh 52-week highs today.

58,2019-02-28,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel shares rose over 2 per cent in early trade on Thursday, ahead of a board meeting later today to finalise its ambitious fundraising plans as the second-largest telco aims to create a war chest to contain debt and meet capex needs for bolstering its 4G networks to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm.

“A meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled on February 28, to inter alia, consider recommendations of a special committee of directors for fund raising,” the Sunil Mittal—led telco said in a regulatory filing on BSE last Monday.

The Airtel board, it said, would also consider “a proposal for raising funds by issue of equity shares, bonds/debentures, or other securities, including through qualified institutions placement, rights issue, preferential issue or through any other permissible mode or a combination thereof, subject to regulatory/statutory approvals as may be required and determination of issue price, if any”.

ET had reported last November that Airtel planned to raise over Rs 15,000 crore via rights issue to build a war chest to cut debt and meet 4G capex needs. 

Over the past 23-odd months, Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower arm, Bharti Infratel, to reduce debt and free up cash to fight Jio. It has already raised well over Rs 12,000 crore through multiple stake dilutions. Last December, it decided to sell a further 32 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel, valued at close to Rs 15,500 crore, to build its 4G war chest. 

Last November, Airtel’s Africa arm raised $1.25 billion (or Rs 9,200 crore approx), through a placement of shares to six global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, in the runup to an Airtel Africa IPO likely around June this year, through which the telco plans to garner an additional $1.5-1.6 billion. More, recently, it did a follow-up $200 million fundraise via a fresh shares issuance to Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).

Shares of India's second largest telco closed nearly flat at Rs 317.95 on BSE."
59,2019-02-28,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel’s board approved plans to raise as much as Rs 32,000 crore ($4.5 billion) through equity and bond sales in one of the largest such exercises by an Indian company. Of this, Rs 25,000 crore will be raised by way of a right issue and another Rs 7,000 crore will be mobilised through foreign currency perpetual bonds.

The record fundraising plan, unveiled after the board meeting on Thursday, comes as India’s second largest phone company seeks to reduce debt and financing costs, bolster cash flows and meet capital expenditure to fight the price war unleashed by Reliance Jio Infocomm.

The planned rights issue is aggressively priced at Rs 220 per share, or a discount of over 30% from the closing price of Rs 317.95 on BSE on Monday. The company will issue 1.14 billion shares, increasing its equity base by over 22% to 5.13 billion equity shares. The rights entitlement ratio has been pegged at 19 shares for every 67 held.

“The Bharti Airtel board has considered the recommendations of the special committee of directors, and thereby approved the fund raising of up to Rs 32,000 crore through a rights issuance of up to Rs 25,000 crore and perpetual bond with equity credit up to Rs 7,000 crore,” the company told the exchanges Thursday.

ET had reported the news on November 28.

The bulk of the proceeds from the share issue will be used to repay debt and lower borrowing costs. Bharti Airtel has net consolidated debt of Rs 1.15 lakh crore, of which the Indian operations’ borrowings amount to about Rs 80,000 crore. This includes outstanding spectrum payments of nearly Rs 46,000 crore. Bharti Airtel’s consolidated net debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) is 4.2x.

“This is will be largest fund mobilisation decision in one go by any Indian corporate in India,” said a top executive at a foreign investment bank associated with the company.

The company is expected to file the draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in the next two weeks and fund mobilisation will be completed by first quarter of 2019-20, a person familiar with the matter said.

This means that two major telecom companies–Bharti Airtel and market leader Vodafone Idea—plan to raise Rs 50,000 crore through right issues in the next three-four months, which could be one of the reasons for the aggressive pricing, said the banker. Vodafone Idea is looking to raise Rs25,000 crore through this route.

“Airtel's sizeable fundraise is aimed to fortify its balance sheet, boost liquidity levels, contain debt and give it a long-term access to funds that is critical to combat Jio and survive in a fiercely competitive industry,” said Naveen Kulkarni, telecoms analyst and research head at Reliance Securities. The discount “is clearly to make things attractive for the eligible shareholders to participate enthusiastically (but it) also partly reflects the continuing uncertainly in the telecom industry, with its accompanying, revenue share challenges.”

The Airtel board also “approved perpetual bonds of up to $1 billion (Rs 7,000 crore) denominated in foreign currency, subject to price, market conditions, and other terms and conditions as acceptable, and with conditions allowing the full accounting equity credit, and subject to all applicable laws, including under ECB (external commercial borrowing) regulations.”

The promoters of Bharti Airtel — Sunil Mittal and Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), who together own a 67.14% stake — are likely to participate in the fundraising exercise, said the people cited above.

In its annual report for the fiscal year ended March 2018, Singtel had said it would continue to take a long-term strategic view of the India business landscape. In FY18, the Singapore company increased its stake in Bharti Telecom, which is Airtel’s key holding company. This stake hike by Singtel led to its effective interest in Bharti Airtel rising to 39.5% from 36.5% in the previous fiscal year, the annual report said.

In India, Airtel is engaged in a price war triggered by Jio that has seen the number of dominant telecom operators shrink to just three private players from more than a dozen in two years.

“While this is painful in the short term, we have arrived at a more sustainable market structure,” Singtel said in the annual report. “Given the right regulations and fair policies, this can be expected to deliver benefits as industry earnings normalise.”

Over the past two years or so, Airtel has been raising funds by progressively reducing its stake in its listed tower arm, Bharti Infratel. It has already raised well over Rs 12,000 crore through multiple stake dilutions. Last December, it decided to sell a further 32% stake in Bharti Infratel, valued at close to Rs 15,500 crore at the time, to build its 4G war chest. That sale however is likely after Bharti Infratel completes its merger with Indus Towers. Depending on market conditions, Bharti Airtel will dilute its stake in the tower business in the latter half of 2019, the people said."
1,2019-03-01,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA:Bharti Airtel promoters Singtel and the Mittal family will need to jointly invest $2.4 billion (.`16,750 crore) in the telecom company’s upcoming $3.5 billion rights issue, which will sharply reduce its leverage when completed, analysts said. Reduced leverage and a stronger balance sheet would give India’s second-largest telco headroom to spend on 4G networks and bid aggressively for 5G spectrum to effectively combat Reliance Jio Infocomm, they said.

Credit Suisse estimates the rights issue requires “Singtel and the Mittals to contribute $1.4 billion and $1billion, respectively, given the high promoter ownership in Bharti Airtel” and added that it needs to be seen if “the relative shareholdings within these promoter groups undergo any change.” The Mittal family and Singtel collectively own a shade over 67% of Bharti Airtel.

The Swiss brokerage said the telco’s net debt to Ebitda or leverage ratio “will fall to 3.3x from current 4.4x level” if the rights issue is fully subscribed along with the (likely) sale of a further 35% stake in its tower arm, Bharti Infratel.

Airtel’s board approved plans on Thursday to raise Rs 32,000 crore through the rights issue and bond sales of Rs 7,000 crore, one of the largest fund-raising exercises by an Indian company. The objective is to cut debt and financing costs and boost cash flows to meet capex needs to engage meaningfully in the price war fomented by Mukesh Ambaniled Jio.

The Airtel stock fell 3.4% to Rs 307.05 at the close on the BSE on Friday. The rights issue was priced at Rs 220 a share, a discount of almost 31% to the closing price of Rs 317.95 on Thursday. Credit Suisse said the rights issue price “implies that the theoretical settling price for the stock should be Rs 297.”

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the massive capital raising plan sends “a strong signal that Bharti Airtel can continue to sustain tariffs at current levels and try to gain market share, and that its promoters are fully backing the company and willing to invest more to compete.”

The US brokerage expects Airtel’s “debt rating to stabilise” after the fund raising. Moody’s Investors Service lowered Airtel’s senior unsecured rating to junk in February on worries about weak cash flows.

Brokerage CLSA said the additional capital will strengthen Airtel’s balance sheet."
0,2019-03-01,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi|Kolkata: Bharti Airtel’s board approved plans to raise as much as Rs 32,000 crore ($4.5 billion) through equity and bond sales in one of the largest such exercises by an Indian company. Of this, Rs 25,000 crore will be raised by way of a rights issue and another Rs 7,000 crore will be mobilised through foreign currency perpetual bonds.

The record fundraising plan, unveiled after the board meeting on Thursday, comes as India’s second-largest phone company seeks to reduce debt and financing costs, bolster cash flows and meet capital expenditure to fight the price war unleashed by Reliance Jio Infocomm. The planned rights issue is aggressively priced at Rs 220 per share, or a discount of over 30% from the closing price of Rs 317.95 on BSE on Monday. The company will issue 1.14 billion shares, increasing its equity base by over 22% to 5.13 billion equity shares. The rights entitlement ratio has been pegged at 19 shares for every 67 held.

“The Bharti Airtel board has considered the recommendations of the special committee of directors, and thereby approved the fundraising of up to Rs 32,000 crore through a rights issuance of up to Rs 25,000 crore and perpetual bond with equity credit up to Rs 7,000 crore,” the company told the exchanges Thursday.

ET had reported the news on November 28.


Agencies

The bulk of the proceeds from the share issue will be used to repay debt and lower borrowing costs. Bharti Airtel has net consolidated debt of Rs 1.15 lakh crore, of which the Indian operations’ borrowings amount to about Rs 80,000 crore. This includes outstanding spectrum payments of nearly Rs 46,000 crore. Bharti Airtel’s consolidated net debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) is 4.2x.

“This is will be largest fund mobilisation decision in one go by any Indian corporate in India,” said a top executive at a foreign investment bank associated with the company.

Market appears to be cheering the improved prospects of Narendra Modi-led government coming back to power after the general elections 2019. The latest CVoter pre-poll survey of March 2019 for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections has predicted the BJP-led NDA falling just short of the majority mark of 272, winning 264 seats.

16,2019-03-12,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Indian shares skyrocketed on Tuesday amid renewed interest among FIIs as expectations ran high that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party will take power for a second term. 

Both Sensex and Nifty repeated yesterday's feat, jumping over 1 per cent each. 

Rupee was a big morale booster, which rose to a two-and-a-half-month high. 

Overseas, Asian markets were a pretty picture as UK Prime Minister got the European Commission to agree to changes in a Brexit deal ahead of a vote in the British parliament on the divorce agreement.

The rally stood mostly on the legs of Reliance Industries, HDFC duo and ICICI Bank, which were among top contributors. 

Rupee bulls came out in full throttle on account of weakness in the US dollar amid persistent buying by foreign portfolio investors. According to provisional data available with NSE, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 3,810.60 crore on Monday, which is over and above Rs Rs 2,741 crore they plowed into the capital markets in the first five trading sessions of March. 

The strong funds infusion propelled the domestic currency higher, which surged over its 2-month high. According to analysts, absence of RBI's intervention in the market added to the rise.

The 30-share index rose 482 points, or 1.30 per cent, to 37,536, but not before rallying 530 points. As many 20 issues flashed green.

NSE barometer Nifty topped the 11,300 mark to settle at 11,301, up 133 points or 1.19 per cent. As many as 30 stocks advanced, 19 declined and one remained unchanged. 

Bharti Airtel with gains of 5.12 per cent was the leader in the Sensex team. The stock surged after Bharti Infratel said its majority shareholder Bharti Airtel will lower its direct stake in the telecom tower company by more than a half. 

IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, L&T and Sun Pharma were among other major index gainers, rising up to 3.69 per cent. 

On the flip side, Bajaj Finance was the worst hit, with a decline of 1.30 per cent. Infosys, NTPC and ONGC lost the plot, dropping half a per cent each. 

The BSE midcap index closed 0.65 per cent higher and the smallcap one 1.07 per cent. 

IT was the only index that lost. Realty, telecom and capital goods were among the lead sectoral gainers, going up over 2 per cent each."
15,2019-03-12,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel shares jumped over 5 per cent whereas those of Bharti Infratel fell as much as 3 per cent in Tuesday's session after Infratel said Airtel was to sell some of its stake in the company.

Bharti Infratel said that Bharti Airtel will slash its stake in the telecom tower company by more than half to 18.3 per cent. 

On the other hand, Airtel's unit, Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd, will buy a 32 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel. Shares of Bharti Airtel closed 5.12 per cent up at Rs 350.80 while those of Bharti Infratel closed 0.72 per cent down at Rs 317.05 on BSE.Bharti Airtel's fund recent raising plans have given the stock a leg-up. The company, in its draft offer letter filed with market regulator Sebi, said Rs 21,550 crore from the proposed Rs 32,000-crore rights issue will be used to pare debt. 

Global brokerage CLSA said the capital raising will assuage any concerns around Bharti Airtel’s leverage."

13,2019-03-12,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Infratel Ltd said on Tuesday mobile carrier and its majority shareholder Bharti Airtel Ltd will lower its direct stake in the telecom tower company by more than a half.

Airtel's unit Nettle Infrastructure Investments will buy an up to 32 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel by March 18, Infratel said in an exchange filing.

Airtel will own an 18.3 per cent stake in Infratel after the transfer, down from its current stake of 50.33 per cent.

""Whenever Airtel transfers stake to Nettle Infrastructure, (eventually) they will sell the stake to a third party. This will help them raise money,"" said a Mumbai-based an analyst, who did not want to be named.

Airtel, like its peers in the industry, has faced immense competition since the entry of Reliance Industries' upstart Jio in late 2016 with its debts soaring and profit margins eroding.

Singapore Telecommunications Ltd said last week it will buy roughly $525 million worth Airtel stock as part of Airtel's plan to raise $4.6 billion through shares and bonds.

Nettle will buy Infratel shares for up to Rs 362.45 each, a premium of up to 13.4 per cent to the stock's closing price on Monday. Nettle already owns a 3.18 per cent stake in Infratel.

18,2019-03-13,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: An arbitral tribunal has dismissed Bharti Infratel’s exit charges claim of over Rs 195 crore (including multiple interest levies) from Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL).

It said the Indian arm of Russia’s Sistema JSFC is not liable to pay for premature termination of service contracts as its mobile licences were quashed by the Supreme Court in the 2G case, which resulted in a change of law — a force majeure event.

SSTL, the tribunal said, was in no position to continue with its obligations under the master services agreement with Bharti Infratel, as the “cancellation of its licences was an unforeseen event, beyond its control.”

The listed tower arm of Bharti Airtel said SSTL’s termination was voluntary as it selectively chose to participate in only eight telecom circles in the 2013 spectrum sale, instead of reobtaining mobile licences in all 21 affected circles to continue operations. The tribunal though, backed SSTL’s stand saying “there is no obligation to re-obtain the licences if they were quashed/terminated due to unforeseen circumstances.”

Bharti Infratel did not immediately indicate if it would challenge the arbitral tribunal verdict in Delhi High Court. A company spokesman declined comment to ET’s emailed queries.

SSTL chief executive Neera Sharma said the tribunal has held that “the 2G judgement resulted in a change in policy in allocation of spectrum” and amounted to a change of law under the contract between SSTL and Bharti Infratel, and termination of contract owing to change of law exempted SSTL from payment of exit charges,” Sharma told ET. She added that all exit charges and related interest claims by Bharti Infratel “had been rejected by the arbitral tribunal.”

The tribunal has, on the contrary, asked Bharti Infratel to refund the over Rs 1.33 crore security deposit submitted by SSTL with interest. Total refund (including multiple interest dues) to SSTL would be roughly Rs 2.9 crore."

22,2019-03-17,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Reliance Communications (RCom), which must pay Rs 453 crore to Ericsson by Tuesday to save chairman Anil Ambani from a Supreme Court-ordered jail term, is facing more legal woes over pending payment.

An arbitral tribunal has asked the telecom operator and a subsidiary to furnish bank guarantees totalling Rs 16.43 crore to Bharti Infratel on a dispute over terminating contracts with the tower firm in 11 telecom zones. In a separate development, Bharat Sanchar Nigam is set to approach the bankruptcy court to recover some Rs 700 crore in dues.

A BSNL spokesperson said it would approach the National Company Law Tribunal this week. A government official said the arrears were towards interconnect charges — over calls made from RCom’s network to phones on BSNL’s network.

RCom didn’t respond until press time on Sunday to an email seeking comment. The company, which is sitting on about Rs 46,000 crore debt, had earlier defaulted on a Rs 21-crore spectrum payment to the telecom department. Another Rs 281 crore is due to the government next month.

The fee being claimed by Bharti Infratel, listed tower arm of Bharti Airtel, relate to its master services agreement with RCom and Reliance Telecom (RTL) inked in April 2010 for providing passive infrastructure support in 11 circles. Passive infrastructure means provisioning of towers, shelters, diesel gensets, air conditioners and civil/electrical works to house and manage equipment such as antennae.

In its interim order, the arbitral tribunal comprising three retired Supreme Court judges directed RCom and RTL to furnish bank guarantees from a nationalised bank, in favour of Bharti Infratel within four weeks from its ruling dated March 11, 2019.

Bharti Infratel’s claims on account of exit fees and invoice charge amount to Rs 79 crore and Rs 22.92 crore respectively, as per the tribunal’s interim order, a copy of which was seen by ET. In its order, the arbitral tribunal asked the two companies to provide bank guarantees equivalent to 15% of the exit fees and 20% of the invoice charge claimed, collectively amounting to Rs 16.43 crore.

Bharti Infratel declined to comment. People aware of the matter said RCom would likely challenge the interim verdict in Delhi High Court."

Board meetings



Analyst calls

• Kotak Securities has recommended to buy Engineers India with a target price of Rs 153 as they believe EIL stock is trading at cheap valuation at PER 14x FY 2020 core earnings. EIL management reiterated positive outlook on the domestic order inflows driven by brownfield expansion of refineries, set up & integration of petrochemical plants with existing refineries and greenfield refinery expansion- including Maharashtra Refinery. 

 • Morgan Stanley has upgraded the rating of Kotak Mahindra Bank to overweight and raised the target price to ₹1,600 from Rs 1,365. The key factors, according to Morgan Stanley for the upgrade includes return of pricing power at private banks, partly helped by higher rates in wholesale markets and the funding crisis at NBFCs, improving credit risk situation in the corporate/SME segment. 

 • Reliance Securities has maintained its buy recommendation on ACC with a marginally revised target price of Rs 1,720. The brokerage continues to maintain their positive view on ACC owing to its deep penetration in the rural markets and consistent focus on premium products. 

• Geojit has downgraded the rating of Cadila Healthcare to hold with a revised target price of ₹358 based on 18x FY21E EPS. Highly leveraged balance sheet post Heinz India acquisition, which was funded largely through debt, remain a near term concern. 

• ICICI Securities has downgraded the ratings of Sterlite Technologies to hold and cut the target price to ₹230 per share citing pricing pressure. Some rub-off of steep correction in fibre optic cable prices in China and in other geographies may result in some downward revision of prices when they come to renegotiation, said the brokerage.

40,2019-03-19,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The telecom sector would require somewhere between $50-60 billion to operationalise the National Digital Communications Policy 2018 objectives by 2022, according to a preliminary finding.

In October 2018, the Narendra Modi government has come out with a national policy that aims to attract as much as $100 billion worth of investments and create 4 million new employment opportunities. 

""$50-60 billion is required to achieve policy targets by 2022,"" EY telecommunication leader Prashant Singhal said, adding that there was a need to come up with recommendations on annual gross revenue (AGR) as well as Goods and Service Tax (GST) to unlock more than Rs 25,000 crore.

There have been various litigations on the AGR while over Rs 25,000 crore is lying with the government on account of GST for which the industry is seeking a refund.

Telcos, barring Reliance Jio, have asked the government to waive GST on spectrum payments and other levies, and in a letter to to the government, lobby group, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) recently said that revenues have declined substantially, the output GST on revenue is unable to absorb input GST credits available.

The Delhi-based group said that nearly Rs 35,000 crore of operator's capital in the form of excess GST credits have been blocked.

""The government should provide credit for the money that can be further adjusted,"" Akhil Gupta, chairman, Bharti Infratel said.

However, Gupta said that there was no dearth of money in the infrastructure side, but the government should ensure that policies should be viable and predictable.

""Predatory pricing should not be allowed anymore,"" he added.

While the department of telecom (DoT) has done good work that includes the policy ambition for not considering revenue maximisation as a goal.

""It is time to make policy goals actionable,"" Sunil K Gupta, secretary, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said.

Gupta further said that any policy that was developed two decades ago, can't be correct in today's parlance, and added that it was time to think afresh.

Fiberisation is important for 5G, according to him, and he added that every stakeholder should be accountable to provide infrastructure as GDP growth depends on collaborative effots.

""Telcos are already investing into networks. The national policy talks of pricing rationalisation and 33 per cent of the revenue goes into taxes while in other markets such as in Australia, Europe and China, smaller spectrum usage charge is applied,"" P Balaji, chief regulatory officer at Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) said.

Balaji said that it was evident that the government has put on a framework to enable $1 trillion economy. 

""There is a need to simplify taxation regime. Infrastructure sharing is important for 5G. Revenue is not growing worldwide. Telcos spend 15-20 per cent on capital expenditure. It is desirable to have a policy on infrastructure,"" GSMA India policy director Manoj Misra said.

The London-based group said that SUC should be an administrative cost and not revenue opportunity for the government. 

When 5G comes, infrastructure will be decentralised. It could be a service revenue that may fund investments in future,"" Rajen Vagadia, president, Qualcomm India & SAARC said."

36,2019-03-19,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta has urged the government to ring in an affordable base price of 5G airwaves in the next sale and also made a strong case for penalising telcos failing to meet their 5G rollout obligations beyond the Tier 1 & 2 cities.

“Telcos failing to meet 5G rollout obligations, and only confining their coverage to Tier 1 & 2 cities with purely a profit maximisation aim, must be heavily penalised,” Gupta said, addressing delegates at the ET Telecom India Mobile Conclave 2019 Tuesday.

Conversely, phone companies that fully meet their 5G rollout obligations outside Tier 1 & 2 cities, he said, must be incentivised by way of “a complete waiver of licence fees, which can be recovered from the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) that has been accumulating over the years”.

“Let’s invest more in networks and less in spectrum and ensure India comes well above the 50th mark in the ICT index of the International telecom Union (ITU) in the days to come,” Gupta said.

5G services, he said, “must not be a showcase merely of South Delhi and the Nariman Points of India; this fast wirless broadband technology needs to go deep into the country, the benefit of which must be taken by the hinterland”.

The Bharti Infratel chairman rued the decline in the telecom industry’s fortunes, which instead of generating millions of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth creation, was seeing “massive job losses,” which “was unfortunate”.

Going forward, Gupta said “a balance between consumer interest and health of the industry needed to be kept in mind” by all stakeholders.

On a brighter note, Gupta told delegates at the ET event that India is the biggest guzzler of data, with consumption levels hitting a robust 12-13 GB per customer per month.

The reason for this scenario, he said, is since data is cheapest in India. “The pricing at which we offer data is lowest in the world, in that a GB in India costs 26 cents, compared to a global average of $8.53 per GB, which translates to about Rs 17-18 per GB in India vs a Rs 600 per GB global average.”"

42,2019-03-20,Bharti Infratel,"By Upmanyu Trivedi and Bhuma Shrivastava

Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani’s decision to end a deal with his brother -- even as he bailed him out -- may be an astute business move.

While helping keep his sibling out of prison this week, Ambani also ditched an accord to buy the assets of his brother’s beleaguered telecom carrier Reliance Communications Ltd., effectively nudging it toward bankruptcy. With RCom all but sure to head into insolvency proceedings, Ambani may be able to snag those same assets at a discount.

In a last-minute rescue Monday, Mukesh stepped in to help younger brother Anil pay $80 million in dues to a local unit of Ericsson AB and avert a three-month jail sentence. On the same day, his Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Anil’s RCom terminated a 2017 deal that had helped the latter stave off bankruptcy.

With that deal now off, RCom is likely to go into a court-led process that may provide Mukesh’s Jio another shot at buying up the carrier’s airwaves, towers and fiber. What’s more, he may get them for less than the Rs 17,300 crore ($2.5 billion) Jio agreed to pay a year ago given the weak financial health of India’s other telecom operators.


Cheaper For Jio
“Jio may have scrapped the asset purchase deal with RCom, but it cannot be ruled out that Jio will try and participate in the purchase,” under the bankruptcy process, said Saurav Kumar, a New Delhi-based partner at IndusLaw, an Indian law firm. That “may eventually be cheaper for Jio.”

A lower price for RCom’s assets would mean deeper haircuts for lenders trying to recover some of the $7 billion in debt the unprofitable operator had as of March 2018.

“India’s bleeding telecom sector will probably keep auction prices low,” allowing Jio to spend less on acquiring RCom’s spectrum, Kunal Agrawal, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst said in a March 19 note.

Jio’s debut in 2016 with free services slashed tariffs, forcing rivals into a brutal price war, where some merged while others quit or went bankrupt. Vodafone Idea Ltd., India’s no. 1 carrier, continues to report losses while Bharti Airtel Ltd., the second-biggest, has posted profits aided by one-time gains.


Shown Interest
Bharti Airtel’s tower unit Bharti Infratel Ltd. and Canadian private equity fund Brookfield Asset Management have shown interest in RCom’s tower assets, Business Standard reported citing sources it didn’t name.

Jio’s strength is buttressed by cash flows from parent Reliance Industries Ltd.’s petrochemicals and refining businesses.

Emails seeking comments from spokespersons at Reliance Industries and RCom went unanswered.

RCom on Monday reiterated that it was “committed to a comprehensive resolution” of its overall debt through India’s bankruptcy process.

A lack of approvals from over 40 Indian and foreign lenders over 15 months was cited as one of the reasons for killing the Jio deal, according to a RCom statement, besides other regulatory delays.


Invite Bids
Under bankruptcy proceedings, a court-appointed insolvency professional and panel of secured creditors will invite bids for RCom’s assets and oversee the sale process. About two-third of the creditors will need to agree to any resolution plan.

“It’s likely that bankers may approve a deal with some significant haircuts,” given the insolvency law doesn’t require consensus, IndusLaw’s Kumar said.

A year ago lenders had hoped for a very different outcome when Anil Ambani promised there would be no write-offs or equity conversions as his company neared asset sales. Earlier in 2017, he had promised RCom’s debt-reduction plan would be the largest in India’s history.

None of that went as planned. Banks were this month reprimanded by a judge for failing to crack down on RCom and better scrutinize the ambitious recovery picture it had painted.

“It takes two hands to clap,” said Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. “You have also failed. You can’t just say they (RCom) failed.”"

Analyst calls
• IIFL has maintained buy rating on ITC with a target price of ₹335. Conventional wisdom suggests that the continuous, sharp tax increase has been the main reason for the slowdown in sales and profit growth for ITC since FY15. However, analysis suggests that consumer slowdown is, in fact, a bigger factor and that FY14-FY19 cigarette EBIT CAGR would have been 786 bps higher, at 16 per cent. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded rating on Just Dial to sell from add and revised fair value to Rs 625 from Rs 545. After the sharp 24 per cent run-up in stock price over the past two weeks, the stock at 18.3 times FY20 EV/FCF offers limited upside, support from its Rs 14.4 billion cash balance notwithstanding. 

 • Jefferies has initiated coverage on ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company with a target price of ₹1,136. The brokerage believes that ICICI Lombard, the best-in-itsdomain private non-life insurer, is well-positioned to deliver RoEs in excess of 20 per cent, which would drive 19% book value growth and 25 per cent earnings growth over FY19-21. 

 • Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on Dabur India with a target price of Rs 535. The brokerage expects volume recovery to sustain over longer term. Dabur will benefit by expansion of the herbal market, premiumisation, innovative launches, said Edelweiss. 

 • CLSA has maintained buy rating on Jubilant Food-Works with a target price of Rs 1,600. The growth in food online-to-offline appears to be a concern and bring back memories of the last cycle where Domino’s struggled, but the franchise is prepared this time.

Souce: Edelweiss Alternative Research"
43,2019-03-21,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: India’s telcos called upon the government to clarify its stance on whether operators should order 5G equipment from Chinese company Huawei or not, saying they can’t afford to take a risk with millions of dollars at stake.

“We are at a loss as to what to do as an operator — should we order Huawei equipment or should we not? It (the risk) cannot be taken by operators,” Bharti Enterprises vice chairman Akhil Gupta said at the third ET Telecom India MobileConclaveon Tuesday. “I request the government of India to make it clear as soon as possible.”

Bharti Enterprises is the holding company of Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest phone company.

Gupta, also chairman of tower operator Bharti Infratel, said the industry understands that the Chinese firm is at the “cutting edge of 5G” technology but said “we can’t take a risk” as telcos will need to invest heavily in 5G equipment.

India’s phone companies are hesitant, said Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).


Ambiguity Over Allowing Huawei
“If there are perceived security issues, the government should inform operators so that they are not stuck with the risk because today if they invest using Huawei products, then six months down the line, they do not want to be in a position where government requires them to remove the equipment,” Mathews said.



COAI represents India’s non-state telcos — market leader Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and late entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm. Of the three, Jio uses 4G equipment from South Korea’s Samsung while Vodafone Idea and Airtel use Huawei’s 4G gear in several circles. Contracts for 5G equipment have not yet been awarded.

“Any move to retrospectively ban 5G equipment could not only be seriously disruptive to operators but also to customers who may face disruptions to their service,” Mathews said, adding telcos have also written to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).

The concerns have arisen because of DoT’s apparent ambiguity over allowing Huawei to participate in 5G trials.

The Chinese company was first excluded by DoT, then added to the list of those that could participate in the trials. But in late February, telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan said the government was yet to take a decision on whether to allow Chinese gear makers to take part as it was examining security-related issues on the back of fears raised by various countries.

Chinese equipment makers, mainly Huawei, have come under global scrutiny after the US raised security concerns regarding 5G equipment, given the former’s perceived proximity to the Chinese government. The US has asked its allies to ban 5G gear from Huawei. Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Australia have acquiesced.

Huawei India CEO Jay Chen rejected the allegations, saying there was no proof to back up them up.

“No matter the country in question, be it New Zealand, Australia or Germany, no one has found any solid evidence,” he said at the same event.

He said the company has testing facilities in the UK, Canada, Germany and Belgium, all of which are open to security checks by government officials, customers, technical experts and the media. “This is a good opportunity for Huawei to make security as its core competence, as important as innovation,” he said. “For example, the test centre in the UK is monitored by the UK agencies. Global government agencies, customers, media stakeholders can go to the UK centre and… audits have not found anything wrong.”

Indian operators have been trying to gather more information about security aspects related to Chinese 5G equipment.

At the conclave on Tuesday, Sundararajan highlighted how security was crucial as telecom adapts to the digital age.

“India needs to develop core capabilities in ICT (information and communications technology) because India is the second-largest country in world and also because digital sector is now increasingly becoming strategic sector for any country,” she said. “So, security and resilience of networks and trust in networks will be paramount.”"

49,2019-03-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market has entered a consolidation phase and the momentum indicators are indicating fatigue on the technical charts. Many of the stocks have slipped into the overbought zone and are hovering above their short-term moving averages. 

As such, some 226 stocks on NSE look set to correct, according to moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The momentum indicator signalled an downward crossover – a sign of bearish undertone – on these counters, hinting at possible downside. 

Many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included lenders such as YES Bank, DCB Bank and Andhra Bank, telecom companies Vodafone Idea and Bharti Infratel, beverages maker such as Tata Global Beverages, United Spirits and United Breweries and NBFCs such as IFCI and Ujjivan Financial. 

Ashok Leyland, Adani Enterprises, Zee Media, IRB Infra, Jain Irrigation, Voltas, HUDCO, Colgate-Palmolive, Avanti Feeds are some of the other stocks that have witnessed bearish crossovers, suggesting possible downsides on these counters.







The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. 

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa. 

Data showed just six stocks showed bullish crossovers on Monday’s daily charts. They included Jet Airways, Power Finance Corporation, Coromandel International, Apar Industries, Cyber Media and Indo Thai Securities. 



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio. 

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

For now, analysts are cautious on the market. Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in advised traders to avoid fresh long exposure. Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan said traders may initiate short positions if the index enters the 11,400-11,450 range.

On Tuesday, the NSE barometer traded a tad below the 11,400 level at the time of writing of this report. “Structurally, Nifty is in for a significant correction. Traders are advised to adopt a ‘sell on rise’ strategy going ahead,” Ratnaparkhi said.

Meanwhile, daily strength indicator RSI and momentum indicator Stochastic are both in bearish mode, which means profit booking may continue in the near term.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Vodafone Idea shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has showed an downward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.83 per cent down at Rs 30 on BSE."

0,2019-04-06,Bharti Infratel,"Voda Idea synergies to be realised by FY21. That will enable the cash generation from operations to improve, say Balesh 
   
   
   Sharma, CEO & MD, and Akshaya Moondra, CFO, Vodafone Idea, in interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 


Where is Vodafone Idea after creating this mega telecom company?

Balesh Sharma: Vodafone Idea creates a new company out of the merger of number two and number three telecom players. There are very strong sets of credentials whether you look at the infrastructure present already with larger pool of spectrum, well invested networks, fibre networks, two very strong brands as well as 387 million customers and of course, the parentage of the Aditya Birla and the Vodafone groups. So, we have got all that it needs to create a great company.

We believe the market has a huge amount of potential still to be tapped. The market is under-penetrated. With a billion sim cards, only half are using data. The other half will get into data. Opportunity has to be created to get them to use data. We are best poised for that because among non users of data, we have 46% market share between the two brands.

We are bringing the two networks together, creating the strength to be able to create a great customer experience and also to bring great profitability by reducing cost and bringing in synergies. 

For us very clearly the priority is to integrate very quickly so as to be able to improve customer experience and profitability. We are bringing in all kind of digital ecosystem partners to contribute to the society by creating digital India. Also, we want people to find us a great place to work in. 


How will a telecom company and shareholders benefit out of this big picture because there has been a disruptive wave of price drop? In next three years, will there be a significant improvement or will there be just an incremental change?

Balesh Sharma: It is a 1.3-billion people market with three private players and one BSNL. It is a great place for everyone to be. The potential there is still untapped. When you develop your network in terms of coverage and capacity to take more and more customers up the data usage curve, there has to be a growth coming in for everybody even at the current prices. When you look at the pricing, it is a category which is limited by nature. There is only so much spectrum, there is only so much capacity that can be created but there is an unlimited demand. So, in a category with a limited supply and unlimited demand, you are selling below cost. This is unsustainable and this is against any law of economics. The reason it is happening is obviously beyond economics. However, consolidation has already occurred. It is an optimal level of competition with three private players and one BSNL in the play. All four are burning cash and are cash negatives. So this is not sustainable. This has to turn around even on the pricing but pricing is not the only growth I am talking about. 

When prices go up, there is growth but even without that, at current prices as data usage goes up there is growth potential plus there is so much neighbourhood industries that are opening up where telecom has a role to play directly or indirectly. Strategies could be different to fructify that. However, whether it is retail or content or Fin Tech etc. there is huge potential for telecom companies to play and we have got clear plans towards that as well. 

All we are saying is we will not directly do all that, we will focus on what our core is, give our customers a great experience, use the analytics to present to them the best offerings that the world has, rather than creating it ourselves. 

We will bring it through partnerships. For instance, on content we already have partnerships with Netflix, Amazon, Zee and Sun TV. We will soon be announcing a partnership with one of the biggest music players in the world. We will not make it ourselves, but we will bring it to our customers.


There are two challenges for the company; one is the business environment which will not change overnight; and second is the financial challenge, the hole in the balance sheet, which you have managed to fix with the rights issue. In the Rs 25,000-crore issue, which will run between April 10 and April 24, existing shareholders will be able to buy 87 shares for every 38 shares held at an issue price of Rs 12.50 a share. Market view is this is good but not great. This will only take care of five, six quarters. Is it true?

Akshaya Moondra: I agree with that statement and let me explain how. In October-November, when we decided on this rights issue, the initial thoughts were about having a capital raise of a smaller size. Then the shareholders and promoters felt that at this point, we need to raise sufficient capital. So that question of whether the capital is adequate or not, goes out totally. 

And with that intent, we came to size of 250 billion of equity raise, which as you would say that is about the largest equity raise by any private company. 

From our perspective, it is enough and we will not need more capital. There are some figures I can share with you and some figures on which I can give guidance, not in terms of figures but qualitatively. 

In October 2018, when we decided on this plan, we started with a cash balance of Rs 136 billion (Rs 13,600 crore) on our balance sheet, the equity raise will bring in Rs 250 billion (Rs 25,000 crore). We have already announced that as Indus Towers merges into Bharti Infratel, the Indus stake which Vodafone Idea has will be monetised and that is worth about Rs 55 billion (Rs 5,500 crore) today. So all in all, about Rs 440-450 billion (Rs 44,000-45,000 crore) worth of cash is available for the business. 

Beyond that, we have an existing operation which is generating an EBITDA. We have already talked about EBITDA improvement coming from cost reduction. One of the ways to look at it is that if you say that Airtel is a good benchmark, that they are at a certain size of operation. Vodafone and Idea actually were two companies with somewhat similar size of cost structure. The cost structures were not very different but when number two and three come together, they inherit a cost structure. Most of the synergies that we are planning for today is just the deduplication of that cost. So, at a higher revenue figure, the cost structure will be same for a similar sized organisation. There is no reason why our profitability will be any lower, but it will take some time to get there. When we had done the merger announcement, we had said that synergies will be realised in FY23, but between the time the merger was announced and the time the merger got consummated, we had a lot of time to plan for this.

Now we have accelerated these synergies to be realised by FY21. That is one part which will enable the cash generation from operations to improve. The second part is we have made large investments in capacity creation and that was one of the reasons that before the merger, we were a bit constrained in terms of making the investment in coverage and capacity. That would have probably become a waste after the merger was completed. 

As soon as the merger has been completed, we have accelerated a process of finalising orders, integration process on the network has started and that will now give us a significant capacity increase. I will come to the investment part later but when we create more capacity, we are able to migrate more subscribers from low ARPU plans to higher ARPU plans because that is a function of capacity. 

As subscribers migrate to higher plans, that provides a revenue upside. This is not dependent on the market price rising which we believe is inevitable and will happen. We have a base EBITDA. It will improve from cost reduction which is just a deduplication of cost and we will get EBITDA improvement from subscribers migrating to higher price plans with the higher capacity being available to us without any improvement in the market prices which will happen later. 

This will give us additional cash. The last item of cash which we are looking at is the fibre monetisation. We have got about 1,56,000 kms of fibre. We have taken steps to divest that into a wholly-owned subsidiary which then becomes a vehicle for monetisation. We are taking steps to get that monetised. That is a large asset. If we take all this into account, we are very adequately funded and I do not see us needing any further capital for the foreseeable future."
1,2019-04-10,Bharti Infratel,"Vodafone Idea CEO Balesh Sharma is under no illusion that better customer experience is a big revenue earner. He promises better score on this front as he says there is a conscious choice for being the best in class. Sharma spoke to ETNow.Edited excerpts:


With this rights issue, would you expect to be fully funded for the foreseeable future, would there be any need for fund raising if planned asset monetisation does not work out?

You are right. The rights issue opens today for Rs 25,000 crore and it is open till April 24. Now, this gives us sufficient funding cover for our clearly stated strategy. As we have talked before to ETNow, our strategy is very clear with Vodafone-Idea Ltd -- two very strong companies and two very strong networks coming together. Therefore, it's great infrastructure and two very strong brands. 

However, the biggest priority for us is to integrate quickly so as to create more coverage and capacity, better customer experience and more profitability. Very clearly, on that direction, we are driving. This funding helps us fund ourselves sufficiently for that. 

With this funding and other opportunities we have talked about, which is Indus Towers, our fibre monetisation and the cash generated from business give us sufficient cover for a long haul to be able to fund our business adequately.


News reports suggest that Indus Towers monetisation is also likely in the next 3-4 months. Could we see more fund mobilisation within this timeline?

Look, Indus Towers monetisation is going to take place around the completion of the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus, which is likely as you said in coming months. When that happens, we have an option of taking stock in the new company or taking cash. We are looking forward to taking the cash and investing that into our business. So, it is well on track.

Give us a sense as to how much interest savings you are going to expect post this rights issue. Are the asset sale funds used to repay debt?

The rights issue helps us reducing the debt whether it is a DoT debt we are paying as instalments for spectrum and the interest thereon or the external debt. However, our real focus right now is to get the investments in to be able to move on our strategy for better customer experience and profitability.


Now in a recent interaction with us, you hinted that synergies are kicking in ahead of schedule. Could you give us a reworked savings that we can expect over the next say two years?

We had announced the merger, we said the merger integration is going to take us four years and therefore, we stated a synergy target and said this will happen in FY23. However, when we were waiting for merger approvals to come, we have spent that one and a half year meticulously planning every part of our business. 

When we finished that blue printing related to retail, distribution, people, organisation, networks and the like in every geography, we realised that we can actually do it much quicker. We are now saying we will do it in two years instead of four, which means in FY21 we would already deliver the synergy targets and very confident of the last six months of progress.


This may not still be enough for the company to return to profitability. What measures are you taking to do that?

The funding in itself is obviously not going to change profitability. What is going to change profitability is utilising the strength that we have with the two companies coming together, putting it together to be able to very rapidly build better coverage and capacity for 4G. 

When that happens, you know that this company Vodafone and Idea with the two brands we have already has 46 per cent share of the 2G market. The people who are not currently using data are sitting on 2G and they are sitting there for in one of my two networks. 

If we have coverage and capacity and great customer experience, the chances are those customers will continue to be with our brand as they go from non-usage of data to some usage of data to unlimited usage of data. Therefore, our brands have an opportunity of taking the customer up the journey on data usage and therefore uplifting the ARPU of each customer. Now this happens as we roll out more and more coverage and capacity and for that, this funding is important. 

The next part of our strategy is to say we will prioritise on more profitable areas. For us, to build future technologies like TDD and massive MIMO is already under way. We are building therefore humongous amount of capacities in the areas of the existing usage revenue and profitability. 

As for the customer experience in these areas, we will ensure we are as good or better than anybody else in the industry. Our existing customers get a much better experience and therefore stay on with us, which takes us up the revenue curve. 

Third, we are trying to correct revenues through all other possible revenue growth areas like enterprise businesses, partnerships and the like. 

With this funding, we will go on with the strategy and be able to grow revenues on one side and take out cost on the other and improve profitability.


What about market share, what about arresting that, you have lost 5 per cent, down to 32 per cent. Any conscious choice to go for quality rather than quantity, is it profitability of a market share that you will be going after? 

There is a conscious choice for being the best in class on customer experience. Everything else follows. Now when you look at where the market share loss has been, it is primarily because we did not have 4G coverage and 4G capacities even in the areas where you had coverage. That is what is corrected by us now very quickly by putting these two networks together. 

Everywhere where we put this network together, we get 4G because one of the two brands has 4G. The new network will have 4G plus in areas where we are investing on TDD and massive MIMO, and you get capacity. Every passing day, the customer experience across the country in every geography is going to improve."
2,2019-04-12,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: Companies with assetlight business models and high offbalance sheet obligations are likely to be impacted by the new accounting standard on leases — which came into effect from April 1, said brokerages.

According to Edelweiss, profits and return ratios of companies with asset-light business models such as retail, multiplex, airlines, and logistics and warehousing sectors would be impacted the most.

Telecom, hotels, and hospital sector companies will also be affected by the accounting change as they have high off-balance sheet lease obligations, Edelweiss said.

Ind-AS 116 sets out principles for recognition, presentation and disclosure of leases. The new accounting norms have been notified by the corporate affairs ministry.

The key change that has been introduced is the elimination of classification between operating and finance leases, which means that all leases on a lessee’s balance sheet will be recognised.

The balance sheet of asset-light companies will expand sharply as a result, the brokerages said.

Most aviation companies acquire aircraft via lease while retail and multiplex companies in the organised space operate mainly from leased premises, the analysts said.

Healthcare sector companies such as hospitals and diagnostic service providers acquire equipments on lease. Similarly, hotels acquire immovable properties and vehicles on operating lease.

Telecom companies will have to recognise agreements for sharing passive infrastructure in balance sheet, which were till not kept offbalance sheet, said analysts.

Motilal Oswal said 20 companies have rentals in excess of 5 per cent of revenues within BSE 500 companies, and they will be the most impacted. The companies that will be impacted include Jet Airways (India), SpiceJet, Bharti Infratel, Future Lifestyle, Coffee Day Enterprises, Inter-Globe Aviation, Inox Leisure, PVR, Blue Dart Express, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Firstsource Solutions, Trent and Shoppers Stop, the brokerage said.

“These companies operate primarily in the airline, retail, quick-service restaurants, telecom and entertainment sectors, which are highly reliant on the operating lease model,” said Motilal Oswal.

Of these 20 companies, seven have predominantly cancellable leases, where managements have the discretion to follow the revised standard or to continue with the existing accounting practice, the brokerage added.

Motilal Oswal said the accounting change should not bring any change in overall valuations but multiples of companies are likely to change materially with the change in the key financial metrics.

The brokerage also noted that companies with forex-denominated lease will have more volatility in earnings."
3,2019-04-14,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: An arbitration tribunal has ordered Reliance Communications (RCom) to pay Bharti Infratel Rs 39.22 crore for prematurely exiting the tower sites of the Sunil Mittal-led telecom infrastructure company, a ruling that adds to the financial woes of the Anil Ambani-owned bankrupt telco.

“The claimant is held entitled to a sum of Rs 39,22,48,384…as exit amount from December 12, 2015, along with applicable taxes,” said the arbitration tribunal in its award dated April 13. Bharti Infratel is claimant and RCom respondent.

The tribunal has also levied an interest amount that the telco has to pay to the infrastructure player. “The claimant shall be entitled to interest on the awarded amount at 9% p.a. from December 12, 2015, till realisation,” said the tribunal.

The arbitration tribunal’s decision will be another blow to RCom that faces debt ofRs 46,000 crore and has been fending off many legal battles with its operational creditors, including Bharti Infratel, and the telecom department, among others.

RCom didn’t comment on this specific issue to ET, but had previously said it can’t pay off any dues since it is under a payment moratorium due to its ongoing insolvency process.

RCom and Infratel’s relationship started in April 13, 2010, with a master service agreement (MSA) to share infrastructure.


Agencies

Infratel was to provide RCom 504 cell sites across circles in 2010 and 2015 with expiry terms fixed between 2020 and 2025, respectively.

However, friction started when RCom informed Infratel in December 2, 2015, that it was exiting 456 sites. According to the infrastructure provider, since the operator was exiting the sites before the stipulated period, it had to pay the exit penalty as per their pact.

According to the arbitration tribunal, the Anil Ambani-owned telco, in its defence, said it did not exit the sites voluntarily but was forced to do so because of “unforeseen circumstances that made it impossible for it to continue with the sites.”

The unforeseen circumstances referred to the 2012 Supreme Court verdict on the 2G spectrum case wherein the court quashed 122 telecom licences granted by the then central government to operators.

This was followed by a telecom policy (National Telecom Policy 2012) which delinked licence from spectrum and introduced a concept where new spectrum could be bought only through auctions. Operators had then approached the government to renew their spectrum licences which were close to expiry, but that didn’t happen.

Reliance Communications said it was one of the telcos affected by this. The telco, now staring at insolvency, told the tribunal that it had done whatever it could to salvage the situation, which included moving the Supreme Court against the government’s refusal to extend licences and even participated in the next round of 2G-3G auctions in 2015 for seven circles.

However, it managed to win spectrum in only two circles in those auctions because of fierce competition. The operator said that because of these circumstances, it should not be made to pay any exit amount on surrendering of sites."

RCom, Bharti Infratel: An arbitration tribunal has ordered Reliance Communications (RCom) to pay Bharti Infratel ₹39.2 crore for prematurely exiting the towers of the Sunil Mittal-led telecom infrastructure company, adding to the financial woes of the Anil Ambani-owned bankrupt telco.


Mastek, Majesco: Mid-tier IT firm Mastek is aiming to sell its 12 per cent holding in its former subsidiary Majesco by the end of 2019 and deploy the cash for acquisitions, as it aims a fourfold growth in business in the medium-term.


ITI: State-run telecom product maker ITI said it has recorded 20 per cent growth in revenue at Rs 2,051 crore for financial year 2018-19.

Board meetings
 Analyst callsAntique Stock Broking has maintained buy rating on UPL and revised target price to ₹1,000 from ₹910. The brokerage believes that UPL is likely to get benefit at operating level during fourth quarter of FY19 on account of favorable currency movement, positive product pricing and better acreage in key markets.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Mahindra & Mahindra with a target price of ₹790. M&M's core business faces headwinds in the form of an uncertain tractor demand outlook due to the cyclical downturn and the initial forecast of El Nino, a weak product lifecycle in UVs, a huge product skew toward diesel segment and a deteriorating margin profile.

• ICICIdirect has maintained buy rating on Tata Steel with a target price of ₹625. It is positive on Tata Steel on the back of increasing focus on higher margin domestic operations. Tata Steel’s standalone operations benefit from its integrated operations thereby clocking higher EBITDA/tonne vis-à-vis its domestic peers.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Motherson Sumi Systems and lowered target price to ₹170 from Rs 233. It has cut estimates by 15-30 per cent to factor in weaker domestic and global car markets, rupee appreciation against euro, and slower ramp-up of SMP volumes.

• Edelweiss has maintained hold rating on NMDC with a target price of ₹100. The brokerage expects volume challenges to persist owing to ongoing production halt at Donimalai despite ramp up expected in existing mines at Chattisgarh and new deposits in JV with CMDC. Over the past three months, the stock has underperformed global peers as well as iron ore prices.

The telecom major had earlier this month received Sebi approval to raise the funds in a bid to boost its balance sheet and create necessary headroom for spending more on its 4G networks to take on Reliance Jio.

The Sunil Mittal-led firm has set April 24 as the record date for the issue. Bharti Airtel’s announcement followed peer Vodafone’s Rs 25,000 crore rights issue that opened on April 10.

Bharti has raised Rs 27,800 crore over the last three years, by selling stakes in Bharti Infratel, the DTH business, its Africa business and by divesting towers in Africa and operations in two countries.

Edelweiss Securities said the fresh fund raising will help bring down debt-to-equity ratio of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to 0.9 times (from 1.5 times and 1.6 times) and tailing 12-month net debt-to-Ebitda to 3.5 times and 23.6 times (from 4.4 times and 30.4 times), respectively.

16,2019-04-21,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty put up a good show last week, as both the key indices logged gains of nearly 1 per cent on rally in select heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, TCS and Tata Motors.

Sensex and Nifty set fresh records at 39,487.45 and 11,856.15, respectively, during the week gone by, which saw fourth quarter earnings, FPI inflows and global sentiment setting the tone for the market.

The coming week has F&O expiry and fourth quarter numbers of some of the heavyweights that may infuse some volatility into the market and some knee-jerk reactions as well are expected due to the ongoing results. 


Here is a look at key factors that can sway the market through the coming week: 


F&O expiry: The market may experience bouts of volatility as the March series of futures and options contracts expire on Thursday and participants will roll over their positions to the April series.


Q4 earnings: The fourth quarter earnings will catch all eyes as the next week will see earnings of ACC, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bharti Infratel, UltraTech Cement, Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp and YES Bank among others. If they come out with better numbers and positive outlook for the future, the market may see itself scaling new highs. 


Political landscape: Experts say political vibes may keep market under pressure till election results are out on May 23. ""Markets are expected to remain subdued and under pressure at least till the election season is over,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote. Even though there is a broader belief that Narendra Modi-led NDA will come back to power, the undercurrent of uncertainty over election outcome may keep the market slightly subdued. 


FPI inflow: Flow of foreign portfolio investments will remain an important factor for the market. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained net buyers in the market, putting in Rs 1,038.46 crore on Thursday, NSE data showed. In April so far, FPIs have pumped in Rs 13,006 crore, data available with NSDL showed. 


Rupee's health: The Indian rupee on Thursday staged a strong comeback by gaining 25 paise to 69.35 against the US dollar after three sessions of losses amid sustained foreign fund inflows. The domestic unit declined by 18 paise on a weekly basis. A stable rupee will give investors some comfort at a time when several factors are indicating at volatile sessions ahead.


Global sentiment: The quarterly earnings of the US companies will be in focus too. Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.com are to report their first-quarter numbers in the coming week which will catch the attention of markets across the globe.


BoJ monetary policy meet: The Bank of Japan (BoJ) will announce interest rate decision on Thursday. As per Reuters, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its pledge to guide short-term rates at minus 0.1 per cent and long-term yields around zero under a policy dubbed yield curve control. It is also expected to forecast that inflation will remain below its target through the fiscal year that ends in March 2022. 


Technical barometer: The Nifty broke crucial support around the 11,760 level on Thursday, but somehow extended its higher-high higher low formation for the fourth straight session. The bulls looked exhausted after the recent rise, said analysts, who feel the index needs to hold above 11,700 to buck the weakening trend. Going ahead, if Nifty trades below 11,738 and closes below 11,700, it may result in the failure of the recent breakout, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in."

18,2019-04-23,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm may be pushed to raise prices in this financial year as it needs to spend about Rs 9,000 crore a year on its long-term capacity leasing deals with special purpose vehicles (SPVs) created to hold its demerged fibre and towers assets, coupled with the capital raising plans of rivals Vodafone Idea (VIL) and Bharti Airtel, said analysts.

“The likelihood of Jio raising prices is higher today than it was six to nine months ago, which has positive implications for incumbent peers, particularly, Vodafone Idea,” JP Morgan said in a note to clients seen by ET. The US brokerage said investors increasingly believe Vodafone Idea and Airtel’s capital raising plans, signalling their capacity to fight, may prompt Jio to rethink its pricing stance, especially on whether it can afford to keep expanding its balance sheet investments for the next two three years.

VIL and Airtel plan to raise about Rs 25,000 crore each through rights issues to boost their countrywide 4G push to effectively battle Jio.

Jio’s management, however, reiterated at its post-results analyst call last week that the telecom operator would not tweak tariffs and would continue to focus on gaining subscriber market share.

The company’s pricing aggression since its entry in September 2016 forced incumbents to match rates to retain customers, galvanising consumption of voice and data services. Users gained but India’s older carriers got hurt. But headline prices — albeit low — have been stable for more than 16 months now, indicating signs of stability, especially with the market having been reduced to three private players.

Analysts said Jio’s tower and fibre SPVs, managed by infrastructure investment trusts, removes refinancing requirements for the country’s youngest telco but would encumber it with a material cash cost in the early years since Jio has inked a 20-year pact for 50% of the fibre capacity and is also the anchor tenant on the 175,000-odd towers.

Some experts stressed though that Jio’s costs would decrease once external tenants come on board, though others said bringing new operator tenants won’t be easy for the tower SPV as both incumbent telcos have their own tower arms (Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel).

Parent Reliance Industries said at last week’s analyst meet that the new tenants for the towers SPV would primarily be telcos, but for fibre there could be multiple players, including internet services providers (ISPs), media distribution companies, enterprise customers and telcos.

Goldman Sachs estimates RIL’s capex intensity in telecom to drop significantly in 2019-20 with demerger of Jio’s tower and fibre assets along with 99% population coverage.

Jio’s capex in the fourth quarter of FY20 was pegged at Rs 21,500 crore and total capex for the fiscal stood at $10 billion (about Rs 70,000 crore).

Brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities, however, expressed surprise over why Jio’s Ebitda margin has remained stagnant at 38-39% for five consecutive quarters, noting that it expanded merely 120 basis points (bps) year-on-year in the March quarter, despite a 56% year-on-year revenue growth to ?11,106 crore, even as network operating expenditure jumped 88% year-on-year.

“Lack of operating leverage in earnings prints continues to surprise as network opex per unit of data carried on the network stayed flat. This challenges our understanding of the wireless business being an inherently high operating leverage one, and Jio has been remarkably consistent in challenging our understanding of the business,” Kotak said in a note seen by ET.

Analysts say a reason could be that Jio is capitalising lesser than previously its depreciation and amortisation costs, and recognising more in the P&L as coverage reaches 99% of the country’s population.

The Mukesh Ambani-led carrier, which has 306.7 million users, reported a 65% jump in net profit in the fourth quarter – its sixth straight profitable quarter – propelled by strong customer additions and data consumption.

JM Financial said Jio is set to emerge as the biggest telco in the quarter to March 2019, on the strength of its Rs 11,100 crore revenue that is likely to exceed market leader VIL’s estimated Rs 10,900 crore in the same period."

The Nifty50 index failed to surpass the 11,650 level on Tuesday and consolidated for most part of the session with sustained pressure at every small bounceback. 

The index has been falling from last three sessions and has started forming lower highs, but it is still respecting its multiple support at 11,550 level from last 16 sessions.

The index formed a bearish candle followed by a Bearish Belt Hold pattern on the daily scale, which indicated that the bears are now forcing the market to restrict its momentum.

The index saw its lowest daily close in last 16 sessions as the bears appeared to have got a grip on it near major support zones. If Nifty fails to hold the 11,550 level, then a consolidation breakdown could take it lower towards the 11,500-11,480 zone while resistance is shifting lower towards the 11,666 level.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,500 followed by 11,000 levels while maximum Call OI was at 11,700 followed by 12,000 levels. There was a shift in congestion of Call open interest from strike price 12,000 to 11,700, which indicated that the upside is being restricted to the 11,666-11,700 zone.

Meaningful Call writing was seen at 11,700 followed by 11,600 levels, while there was Put writing at 11,500 followed by 11,600 levels. The option band signified a shift in trading range to the 11,500-11,700 zone.

India VIX moved up 2.47 per cent to 24.65 level even as it made a high of 26.31 during the session. VIX is at its highest level in 38 months since February 2016. A rising VIX indicates limited upside with volatile swings.

Bank Nifty remained volatile and drifted towards the 29,450 level as it failed to hold multiple supports at 29,650 level. It formed a Three Black Crows pattern on the daily scale, which implies supply at higher levels as it tumbled from its lifetime high of 30,669. Now as long as the index holds below 29,750 level, it could extend losses towards 29,250 and then 29,000 levels, while on the upside, a major hurdle is seen at 30,000.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 11,590 with a loss of 0.24 per cent. There was long buildup in ONGC, Coal India, Bata India and ICICI Bank while shorts were seen in Bharti Infratel, Berger Paints, Bharti Airtel and GAIL.

Analyst calls

 • Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on Dr Reddy's Laboratories with a target price of ₹3,450. The company is getting fitter and leaner as it divests loss-making ventures and bolsters core competencies, said Edelweiss. 

 • HSBC has maintained buy rating on Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and revised target price to ₹,500 from ₹1,600. To address investors’ concerns on increase in pledging of promoter’s share, promoters can utilise their personal assets to reduce pledged shares from 78% to 68% in the next few months, said HSBC. 

 • IIFL has maintained buy rating on Essel Propack with a target price of ₹160 after Essel Propack's promoters sold 90% of their stake to the Blackstone Group at ₹134 per share. Essel Propack could benefit from Blackstone’s management talent, and systems and processes. 

 • Kotak Securities has retained buy rating on Welspun Corp with a target price of ₹161. Given its strong manufacturing and execution capabilities, strong order backlog coupled with robust bids in the pipeline, Welspun Corp is better placed to take advantage of renewed pipe demand globally and in the domestic market, said Kotak Securities. 

 • Morgan Stanley has upgraded Lupin to overweight and raised target price to ₹1,094 from ₹783. After a sharp fall in earnings and stock price over the past four years, Lupin now appears well positioned for recovery, said Morgan Stanley.

25,2019-04-24,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market rose on Wednesday morning tracking overnight gains in US stocks. Upbeat earnings helped the Nasdaq and S&P500 reach record closing highs on Wall Street on Tuesday.

Tata Motors shed the most, down 1.62 per cent. Among other losers were Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Vedanta, Sun Pharma and Tata Steel.

26,2019-04-24,Bharti Infratel,"The markets might remain very volatile from a short-term perspective. It is the good quality stocks and stock selective action 
  
  
  that needs to be mandated in these markets, said Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 


Do you want to start with crude oil, the earning season or the elections?
The global macro factors remain at the top of the agenda for a lot of equity investors. The spike in crude prices does hurt sentiments across the emerging pack as well as the global markets. The second element has to do with the entire Brexit outcome and global recessionary factors, the inverted US yield curve, what is happening with the German bunds etc.

A lot of the central bankers have already sprung into action and so the actions taken by the ECB and the Fed are a testimony in terms of the proactive measures that are being taken by the central bankers. The global backdrop will continue to be very volatile. That coupled with what will be unfolding in Indian election scenario is going to be a main factor as far as global and domestic macro factors are concerned. 

When it comes to corporate earnings, that is going to be the basic facet in terms of a reset that the markets will probably look at. When you are talking about the low base over the next few quarters and corporate earnings improving with the expectations of private capex coming back -- if that scenario pans out -- then the corporate earnings will probably start improving. 

Our own base case is a 15%-16% growth which lays testimony to the kind of earnings expectations that one can take from banks and even from some of the oil and gas heavyweights. The markets might remain very volatile from a short-term perspective. It is the good quality stocks and stock selective action that one really needs to mandate in these markets.


ACC missed the margin trajectory and the estimates because of the RMC (ready mixed cement) pressures kicking in in the quarter gone by. Would UltraTech and the cament pack fare the same way? 
The volume growth is largely in line with expectations for ACC at 7.5 million tonnes. They disappointed the street with the margins. If you dwell deeper, the higher slack cost is something that probably impacted the operating performance. Also, petcoke and international coke prices actually came off and the rupee also appreciated in the latter half against the dollar.

But those benefits were not very evident in terms of the ACC’s reported numbers at this point of time. The margins at 13.6% disappointed the market because large element of the expectation was improvement in the operating performance. 

From a valuation perspective, it is around 11 times EV/EBITDA around 130 odd on the US dollar per tonne basis. The premium valuations would get justified on expectations that the new plants which are operating at higher capacities would deliver.


The Indiabulls Group is clearly looking to exit realty for the deal with LVB to really follow through. How do you see the synergies shaping up?
The regulatory approvals which are yet to come through form a big overhang for the stocks. If that comes through, a lot of synergies would get built in for the Indiabulls Group stocks as well. 

If it does not go through, that overhang will probably still persist and within the group itself, the housing finance arm is probably one of the entities that is expected to do well based on the expectations of good capital adequacy, good asset quality numbers that it keeps on reporting and the expectations of strong earnings growth and the momentum carrying on to the bottom line.

If the approval does come through,the longer term synergies will get played out on the Indiabulls stocks. If it does not, the reversal can also be sharp. One needs to watch out for the approval to probably come through.


What is your call on Lupin?
One really needs to await what kind of action is indicated on these plants and the second element obviously is going to be the Q4 numbers. These numbers are going to be very strong on two basic factors -- a)the Ranexa launch and the exclusivity thereof is going to ramp up their US revenues by more than 30-32% odd close to $250 odd million. b) Tamiflu sales. 

A part of the Ranexa revenues should also get recognised in the quarter to come. With the business expected to remain soft, the Solosec ramp-up is going to be very interesting. If any action is indicated in terms of an import, that would be a negative. I expect some softness in Lupin over the next few weeks.


What is the expectation from Bharti Infratel?
The expectations in terms of the tenancy additions that are expected to take place need to be watched out for. The loss of share that has come through, did impact the balance sheet. You are obviously going to have other elements in terms of other income moving up because of the payoffs that are going to come through within the individual segments.

The EBITDA margins, specifically on the energy segment is something to be closely watched out for and the consolidated EBITDA margins as well. It should be a stable performance as far as Bharti Infratel is concerned. It is fair to say that anybody holding on to the stock can hold on. Any disappointment that can come through in terms of numbers which I do not believe should come through. It should largely be in tune with street expectations."
27,2019-04-24,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel reported a flat net profit in the fiscal fourth quarter, hurt by a sharp drop in co-locations on its telecom sites amid rapid consolidation in the sector, and said its merger with Indus Towers was on track and will be completed in the next few months.

India’s sole listed tower company’s consolidated net profit for the January-March period came in at Rs608 crore compared with Rs606 crore a year back, and Rs 648 crore in the previous three-month period.

Quarterly consolidated revenue fell 2% on year and 1% sequentially, to Rs3,600 crore, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

The company’s results were announced after market hours. Bharti Infratel's stock closed up 2.6% at Rs 302.15 on BSE Wednesday.

“The year gone by saw major consolidation in the Indian telecom industry with four operators ceasing to exist either on account of mergers or outright shut down of operations. Between Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, approximately 20% of opening co-locations were lost during the year translating to approximately 75,000 co-locations on an overall basis and approximately 40,000 co-locations on consolidated basis, mainly due to merger of Vodafone & Idea,” Akhil Gupta, chairman at Bharti Infratel, said in the statement.

Co-locations are points where a tower company deploys mobile telecom antennae of multiple carriers on a single structure.

“However, despite such unprecedented loss of co-locations, the overall financial performance for the year and the quarter ended March 31, 2019 has only been marginally lower than last year,” he added.

Gupta was however more upbeat about the business prospects of the company going forward, given the surging demand for data.

“We believe that with rapidly growing data demand, large network rollouts will be required, indicating strong potential for the company in coming years and we are already seeing some early signs of acceleration in network rollouts,” the top executive said.

The company’s consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortisation (Ebitda) fell 4% on-year to Rs 1,534 crore for the quarter ended March 2018, while operating free cash flow rose 14% on-year to Rs 1,154 crore during the period.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base increased by 826 on-year but fell by 24 sequentially to 92,277 in the fiscal fourth quarter. The tower company alone lost a whopping 32.873 co-locations on-year and 1,725 on-quarter, reducing its total count to 172,724 as of March-end.

“The company during the quarter has reported co-locations reduction of 3,787 basis exit notices received. However as at March 2019, there are cumulative 4,308 co-locations for which though the exit notices have been received but actual exits have not happened,” the company said.

Revenue from operations included exit charges—or charges paid by clients to exit locations ahead of a contracted term - of Rs 155 crore, the company said.

The exits, accordingly, reflected in a lower average sharing factor, which dropped to 1.88 from 1.89 in the December quarter, and from 2.30 a year ago. The sharing revenue per tower a month, in turn, however rose 0.5% on-quarter to Rs 76,159, but fell 4.6% on year.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base includes units by virtue of its 42% stake in Indus Towers. The two companies though are in the process of merging their operations, a deal which is expected to be completed “in the next few months”, the company said. As of March 31, 2019, Bharti Infratel owned and operated 40,388 towers with 76,341 co-locations in 11 telecom circles while Indus operated 123,546 towers with 229,483 co-locations in 15 circles.

The new entity, which would create the largest mobile tower operator in the world outside China, is estimated to have over 163,000 towers across 22 telecom service areas in India.

Infratel quarterly Ebitda margin expanded to 42.6% from 41.6% in the previous quarter.

Consolidated expenses for the March quarter was flat on year at Rs 2,066.3 crore. The largest components were power & fuel which rose 1% on-year, followed by rent which fell 3%, while repairs & maintenance dropped 7%.

Net finance income for the quarter came in at Rs 243 crore compared with an expense of Rs 129 crore a year ago. Other income fell 57% on year to Rs41 crore."

36,2019-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: CLSA downgraded Bharti Infratel to sell from outperform and lowered its price target to Rs 285 from Rs 300, citing muted tenancy growth outlook. 

""With Vodafone Idea looking to optimise its network operating costs and the continuing slowdown in new tenancies by Reliance Jio, the tenancy growth outlook for Bharti Infratel is likely to be muted in the near term,"" said CLSA. 

The brokerage has cut its FY20-FY21 tenancy estimates by 2 per cent and expects tenancies to see a 2.5 per cent compounded growth over FY19-FY21. 

CLSA said Bharti Infratel’s upcoming merger with Indus Towers will not improve its capital structure and could result in a stock overhang as both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea may look to sell their stakes in the merged company to deleverage their balance sheets. 

The brokerage added that Bharti Infratel’s 4 per cent yield is a key support and special payouts or buybacks could be catalysts."

Board meetings (FULL LIST)
 

Analyst calls

 • Jefferies has maintained buy on NTPC and revised target price to ₹160 from ₹171. NTPC should see twin benefits of operational improvement and capacity addition in the next five years, said Jefferies. Potential earnings upside of 5-6% from demand-led PLF recovery is an additional benefit, it added.

 • ICICI Securities has initiated coverage on Bandhan Bank with a target price of ₹763. The opportunity that Bandhan has to leverage is its own strengths and fully exploit its banking licence can result in superior growth and profitability.

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has retained reduce rating on MRF and revised fair value lower to ₹52,000 from ₹56,000. The brokerage said its cautious view on the stock is underpinned by three major concerns: potential market share loss in the truck-bus radial tyre segment and higher-sized passenger vehicle tyres due to lack of product innovation and investment in R&D; normalisation of margins in the increasingly competitive two-wheeler segment; and expensive valuations. 

 • Morgan Stanley has maintained underweight rating on Tata Global Beverages with a target price of ₹165. Fourth quarter earnings growth was affected by one-off losses from associates, said Morgan Stanley. There is no quick fix,especially for Tata Global's international business,given the weak brand construct,exposure to a relatively unattractive category/geographic mix,and mediocre return ratios, it said. 

 • Investec Securities has initiated coverage on Orient Electric with a target price of ₹210. Following its demerger from Orient Paper in 2017, Orient Electric’s new management team has undertaken measures to improve rand positioning, product offering, distribution and logistics, said Investec.

“The market failed to maintain the opening gains due to a surge in oil prices, concern over global slowdown and the Chinese central bank ruling out any stimulus,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Analyst calls• Citigroup Global Markets has upgraded AU Small Finance Bank to buy from sell and raised target price to ₹720 from ₹535. Erosion in NIM due to yield compression has constrained ROA over the past four quarters despite realization of scale benefits in opex, said Citi. 

• IIFL has an add rating on Coromandel International with a target price of ₹ 440. Fertiliser MRPs are expected to fall ahead of the Kharif season, and this could potentially weigh on sales volumes and margins, said IIFL. 

• CLSA has downgraded Bharti Infratel to sell from outperform and lowered price target to ₹285 from ₹300, citing muted tenancy growth outlook. With Vodafone Idea looking to optimise its network operating costs and the continuing slowdown in new tenancies by Reliance Jio, the tenancy growth outlook for the company is likely to be muted in the near term, said CLSA. 

• Investec Securities has maintained hold rating on UltraTech Cement and increased target price to ₹4,712 from ₹4,476. UltraTech Cement's operational beat in the Q4 result was primarily driven by lower cost heads, as price growth disappointed, said Investec. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained buy rating on ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company and revised fair value to ₹500 from ₹480. ICICI Prudential Life reported strong operational performance with increase in the share of protection APE and improvement in persistency, said Kotak Institutional.

46,2019-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: Bharti Infratel, whose stock plunged over 10% Thursday after weak fourth-quarter results, said the worst is over in terms of tenancy losses on its telecom tower sites, expecting sustained 4G network expansion to drive revenue growth in the coming months.

“Vodafone Idea has just concluded its rights issue and Bharti Airtel’s will open soon, which will give them adequate fresh funds to engage in aggressive tower network build-outs for expanding 4G coverage amid surging data consumption, a scenario that promises a favourable impact on our business prospects,” Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta said.

The top executive spoke on an earnings call a day after India’s sole listed tower company reported flat net profit growth in the March quarter, stung by a sharp fall in ‘co-locations’ at its sites amid rapid consolidation in the sector. Co-locations are points where a tower firm deploys mobile telecom antennae of multiple carriers on a single structure.

Bharti Infratel shares declined 10.3% to close at Rs 270.95 on the BSE, a day after the company’s consolidated net profit for the January-March period came in at Rs 608 crore compared with Rs 606 crore a year ago and Rs 648 crore in the previous three-month period. Quarterly consolidated revenue fell 2% on-year and 1% sequentially to Rs 3,600 crore.

The company’s leadership is pinning its hopes on strong revenue growth in the coming quarters as it does not expect the Big 3 telcos - Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm - to compromise on network coverage, especially to maintain their current revenue market share levels.

“Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Jio will definitely pump in capex to ensure similar 4G coverage to hold on to revenue share, which augers well for tower-cos,” Bharti Infratel managing director DS Rawat said.

Gupta expects strong emerging appetite for data services in the rural markets to boost revenue growth prospects for tower companies. All major telcos, he said, are expanding their mobile broadband footprints aggressively in the rural markets amid strong data consumption trends.

Rawat downplayed worries about potential tenancy losses in the near future, asserting that only a fraction of the contracts were coming up for renewal since the bulk of the extensions had transpired in 2016 and are valid till 2022.

Bharti Infratel expects a steady revenue inflow of Rs 90 crore every quarter by way of fees paid by telcos exiting locations ahead of contracted terms.

However, brokerage CLSA predicts a muted tenancy growth outlook for Bharti Infratel as market leader Vodafone Idea optimises network operating costs in the course of its complex dual-network integration, coupled with the slowdown in new tenancies from Jio."
51,2019-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Around 10 stocks rose to touch their 52-week highs on NSE in Friday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week highs were Balaxi Ventures, Brightcom Group, Dr. Reddy's Lab and HCL Technologies.

Bank of Maharashtra, Seamec, SRF and Wipro also featured among the stocks that touched their 52-week highs on NSE.

Benchmark NSE Nifty index was trading 30.40 points up at 11,672.20 while the BSE Sensex was trading 64.35 points up at 38,795.21. 

Overall, 32 shares were trading in the green in the Nifty50 index, while 18 were trading in the red. 

In the Nifty 50 index, Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Cipla, GAIL and Bharti Infratel were among the top gainers. 

While Tata Motors, Grasim Inds., Maruti Suzuki, Kotak Bank and IndusInd Bank were trading in the red."
56,2019-04-27,Bharti Infratel,"US-based asset management firm Providence Equity Partners is likely to join Vodafone Idea in selling their stakes in Indus Towers for roughly Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 5,500 crore, respectively, before the tower company’s merger with Bharti Infratel, people aware of the matter said.

Under the terms of the merger, Providence, which owns 4.85 per cent in Indus Towers, can monetise a 3.35 per cent stake and get a 1.1 per cent stake in the combined tower entity for the remaining 1.5 per cent. Providence is likely to eventually sell these shares, too, and fully exit the merged entity, one person told ET.

Vodafone Idea has the option to sell its entire 11.15 per cent stake in Indus for cash, based on a formula linked to trading performance of Bharti Infratel’s shares during the 60 trading days prior to the Indus-Infratel merger closure. A Vodafone Idea spokesman told ET that “based on current facts, the company would like to take cash,” although it “retained the option to take cash or shares, and a final decision would be taken closer to the Indus-Infratel merger based on facts at that time.”



At press time Providence, Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers did not reply to ET’s queries. Bharti Infratel shares rose 0.4 per cent to Rs 272.15 at the close on the BSE on Friday.

Analysts said it’s a given that loss-making Vodafone Idea would cash out to garner funds to step up 4G network spends and compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Earlier this week, Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta said the listed tower company’s merger with Indus would be completed in the next few months. The National Company Law Tribunal is likely to consider the Bharti Infratel-Indus merger at a scheduled hearing on May 14.

Analysts said if Providence and Vodafone Idea exercise their cash exit options, it could increase the leverage ratio (net debt to Ebitda) of the merged entity.

“Bharti Infratel’s management confirmed that net debt/Ebitda will likely increase after the merger with both Idea and Providence taking the cash exit option, but will remain lightly leveraged in the short-term,” Sanford C Bernstein said in a note seen by ET.

Bharti Infra and Vodafone, the two other investors in Indus Towers holding 42 per cent each, will jointly control the merged tower company as equal shareholders with equal board representation. The size of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone’s stakes in the entity will hinge on Vodafone Idea and Providence’s decisions to cash out."

Analyst calls

 • Equirus has downgraded Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company to add from long and lowered target price to ₹1,495 from ₹1,500, citing limited upside. Cholamandalam Finance’s consistent performance continued in the fourth quarter of FY19, with a 21% year-on-year PPOP growth, 16% sequential growth in disbursements and asset quality improvement. 

 • CLSA has retained outperform rating on Ambuja Cements with a target price of ₹250. Ambuja’s first quarter results largely mirrored its 50%- subsidiary ACC, as realisations missed forecasts, driving an earnings miss, although it managed costs better, said CLSA. The perils of going slow on capacity expansions came to the fore once again, as volume growth was just 3% year-on-year, it said.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Quess Corp with a target price of ₹1,000. The brokerage expects Quess Corp to end FY19 on a strong note with quarter-on-quarter organic revenue growth of 6% led by strong momentum in staffing and facilities business. EBITDA margins are likely to improve further in Q4 by 15 bps led by strong growth and improving business mix. 

• Emkay Global has maintained hold rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of ₹1,470. The brokerage estimates the bank’s standalone RoA/RoE to improve to 1.8%/15% from 1.7%/12% in FY19, driven by margin expansion and a moderation in cost ratios. The brokerage likes the bank due to superior asset quality, conservative risk management practices, and improving return ratios. Promoter’s ongoing tussle with the RBI remains an overhang, the brokerage said. 

• IDBI Capital has maintained reduce rating on TVS Motor Company and revised target price to ₹430 from ₹480 earlier. TVS Motor fourth quarter results were below estimates on operating level, said IDBI Capital. The brokerage cut volume and revenue estimates by 1.5% each for FY20, factoring slower growth for twowheelers in first half of FY20 and introduced FY21 estimates and reduced target multiple on higher exposure towards scooter segment.

After the merger, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group, which currently own 42% each in Indus Towers, will hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively. KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will own a combined 6%, stemming from their stake of over 10% in Bharti Infratel. Vodafone Idea, currently holding over 11% in Indus, is expected to exit at the time of merger.

“Post merger, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group would reduce their stakes, by selling them primarily to KKR and a minority part to Canada Pension and some others,” said a second person familiar with the negotiations.

KKR could eventually hold anywhere between 25% and 32% in the merged entity, which will have over 160,000 towers, with CPPIB and some others having minority stakes.



Both people said Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group are expected to retain a minimum of 13% at the beginning, allowing them certain rights such as veto powers over signing and terminating contracts with clients, among others. However, the Vodafone Group is expected to eventually exit the tower company.

The merger of Bharti Infratel, India’s only listed tower company, and Indus Towers is set to come up for approval at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on May 14. “The stake sales in the new entity should conclude by June, when the merger is likely to close,” the second person said.

Vodafone Group declined to comment on the matter, while Bharti Airtel and KKR didn’t respond to emailed queries sent by ET.

If the merged entity is valued at $13 billion, Bharti Airtel could raise about $3.2 billion (Rs22,400 crore) by reducing its stake from over 37% to 13%. On its part, the Vodafone Group could raise around $2.1 billion by reducing its holding to 13% from over 29%.

Bharti Infratel closed 3.8% lower at Rs261.85 on the BSE on Tuesday, while Bharti Airtel ended 1.4% down at Rs320.20. Vodafone Idea fell 4.6% to Rs15.60.


CASH INFUSION
The stake sale is expected to generate much-needed cash for Bharti Airtel that will help strengthen its balance sheet, bolster its 4G network to compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm and prepare for 5G. For Vodafone Group, it will be a return on some of its investment in India. It recently invested Rs 11,000 crore in Vodafone Idea’s Rs25,000-crore rights issue.

Bharti Airtel, which had net debt of Rs 1.06 lakh crore at the end of December, is planning to raise Rs25,000 crore via its own rights issue, which opens on May 3. The company has raised Rs 27,800 crore in the last three years by selling stakes in Bharti Infratel, the direct-to-home (DTH) satellite TV unit, the Africa business and divesting towers in Africa and operations in two countries.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been under financial pressure since the entry of Jio over two years back, affecting revenue and driving their India mobile businesses into losses. Both have been raising cash through various means to pare debt and expand their 4G networks to take on Jio, which has almost caught up with them, both on revenue market share and subscriber numbers."

19,2019-05-11,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Vodafone Group Plc is likely to free up its pledged stake in Vodafone Idea by selling shares in the entity to be formed by the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel, which is expected to conclude by June, people familiar with the matter said.

“Vodafone Group’s decision to pledge 44.39% was a stop-gap move to raise the Rs 11,000 crore it needed to infuse in the Vodafone Idea rights issue,” a person said. “It’s likely to monetise its sizeable stake in the Bharti Infratel-Indus merged entity and use the proceeds to release the pledged shares in the Indian telco.”

Vodafone pledged its entire stake in Vodafone Idea — worth over Rs 18,000 crore — with seven foreign banks for financing arrangements after India’s largest telco issued new shares to promoters in a Rs 25,000-crore rights issue, which closed on April 24. Shares were pledged in favour of HSBC Corporate Trustee Com (UK), which is acting as a trustee for BNP Paribas, HSBC Bank Plc, ING Bank NV, Stan-Chart Bank, BankAm-Merrill Telco is seeking to free up 44.39% in Voda Idea it pledged to raise funds Lynch and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc.




Vodafone Group did not respond to ET’s queries on the matter as of press time. Vodafone Idea shares fell 2.44% to Rs 14 at the close on the BSE on Friday.

In its 2018 annual report, Vodafone Group said additional funding in India would come from sale of its stake in Indus Towers. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group, which own 42% each in Indus Towers, will hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively in the combined company.

ET reported recently that Bharti Airtel and the Vodafone Group are in talks with a consortium led by private equity firm KKR to slash their stakes to 13% or less in the merged company. However, the Vodafone Group is expected to eventually exit the tower company.

If the merged entity is valued at $13 billion, the planned stake reduction could help Bharti Airtel raise about $3.2 billion (Rs 22,400 crore) and the Vodafone Group about $2.1billion.

Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICap Securities, said Vodafone may not exit the tower company immediately and the UK company is likely to wait to get more bang for the buck when the outlook for telecom in India improves, pricing power returns and the loss-making Vodafone Idea catches up with Reliance Jio Infocomm and Airtel on 4G coverage and recovers revenue market share. Such a scenario, he said, “would also boost tenancies and improve the valuation of the combined Bharti Infratel-Indus combined entity and enable Vodafone Plc to secure a higher valuation.”"

Vodafone Idea is the largest telecommunications company in India in terms of subscribers. The firm had over 334.1 million subscribers as of March 31.

Commenting on the company’s performance, Balesh Sharma, CEO of Vodafone Idea said: “The initiatives we have taken since the merger are yielding positive results and we are well on track to deliver our synergy targets two years early. The oversubscription of our recent rights issue is a clear testament to investors’ support for our strategy.”

The company added that the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers has received approval from the Competition Commission India, the Sebi, shareholders and creditors. 

“An application for sanction of the scheme has been filed with the NCLT and the matter is listed for final hearing,” it added. 

Vodafone Idea has an option to sell its 11.15 per cent stake in Indus, which has an implied value of Rs 6,160 crore, for cash at completion.

23,2019-05-14,Bharti Infratel,"Vodafone Idea’s net loss narrowed to Rs 4,878.3 crore in the fourth quarter, helped by a tax refund and lower expenses, as service revenue inched up after 11 quarters of declines, indicating that the worst may be over for India’s top mobile phone company.

Earnings in the three months ended March were helped by a tax refund of Rs 1,873.3 crore. The operator, formed in a merger last August, posted a net loss of Rs 5,005.7 crore in the third quarter.

Service revenue rose 0.1 per cent sequentially to Rs 11,775 crore as the company introduced the minimum recharge plan, aimed at weeding out low-paying subscribers. However, this also led to the loss of 53.2 million subscribers who switched to rival telcos rather than recharge, taking its user count to 334.1 million at the end of March.

The minimum recharge plan helped the telco’s average daily revenue (ADR) for the quarter grow 2.3 per cent sequentially, after declining for 11 prior quarters, and helped average revenue per user (ARPU) increase for the second successive three-month period – up 16.3 per cent to Rs 104.

“The customer decline for VIL has been 88 million since October and the trend may continue for the next two quarters. Despite the 16 per cent growth in ARPU, the revenues have not increased, which shows that the net impact of the minimum recharge plans has been muted,” said Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICap Securities.

Comparatively, Reliance Jio Infocomm’s ARPU was ahead at Rs 126.2 and Bharti Airtel’s was estimated at Rs 125. Jio, the only profitable Indian mobile telco, is catching up on revenue, having recorded Rs 11,106 crore in the fourth quarter. Airtel’s India mobile revenue stood at Rs 10,632 crore, rising 4.3 per cent on quarter.

However, some analysts said the increase in ARPU and revenue signal that the worst may be over for Vodafone Idea and Airtel, which faced immense pressure on revenue and posted losses due to the intense competition triggered by Jio’s entry in September 2016. Widening losses led Vodafone India and Idea Cellular to merge.

Shares of Vodafone Idea advanced 3.2 per cent to Rs 14.45 at the close on the BSE on Monday, before the company released its earnings statement.

Vodafone Idea CEO Balesh Sharma said the company’s initiatives since the merger last August were yielding positive results.

“We remain focused on fortifying our position in key profitable districts by expanding coverage and capacity of our 4G network, targeting higher share of new 4G customers… whilst also improving cash flows through cost transformation,” he said in a statement.

Cost savings due to synergies helped quarterly earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) jump 57 per cent on quarter to Rs 1,790 crore.

“Total operating expenses for the quarter fell on quarter due to the realisation of merger synergies,” the company said, adding that it had realised annualised synergies of Rs 5,100 crore, about 60 per cent of the Rs 8,400 crore annual synergy target.

“We have removed surplus equipment on 24,000 sites out of the total 67,000 co-located sites. Additionally, we have also exited about 9,900 low utilisation sites. Both initiatives have yielded significant cost savings,” the company said.

The integration efforts led the telco to record one-time charges amounting to Rs 1,145.8 crore in the quarter, a further drag on earnings.

Vodafone Idea has stepped up spending – at Rs 3,230 crore for the just-ended quarter – to increase 4G coverage.

“Our 4G population coverage reached 65 per cent as of March 31, 2019, compared to less than 50 per cent for each of the brands in August 2018,” the company said.

The company added 5.4 million 4G customers, taking the overall 4G subscriber base to 80.7 million.

“Total data volumes grew by 9 per cent to 2,947 billion MB compared to the last quarter and the average daily data volume increased by 11.4 per cent to 32.7 billion MB in the fourth quarter,” the telco said.

However, total minutes on the network fell by 1.3 per cent due to reduction in incoming minutes following the disconnection of ‘Incoming only’ or ‘low ARPU’ customers.

The telco raised Rs 25,000 crore via a rights issue in April to repay debt and free up cash for 4G expansion. Net debt stood at over Rs 1.18 lakh crore at March end.

The company has the option to sell its 11.15 per cent stake in Indus Towers, which has an implied value of Rs 6,160 crore, once the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers is cemented. The company is exploring options to monetise over 158,000 km of its intra-city and inter-city fibre network."
25,2019-05-20,Bharti Infratel,"Four bigticket fund houses, including Franklin Templeton MF, ICICI Prudential MF, SBI MF and HDFC MF, are among those that have bid for Bharti Airtel’s about Rs 25,000-crore rights issue, bankers involved in the process said, which the telecom operator will use to bolster its balance sheet to fight rivals Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea.

“The issue was subscribed 1.07 times,” said a banker familiar with the issue details.

Bharti Airtel declined to comment.



Late Friday, the mobile phone operator had said, “Based on preliminary information received, the rights issue has been over-subscribed.” The country’s No 2 telecom carrier did not, however, provide specific details. The rights issue was priced at Rs 220 apiece. The company issued 1.14 billion shares, increasing its equity base to 5.13 billion shares. The rights entitlement ratio was 19 shares for every 67 held. Shares of the company closed 0.84 per cent higher at Rs 328.2 on the BSE Friday. Airtel has also raised another $1 billion (Rs 7,000 crore) through the sale of perpetual bonds to fund its 4G network expansion. The rights and bonds issues were the latest by Bharti Airtel to shore up the balance sheet and free up cash to invest in 4G networks amid continuing competition since Reliance Jio’s entry in September 2016. “…the (latest) capital raise provides the company with adequate financial muscle amidst the current intense competitive environment in Indian mobile market,” UBS said in a recent report. Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICap Securities, said, “the strong response to the rights issue will also give Airtel the financial capability to participate meaningfully in the upcoming 5G auction as and when it happens”. Airtel’s rights issue outcome must not be seen in isolation as it will be followed by an IPO of its Africa unit, the proceeds of which will further reduce leverage, Sharma said. The Singapore government’s investment arm GIC is estimated to have invested Rs 5,000 crore for 4.4 per cent of Bharti Airtel by picking up a part of the rights entitled to Bharti Telecom, one of the promoter companies, the other being SingTel. The Bharti Airtel promoter group, comprising Bharti Telecom and Singtel, had said that they would subscribe to shares worth Rs 11,785.7 crore in the rights issue. Singtel had said that it would invest Rs 3,750 crore. Airtel, whose India mobile business was forced into the red, has already raised over Rs 12,000 crore by selling stakes in tower unit Bharti Infratel. It is expected to sell more stake in an entity to be formed after the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers. The initial share sale in its Africa unit is expected to fetch another $1.25 billion, which will further cut debt, which stood at Rs 1.06 lakh crore at the end of December. The company hasn’t provided updated figures due to the rights issue. “On our calculations, Rs 32,000 crore will help reduce Airtel’s net debt to EBITDA to 3.3x (vs 4.8x using Q3FY19 reported financials), which could potentially go down to around 2.2x assuming the company is able to raise further capital from its African IPO and Bharti Infratel stake sale as previously announced,” UBS said. The perpetual bonds of Rs 7,000 crore will be denominated in foreign currency and will allow full accounting for equity credit, it added. The fund raise comes at a time when analysts believe the worst is behind for India’s older players Airtel and Vodafone Idea, both of whom saw their respective average revenue per user (ARPU) rise in the January-March quarter. Having held prices steady for several quarters now, experts expect rates to rise – albeit gradually – later this fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. Vodafone Idea also recently raised Rs 25,000 crore via rights issue. Lead managers to the issue were Axis Capital , J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs (India) , HSBC Securities and ICICI Securities Ltd."

29,2019-05-21,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: Bimal Dayal, chief executive officer of Indus Towers, will head the new tower company to be formed by the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel, while Hemant Ruia will be the chief financial officer.

Dayal is proposed to be appointed as the CEO of the merged entity and “will be responsible for the combined business and will take forward integration of the two companies in preparation of the merger,” Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Plc, the joint owners of the proposed merged entity, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Ruia (currently CFO of Indus Towers) is proposed to be appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of the merged entity.”

The merger, in the making for about a year, will create one of the largest tower companies globally and is expected to conclude by June end, after obtaining regulatory approvals.

“Shareholder groups (Bharti and Vodafone Group) of the combined entity resulting from the merger of Indus Towers Ltd. with Bharti Infratel Ltd. today announced that the merger process is at an advanced stage of completion,” the parent companies said.

The existing leadership teams of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel will continue to manage their respective businesses till the merger becomes effective.

The alliance will create a pan-India company with over 163,000 towers, operating in all 22 telecom service areas with an estimated valuation of $12-13 billion.

Bharti Infratel shares rose 2.4% to Rs 276 on the BSE on Tuesday, giving the company a market capitalisation of Rs 51,049 crore ($7.3 billion).

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group, which own 42% each in Indus Towers, are expected to hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively, in the merged entity.

KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will own a combined 6%, stemming from their stake of over 10% in Bharti Infratel. Vodafone Idea, currently holding over 11% in Indus, is expected to exit at the time of merger.

ET had reported that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group are in talks with a consortium led by private equity firm KKR to slash their stakes by over half to 13% or less each in the new company.

While Airtel is expected to use the funds to pare debt and free up cash to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm, Vodafone may infuse the funds into Vodafone Idea, its Indian venture.

ET had reported that US-based asset management firm Providence Equity Partners is likely to join Vodafone Idea in selling stakes in Indus Towers for about Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 5,500 crore, respectively."

40,2019-05-28,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel plans to raise about $1 billion from the sale of atleast a 25% stake in its Africa subsidiary that will be listed on the London Stock Exchange. It plans to use the money raised to reduce debt and compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm in the Indian market.

“Immediately following admission (in the London Stock Exchange), the company intends to have a free float of at least 25% of the company's issued share capital and expects that it would be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE UK indices,” the company saidin a release on Tuesday. “In addition, it is expected that up to a further 15% of the offer will be made available pursuant to the over-allotment option.”

People familiar with the matter said Bharti Airtel expects to raise over $1 billion from the initial public offer (IPO), valuing the company at over $4 billion. Airtel has already raised $1.45 billion via pre-IPO placements to seven investors.


PLANNING TO LIST IN NIGERIA TOO
This helped cut net debt in the Africa business to $4 billion at the end of March from $7.8 billion a year back, analysts said.

The company had initially expected to raise $1.25 billion from the IPO, experts said. In January, Airtel’s Africa unit raised $200 million by selling a stake of about 4.37% to Qatar Investment Authority at a valuation of $4.58 billion. Before that, it sold about 25% to six investors including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, raising $1.25 billion, valuing the company at $5 billion.


Others
Following the aforementioned divestment stake sales, Bharti Airtel owns 68.31% in the Africa unit. Separately, ICIL, the Sunil Mittal family’s investment arm, holds a combined 9.88% stake, directly and indirectly.

Shares of Bharti Airtel, of which Singtel owns over 35% after the recent rights issue, ended 1.24% lower at Rs345.65 on BSE on Tuesday.

“Since first investing in Africa almost nine years ago, we have well leveraged our expertise in emerging markets to deliver on a clearly-defined strategy to build Airtel Africa into a market-leading mobile service provider, increasingly expanding beyond voice into data services and Airtel Money,” Airtel Africa chairman Sunil Mittal said in the IPO document.

He added that recent investments will put Airtel Africa in a strong position to build its own capital market profile.

Bharti Airtel is also considering a plan to list the unit’s shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. “If the company decides to proceed with a listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the earliest that will happen will be at the time of admission (to the London Stock Exchange),” it said.

The share sale plan follows Airtel Africa turning to profit for the first time more than a year ago. It posted a net profit of $83 million (Rs580 crore) for the March quarter, compared with a net loss of $49 million a year ago. Total revenue rose 6% to $781 million, though it fell from $783 million sequentially.

“Operating with an asset-light model, the company has improved financial performance, through sustainable revenue growth in voice, data and mobile money, significantly improved ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margin with strong free cash flow generation,” said Raghunath Mandava, CEO of Airtel Africa. “Airtel Africa’s mobile payments business — Airtel Money — is the fastest growing business for the company.”

Bharti Airtel is facing pressure on revenue and profitability at home owing to intense competition triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm. The company is trying to build a war chest to fund its 4G network expansion across the country. It has also been selling stakes in tower unit Bharti Infratel, and plans to sell another 32% in that company. It has also raised Rs 25,000 crore through a rights issue and Rs7,000 crore via a bond issue.

45,2019-05-31,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel expects tariffs to firm up as stability returns to the telecom sector after over two years of intense competition, the top management said on an earnings call Friday.

Having invested on expanding its 4G network over the two years ended March 2019, the Sunil Mittal-led telco will lower its capex requirements for FY20.

Airtel called for lower 5G airwave prices in the upcoming auctions, which Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO for India and South Asia, again termed as “exorbitant.” The company will consider participating in the auctions once the issue was addressed.

“Over the last 3-4 quarters, our revenues have kind of flattened out. This quarter, there’s revenue growth. Over a longer period of time, prices are not coming down anymore, so competitive intensity is stable… we’re not seeing any further reduction in prices,” Vittal said.

However, he said “industry repair needs to happen” because the market remains brutal, pointing to Airtel’s average revenue per user (Arpu), which fell to Rs 123 from Rs 200 two years ago.

India’s No. 2 telco had mapped out capex of Rs 24,000 crore for FY19 compared with Rs 23,968.2 crore in the previous financial year. After refarming airwaves in some bands in 10 circles, the company may not require additional capex.

“We’ve had $10 billion capex plan under Project Leap. I would definitely say that peak levels of capex were seen last year and it will be lower through the course of this year,” Vittal said.

However, Airtel said it will not compromise on network quality, indicating that investments on improvements will be made as needed.

“Our utilisation of spectrum is low. We can create higher throughputs, which is why capex of FY19 was a peak and we will see moderation in capex in the full year March 2020,” Vittal added.

Asked about spectrum auctions, the Airtel boss said the proposed 5G airwave reserve prices were unsustainable and the company will not bid for them unless they were lowered.

“We’ve made it clear that for 3.5 GHz spectrum, the reserve prices indicated by Trai in the ballpark of Rs 50,000-55,000 crore for 100 MHz are prices we can’t afford and they’re exorbitant. We would hope that the government brings down prices of spectrum and that is when we would look seriously at 5G,” he said.

On monetising the assets of tower company Bharti Infratel, Airtel said it would look at “all possible opportunities” and added that the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel was awaiting the approval of the National Company Law Tribunal.

The merger, agreed in April last year, will create the world’s largest tower company outside China, with more than 163,000 towers.

Airtel is adding services to its broadband plans in order to increase customer stickiness, amid the impending launch of broadband services by Reliance Jio Infocomm.

The telco reported a loss of Rs 89.8 crore before interest and taxes for its India operations in the quarter ended March 2019 compared with a profit of Rs 101 crore a year earlier. Local mobile services revenue increased marginally for the first time in several quarters."
0,2019-06-02,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: The Chandigarh bench of the National Company Law Tribunal has approved the merger of Indus Towers with Bharti Infratel, which will create one of the largest telecom tower companies globally.

Bharti Airtel and the UK’s Vodafone will jointly control the pan-India company, which will operate over 163,000 telecom towers across 22 service areas with an estimated valuation of $12-13 billion.

“The NCLT, Chandigarh Bench, vide its order dated May 31, 2019, has sanctioned the scheme of amalgamation and arrangement between Indus Towers (transferor company) and Bharti Infratel (transferee company) and their respective shareholders and creditors under Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013,” Bharti Infratel said in regulatory filings on Sunday.

The tower arm of Bharti Airtel said the Indus-Infratel amalgamation would “become effective” when a certified copy of the NCLT order is filed with the Registrar of Companies “upon fulfilment/waiver of other conditions prescribed in the scheme. The effective date, it said, would be communicated to the exchanges when the scheme takes effect.

Bharti Infratel shares had fallen 0.4% to Rs 271.20 on the BSE on Friday.

Just over a week ago, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Plc had said Indus Towers CEO Bimal Dayal would head the merged entity, while Hemant Ruia would be its chief financial officer.

The merger, proposed almost a year ago, is expected to conclude by the end of June after obtaining regulatory approvals. In the interim, the existing leadership teams of Indus and Bharti Infratel will manage their respective businesses.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Plc currently own 42% each in Indus Towers and are expected to hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively, in the merged entity.

KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will own a combined 6%, stemming from their stake of over 10% in Bharti Infratel. Vodafone Idea, currently holding 11.15% in Indus, is slated to exit at the time of merger.

ET reported earlier that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group are in talks with a consortium led by private equity firm KKR to slash their stakes by over half to 13% or less each in the new company. While Airtel is expected to use the funds to pare debt and free up cash to fight Reliance Jio Infocomm, Vodafone may infuse the funds into Vodafone Idea, its Indian mobility joint venture.

Vodafone Plc had said in its 2018 annual report that any additional funding in India would come from the sale of its stake in Indus Towers. The British telco is expected to eventually exit the tower company.

Some analysts said the UK company might wait to get more bang for buck when the outlook for telecom in India improves, pricing power returns and the loss-making Vodafone Idea catches up with Reliance Jio and Airtel on 4G coverage and recovers revenue market share.

ET had also reported that US-based asset management firm Providence Equity Partners is likely to join Vodafone Idea in selling stakes in Indus Towers for roughly Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 5,500 crore, respectively, before its merger with Bharti Infratel."

BOARD MEETINGS
 


ANALYST CALLS
 • Citi has a sell rating on Glenmark Pharmaceuticals with a target price of ₹615. Notwithstanding the recent weakness in the stock, Citi said it is looking for signs of meaningful traction in the US business to turn constructive — as this is key for margin improvement as well as cash generation and meaningful reduction in debt. 

 • IIFL has an add rating on Bharat Electronics with a target price of ₹149. While gross margins are likely to moderate in FY20/21 due to sales mix, benign employee expenses and other fixed overheads will help operating profit margins sustain at 20-21% levels, with 13-15% sales growth, said IIFL.

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Ujjivan Financial Services with a target price of ₹375. The brokerage believes that FY20 should start seeing normalisation of the cost-income ratio, a key concern. The valuations are inexpensive with gradual recovery in return on equity towards normalised levels and addressing the issue on listing of the bank should aid valuation expansion from current levels, the brokerage said. 

 • IDBI Capital Markets has maintained buy rating on Nava Bharat Ventures and trimmed target price to ₹125 from ₹127. The company’s EBITDA in the March quarter was lower than estimated due to weaker-than-expected profitability in the power segment, said IDBI Capital Markets. The stock trades at an attractive valuation, the brokerage added. 

 • CLSA has maintained buy rating on J Kumar Infraprojects with a target price of ₹315. The key message from J Kumar Infra’s fourth quarter result was its pick-up in new orders despite election-led, slow-down fears and robust execution, said CLSA. The brokerage expects J Kumar’s EPS to see an 18% CAGR over FY19-FY22 and highlighted that the stock looks cheap at 4.6 times FY20 estimated EPS.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
3,2019-06-03,Bharti Infratel,"Motilal Oswal Securities has given a buy recommendation on Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 405.

Shares of Bharti Airtel traded at Rs 351.35 around 1 pm on 3 June, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.

After the conclusion of the rights issue, Bharti reported detailed Q4FY19 operating metrics. Marred by competition for the past several quarters, Bharti’s India wireless Ebitda saw a strong turnaround in Q4FY19, up 32 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), primarily on the back of 4 per cent QoQ revenue growth coupled with steady cost control. 

Consequently, margins expanded 500bp QoQ to 24.1 per cent. Adjusting for the writeback in SG&A, India wireless Ebitda growth is estimated at 23 per cent. On a high base, growth in the Africa business seemed muted; revenue declined marginally by 2 per cent QoQ to Rs 5,500 crore, while Ebitda stood flat QoQ at Rs 2,420 crore. Margins at 43.8 per cent, however, expanded 50bp QoQ.

Q4FY19 witnessed full-quarter benefits from the rollout of minimum recharge plans. This, coupled with minor tinkering in other price plans led to a steep 19 per cent QoQ increase in ARPU to Rs 123. A key point to note — subscriber base decreased marginally by 1 per cent QoQ to 28.26 crore, highlighting the stickiness of low ARPU subs on Airtel’s network. Cumulatively, the Minimum Recharge strategy led to 23 per cent increase in ARPU in the last two quarters against 15 per cent decline in subscriber base, thus showing healthy improvement in revenues. 

Historically, subdued performance of the India wireless business was negated by healthy performance in other segments. However, during Q4FY19, other businesses (contributing nearly 36 per cent to consolidated Ebitda) declined, offsetting the strong growth in India wireless business. Telemedia Ebitda fell 5 per cent QoQ while enterprise and passive Infra Ebitda fell 3 per cent and 4 per cent QoQ, respectively. On the other hand, digital reported 2 per cent and 3 per cent QoQ revenue and Ebitda growth despite impact from TRAI’s new tariff order.

As per the brokerage, the company's management thinks that the peak capex levels are now behind and FY20 capex should see some moderation. Airtel Thanks with an array of services like entertainment, music, financial services, etc. should drive ARPU, the management of the company. 

""We have largely maintained our revenue and Ebitda estimates. We believe that Bharti is on course to reach self-sufficiency in terms of FCF with series of fund raising from the rights issue, Africa IPO and Bharti Infratel stake sale, coupled with lower capex and stable Ebitda,"" said the brokerage, adding, ""this would allow it to maintain a foothold in the industry despite the hyper-competitive market conditions, and remain well-poised to benefit as industry ARPU revives over the next 3-4 quarters."""
2,2019-06-03,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Bharti Airtel climbed over 2 per cent in Monday’s trade, looking set to extend its gaining streak into the third consecutive session.

The telecom operator expects tariffs to firm up as stability returns to the telecom sector after over two years of intense competition, the top management said in earnings call on Friday.

“Over the last 3-4 quarters, our revenues have kind of flattened out. This quarter, there’s revenue growth. Over a longer period of time, prices are not coming down anymore, so competitive intensity is stable… we’re not seeing any further reduction in prices,” Gopal Vittal, CEO for India and South Asia.

Shares of the company have been ascending since Thursday when it reported a quarterly loss before interest and taxes for its India operations, but a marginal expansion in its local mobile services revenue, the first in several quarters.

On Monday, the scrip hit a high of Rs 355.65 on BSE.

The company attributed the rise in mobile revenue to its ‘Airtel Thanks’ programme that it recently launched. Data traffic in the quarter surged by nearly two-and-a-half times and voice services by 23.4 per cent from a year earlier. 

Airtel had reported its consolidated results earlier this month, but not announced the India numbers separately at the time as its fundraising exercise including a rights issue was underway. 

On a consolidated basis, which includes the performance of its overseas operations, Airtel had earlier this month reported a 29 per cent year-on-year increase in net profit at Rs 107.2 crore, boosted by a one-time gain. 

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities said the company looks well-poised to benefit on industry average revenue per user (ARPU) revival over next 3-4 quarters.

The brokerage has given a buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 405.

As per the brokerage, the management of the company expects that 'Airtel Thanks' with an array of services like entertainment, music, financial services, etc. should drive ARPU. 

""We believe that Bharti Airtel is on course to reach self-sufficiency in terms of free cash flow (FCF) with series of fundraising from the rights issue, Africa IPO and Bharti Infratel stake sale, coupled with lower capex and stable Ebitda. This would allow it to maintain a foothold in the industry despite the hyper-competitive market conditions, and remain well-poised to benefit as industry ARPU revives over the next 3-4 quarters,"" Motilal Oswal said.

The shares of the company closed at Rs 353.05 up 1.31 per cent on BSE."

4,2019-06-04,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: Bharti Airtel plans to raise as much as $862.5 million (Rs 6,038 crore) from the dilution of a roughly 15% equity stake and greenshoe option in an initial public offering of its African subsidiary on the London Stock Exchange and use the funds to pare debt.

The company plans to offer new shares, including the greenshoe option, that will be equivalent to about 15% of the company’s issued capital, a person with knowledge of the matter told ET.

The company expects to raise about $750 million from the offer, excluding the 15% greenshoe option, Airtel Africa said in a filing with the LSE on Tuesday. The net proceeds from the issue will be used to reduce net debt, it said.

Airtel Africa intends to have a free float of at least 25% of the company’s issued share capital and some pre-IPO investors are expected to contribute towards achieving this level, it said in the filing.

The company has already raised $1.45 billion via pre-IPO placements to seven global investors, including Qatar Investment Authority, Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International.

Bharti Airtel currently owns 68.3% in its Africa unit, while the seven global investors collectively own the remainder 31.7%. After the IPO, the public holding in Airtel Africa will be 25% and the stakes of Airtel and the global investors will stand diluted to 75%.

Airtel Africa is expected to raise funds at a valuation of about $5.8 billion, people familiar with the matter said.

In response to ET’s queries, Airtel declined to comment.

A greenshoe option allows underwriters to offer additional shares at the offer price to investors if public demand exceeds expectations.

Before the shares are admitted for trading on the LSE, the company will be re-registered as a public company limited by shares and renamed Airtel Africa Plc.

Airtel Africa said in the filing that the indicative price range of its upcoming IPO, as well as the number of shares to be sold, will be determined in due course and contained in the prospectus expected to be published in the coming weeks.

“The final offer price will be determined following publication of the prospectus and a book-building process, with admission expected to occur in July 2019,” Airtel Africa said.

The Africa unit is also “considering a listing of its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.”

Bharti Airtel managed to cut the net debt of its Africa business to $4 billion at the end of March from $7.8 billion a year ago by virtue of the $1.45 billion raised via the pre-IPO placements.

Consolidated net debt rose to Rs 1.08 lakh crore in the March quarter from Rs 1.06 lakh crore in the previous one, increasing its net finance cost by 38% to Rs 2,532 crore during the January-March period.

Bharti Airtel has been facing pressure on revenue and profitability in India amid competition triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016. The company is trying to build a war chest to fund its countrywide 4G network expansion and participate in the upcoming 5G spectrum sale.

The telco has been selling stakes in tower unit Bharti Infratel and plans to sell another 32% in that company. It raised Rs 25,000 crore through a rights issue in May and Rs 7,000 crore via bond sales."

13,2019-06-08,Bharti Infratel,"Domestic equity investors took money off the table for the week ended June 7, sending benchmark equity indices down for the first time in four weeks. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty kicked off the truncated week on a positive note after Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched Rs 1 lakh crore in May 2019 as compared to Rs 94,016 crore in the year-ago period.

Markets participants ignored CSO data which showed that economic growth slowed to a 5-year low of 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, pushing India behind China, due to a poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

However, sentiments got dampened after a private weather forecaster Skymet Weather said the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. Also, lack of a comment from RBI on the on-going NBFC crisis overshadowed the 25 bps rate cut and change in stance.

However, some buying on Friday capped the downside.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Markets started the holiday trimmed week on a positive note. The momentum was triggered by weakness in crude oil prices and hopes of RBI cutting rates in the bi-monthly policy. But the momentum was short-lived and markets traded lower after RBI cut repo rates by 25 bps and changed stance to accommodative from neutral that came mostly in expected lines. No further comments by RBI regarding the on-going NBFC funding crisis was taken as a surprise by the market that added to the negativity.”

As a result, the BSE Sensex closed 98.30 points, or 0.25 per cent down at 39,615.90 on June 7 against 39714.20 on May 31. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index closed 52.15 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 11,870.65.

18,2019-06-10,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Headline Sensex and Nifty indices ended Monday’s session in the green amid positive global cues on hopes of a Fed rate cut.

The market failed to hold the gains seen in opening deals, as there was no significant positive trigger at home to sustain the momentum and thrust the market to previous high levels. 

Losses in the HDFC twins, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ONGC and YES Bank weighed on Sensex, while IT and FMCG majors, including TCS, Infosys and ITC underpinned the index.

The 30-share pack ended 169 points, or 0.43 per cent, up at 39,784, with 20 stocks advancing. NSE’s Nifty settled 52 points or 0.44 per cent, higher at 11,922, with 34 stocks closing with gains.

J&K Bank crashes 12% Shares of Jammu and Kashmir Bank plunged 12.11 per cent to Rs 52.25 after Jammu and Kashmir government removed the bank's chairman Parvez Ahmed Nengroo and started investigations against him over allegations that he offered loans worth crores to people recommended by politicians, placed his relatives in plum positions and for even diverted funds meant for the bank’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative for the beautification of Royal Spring Golf Course –– a rendezvous of the elite.

21,2019-06-12,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Brookfield Asset Management and Reliance Industries (RIL) are expected to sign a term sheet for the proposed sale of Jio’s telecom towers in the next 7-10 days as the refining-to-retail conglomerate steps up efforts to halve its telecom debt.

People close to the situation said that Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd’s portfolio of 170,000 towers are currently valued at around Rs 36,000 crore ($5 billion approx), of which Rs 25,000 crore is to be funded through equity. Once the build-out phase is completed, it is likely to be levered up further for an enterprise valuation of $7 billion.

Jio’s tower footprint is the largest in the country. Bharti Infratel and Indus together had 163,000 towers as of December 2018. Jio acquired 45,000 towers from Reliance Communications and built the rest. The telco is estimated to be ramping up its tower count to 260,000 by first half of this fiscal.

The diligence process will get initiated after signing of the term sheet. A final binding agreement is due to be signed by early August.


Others
Apart from Brookfield, one of the world’s leading private equity and alternative asset managers, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani is also likely to invest in Jio’s towers in his personal capacity. These assets are likely to generate a 12-13% returns based on the tenancy lease assumptions. Jio is the main tenant in these assets.


'IT'S ABOUT FINE-TUNING, APPROVALS'
Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that of the 125,000 towers built by Jio, around 40,000 are predominantly monopoles and would not support other tenants unless incremental capex is made.

Sebi guidelines stipulate at least five non-sponsor investors or unit holders for privately placed InvITs. The instrument will be listed but privately placed to institutions and high networth individuals, much like listed nonconvertible debentures. For example, the Poonawalla family, Rosy Blue’s Russell Mehta were cosponsors to the East West gas pipeline that Ambani had sold to Brookfield for $2 billion earlier in the year. Brookfield is likely to rope in some of its limited partners and sovereign funds to come on board the tower company.

Reliance and Brookfield declined to comment on speculation.

“The broad commercial terms have been agreed upon by the senior leadership of both sides. This will be the second such transaction between the two, so there is already a successful template in place. Now it’s about documentation, fine-tuning and regulatory approvals,” said a company official on condition of anonymity.

Once completed, Brookfield — which recently bid successfully for Leela Hotels — will be signing off on its biggest investment in India till date.

Reliance is also holding parallel negotiations for a similar monetisation exercise for its 700,000 route km fibre network with global pension funds, SWFs and infrastructure focussed funds. It mandated Citi, Moelis and ICICI Securities in March to manage the exercise. The company is hoping to wrap up both the transactions by August.

In January, after Q3 results, Reliance executives had spoken about demerging the fibre and tower businesses into Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd, respectively. This move was a precursor to transferring fibre and tower assets into two separate firms to monetise them via a sale and leaseback or InvIT structure. Along with the demerger, Rs 1,07 lakh crore ($15.41 billion) worth of liabilities also moved to these new companies.

CLSA estimates Reliance’s telecom debt alone to be over $26 billion.

The plan has been that these companies will look to raise funds from external investors. While the investors might derive comfort from the parentage, they will not have any recourse to RIL’s balance sheet. Jio has signed a 20-year agreement with these entities and Reliance will also get to participate in any value creation in the business as it will hold preference shares in the entity.

Jio will be the anchor tenant for all the towers and has entered into long-term anchor contracts for 50% fiber pairs.

“We understand that the amount RJio will pay for the usage of these assets (which will be the revenue for the InvIT) will generally be at a rate lower than that prevalent in the market given its anchor status. RJio will have the first right of refusal on future asset creation within the SPVs (special purpose vehicles). In case the SPVs are able to attract new tenants in the future, then RJio would benefit from further lowering of rentals,” say Parag Gupta and Gaurav Rateriam, analysts from Morgan Stanley.

An InvIT or infrastructure trust owns mostly operational infrastructure assets. Though similar to debt instruments like bonds, InvITs do not pay back the principal and are free to ramp up by acquiring new assets, offering longer life as against fixed maturity for bond papers.

India’s tower landscape is dominated by three players — Jio Infratel, Bharti Infratel-Indus and American Tower Corporation — who control about 90% of tenancies. “Despite muted near term growth prospects of the tower industry, we expect 900 million 4G users on an average consuming 12 GB of data,” argues Sachin Salgaonkar, analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We expect most of the data demand to be met using towers rather than by small cells or in building solutions.”"

28,2019-06-14,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Vendors of cash-strapped telelcom operator Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) have asked the government to intervene to get pending dues of as much as Rs 2,500 crore, with some warning of service disruptions to the state-run company’s 120 million users unless the payments are made.

The vendors include multinationals such as Nokia, ZTE, ATC Corp and UTStarcom, and domestic firms including Bharti Infratel and Aksh Optifibre.

“…We are engaged in discussions with the concerned officials on this matter and are hopeful of an early resolution within this month,” a Nokia spokesperson told ET.

A gear supplier to BSNL, Nokia wrote in a recent letter to the Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT) additional secretary Anshu Prakash seeking his intervention to recover Rs 650 crore. ET has seen a copy of that letter.

The Finnish equipment maker said it was “facing challenges in maintaining cash flow as payment against capital expenditure and operating spend has been slowed down” and that its payment has been overdue for more than three months.

In a letter dated May 22, the Towers and Infrastructure Providers Association has asked BSNL to clear Rs 425 crore, on account of tenancy fee and power tariff.

US-based ATC has close to Rs 225 crore due from BSNL, while the Sunil Mittal-owned Bharti Infratel has nearly Rs 90 crore outstanding.

UTStarcom said it has “Rs 240.75 crore Capex and Rs 44.57 crore Opex pending for more than six months, for next-genaration network (NGN) phase 1, 2 and 3 as well as towards annual maintenance charges of multi-play services it provided.”

“We have committed to support BSNL, and have made an upfront payment to sub-vendors and have to fulfil obligations,” the Hong Kong-based telecom firm has written in a letter.

Chinese firm ZTE, an L2 gear supplier to BSNL and a rival to Nokia, too has an outstanding of around Rs 600 crore, which include the capital cost of deployment as well as maintenance of BSNL’s 2G and 3G infrastructure.

The companies have said that the wireless network expansion and new technologies that they deployed made the state-run operator better compete with private sector players.

The multinationals argue that a formal clearance from the DoT would enable credit lines to open. The DoT and BSNL did not revert to ET’s emailed queries on the subject.

Fiberhome India, a subsidiary of Chinese Fiberhome Networks, is also seeking Rs 143 crore from BSNL, while Aksh Optifibre, which has partnered with BSNL for the rollout of the national broadband network BharatNet, is owed around Rs 60 crore.

In a letter to the government-controlled operator, Aksh Optifibre said the “company's operations have been severely impacted due to non-receipt of payment.”

The government-run telecom carrier had delayed February salaries to its 1.70 lakh employees, but is expecting the DoT to approve credit worth Rs 3,300 crore to clear the outstanding amounts.

The salary issue, according to the telco, has now been sorted with cash flows back to normal."

35,2019-06-17,Bharti Infratel,"Airtel Africa has set a price of 80-100 pence a share for its initial public offer (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) to raise about $750 million (Rs 5,240 crore). The funds will be used to pare the company’s debt.

The IPO will see 25% of the company’s shares up for sale for retail as well as pre-IPO investors following which the company will be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE UK indices, the company said in a filing to London Stock Exchanges Monday.

The company is expected to raise 595 million pounds ($749.05 million) by issuing about 595.2 million to 744 million new shares. The given price range implies a market capitalisation between 3.01 billion pounds and 3.62 billion pounds ($3,788 million - $4,565 million).

“Ten per cent of the offer is expected to be made available pursuant to the over-allotment option…Excluding the overallotment option, the offer is expected to comprise approximately 541.1 million - 676.4 million new shares to be issued by the company to raise gross proceeds of approximately £541 million ($682 million).”

A greenshoe, or overallotment, option allows underwriters to offer additional shares at the offer price to investors if public demand exceeds expectations.

While the final pricing is expected to be announced around June 28, the company said that conditional dealings will begin the same day, while unconditional dealings are likely to begin around July 3.

“We are excited to be able to give an opportunity to a broader audience of institutional investors to participate in some of the fastest growing telecom and payment markets in the world through the IPO of Airtel Africa shares on the London Stock Exchange,” said Raghunath Mandava, CEO of Airtel Africa.

“We have built Airtel Africa into the second largest mobile operator in Africa and our clear strategy and efficient business model make us well positioned to capture growth opportunities across our markets, in voice, data and mobile money,” he added.

Before the shares are admitted for trading on the LSE, the company will be re-registered as a public company limited by shares and renamed Airtel Africa Plc. The Africa unit also “intends to undertake a listing of its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange concurrently with the IPO,” subject to all relevant approvals, the company said.

After the IPO, the stakes of Airtel and the global investors will stand diluted to 75%. Bharti Airtel currently owns 68.3% in its Africa unit, while the seven global investors collectively own the remainder 31.7%.

Bharti Airtel has already managed to cut the net debt of its Africa business to $4 billion at the end of March from $7.8 billion a year ago by virtue of the $1.45 billion raised via pre-IPO placements to seven global investors, including Qatar Investment Authority, Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International.

Proceeds from the IPO will go towards reducing debt of the company at a time when competition with Reliance Jio continues to escalate. The company’s consolidated net debt rose to Rs 1.08 lakh crore in the March quarter from Rs 1.06 lakh crore in the previous one, increasing its net finance cost by 38% to Rs 2,532 crore in the January-March period.

Facing revenue and profitability pressure in India, the company is trying to build a war chest to fund its countrywide 4G network expansion and participate in the upcoming 5G spectrum sale.

The telco has been selling stakes in tower unit Bharti Infratel and plans to sell another 32% in that company. It raised Rs 25,000 crore through a rights issue in May and Rs 7,000 crore via bond sales."

43,2019-06-20,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel’s revenue and operating income (read: Ebitda) is likely to grow by mid-single digit percentages in FY20, during which the Sunil Mittal-led telco is also estimated to pump in a whopping $4 billion (Rs 28,000 crore) of capex to bolster 4G networks and fibre infrastructure, ratings agency, Fitch said.

The global ratings agency said the strong revenue show would be spurred by better average revenue per user (ARPU) in the Indian mobile segment coupled with steady growth in Africa and business-to-business (B2B) segments. 

Fitch estimates Airtel’s India mobile business Ebitda will increase 15-20 per cent this fiscal, driven by strong growth in data usage and higher blended ARPU, especially as competition eases and incumbents focus on profitability.

“Bharti’s management is committed to an investment-grade rating, and we expect Airtel to further reduce debt through the upcoming equity issuance of its Africa subsidiary and stake sale in its tower arm (read: Bharti Infratel),"" Fitch said in a media statement Thursday.

Bharti Airtel shares closed a shade over 2 per cent higher at Rs 348.65 on BSE Thursday.

The global ratings agency also affirmed Airtel’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at BBB-, adding that its outlook on the IDR is stable.

It said the stable outlook reflects expectations of a recovery in Airtel’s Indian mobile segment, continued growth in Africa and the enterprise segment, and also the telco's ability to hold on to revenue market share (RMS) despite intense competition.

Airtel’s RMS had recently shrunk 285 basis points to 27.3 per cent in the March quarter, forcing it to trail nearest rivals Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio, but the company told ET that the phenomenon was triggered by one-time accounting adjustments, adding that the anomaly would get corrected in the June quarter, FY20 itself.

Fitch estimates Airtel’s funds flow from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage to improve to 2.1x-2.3x in FY20 from 2.4x in FY19, excluding the $6.1 billion in deferred spectrum costs, helped by Bharti’s $3.5 billion funds raise via a mega rights issue.

“We expect Airtel’s leverage to remain under the 2.5x threshold, although it may climb to 2.4-2.5x in FY21 if it were to make a large upfront payments for 5G spectrum assets,” said the global rating agency, adding that it would “consider negative rating action” if the telco’s leverage rises above the 2.5x threshold.

The government has recently underlined plans to conduct the next spectrum sale in calendar 2019 itself, which will mark the debut of 5G airwaves. In the run up to the sale, it has decided to allocate 5G trial spectrum for a year that will be extendable, for a one-time fee of Rs 5,000 per location."

53,2019-06-26,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA | MUMBAI: Bharti Airtel has prepaid over Rs 22,000 crore of rupee-denominated domestic loans to multiple banks using a majority of the carrier’s Rs 25,000-crore rights issue proceeds, people familiar with the matter said. The payments will sharply reduce Airtel’s net finance costs and free up capital to expand its 4G network and buy spectrum in the next auction to take on Reliance Jio more effectively.

The Sunil Mittal-led telco has prepaid a loan of about Rs 6,000 crore to Axis Bank, and cleared additional loans, aggregating upwards of Rs 16,000 crore to other local banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, a person with direct knowledge told ET. These loans were taken by the telco to finance working capital needs.

Bharti Airtel did not reply to ET’s queries. The named banks too did not reply to ET’s queries.

Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICap Securities, estimates any prepayment of rupee loans, upwards of Rs 22,000 crore, would translate in a near Rs 2,000 crore reduction in Airtel’s annual net finance costs, improve leverage and also boost its credit rating, going forward.

Rupee-denominated loans, typically, attract 8.5-9% interest, which is higher than the rate on overseas loans.

In the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 2019, Airtel’s net finance cost rose 30.2% sequentially and 38.4% on year, which continue to drag profitability. The company’s net consolidated debt stood at $15.65 billion (Rs 1.08 lakh crore) in the March quarter, up from Rs 1.06 lakh crore at the end of December, 2018. Of this, India mobile business debt was estimated at nearly $11billion (Rs 77,000 crore approx) at March end.

“Airtel’s move to lower debt will be viewed positively by markets, given the current environment of heightened risk aversion towards highly leveraged corporates,” said Ajay Bodke, CEO (PMS) of Prabhudas Lilladher, a Mumbai-based brokerage firm.

Bharti Airtel shares rose over 1% to close at Rs 348.45 on BSE on Tuesday.

Analysts expect the effects of the prepayment to reflect in the telco’s June quarter earnings.

Airtel’s recent decision to raise a whopping Rs 32,000 crore through the Rs 25,000-crore rights issue and bond sales of Rs 7,000 crore was one of the largest fund-raising exercises by an Indian company. Its stated objective was to cut debt and financing costs and boost cash flows to meet capex needs.

The company is also raising $750 million separately through an IPO of its Africa unit, besides preparing to sell a significant stake in the Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers merged entity.



Brokerage Credit Suisse estimates that Airtel’s net debt to Ebitda or leverage ratio would fall to 3.3x (from around 4.4x level), on the rights issue proceeds and a likely sale of a further stake in Bharti Infratel.

Global ratings agency Fitch expects Airtel’s revenue and operating income (read: Ebitda) to grow by mid-single digit percentages in FY20, during which the telco is also estimated to pump in a whopping $4 billion ( Rs 28,000 crore) of capex to bolster 4G networks and fibre optics infrastructure.

Further, it estimates the company’s India mobile business Ebitda will rise 15-20% this fiscal, driven by strong growth in data usage and higher blended ARPU, especially as competition eases and incumbents focus on profitability."
54,2019-06-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Logging gains for the second day in a row, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty settled in the green on Wednesday, taking cues from positive global sentiment.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s statement that the US and China are close to sealing a trade deal gave a legup to market sentiment. The rupee’s rise against the dollar was another factor that influenced the mood even as oil prices remained elevated.

7,2019-07-05,Bharti Infratel,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 5 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

Jefferies has maintained hold rating on Whirlpool of India with a target price of Rs 1,560. While strong summers could help the company deliver a good performance in the first quarter of FY20, the brokerage is circumspect about underlying industry risks such as rising competition, overall demand softness and volatility in key commodities and rupee. Jefferies said the positives seem priced in at current stretched valuations. The stock ended down 0.2 per cent at Rs 1,600.60 on Thursday.


Kotak Institutional Equities has a buy rating on Jubilant FoodWorks with a target price of Rs 250. The brokerage said it was impressed from its visit to the newly launched Hong's Kitchen store in Gurugram. Chinese cuisine is a market under-served by organised players and Jubilant has the capability to tap this opportunity and scale Hong's Kitchen to 500-plus stores in the next 5-7 years, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.7 per cent at Rs 1,259.25 on Thursday.


CLSA has maintained sell rating on Bharti Infratel with a target price of Rs 250. Bharti Infratel’s tenancy growth is set to be elusive medium term with Vodafone Idea continuing to optimise its network and Reliance Jio unlikely to award tenancies post its tower infrastructure investment trust (InvIT), said CLSA. The upcoming Indus merger will not result in an improvement in its capital structure and in the merged firm Bharti Airtel and Vodafone will still own 66 per cent, which will also be a share overhang, said CLSA. The stock ended down 0.94 per cent at Rs 263.20 on Thursday.

IIFL has maintained buy rating on Torrent Pharmaceuticals with a target price of Rs 1,950. Torrent Pharma’s expanded revenue base in India helped the company significantly improve its net working capital (NWC) cycle in FY19, said IIFL. Although debt reduction was lower in FY19, it was impacted by sartan-related recall expenses, the brokerage said. Given no major capex planned over the next 2-3 years, the brokerage expects FCF generation and deleveraging to accelerate in coming years. The stock ended down 0.5 per cent at Rs 1,543.30 on Thursday.

Investec Securities has maintained buy rating on Tata Steel on the back of deleveraging and gains on the back of strong mining profitability. The brokerage has trimmed target price to Rs 721 from Rs 730. Tata Steel’s FY19 annual report outlines long term value drivers – growing Indian operations, de-leveraging balance sheet, and diversifying revenue streams, said Investec. Higher contingent liabilities, commitments and potential impairments are a concern, it added. The stock ended down 0.43 per cent at Rs 495.35 on Thursday."

12,2019-07-08,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: The budget proposal to raise basic customs duty on optical fibre cables (OFC) to 15% from 10% will increase tower fiberisation costs, adding to the telecom sector’s continuing financial stress, and jolt India’s target to be 5G-ready by 2020, industry insiders said.

Indian OFC manufacturers, however, expect finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s proposal to encourage telecom companies to source the fibre locally, thereby giving a boost to its domestic production.

Amajor potential deterrent to India’s 5G ambitions is inadequate fibre connectivity, given that well below 25% of telecom towers are linked by fibre. And, the prospect of higher import duty on OFC sitting on top of chunky right of way (RoW) costs, the industry insiders said, would hinder the efforts to rollout reliable fibre-based tower networks that are critical to support 5G data speeds of 10 Gbps and next-gen applications such as video-on-demand and Internet of things to smart cities. Most 5G use cases also won’t even work without strong pan-India fibre connectivity The latest Economic Survey estimates the telecom sector’s contribution to GDP to reach 8.2% by 2020 on the back of the industry players leveraging 5G technologies in a big way. The government, in fact, has resolved to make India 5G-ready by 2020 and plans to auction 5G spectrum later this year.

Senior tower industry executives see this to be a tough target to achieve.


Agencies

“The proposed hike in basic customs duty on OFC will result in higher capex, eventually burning a hole in the pockets of the telecom industry, which is already in a financial turmoil, and seriously impede 5G rollouts in India,” said Tilak Raj Dua, the director-general of the Tower & Infrastructure Providers Association (Taipa). The industry is in the process of estimating the overall incremental fiberisation cost per km following the proposed OFC duty hike, he said.

Taipa is an industry grouping representing Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel, ATC, GTL, Reliance Infratel and Tower Vision.

According to Dua, fibre is the most significant component to enhance fast broadband connectivity, and a sharp duty hike would undermine 5G rollouts in India where less than 25% of towers are fiberised, compared with as much as 80% in the US, China, Japan and South Korea.

Another senior executive of a Big 3 telecom company backed the vi-ew, saying the “fibre capex component in a telco’s total network capex is likely to significantly rise in a 5G scenario from the current 35-40% level in 4G, which is why a higher OFC import duty, along with RoW costs, can sharply increase 5G rollout costs, going forward”.

Dua said India’s plans to become 5G-ready rapidly would face big challenges as a higher input cost structure would further push it behind pioneer 5G-deployed markets such as the US, China, Japan or South Korea.

21,2019-07-12,Bharti Infratel,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 13 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

CLSA has retained sell rating on Bharti Infratel with a target price of Rs 250. Bharti Infratel’s merger with Indus Towers is likely in the coming months, said CLSA. This partstock/part-cash merger will have limited opex synergies, though mergeco EPS will be boosted by Indus Towers, said CLSA. Bharti Infratel’s elusive tenancy growth in the medium term underlines negative stock view, it said. Shares of Bharti Infratel ended up 1.85 per cent at Rs 264.70 on Thursday.


ICICI Securities maintained buy rating on UltraTech Cement with a target price of Rs 5,200. Acquisition of Binani Cement resulted in creation of intangible assets of Rs 17.1 billion, goodwill of Rs 17.6 billion and assets held for disposal (to be monetised likely in FY20) at Rs 550 crore, said ICICI Securities. With the integration and ramp-up of acquired assets largely behind, UltraTech's focus would shift to improving margins /return ratios and deleveraging the balance sheet. Shares of UltraTech Cement ended up 1.3 per cent at Rs 4536.30 on Thursday.


Kotak Institutional Equities maintained buy rating on Ashok Leyland with fair value of Rs 130. Ashok Leyland reported strong revenue growth in FY19 led by strong volume growth in the domestic M&HCV and LCV markets, the brokerage said. However, EBITDA margin declined due to intense competition and high discounting, it said. The brokerage expects the M&HCV industry to grow at a healthy pace in the medium term led by strong growth in infra activities and prebuying due to BS-VI emission norms. Shares of Ashok Leyland ended up 0.41 per cent at Rs 85.15 on Thursday.

Investec Securities has reiterated its hold rating on HDFC with a target price of Rs 2,215. HDFC remains the best quality housing finance company; however, growth and RoE of 16 per cent plus over the medium term seems difficult, said Investec. HDFC is cautious on wholesale segment, which grew 8 per cent YoY in FY19, said Investec. The focus on affordable housing was noted, but growth needs to pick up in medium/ high-income segment, said Investec. Shares of HDFC ended up 1.5 per cent at Rs 2261.45 on Thursday.

HSBC has retained buy rating on Cadila Healthcare and reduced the target price to Rs 260 from Rs 410. The brokerage expects clarity to emerge on FDA status of Moraiya plant by early August 2019. Looking at market dynamics and competitive scenario for key Heinz brands, growth of 6-7 per cent per annum looks reasonable, HSBC said. India sales should see recovery from Q2 of FY20, HSBC said. Shares of Cadila ended up 2.6 per cent at Rs 234.35 on Thursday."

24,2019-07-19,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel could raise another $3.5 billion (Rs24,500 crore) from the sale of a significant stake in the soon-to-be merged Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel entity, and coupled with the recent rights issue and the IPO of its Africa business, would help bring its debt-to-Ebitda, or leverage, ratio below 3.5 times by March 2020, Moody’s said Friday.

The ratings agency said in a release that Bharti Airtel after the inorganic fund raising steps, Bharti Airtel will “rely more heavily on organic cash flow from the Indian operations to ensure adequate financial flexibility going forward…,” which will help sustain improvement in credit metrics. 

“Proceeds from the recent capital-raising activities will strengthen balance sheet and improve cash flows,” the ratings agency said.

Bharti Airtel completed a Rs 25,000 crore ($3.5 billion) rights issue in May and the listing of its African subsidiary, Airtel Africa, which raised $750 million in June.

Assuming that nearly all of the proceeds are used to reduce debt, Moody’s expects consolidated leverage to improve to around 4.2 times from 5.1 times at fiscal year ended March 2019, which will still be above 3.5 times, the threshold for outlook stabilisation.

“Sale of a significant stake in its tower assets would aid further debt reduction. We expect Bharti to ultimately sell a significant stake in the tower company formed from the merger of Infratel and Indus Tower Limited, although it may retain a minority stake,” Moody’s said.

Assuming a premium to Infratel's average closing price in July, Moody’s estimated Bharti Airtel could raise an additional $3.5 billion of cash, and if proceeds are largely applied to debt reduction, Bharti's leverage could fall below 3.5x by fiscal year ending March 2020.

In mid-day trade, the Airtel stock was down 0.9% at Rs339.10 on the BSE Friday, while shares in Bharti Infratel were 0.4% lower at Rs261.50.

“Although cash flows will rise as interest costs fall, a meaningful expansion of organic profitability at Bharti's Indian mobile operations is needed to improve its credit profile. We expect Bharti's capital spending and network costs to remain high as competition remains intense,” the agency said.

 Airtel Africa contributed around 30% of reported consolidated Ebitda in fiscal 2019. But Bharti Airtel’s ownership of Airtel Africa has been diluted to around 55% from 68% following the subsidiary's IPO.

“While Airtel Africa will continue to be a material contributor to Bharti's consolidated EBITDA, we expect actual cash flow received from Airtel Africa by way of dividends to be limited over the next 12 months. Excess cash flow at the subsidiary will likely be reinvested in its growing business,” Moody’s said."
25,2019-07-20,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: A consortium led by Brookfield Asset Management has agreed to acquire Reliance Industries’ Reliance Jio lnfratel unit in a multi-stage deal, which would see it first investing Rs 25,215 crore in an infrastructure trust that owns 51% of the telecom tower company.

Once the transactions are closed, the Canadian alternative assets manager and its partners would own 100% of India’s largest telecom tower company with 170,000 towers through Tower Infrastructure Trust. The proceeds will allow Mukesh Ambani-controlled RIL reduce debt at its telecom unit, Reliance Jio Infocomm, and free up cash to take on rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.

“This is the single largest foreign investment in an Indian infrastructure vehicle,” RIL said.


TOWER, FIBRE BIZ SPUN OFF EARLIER THIS YEAR
The oil-to-telecom conglomerate said talks were ongoing also to monetise the group’s fibre assets, Jio Digital Fibre, under a similar deal structure, but did not name any potential investors. The tower and fibre businesses were both spun off from Jio earlier this year.



Under the deal announced on Friday, Reliance Industrial Investments & Holdings, a wholly owned Reliance Industries unit and the sponsor of Tower Infrastructure Trust, would issue units in the trust to Brookfield affiliate BIF IV Jarvis India and some co-investors. Brookfield and its partners would become the sponsors of the trust, holding all the units, while the Reliance Industries subsidiary would become a co-sponsor, but hold no units.

The trust currently owns 51% of Reliance Jio lnfratel, where Reliance Industries holds the remaining 49%. On receiving the funds, the trust would buy out Reliance’s 49% stake, repay Rs 12,000 crore to Jio and “certain existing financial liabilities of Reliance Jio Infratel”, besides investing for the tower firm’s growth, Reliance Industries said.

Jio would also transfer its proceeds of Rs 12,000 crore to the Reliance Group against certain financial liabilities owed to the parent.

After the completion of the proposed deal, Reliance Jio lnfratel would have debt of Rs 16,000 crore.

This is the second investment this year that Brookfield is making in a venture controlled by Mukesh Ambani. In March, it had agreed to buy the loss-making East-West Pipeline, earlier known as Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure, at an enterprise valuation of Rs 13,000 crore.

“The big investment from Brookfield will strengthen Jio’s balance sheet, boost its cash reserves and help it build a sizeable war chest to fight Airtel and Vodafone Idea and consolidate its gains in the mobile broadband turf,” said Rohan Dhamija, a partner and the head of India and Middle East at Analysys Mason.

Brookfield will seek to obtain more tenants for the tower assets, Reliance said. “All expansion will be by Brookfield. This is monetisation (for Reliance). We have invested and now we have exited. Same we will do for fibre,” Reliance Industries chief financial officer V Srikanth told reporters.

ET had reported in its June 12 edition that Brookfield was close to signing a pact to invest in the tower assets.

Jio had demerged the tower and fibre businesses in the quarter ended March to Reliance Jio Infratel and Jio Digital Fibre. The fibre network is 700,000 route km long. Separating the two helped the telecom company remove liabilities of about Rs 1.07 lakh crore from its balance sheet. Jio had debt of Rs 75,000 crore at the end of June.


RIVALS RAISING FUNDS
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have recently beefed up their books with each raising Rs 25,000 crore via rights issues. Both are also considering stake sales in their tower units to raise further cash. All three telcos are trying to strengthen their balance sheets also by reducing debt amid continuing need to invest in their 4G networks besides preparing for the upcoming spectrum auction where 5G airwaves will be up for sale for the first time.

Jio has a right to use the tower and fibre assets, for which it has started paying the trust. “This has resulted in recognising a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability of Rs 6,633 crore as at 1st April 2019,” Jio said. Anshuman Thakur, Jio’s strategy head, said Jio’s longterm lease was “capitalised”.

Reliance Jio Infratel’s portfolio of 170,000 towers tops those of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, which together have 163,000 towers. Jio acquired 45,000 towers from Reliance Communications and built the rest.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that of the 125,000 towers built by Jio, around 40,000 were predominantly monopoles and would not support other tenants unless incremental capex was made. But the assets are likely to generate a 12-13% return based on the tenancy lease assumptions.

India’s tower landscape is dominated by three players — Jio Infratel, Bharti Infratel-Indus and American Tower Corporation — who control about 90% of tenancies.

Analysts expect 900 million 4G users on an average consuming 12 GB of data and that most of the data demand is set to be met using towers rather than by small cells or in-building solutions, making the deal timely."

The fresh debt and proceeds from Brookfield’s proposed Rs 25,215-crore investment in an infrastructure trust that owns Jio Infratel will be used to pay off roughly Rs 36,500 crore of the tower entity’s liabilities, comprising loans from banks and Reliance Industries (RIL), and vendor-related dues. 

The infrastructure trust “may raise an additional Rs 10,000 crore to repay/refinance” the tower arm’s liabilities, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, which was present at Reliance Jio Infocomm’s earnings call on Friday, said in a note to clients. Brokerage IIFL Institutional Equities estimates Jio Infratel’s liabilities are split across Rs 11,000 crore bank borrowings, Rs 11,800 crore from RIL by way of non-convertible debentures and Rs 13,700 crore of other liabilities. 

“Long-term debt (is) also being raised in RJIPL... Proceeds from investment by Brookfield and long-term loans will be used to repay existing financial liabilities of RJIPL, including loans extended by Reliance,” said RIL in its analyst presentation. 

Brokerage Ambit said while Brookfield and its investor partners will acquire units of the infrastructure trust holding Jio Infratel, further “clarity is needed on yield assured to these unitholders, which could set a benchmark altering rentals currently earned by Bharti Infratel/Indus Towers.” 

As per analysts, Jio’s parent RIL said it is making good progress to monetise Jio Digital Fibre under a similar deal structure, although it did not identify potential investors.

33,2019-07-24,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices started off on a firm note on Wednesday, tracking firm cues from the global markets, but concerns surrounding massive FII outflows, rising crude prices and earnings weighed on domestic market.

Meanwhile, IMF cut India’s growth estimates by 0.3 per cent to 7 per cent for 2019 and to 7.2 per cent for 2020, saying its GDP will grow slower on weaker-than expected outlook for domestic demand.

The volatility also remained high ahead of the July futures and options expiry on Thursday. India VIX spiked 4 per cent. 

At around 9.35 am, BSE Sensex traded 120 points or 0.31 per cent lower at 37,864 while its NSE counterpart Nifty 
slipped below the 11,300 mark to trade at 11,286, down 45 points or 0.39 per cent.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 2,608 crore on Tuesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 2,625 crore, data suggests. 

Oil prices rose, extending gains after an industry group reported a much bigger-than-expected drop in US inventories. Brent crude futures rose 24 cents, or 0.4%, to $64.07 a barrel, while WTI futures gained 22 cents. 

The rupee on Wednesday opened 15 paise down at 69.09 against the US dollar due to stronger greenback against major currencies and sustained foreign fund outflows. “Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 68.65 and 69.20,” brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market participants would keep a close eye on stocks such of Asian Paints, Jubilant Foodworks, ICICI Prudential, Canara Bank, Bharti Infratel, Oberoi Realty and Shriram Transport, Karur Vysya, IDFC First Bank, Monsanto India, Quess Corp and Syndicate Bank, which are among entities which will announce June quarter results today.

37,2019-07-24,Bharti Infratel,"Kolkata: Bharti Infratel reported strong net profit growth in the fiscal first quarter, driven by a net rise in co-locations on its telecom sites and expects the trend to continue with big phone companies likely to focus on network rollouts after recent mega fund-raises.

India’s sole listed telecom tower company’s consolidated net profit for the April-June period came in at Rs 887 crore, reflecting a 39% on-year jump over last year. Net profit was nearly 46% higher sequentially from Rs 608 crore reported in the March quarter, FY19.

Quarterly consolidated revenue, in turn, rose 1% on-year to Rs 3,712 crore, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

The telecom tower company’s results were announced after market hours. Bharti Infratel’s stock closed 0.88% higher at Rs 264.10 on BSE on Wednesday.

“After negative trend in net co-locations for the last six quarters due to consolidation in the telecom industry, we had net additions in co-locations this quarter,” Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta, said in a statement.

Co-locations are points where a tower company deploys mobile telecom antennae of multiple carriers on a single structure.

The top executive expects “the trend would continue” as operators, post-consolidation and raising of significant capital recently would focus on fresh network rollouts to increase both coverage and capacity.

Both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have concluded mega fund-raises, via rights issues, a sizeable chunk of which will be deployed in ramping up their 4G networks to effectively take on Reliance Jio Infocomm.

The company’s consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortisation (Ebitda) rose 28% on-year to Rs 1,953 crore in the June quarter, while operating free cash flow rose 22% on-year to Rs 1,207 crore.

Bharti Infratel reported 523 net on-quarter additions in co-locations, taking the total count to 1,73,247 as of June-end. This led to a 7% sequential rise in the sharing revenue per tower to Rs 81,503. The company though lost a whopping 27,531 co-locations on-year, courtesy the negative trend innet co-locations for the past six quarters amid rapid sector consolidation.

The company’s tower base rose 873 on-year and 354 sequentially to 92,632 in the fiscal first quarter.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base includes units by virtue of its 42% stake in Indus Towers. Last month, the Chandigarh bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) cleared the Indus-Bharti Infratel merger that will create one of the largest telecom tower companies globally, estimated to have over 1,63,000 towers across 22 telecom service areas in the country. 

The company’s consolidated expenses for the June quarter fell 18% on-year to Rs 1,759.1 crore. The largest components were power & fuel, which fell 4%, followed by repairs & maintenance and employee expenses that fell 30% and 4% respectively

Separately, at the company’s 13

48,2019-07-26,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Vodafone Idea’s (VIL) net loss narrowed to Rs 4,873.9 crore for the April-June quarter, helped by a change in accounting standard and lower operating costs, but its revenue fell dropped below rival Reliance Jio’s for the first time, as some subscribers left and others moved to lower tariff plans.

The adoption the Ind AS 116 accounting standard “resulted in a positive impact of Rs. 1.2 billion at PAT (profit after tax) for the quarter,” the company said in a statement on Friday.

Essentially, Ind-AS 116 enables companies to recognise leases (towers in this case) as assets in the balance sheet from April 1, 2019, and as such, the relevant lease rentals do not get reflected in the network opex – thus pushing up earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortization (Ebitda), but as an element of depreciation cost. 

Thus, quarterly Ebitda more than doubled to Rs 3650 crore from Rs 1790 crore, with the adoption of the new accounting standard pushing up the metric by Rs2,410 crore. Operating expenses fell nearly 24% to Rs7619.9 crore, while depreciation & amortization, and finance costs rose over 31% and 23.4%, respectively. Net debt however fell sequentially to Rs99,260 crore from Rs11,839 crore.

EBitda margin expanded to 32.5% from 15.2% in the previous quarter.

Revenue for the quarter ended June fell 4.3% on quarter to Rs11,269.9 crore, hurt by subscribers leaving due to the company’s minimum recharge plans and “continued down trading of high ARPU (average revenue per user) customers,” the company said. Rival Jio’s revenue for the same period was Rs 11,679 crore, while net profit rose 46% to Rs891 crore, with its subscriber base at over 331 million. Airtel’s results are expected on Aug. 1.

The company said that the impact of lower revenues was partially offset by further cost savings due to continued synergies derived from the integration of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular’s networks and operations, with the combined entity having reached around 70% of its opex synergy target of Rs 8,400 crore.

“We are delivering on our stated strategy although the benefits are not yet visible in our top line,” Vodafone Idea CEO Balesh Sharma said. “We are well on track to deliver our synergy targets by Q1FY21. We expect these factors to increasingly contribute to our financial performance going forward.”

The telco, which raised Rs25,000 crore via a rights issue, plans to sell its stake in the Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers merged entity, with the deal expected to close in August. “We are also exploring options to monetize over 159,000 Kilometers of intra-city and inter-city fibre which will provide further financial flexibility,” Vodafone Idea said.

Shares of Vodafone Idea closed at Rs 9.25, down by 4.84%, on the BSE on Friday. The results were declared post market hours. 

""…the sharp increase in the company's Ebitda is artificial as it's not driven by business growth but a change in the accounting standard (Ind AS-116) that allows tower leases to no longer be treated as opex under IFRS 16, but instead as a lighter depreciation & amortisation item,"" Rohan Dhamija, partner & head of India & Middle East, Analysys Mason, said, who added that the net loss was wider than expected. 

While the minimum recharge plans - under which users must recharge every 28 days – meant subscriber base fell to 320 million from 334.1 million, it helped ARPU grow for the second successive quarter – to Rs108 from Rs104 in the previous quarter.

“…the customer base on ‘service validity vouchers’ is yet to stabilize on a regular recharge cycle,” the company said.

The company said its high revenue customers were ‘broadly stable’, reflecting in the churn which dropped to 3.7% in the June end quarter, compared to 7.2% in the previous one. 

The closure of Vodafone M-Pesa and Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank Ltd (ABIPBL) resulted in an impairment loss of Rs 210 crore during the quarter, dragging its net loss further."

Nifty50 on Monday failed to hold above the 11,300 level and drifted sharply towards the 11,150 mark. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale, as every bounce got sold into. The index has been hovering near its 200-day EMA since past few sessions and the overall structure of the index is under pressure.

Now, as long as it holds below 11,250 level, it could extend its weakness towards the next major support at 11,111 and then the psychologically important 11,000 mark, while on the upside hurdles are seen in the 11,300-11,320 zone.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,200 levels while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,300 levels. Marginal Put writing was seen at 11,200 followed by 10,900 level, while there was Call writing at 11,300 followed by 11,400 levels. The options data suggested a broader trading range between 11,000 and 11,500 levels.

India VIX moved up 7.69 per cent to 13.06 level.

Bank Nifty traded between 29,100 and 29,550 but failed to sustain at higher levels. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale, but took support at its 200-day EMA. It has been forming higher highs and lows from past three sessions. Now, it needs to hold above 29,350 to witness a bounce towards 29,500 and then 29,650 levels, while on the downside supports are seen at 29,000 and then 28,888 levels.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,225 with a loss of 0.90 per cent. Long buildup was seen in UBL, Berger Paints, Marico and Jubilant Foodworks while shorts were seen in Havells, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bharti Infratel and Grasim.

The recent news flows have aggravated the pessimism. ""The recent news flow related to Indiabulls Housing Finance and the founder of Cafe Coffee Day VG Siddhartha have added to the negative perception about the business environment,"" said Rusmik Oza, Senior VP & Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities. 


We walk you through the key highlights of Tuesday's session:

Investors lose Rs 3.09 crore in 2 days!
In last two sessions, cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 1,40,73,089.85 crore from Rs 1,43,82,243.21 crore last Friday, making investors poorer by Rs 3.09 lakh crore. On Tuesday alone, investors lost Rs 1.72 lakh crore.


656 stocks plumb 52-week lows
Hero MotoCorp, IndusInd Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Tata Steel and Tech Mahindra were among 656 stocks that touched their 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, SAR Auto Products, Mandhana Industries, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers, Adhunik Industries and Pioneer Investcorp were among 23 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


325 stocks hit lower circuits

The index had closed 3 per cent lower on Monday. Analysts say, a slowdown of the economy due to the US-China trade war and feeble health of the auto industry, which is a major consumer of steel and aluminium, are putting pressure on the metal sector.


Coffee Day Enterprises plunges 20%
Shares of Coffee Day Enterprises hit a lower circuit limit of 20 per cent to close at Rs 154.05 on reports that founder VG Siddhartha has been missing since Monday night.


Axis Bank falls 2% ahead of Q1

TechM declines
Tech Mahindra closed the day 0.93 per cent down at Rs 640.30 ahead of its quarterly numbers, After the market hours, it posted a 6.83 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 959.30 crore for the quarter ended June 30. It had reported a net profit of Rs 897.90 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.


BoI falls 7% despite strong Q1 nos

52,2019-07-30,Bharti Infratel,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Tuesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 17 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

ICICIdirect has maintained hold rating on Bharti Infratel with a target price of Rs 275. The key risk for Infratel is on tenancy growth concerns, pricing and possibly in worst case, Vodafone Idea’s survival (it is an anchor tenant), said ICICIdirect. There will also be share price overhang as none of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Group or Vodafone-Idea, will be subject to a lock-in on their shareholdings postmerger, said ICICIdirect. Shares of Bharti Infratel ended down 5.2 per cent at Rs 256.3 on Monday.


Edelweiss has maintained ‘buy’ on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 585. Earnings in Q1 reaffirm conviction that ICICI Bank is expecting sustainable, prudent and profitable growth, said Edelweiss. Over the past decade, ICICI was caught on the wrong side of the cycle, it said. Now, its focused approach and structural changes underpin a sustainable franchise, said Edelweiss. Earnings consistency too instils confidence. Shares of ICICI Bank ended up 3.3 per cent at Rs 429.3 on Monday.


IDFC Securities has a neutral rating on Vedanta with a target price of Rs 201. The brokerage expects Vedanta to record EBITDA CAGR of 15 per cent in FY19-21 driven by volume growth in zinc, and oil and gas, and lower cost of production of aluminium. The unwinding of Vedanta’s structured deal with Volcan removes one layer of overhang on the share price, said IDFC Secs. Any move by the parent in deleveraging its balance sheet by monetising assets will remove overhang on Vedanta's share price. Shares of Vedanta ended down 5.1 per cent at Rs 155.70 on Monday.

Citigroup has maintained buy rating on Persistent Systems and lowered target price to Rs 540. Persistent’s revenue growth trajectory continues to disappoint versus peers. The brokerage expects investor sentiment to remain weak unless Persistent delivers growth in digital business and improve margins going forward. Shares of Persistent Systems ended down 5.3 per cent at Rs 534.9 on Monday.

CLSA has retained sell rating on JSW Steel and revised down target price to Rs 200 from Rs 225. JSW’s margin outlook remains weak and we expect a sharp 39 per cent fall in its EPS over FY19-21, said CLSA. Its capex intensity has also risen in a weakening steel cycle and the potential acquisition of Bhushan Power could stretch its balance sheet further, the brokerage said. Shares of JSW Steel ended down 3.2 per cent at Rs 241.55 on Monday."

5,2019-08-02,Bharti Infratel,"Vodafone Idea Ltd, India’s second-largest telecom operator in terms of subscribers, is set to monetise its stake in Indus Towers as part of the latter’s merger with Bharti Infratel, which is in the final stages. Vodafone Idea is likely to get about Rs 5,500-6,000 crore from the sale of its holding, people close to the development told ET.

“In the two-stage transaction, Bharti Infratel will first buy out the stakes of Vodafone Idea and Providence Equity Partners,” said one of the persons. “Subsequently, Indus Towers will be merged with Bharti Infratel.”

Born out of a merger between Vodafone India and Idea Cellular that was completed last August, Vodafone Idea is looking at generating funds from various avenues, including a Rs 25,000 crore rights issue in the June quarter. The company has incurred a cumulative loss of Rs 19,734 crore in the past four quarters. Vodafone Idea holds an 11.15% stake in Indus Towers.

UK’s Vodafone Group Plc owns about 45% of the telco and a 42% stake in Indus Towers. After the Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel merger is complete, the UK-based company will have a 29.4% stake in the resultant entity. It’s said to be holding discussions separately with financial investors and private equity firms to dilute this holding.

“In addition, Providence Equity Partners, the private equity firm that owns a 4.85% stake in Indus Towers, will also monetise almost twothirds of its holding,” he added. It would have held a 3.1% stake in the merged entity. However, after cashing out partly, it will hold a 1.1% stake, sources said.

The combined value of these two transactions—Vodafone Idea’s exit and Providence’s part sale--is pegged at around Rs 7,000 crore. This will be funded through a combination of internal accruals and shortterm debt by Bharti Infratel.

Vodafone Idea declined to comment on queries. Its spokesperson said that, at the time of announcing the June quarter result, the company had said that, “Vodafone Idea’s 11.15% stake in Indus has an implied value of about Rs 5,630 crore, based on the VWAP (volume weighted average price) for Bharti Infratel’s shares during the last 60 trading days as at June 30, 2019) which we plan to monetise on completion.”

22,2019-08-22,Bharti Infratel,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."

31,2019-08-28,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi: Shareholders of Vodafone Idea approved the carrier’s move to raise its authorised share capital to Rs 50,000 crore, which will provide headroom infusion of additional funds.

The approval has been sought to incorporate investments from the Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, which led to the issue of additional shares by the company.

“The members have approved increase in the authorised share capital of the company from existing Rs 3,02,93,00,20,000 (over Rs 30,293 crore) to Rs 5,00,00,00,00,000 (Rs 50,000 crore) by amending clause V of the memorandum of association,” Vodafone Idea said in a BSE filing.

The proposal was approved by over 92% shareholders in the annual general meeting of the company held Tuesday.

Vodafone Idea’s Rs 25,000-crore rights issue, the largest in the country, opened on April 10 and closed on April 24 with 2000 crore shares at Rs 12,5 each, where promoters Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group infused up to Rs 18,250 crore.

The proceeds are meant to beef up the company’s financial war chest which will be used to accelerate integration of operations of former companies Idea Cellular and Vodafone India.

While the merged entity Vodafone Idea wants to prioritise investments in profitable areas and focus on increasing average revenue per user, a key measure of profitability, analysts have flagged several issues in the company’s performance.

“Our analysis of VIL’s debt and deferred spectrum repayment schedules, basis the company’s FY2019 annual report, suggests a need for another round of equity infusion as early as second or third quarter of FY 21 unless there is a quick and steep recovery in ARPU,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities told clients in a note dated August 26.

They added that the company can see an upside in case sale of fiber assets closes and fetches upwards of Rs 100 bn (Rs 10,000 crore), or some of the debt due for repayment is refinanced or capex credit increases by a sum materially higher than the Rs 60 bn (Rs 6,000 crore) that they assumed.

The headline index has been finding multiple hurdles in 11,145-11,150 zone from the last four weeks and needs to cross and hold above the same to extend its bounce or else rangebound moves could return.

On the Options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,000 followed by 10,800 strike while maximum Call open interest was at 11,200 followed by 11,100 strike.

We have seen meaningful Call writing at 11,100 followed by 11,200 strike while Put unwinding was seen at all the immediate strike price. Option data suggests a trading range between 10,950 to 11,100 zone.

3,2019-09-05,Bharti Infratel,"The leverage will be more around the investments made in Hathaway and Den. They have a cable infrastructure. Hathaway has some decent home broadband and so they will be able to leverage that cable TV base, says Rajiv Sharma, Co-head, Institutional Equity Research, SBICAP Securities. Edited excerpts from an interview.


It all sounds great in terms of the kind of offers that they are rolling out but some of the analysts of the view that given that there has been relatively low progress or slow progress for Jio GigaFibre. Post the announcement in August 2018, they have reached just about 500,000 households and will we see on ground challenges for actual implementation of all of these very ambitious plans?The way to look at this is that a very ambitious plan has become a more realistic plan now. The 50 million number which was earlier expected by Reliance, has been pegged down to 20 million households now. It is more realistic, it is more doable but unlike mobility which is one tower and you are reaching 60,000 individuals, this is a one on one network and we have a lot of flatbeds. Every place is not Mumbai or South Mumbai. There are challenges of rollout, but it seems they have factored in the revised target of 20 million, given in the AGM.


Given the fact that they have got just about 500,000 broadband customers as of now on a trial basis, they have a headstart in technology like AR and VR. That is going to be a big positive. How do you see the overall landscape changing within the space?The leverage will be more around the investments made in Hathaway and Den. They have a cable infrastructure. Hathaway has some decent home broadband and so they will be able to leverage that cable TV base. That is the first leverage that they have. 

But again, as I mentioned, that this is a supply side issue. There are supply side gaps when it comes to home broadband. The demand is always there and there are some mom and pop small operators which are giving you home broadband but that is not as robust as a FTTH would be. There will be demand but the ability to close that or bridge that demand will be a very slow and gradual process. 

Hathaway was adding some million subscribers over three to four years. That is the kind of run rate. Jio being Jio, it could do a two to three million every year. So, even this 20 million target will be reached gradually. It will be like three to four million per year and over four to five years, they should be able to hit this target.


There is a very ambitious plan of “first day first show” movies for the premium Jio GigaFiber users. Is this going to be a little bit of a concern in the long run? How are movie producers going to address the piracy issues as well and are they going to be agreeable?So let me take the second one first, which is this is going to be very tricky. Price discovery is a very important phenomenon which a box office does and if you ask any producer, before the movie is released he would say that his movie is going to be a blockbuster and it is going to collect above Rs 300 crore, but the box office it gives you realistic numbers as to what the movie was really worth. 

Now doing it in reverse is possible provided you are willing to compensate every film four to five times. That tells you that this is going to be very selective and could be something which Jio is itself is producing or could be one or two smart buying. It does not look like a sustainable thing or a feasible thing.


 Let us talk a little bit about the financials for Reliance Jio. Can you walk us through the overall debt, the kind of EV that they are seeing for mobile and how lucrative all of these freebies are for the company?Their ARPUs for the home broadband is starting from Rs 700. For Bharti, it is around Rs 800-850. So, we are not seeing a mobile kind of disruptive pricing in the home broadband segment. 

Second, this is only the home broadband. This is not TV bundled with home broadband because the new tariff order really constraints anyone from doing so. So the pricing is realistic. Today, they are expected to make a $7 billion kind of revenue for FY20. If over the next three to four years, the home broadband itself could add something like $2.5- 3 billion to revenues and $1-1.5 billion on EBITDA. Deleveraging process has started with the tower and fibre InvIT. Now the tower InvIT has happened. There will be some progress in fibre too in coming days.


What your view is on Reliance Industries and some of its peers?We have a hold on Bharti Airtel with limited upsides, given that we do not see a meaningful tariff hike in mobility which is still the key driver for the overall space. We are seeing some announcements by Vodafone-Idea doing some kind of selective Rs 20 recharge plan. So, tariff clarity has still not emerged. Thus, there are limited upsides on Bharti. We do not like Vodafone. We are sceptical in Vodafone as also Bharti Infratel. We do not have coverage on Reliance as of now."

Vodafone Idea: The telecom company’s strategy to pick cash over Esops to insulate themselves from share price uncertainties may not be paying off. The cash component may shrink, too, as the telco loses revenue market share and customers – key parameters to which the incentive is linked. 


Sun Pharma: Drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said its Netherlands-based arm has fully acquired PJSC Biosintez, Russia by purchasing 3.04 per cent stake in the company under the mandatory tender offer.


Nestle India: Nestlé India will appeal against an order issued in a 2015 case imposing a Rs 20-lakh fine on the company for the presence of monosodium glutamate in its instant noodle product Maggi.

15,2019-09-19,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel aims to almost halve its debt to about ₹50,000 crore by March 2020, retaining mostly spectrum dues that are payable annually to the government, senior officials of the telco said.

“Given a choice on which debt to retire first, the company feels it is always better to retain the government debt even though it is a little more expensive, as the tenure of payment is longer,” one official told ET, asking not to be identified.

Airtel’s liabilities related to spectrum purchases — to be paid to the government — are estimated at between ₹45,000 crore and ₹50,000 crore. Payments for auctioned spectrum are made in equal annual instalments over 16 years and there is no fine for early payments.

“One can repay three instalments together without attracting any penalty,” the official said.

Airtel had ₹1.16 lakh crore of debt at the end of June. One official said the figure is higher than in the previous quarter owing to a change in accounting standards.

Airtel, India’s second-largest telco, declined to comment to ET’s emailed queries.

Part of the debt is being cleared after the company raised funds through equity and bonds.

Airtel raised ₹25,000 crore from a rights issue and ₹7,000 crore through an issue of perpetual bonds with equity credit, while the listing of its Africa unit on the London Stock Exchange helped bring in $750 million (₹5,250 crore), all of which is being used to pare debt. The full extent of the repayments will be reflected in the next quarter’s results, the officials said.

Airtel could raise $3.2 billion (₹22,400 crore) by reducing its stake to 13% from some 37% in the entity being formed by the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel. ET reported in May that Airtel and Vodafone Group have been in talks with KKR to dilute their respective holdings in the merged entity, which may be valued at $13-14 billion.

“The company hopes to pay off the remaining non-spectrum-related debt by paring its stake in the Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel merged company,” the second person said.

Airtel’s tower unit Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, a joint venture between Airtel and Vodafone Idea, are awaiting final approval from the government for their merger.

“Bharti Airtel’s balance sheet is more robust than its peers, end of June 19; Vodafone Idea’s net debt to Ebidta was 12 times, that of Reliance Jio was 6 times and that of Bharti Airtel was 3.4 times,” brokerage Goldman Sachs said in a recent note.

CLSA said with Airtel’s capex intensity likely to moderate, there is no compulsion for any further asset sale, including offloading a potential stake of Bharti Infratel.

“That is one of the reasons why the proposed talks with Vodafone Idea for a joint optic fibre company have been called off,” the first executive told ET.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel had been in talks to pool their joint optic fibre assets and sell stakes in that joint venture. But, as ET reported on August 24, the talks ended given the divergent needs of the companies. While Vodafone is in urgent need to boost its cashflows, Airtel is in a more comfortable financial position.

Goldman Sachs expects Airtel to be free cashflow positive, starting FY21."

This festive season, it’s a win-win situation for the three telecom majors because the sector has gone through the worst amid price was and rising cost of money. With the cost of money easing, highers tariffs should bode well for all three players going forward.”

He said it would be a win-win situation for RIL given that it is in the process of launching a new channel, that would give them much more visibility to take on the likes of Netflix.

2,2019-10-01,Bharti Infratel,"Panic selling in bank and other financial stocks and continued slump in auto sales weighed on market sentiment on Tuesday, which caused the Sensex to dive over 700 points at one point before paring the losses to close 361 points, or 0.94 per cent, down at 38,305. Nifty fell 1 per cent, or 114 points, to end at 11,360. 

Rumours in the market about disruption in online transactions at several banks forced RBI to come out with a clarification to assure panicking public. 

YES Bank shares continued to fall and it was joined by RBL Bank; the first ended with 23 per cent loss while the second shed 9 per cent.

Auto sales continued to contract in September. Barring Maruti, Eicher Motors and M&M, other auto stocks closed in the red. 

""A contraction in core sector and concern over the government plan to stick with its 3.3% fiscal target in spite of huge tax cut raised concern over spending. Investors are not expecting a meaningful recovery this festival season due to continued weakness in auto sales. Volatility in bank stocks and a fall in the rupee triggered profit booking,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. 

Here is a lowdown on key movers and shakers of Tuesday’s session:


YES Bank continues to tankYES Bank continued its downhill journey, as stock crashed 23 per cent on BSE to close at Rs 32. The scrip tumbled after founder Rana Kapoor and associated promoter entities sold a large stake in the bank. YES Capital (India), Morgan Credits Private and Rana Kapoor together sold 552 lakh shares, or 2.16 per cent stake, in the open market during September 26-27.


Mysterious plunge in RBL BankShares of RBL Bank plunged as much as 22 per cent in intraday trade, but recovered at the end to close about 9 per cent down at Rs 800. Vishwavir Ahuja, MD and CEO, RBL Bank, said selling is looking highly speculative and misplaced. Ahuja said the bank continues to grow and remains profitable. ""You will see this in our earnings, which are little over two weeks from now. Nothing has changed fundamentally in the bank,"" he said.


Panic selling in PSU banks Public sector banks also came under pressure after Jefferies warned that bad loans could rise in the banking system. In a note, the global brokerage suggested that there was a divergence between ratings and debt repayment ability of companies. The Nifty PSU Bank index dived about 4 per cent for the day. Bank of Baroda and SBI in the PSU Bank pack are most prone to high risk emanating from defaulting companies, it said.


Little hope from auto sales Auto sales continued to slide in September. M&M’s volume declined 21 per cent, while SML Isuzu (26 per cent), Eicher Motors (30 per cent), Maruti Suzuki (24 per cent) and Ashok Leyland (27 per cent) all report drop in sales. Only Escorts (up 2.2 per cent) and Atul Auto (4 per cent) registered growth in monthly sales. Most of the auto stocks ended in the red. However, M&M, Eicher Motors and Maruti registered gains. Overall, Nifty Auto index dropped 0.4 per cent. 


All sectoral indices in the redAll sectoral indices on NSE ended in the red, with Nifty Realty and Nifty Media indices plunging over 4 per cent. Bank, pharma and metal indices were other big losers. 


Key Sensex moversReliance Industries and bank stocks on the index were the biggest drags on Sensex. RIL dragged Sensex by 85 points, followed by ICICI Bank (55 points), SBI (55 points) and IndusInd Bank (51 points). HDFC twins provided some support, lifting it over 120 points. 


Investors lose Rs 1.85 lakh croreDomestic equity investors lost some Rs 1.85 lakh crore in Tuesday turmoil, as the market-cap of all BSE-listed companies shrank to Rs 145 lakh crore from Rs 147 lakh crore on Monday. 


Spike in volatilityIndia VIX, a measure of volatility in the market, jumped 5 per cent to 16.7. Increased volatility usually means pain for investors, as it is a symbol of instability and the market could move either way very swiftly. 


Over 190 stocks blink ‘sell’ signalsOver 190 stocks crossed below the MACD Signal line on Tuesday. They included SBI, RBL Bank, Bank of Baroda, PNB , Motherson Sumi, Adani Power, Rail Vikas Nigam, Bharti Infratel, etc. The MACD is one of the technical indicators used to spot trends, though it is seldom used as a standalone indicator.


Most active stocksYES Bank and Vodafone Idea were the most traded stocks in terms of trading volume on NSE. They were followed by Indiabulls Housing, SBI and IDFC First Bank. In value terms, Axis Bank, YES Bank, Indiabulls Housing, SBI and HDFC topped the list."
0,2019-10-01,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel plans to raise about $750 million (about Rs 5,300 crore) through the sale of overseas bonds to refinance debt and free up cash to invest in expanding its 4G network, said three people familiar with the matter. The sum may go up to $1billion (Rs 7,000 crore) depending on investor response.

The so-called perpetual bonds are a quasi-equity obligation without a fixed maturity, said one of the persons. The securities, which will be sold to investors across the world, are known as 144A bonds that allow the participation of those in the US as well. “The bonds will carry five-year non-call — that means the debt cannot be repaid before five years,” said the person.

Roadshows for the fundraising plan are set to begin this week. The bonds may be priced in the range of 5.75-6.10 per cent, dealers said.

Networki2i, Airtel’s Mauritius subsidiary, will be the official borrower and is expected to issue the bonds.



About eight large foreign banks including Citi, Standard Chartered, JPMorgan and Barclays will manage the sale, said the people cited above. They could not be contacted immediately for comment.

“The international rates are fairly low right now and it makes sense for the company to ready a war chest whenever it can tap into an opportunity of low-cost funds,” said one of the persons.

Bharti Airtel, which reported a debt of Rs 1.16 lakh crore at the end of June, declined to comment. The stock ended 5.3 per cent higher at Rs 367.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday, in contrast with the drop in the broader market.

The company is trying to strengthen its balance sheet by halving debt by end of this fiscal year, while retaining only its liabilities to the government for spectrum purchased at auction, as ET reported on September 19. This will allow it to compete aggressively for subscribers with Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea.

Gopal Vittal, the telco’s CEO for India and South Asia, has set a target of crossing 35 per cent domestic revenue market share, from 31.4 per cent now, in the next two to three quarters by targeting rivals and expanding its own 4G user base to push up average revenue per user, ET reported on September 30.

“It is an excellent time to raise money overseas because the cost of rates (interest rates) are at the lowest we have seen in the last five years,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president for markets and corporate affairs at brokerage IIFL.

Globally, bonds worth about $17 trillion have a negative yield — investors pay to hold such debt. This has prompted many Indian corporates, including nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs), to tap the offshore credit market. This diversifies borrowing sources and brings down costs, experts said.

Cheaper funds will allow Bharti Airtel to extinguish some of the company’s higher-yielding bonds, releasing cash to invest in expanding the 4G network to meet surging demand for data, Bhasin said.

“Airtel is an AAA-rated company and that means it will be able to raise money from overseas with a lot of ease,” Bhasin said.

The phone company recorded a consolidated net loss of Rs 2,866 crore in the June quarter, dragged down by a one-time expense relating to 3G gear and a sharp increase in finance costs. But its India mobile service continued to show signs of a recovery during the quarter, after a two-year spell of brutal competition. Bharti Airtel recorded a 2.2 per cent sequential hike in quarterly revenue from local mobile services to Rs 10,866.7 crore.

“Bharti Airtel’s balance sheet is more robust than its peers, end of June 19; Vodafone Idea’s net debt to ebidta (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) was 12 times, that of Reliance Jio was six times and that of Bharti Airtel was 3.4 times,” brokerage Goldman Sachs said in a recent note.

Earlier this year, Bharti Airtel raised Rs 25,000 crore via a rights issue and another Rs 7,000 crore through an issue of perpetual bonds. This followed the telco raising Rs12,000 crore by paring its stake in tower unit Bharti Infratel.

The carrier could raise another $3.2 billion (Rs 22,400 crore) by reducing its stake to 13 per cent from about 37 per cent in the entity being formed by the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel. ET reported in May that Airtel and Vodafone Group have been in talks with KKR to dilute their respective holdings in the merged entity, which may be valued at $13-14 billion."

4,2019-10-09,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai: As India Inc heads into the September-quarter earnings, investor focus is on the profitability of telecom companies. Analysts expect government intervention to help boost their cash flows in the next couple of years, although these ‘palliative measures’ may not have any meaningful impact on the intrinsic value of these stocks.

Analysts maintain a ‘buy’ rating on Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries, and a ‘neutral’ rating on Vodafone India and Bharti Infratel.

India mobile revenues for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea could decline quarter-on-quarter given the weak seasonality, although consolidation and the switch by an increasing proportion of customers to bundled plans could minimise the seasonality impact at Bharti Airtel.

In its report on the sector, Credit Suisse has said that mobile pricing came under significant pressure, with Reliance Jio using it as a key tool to gain market share.

“Given that it is still short of its stated objective (50 per cent share), we expect no major improvement in pricing over the next 18 months,” the Credit Suisse report said.

It added that revenue and profitability at Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been under pressure over the past three years, mainly due to intense competition. Credit Suisse said it expects pressure on earnings to continue over the next two years, with Jio looking to gain further market share.



Swiss brokerage house UBS said that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) review of the inter-connection usage charge (IUC) deadline raised expectations that the government could take other measures to support the sector to ensure India remained a three-player market.

“What else can the government do? Interestingly, the TRAI’s announcement to revisit the deadline for zero IUC has restarted market debate on other potential relief measures for the sector,” said UBS.

Analysing the potential impact of government intervention, the UBS report said that measures such as a two-threeyear moratorium on spectrum payments and permission to offset payment for spectrum and other government levies against GST input tax credit could improve cash flows in the first couple of years, although such steps have little meaningful impact on intrinsic value.

It added that steps such as an increase in spectrum payment duration from 16 years to 18 years and reduction in USO (universal service obligation) Fund from 5 per cent to 3 per cent of revenues could have meaningful impact on valuation.

In its Q2 preview, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoFAML) said it expects a seasonal decline at Bharti and Vodafone, while Jio is expected to be partly shielded.

“We expect Bharti and Vodafone Idea to show a QoQ revenue decline, led by normal seasonality coupled with the impact from floods in a few states,” the US brokerage said.

It added that as most of Jio’s subscribers are on unlimited plans, it does not expect Jio to show any seasonality impact.

“For 2Q, we expect Jio/Bharti India cellular to show 4 per cent/-0.4 per cent QoQ revenue growth. For Vodafone, we once again expect a more pronounced weak quarter (vs competition) and model a 3.4 per cent QoQ decline in revenues,” the brokerage said.

It maintained ‘buy’ ratings on Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel on favourable risk-reward, but assigned ‘underperform’ ratings on Vodafone Idea due to consensus estimate downgrades."

YES Bank tanksYES Bank erased almost all gains of Monday’s session and closed 5.3 per cent down to Rs 43.20 after it denied reports of Microsoft in talks of investing in the lender. The lender in a regulatory filing said it was “not aware of the source, which resulted in the news item and as a matter of policy, the bank would not like to comment on such article.”

On Monday, a media report claimed that Microsoft is among three investors, which are in talks for a stake in YES Bank.


IndusInd Bank surges ahead of Q2IndusInd Bank jumped 5.5 per cent on BSE ahead of its September quarter earnings scheduled on Thursday. Brokerages expect IndusInd Bank to register robust growth in September quarter profits, supported by surge in net interest income (NII), loan growth and pre-provisioning operating profit (PPOP). The reduction in corporate tax rate is also positive for the bank.


Bank, financial services rallyOverall, bank and financial services rallied as a pack shrugging off a lull of six days during which Nifty Bank ended in the red in five sessions.

8,2019-10-10,Bharti Infratel,"Bulk of the corporate tax cut benefit will be reflected in FY21, says Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, MOSL. This quarter, tepis results are expected from corporates. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

On earnings seasonWe did a detailed analysis on the overall quarterly expectation and this quarter we are expecting tepid earnings from the corporates. The corporate tax cut that the government has announced will benefit with a lag and we will see the bulk of the benefit coming in FY21, where we have seen a lot of earnings upgrades, not only because of the tax cut, but also the demand revival. 

For this particular quarter, dismal performance will continue in the auto sector. We expect PAT to decline about 37% for the quarter. 

Private banks are something that we will watch out for. That is where the bulk of growth will be coming in. We are expecting a 26% pre-provisioning profit growth and about 9% profit growth. There will be a lot of adjustments on the tax front in the form of DTA as well as the other advance tax that these companies would have paid. But that is one segment where we believe the growth would continue in this quarter. 


On IndusInd Bank results
The numbers are kind of mixed. The headline numbers are definitely in line with expectations but the slippages especially on the corporate side are higher than the overall Street expectation. The commentary on the latest developments with regards to some of the newer corporates which are getting into a stress or a watch list, will be something that will be very keenly awaited..


On telecom We are viewing Jio’s decision to pass on the interconnect charges as a very positive development. We have been expecting some kind of price rise especially led by R Jio in the telecom sector, given the state in which the sector has been for quite some time. Now that Reliance has gained a significant market share, we expect Reliance Jio to start increasing the prices somewhere or the other. 

Some time back, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had postponed the interconnect usage charges, the ICU fee, which was to be brought down to zero from 1st of January, saying that it is still not compatible and implementable. So, that was a big positive and that we believe would lead to R Jio charging the interconnect fees from the end users. Now we have seen historically, a lot of this fees was being paid by Reliance Jio to the other telecom players and it was pinching them. Now, with this incremental charge, it is definitely positive for Bharti as well as Idea. It could provide somewhere about 28 billion of EBITDA increase for bot.

We are already factoring in 5% ARPU increase for both the companies, but we believe this move will definitely be sentimentally positive for the sector. 


On Bharti Airtel
In the overall telecom space, RJio is the top pick, but it is followed by Bharti Airtel. We believe that Bharti is well poised in the current environment mainly because of its potential FCF (free cash flow generation) from FY20 onwards. If you see the overall change in the estimate for this development that has happened, we believe that incrementally this should lead to further increase in ARPU. 

Bharti Airtel has already started the process of monetising some of its Bharti Infratel assets and looking at reducing its debt significantly over the next one or two years.That should be beneficial given the current financial strength vis-à-vis Vodafone Idea, where the financials are weakening by the day.

 We believe, of the three, it is RJio, followed by Bharti Airtel, where pure play telcom can be looked at as a contra play in the current environment.


On auto sectorOur auto universe coverage net profit to decline was almost 37% in this quarter and that too on a weak base. Last year, in the same quarter, PAT was down almost 25% and we see this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit PAT decline. Overall, the EBIDA margins are expected to decline by 270 bps, impacted by weak operating leverage and higher discounts. 

We have seen month on month stability in the auto sales volume numbers. Apart from that, there has been hardly any cheer on ground. The start of the festive season has been decent but we definitely need to see whether it sustains and picks up momentum from here. Till the results are out and the outlook is known, the stocks will remain under pressure given the muted earnings outlook."

YES Bank slides further

Cipla dives & rebounds
Shares of Cipla slipped as much as 5 per cent after brokerage Equirus raised concerns over its Goa unit that received 12 observations from the US drug regulator. However, the stock later rebounded to close about 4.5 per cent higher at Rs 441.

17,2019-10-21,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel reported a 61 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit in the second quarter of FY20, helped by a change in accounting standard which lowered operating costs, and a higher net finance income.

India’s sole listed telecom tower company’s consolidated net profit for the July-September period came in at Rs 964 crore. Net profit was also higher that the Rs 887 crore reported in the June quarter, FY19.

Quarterly consolidated revenue, though, fell 1 per cent YoY to Rs 3,638 crore, the company said in a statement Monday.

The company’s consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortisation (Ebitda) rose 25 per cent YoY to Rs 1,885 crore, which was lower than the Rs 1,953 crore figure posted in the June quarter. Operating free cash flow rose 8 per cent YoY to Rs 1,080 crore, which was lower than the Rs 1,207 crore it clocked in the previous quarter. 

Without the adoption the Ind AS 116 accounting standard, the company’s revenue would be down 3 per cent on year, Ebitda would be lower by 1 per cent and operating free cash flows would have fallen 1 per cent as well, the company said in the statement. 

Essentially, Ind-AS 116 enables companies to recognise leases (towers in this case) as assets in the balance sheet from April 1, 2019, and as such, the relevant lease rentals do not get reflected in the network opex – thus pushing up earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortization (Ebitda) - but as an element of depreciation cost. 

The company’s consolidated expenses for the September quarter fell 19 per cent YoY to Rs 1,752.7 crore. The largest components were power & fuel, which fell 3 per cent, followed by repairs & maintenance expenses that fell 9 per cent. There was no rent paid in the just ended quarter, against a rental expense of Rs 3,168 crore a year back.

But depreciation and amortization costs rose 32 per cent on year to Rs 786.5 crore. Quarterly net finance income rose to Rs 1,251 crore compared with a net finance cost of Rs 442 crore a year back, to support net profit.

“Bharti Infratel has continued on the positive trend in quarterly net additions on both towers and co-locations during the quarter ended September 30, 2019,” Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta, said in a statement.

Co-locations are points where a tower company deploys mobile telecom antennae of multiple carriers on a single structure.

“We continue to believe that there is a strong growth potential in telecom passive infrastructure in the country as telecom networks keep pace with the continuing exponential data consumption growth. Both Bharti Infratel and Indus towers are well poised with their industry-leading scale and strong financial position to partner with mobile operators as they look to intensify their networks,” Gupta added.

Indus Towers, a telecom joint venture between Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, is currently merging with Bharti Infratel, which is a tower unit of telecom major Bharti Airtel.

Bharti Infratel reported 159 net on-quarter additions in co-locations, taking the total count to 1,73,406 as of September-end. The company though lost a whopping 1,106 co-locations on year.

The company’s tower base rose 1,298 YoY and 789 sequentially to 93,421 in the fiscal second quarter.

Bharti Infratel’s tower base includes units by virtue of its 42 per cent stake in Indus Towers."
18,2019-10-21,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: The board of Bharti Infratel Monday said it was not possible to complete its merger with Indus Towers by the deadline of October 24, given the still-required government approvals, throwing the deal which would have created among the world’s largest telecom tower companies into disarray.

The development also puts a cloud on the hopes of Vodafone Idea, its co-parent Vodafone Group of UK and Bharti Airtel – joint owners of Indus Towers – of raising funds by divesting stake in the merged entity, say analysts. Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, currently holding 11.15% in Indus Towers, was banking on an exit at the time of merger to raise over Rs5,500 crore to fund its future network expansion needs to compete against Airtel and Reliance Jio.

The telecom tower company’s stock closed 1.8% higher at Rs 261.80 on BSE on Monday. The announcements came after market hours.

In a release issued on Monday, the board of Bharti Airtel’s telecom unit said it has set up panel of directors to advise by Thursday on the future steps needed to be taken by the tower company to “secure” the interests of its shareholders.

“The scheme contemplated the closing by October 24, 2019 (long stop date), by which time a large number of processes and conditions precedent were required to be completed, which included but were not limited to all requisite Government approvals and filings,” Infratel said.

The merger, proposed well over a year ago to create a company with over 1,63,000 towers, had received a clearance from the Chandigarh bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in early June, and had been awaiting a nod from the Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT) for enhancement of foreign direct investment limit.

“The Board noted that all the requisite Government approvals have not been received till date and conditions precedent and processes not completed. It therefore concluded that it is not possible to complete the scheme by the long stop date,” the company added.

Thus, the board thus authorized a Committee of Directors to explore and evaluate all possible options to secure the best interests of the company and its shareholders under the current facts and circumstances.

“Based on the recommendations received, the Board shall take a suitable decision on the way forward,” it added.

As per the merger terms, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Plc – which currently own 42% each in Indus Towers – were expected to hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively, in the merged entity.

KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board were expected own a combined 6%, stemming from their stake of over 10% in Bharti Infratel.

US-based asset management firm Providence Equity Partners was also likely to join Vodafone Idea in selling stakes in Indus Towers for roughly Rs 2,000 crore.

Separately, Bharti Infratel chief financial officer S Balasubramanian has resigned from Bharti Infratel, which effective December 5, 2019.

23,2019-10-24,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi: The merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel has hit another roadblock just before the deal closure deadline.

Indus Towers shareholders Vodafone Group of the UK and its local unit Vodafone Idea are reluctant to extend the date unless the pricing mechanism is revised to safeguard the cash the Indian telco expects to get on a possible exit after completion of the transaction.

This comes after a 21% drop in Bharti Infratel shares since the deal was announced in April 2018, reducing the amount payable to shareholders that choose to leave the merged entity. Government approvals for the deal were still awaited on Wednesday, the eve of the transaction deadline.

Bharti Infratel, the telecom tower unit of Bharti Airtel and a 42% owner of Indus Towers, is not keen on revisiting the pricing mechanism, people familiar with the matter said.

Vodafone Group and Vodafone Idea, which own 42% and 11.15% in Indus Towers, respectively, are standing their ground, leading to a stalemate.

While Vodafone Plc was to retain its stake in the merged company, Vodafone Idea was to sell its shares.

“The long-stop date for the deal is October 24, 2019. The deal was signed on April 23, 2018. However, some shareholders of Indus Towers are reluctant to extend the date unless the pricing mechanism is revised,” one person directly involved in the deal told ET.

Bharti Infratel, after a board meeting on October 21, said it was not possible to complete its merger with Indus Towers by October 24, given the pending government approvals. The tower company did not extend the date and instead formed a committee to explore and evaluate options to “secure” the interests of its shareholders on or before the next board meeting on October 24.

Bharti Infratel shares declined to Rs 259.40 at the close on the BSE on Wednesday, from Rs 328 on April 23, 2018, eroding its market capitalisation by Rs 12,668 crore.

According to a formula to calculate the cash consideration payable to any partner seeking to exit, Vodafone Idea now stands to get roughly Rs 4,500 crore ($635 million), compared with Rs 6,500 crore, as per the April 2018 announcement.

Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, which faces shrinking revenue, quarterly losses and high debt, was banking on an exit – instead of a roughly 7% stake in the merged entity – at the time of the merger to raise funds to expand its network and compete against Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Assuming Vodafone Idea’s exit, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Plc were expected to hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively, in the merged entity, as per the terms of the deal with part-cash consideration.

Private equity firm Providence, with a 4.85% stake in Indus Towers, would have retained 1.1% in the combined entity after a share swap, if it cashed out its remaining 3.35% stake.

“We have no further comments to offer beyond the statement/disclosure made to the stock exchanges,” a Bharti spokesperson said in an emailed statement to ET. Vodafone Idea and Vodafone Group did not respond to emailed queries till the time of going to press.

Nifty50 remained volatile and traded in a wide range of 150 points for most part of Thursday’s session. It formed a Bearish Candle on the daily scale, as selling emerged at higher levels and the index drifted towards the 11,535 mark before closing with a marginal loss of 20 points.

The index has been moving between 11,530 and 11,700 levels for past four sessions and now needs to hold the support to attempt the upper band of the trading range towards 11,700 level, while a decisive hold below 11,550 level could negate the current short-term bullish setup and Nifty may head towards its downside support in the 11,480 – 11,450 zone.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,700 strikes. There was Call writing at 12,000 and 11,700 levels, while Put writing was seen at 11,500 and then 11,400 levels. Options data suggested a trading range between 11,500 and 11,800 levels.

India VIX fell marginally by 1.81 per cent to 16.24 level.

Bank Nifty failed to hold its gains at higher levels and drifted sharply towards the 29,000 mark as selling emerged in the latter part of the session. The index formed a Bearish Candle on the daily scale and relatively underperformed Nifty. Now it has to hold and sustain above 29,200 level to witness a bounce towards 29,500 and then 29,700 levels, while a hold below the same could drift it towards 28,800 and then 28,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed flat at 11,614 level. Long buildup was seen in Torrent Pharma, PVR, Tata Elxsi, Mannapuram Finance and IndiGo while shorts were seen in Bharti Infratel, SBI, Hexaware, Cummins and IndusInd Bank.

Vodafone Idea, facing a demand of more than Rs 39,000 crore as per Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT’s) court filings, will be the worst affected following the Supreme Court order as it copes with falling revenue, shrinking user base and quarterly losses of nearly Rs 5,000 crore combined with a debt of more than Rs 99,000 crore, analysts said. 

The telco is considering filing a review petition. In comparison, rival Bharti Airtel’s shares saw a marginal drop of 0.40 per cent to Rs 370.95.

The possibility that the debt laden operator will get lesser cash on exiting Indus Towers, post the latter’s merger with Bharti Infratel put further pressure on the stock. 

Early Friday, tower firm-Bharti Infratel extended the deadline to complete the merger with Indus Towers by 60 days to December 24, but said that dilution of shares by existing holders will be lesser than earlier announced, thus also lowering the cash to be paid to Vodafone Idea on the telco’s possible exit from the merged entity.

The index has been stuck between 11,500 and 11,700 levels for last five sessions and now needs to hold its support to aim for the upper band of the trading range at 11,700, while a decisive hold below 11,550 can negate the current short-term bullish setup and take Nifty to its downside support in the 11,480 – 11,450 zone.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,700 levels. There was Call writing at 11,600 and then 11,550 levels, while Put writing was seen at 11,500 and then 11,550 level. Options data suggested a trading range between 11,450 and 11,750 levels.

India VIX fell 5.70% to 15.31.

Bank Nifty remained volatile and traded in a broad range of 500 points for most part of the session. It formed a Hammer pattern on daily scale, as dips got bought into while a long-legged Doji on the weekly scale suggested a tug of war between the bulls and the bears.

The index is finding multiple supports near 28,800 mark, while supply pressure remained intact at higher levels. Nifty has to hold above 29,200 to witness a bounce towards 29,700 level, while a hold below the same level may make it drift towards 29,000 and then 28,800 levels.

Nifty futures closed flat at 11,604 level. There was long buildup in Star, Glenmark, UBL, Sun TV and Cipla while shorts were seen in Cummins, Torrent Power, Bharti Infratel, GAIL and Marico.

34,2019-10-25,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ruled that adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for telcos should include all revenue accrued to carriers, including that from noncore activities, backing the telecom department’s stance in a 16-year-old case. But it left the authorities in a bind over how to recover more than Rs 1.3 lakh crore in dues, penalties and interest from a sector already under financial stress without causing further damage.

“The government is in a fix and the problems are plenty. If we go ahead and demand the AGR dues, most will not be able to pay,” a senior government official told ET, asking not to be named. “If we increase the payment period, then it will increase the interest and penalties.”

Of the 15 companies that had been served demands for licence fees worth a total of more than Rs 92,000 crore and spectrum usage charges (SUC) of a combined Rs 41,000 crore, only three — Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio — are operating. The rest have either exited or are undergoing bankruptcy proceedings such as Aircel and Reliance Communications.

Licence fees and SUC are both calculated on the basis of AGR.

Vodafone Idea, facing a demand of more than Rs 39,000 crore as per Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT’s) court filings, will be the worst affected as it copes with falling revenue, a shrinking user base and quarterly losses of nearly Rs 5,000 crore combined with debt of more than Rs 99,000 crore, analysts said. Shares plunged to a 52-week low before closing 23.4% down at Rs 4.33 on the BSE Thursday.

Vodafone Idea said in a release that it’s considering filing a review petition.

Bharti Airtel, which faces demands of more than Rs 41,000 crore in licence fees and SUC, fell nearly 10% soon after the news, but recovered to end 3.3% higher at Rs 372.45, on hopes of revenue market share gains due to a weaker Vodafone Idea, said experts. Tata Teleservices, which has sold its consumer mobility business to Bharti Airtel, owes the government about Rs 12,907 crore in licence fees and spectrum usage charges, as per DoT.



By some industry estimates, the liability for Vodafone Idea could be even higher at Rs 58,000 crore and for Bharti Airtel at Rs 43,000 crore, including licence fee, penalties, interest, compounded interest and SUC.

The official cited above said that the government itself has admitted that the sector is under stress with debt of more than Rs 7 lakh crore and a 25% fall in AGR in the two years to March 31. “Operators have asked for some relief and we are working on that but now the problem is much bigger,” he said.

The government will have to take quick action, otherwise “one of the telcos” will be in serious distress, which may further change the industry structure, the official added, without naming the operator.

The top court in a 153-page order ruled in favour of the DoT in the case that dates from 2003, saying that all revenue accruing to telecom operators, including those from handset sales, rent, dividends, interest income, profit from sale of scrap, termination fees and roaming charges, would also be included in AGR. However, gains from the sale of capital assets and insurance claims by telecom companies will not be a part of it. Telcos had argued that only revenue derived from licensed services should be considered part of AGR.

“In the instant case, the demand had been raised by the licensor, and after that, untenable objections have been raised which had no foundational basis, and the licensees have taken inconsistent stands,” ruled a bench led by Justice Arun Mishra, dismissing the objections of the mobile phone companies. The other members of the bench were justices AA Nazeer and MR Shah.

“The conduct of the licensees was highly unfair, and anyhow and somehow, they had attempted to delay the payment,” the bench observed.

Operators have thus far calculated AGR on the basis of a telecom tribunal judgement in 2015, which includes some noncore elements. Accordingly, operators had paid up only what they estimated was due as licence fees and spectrum charges, but DoT continued to demand the remainder.

Soon after the order, officials at the department scrambled to discuss the way forward and how to soften the blow, with more meetings to be held over the next few days. They expect representations from operators to follow soon, said government officials aware of the development.

Bharti Airtel said it was “disappointed” by the verdict, which will “further weaken the viability of the sector as a whole.” Vodafone Idea said that the order had “damaging implications” for the industry. The telco said it will study the legal possibilities, which include a “review application.”

“The question that arises is whether this is the financial straw that finally breaks the back of operators,” Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) director general Rajan Mathews said. COAI is an industry body that represents private operators.

Meetings in the telecom department will also have to consider the viability of spectrum auctions and when they can be held in light of the verdict. “How can spectrum auctions happen in the next few months when operators are in no position to pay after the ruling?” said one of the officials cited above. “What complicates matters is that some of the airwaves are expiring by FY21.”

Telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had recently said that spectrum auctions will be conducted within this financial year.

Analysts projected a grim outlook.

“Telecom sector is under immense financial stress admitted by all stakeholders. Further demand of Rs 92,000 crore (in licence fees) will dampen the sentiment of telecom operators and raising funds for broadband, network expansion and Digital India will hit a significant roadblock,” said Prashant Singhal, emerging markets, technology, media and telecom leader, EY.

He added that the impact will not be limited to just telecom operators but will have a domino effect on the larger digital value chain. “This requires immediate intervention by all stakeholders to get the sector back in shape.”

Tower firm Bharti Infratel fell 8.5% to end at Rs 237.45 on fears that its tenancies will be hurt due to the weaker finances of its main tenants – Vodafone Idea and Airtel. The stock was also hit by the uncertainty over its merger with Indus Towers.

Lenders such as Yes Bank, State Bank of India, Union Bank, Bank of India and IndusInd Bank also fell on fears of the effect the verdict may have on the debt repayment capability of companies such as Vodafone Idea, said analysts. According to the Reserve Bank of India, banks’ exposure to the telecom sector amounted to Rs 90,600 crore as of November 2018."

50,2019-10-26,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Infratel extended the deadline to complete its merger with Indus Towers by 60 days to December 24 and said stake dilution by the existing shareholders would be less than announced earlier, thus also reducing the cash payable to Vodafone Idea should the telco decide to exit the merged entity.

The dilution of stake by the shareholders is expected to be lower based on the company’s net debt at the end of September and “agreed closing adjustments,” the company said in a filing on Friday, a day after its board met.

This is “on account of lesser number of shares to be issued against swap of Indus shares vis-a-vis the illustrative shareholdings disclosed in the original transaction announcement,” the listed tower unit of Bharti Airtel said.

The company’s debt position has progressively worsened since the merger announced in April 2018. Net debt with lease liabilities for Bharti Infratel was Rs 5,249 crore at September end compared with Rs 4,995 crore at June end.

“These would also result in lower cash payments to Vodafone Idea Ltd. vis-a-vis the illustrative amounts disclosed earlier,” the company said.

Bharti Infratel said there was no certainty that the merger would close within the extended time because it depended on government approvals and the fulfilment of other conditions.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group each own 42% in Indus Tower, while Vodafone Idea holds 11.15% and private equity firm Providence has 4.85%. Assuming Vodafone Idea’s exit, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone were expected to hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively, in the merged entity, as per the terms of the deal announced in April 2018.

Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea was banking on an exit at the time of merger – instead of taking a roughly 7% stake in the merged entity – to raise funds to expand its network and compete against Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm.

ET reported on Thursday that an over 21% drop in Bharti Infratel shares since the deal was announced had reduced the amount payable to shareholders seeking to exit the merged entity. Vodafone Group of the UK and its local unit Vodafone Idea were reluctant to extend the date for the merger unless the pricing mechanism was revised to safeguard the cash the Indian telco would get."
51,2019-10-26,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi: Telecom equipment makers such as Europe’s Ericsson and Nokia, and China-based Huawei could be staring at a significant impact in India, with the Supreme Court's ruling on adjusted gross revenue likely to force their main clients, Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) and Bharti Airtel, to curtail capex plans, say analysts.

With the balance sheets of the two telcos likely to be further weakened, existing tenancies and future growth of telecom tower companies like Bharti Infratel could be at risk as well, they said.

Rajiv Sharma, the head of research at SBICap Securities, said all vendors would be affected except Samsung (the Korean company sells equipment only to Reliance Jio Infocomm in India, and the country’s newest telecom operator isn’t affected by the judgement) because telcos’ capital expenditure plan would take a back seat.

“A sharp cut in the capex deployments over the next 12-18 months at the least is expected, and it could be prolonged. VIL will find it hard to do meaningful capex if they were to pay, and Airtel will also be selective,” Sharma added.

Rohan Dhamija, a partner at Analysys Mason, however, said the impact on Chinese vendors, Huawei and ZTE, would be lesser than their European rivals because their relaxed payment terms for VIL.

“Secondly, their play in 5G (where much of the new investments are expected) was already supposed to be low because of the security issues. Nokia and Ericsson will see the maximum impact in the mid-to-long term,” Dhamija added.

Mahesh Uppal, a director at telecom consultancy firm Comfirst, said equipment vendors, especially the bigger ones, would face a Catch-22 situation.

“They will neither be in a position to stop supplies (anticipating payment issues) nor in a position to continue to do so (if they stop paying). Telecom equipment is not a mass-market as it has limited buyers in India. The impact on such players is going to be much bigger,” he added.

Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei and ZTE didn't respond to ET's queries.

Top executives from Nokia, Ericsson, and Huawei, in separate interviews to ET, recently expressed concern over the industry's financial stress. They had pinned their hopes on the upcoming 5G auction and future 4G expansion plans, which are now uncertain due to the Supreme Court judgement of Thursday.

The apex court backed the government’s broader definition of AGR to include most non-core revenue, leaving Airtel and Vodafone Idea facing the telecom department’s claims worth a combined Rs80,000 crore in licence fee and spectrum usage charge dues.

“5G will be delayed and is a far cry. 5G auction is kind of pushed off by two years because you can't have an auction with just one player,” Sharma said. Dhamija seconded his views, saying that telcos would not have money to buy new airwaves.

VIL is the worst off, given its existing weak financial condition, falling revenue, quarterly losses of around Rs5,000 crore and high debt of more than Rs99,000 crore, say analysts, adding that the telco’s network expansion and integration plan would take a hit.

“The recent ruling could not only affect the future tenancy additions (of Bharti Infratel) but also impinge on existing tenancies (especially of Vodafone Idea),” Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Infratel has had around 47,000 net tenancy deletions over the last two years, largely driven by network rationalisation by VIL since the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular to cut costs, along with lower additions from Jio as it setup its own tower capacity.

Sharma said Infratel would be impacted as tenancies would likely go further down. “VIL is already bringing down its tenancies,” he added."
52,2019-10-27,Bharti Infratel,"Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty lost more than half a per cent during the week ended October 25 as the market witnessed some selling pressure, mainly due to weakness on the IT counter amid mixed earnings and the Infosys whistleblower crisis.

Tata Motors was the biggest gainer, rising 41 per cent, while its DVR followed with 38 per cent gains.

Tata Motors last week delivered better-than-expected numbers for September quarter, sending the stock soaring. Kotak Institutional Equities raised fair value of the stock to Rs 200 from Rs 190, retaining a ‘buy’ recommendation. CLSA upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ after almost three years of 'sell' rating. The brokerage raised its target to Rs 190 from Rs 120.

Among other automakers, Eicher Motors (up 26 per cent), Maruti Suzuki (up 10 per cent) and Motherson Sumi Systems (up 12 per cent) were other major gainers. Hero MotoCorps was the only loser in the series, sliding 2.8 per cent.



“After the gloom-doom scenario, recovery started as credit supply came back in the system. Sales recovery is getting visible. A large part of the problem was credit supply,” said Vikas Khemani, Founder of Carnelian Capital Advisors. He is positive on auto stocks for the short term.

AK Prabhakar, Head of Research at IDBI Capital, however, doesn’t attach much importance to this rally. “The auto sector is not something I am gung-ho about. After five years of rally, auto started to correct. So it will have some recovery here and there, but I will not attach much importance to it at this point. The rally is done. So, the upside is limited. I will not buy auto at current levels, but I will not sell either,” he said.

Nifty Auto index rallied 10 per cent in the October series. In comparison, Nifty edged merely 2.35 per cent and 30-share Sensex added 2.72 per cent.

“October series has by far seen some 3-odd percentage gains. If we add September gains, we are already up around 9-odd per cent in last two months. In November, we expect the market to consolidate. It is less likely to show any runaway move. We will see the market trade with some positive bias, but broadly speaking, it is more likely to consolidate in a broad range,” said Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services.

Vaishnav expects auto stocks to be resilient going forward. “They may not move as sharply as they did in October series, but we will still see some relative outperformance,” he said.

Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak Securities, feels the market will consolidate going ahead. “Nifty remains in a structural uptrend and is expected to test 12,200-12,300 levels in the next few weeks. Since we witnessed a rally in the recent past, some consolidation is expected in the 11,650-11,950 range. Accumulation on dips is advisable, as we await the next momentum trade to get triggered. Metals and select banking stocks traded with a positive bias. Selective buying is advised in the midcap space,” he said.

As many as 98 stocks that trade in the F&O segment gained in October series. Apart from Tata Motors, Adani Enterprises (up 28 per cent), NMDC (22 per cent), GMR Infra (21.5 per cent) and Tata Elxsi (20 per cent) were among 29 F&O stocks that gained in double digits in October series.

Among the biggest losers were Century Textiles (down 55 per cent), Dish TV (49 per cent), Indiabulls Housing (48 per cent), Bharti Infratel (29 per cent) and Vodafone Idea (27 per cent). In total, 61 F&O stocks are on course to end the October series in the red.

Interestingly, a number of private bank stocks have given negative returns, with RBL Bank and IndusInd Bank down 25 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. Federal Bank (down 12 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (down 3 per cent) were also among losers. YES Bank, on the other hand, was the biggest gainer among F&O banking stocks, up 11 per cent. Nifty Bank was flat during the period.

Khemani said subdued performance from select banks was due to bank-specific issues. He said there were some short-term trade in PSU banks, but otherwise he prefers private banks.

75,2019-10-31,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: Troubles for two of India's telecom giants -- Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea -- are getting acute each day with the latest whammy coming in the form of ratings downgrades.

Fitch Ratings on Wednesday put Bharti Airtel 'rating watch negative' list while Care Ratings downgraded Vodafone Idea on ‘long-term bank facilities’ and non-convertible debentures.

Vodafone Idea said on Wednesday that Care Ratings has downgraded its rating on 'long-term bank facilities' and non-convertible debentures', citing the recent court ruling on the AGR issue and extension of timelines with regard to sale of Indus Tower stake to Bharti lnfratel.

Fitch Ratings put Bharti Airtel on 'rating watch negative' over unpaid regulatory dues arising from a recent Supreme Court ruling.

Fitch placed Bharti's 'BBB-' Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).

Shares of Bharti Airtel slipped 0.75 per cent to trade at Rs 365.50 in early trade on Thursday, while the BSE Telecom index fell 8.73 per cent to 878.48 at around 9.35 am (IST). Vodafone-Idea was down 7 per cent at Rs 3.54.

The benchmark BSE Sensex was trading 193 points or 0.48 per cent, higher at 40,245.

The Supreme Court, last week, upheld government’s way of computing the telecom revenue, from which dues like licence fee and spectrum usage charges are derived, and as a result Vodafone-Idea, Bharti Airtel and other telecom operators may have to pay the government a whopping Rs 1.4 lakh crore after including penalty and interest components.

Vodafone Idea may have to pay about Rs 40,000 crore, while Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around Rs 42,000 crore (including licence fees and spectrum usage charges), PTI reported referring the telecom department’s initial calculations.

Following this development, Airtel on Tuesday deferred its September quarter result announcement till November 14. The company was earlier scheduled to approve and release its Q2 numbers on Tuesday.

“...the management of the company recommended to the board of directors that the agenda item related to the approval of audited financial results for the second quarter and half year ended September 30, 2019... be deferred till November 14, 2019, on account of the fact that more clarity is needed on the AGR matter arising out of recent judgement of... the Supreme Court,” Airtel said in a regulatory filing.

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP, IIFL Securities said, ""Telecom stocks are a mixed bag with pricing power coming back. Jio and Bharti Airtel are going to be benefitting. However, the AGR penalty means extra outlay and debt burden will be high. We think the government will give some recourse to that.""

Commenting on the Supreme Court order, Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers in an interaction with ETNOW said that as far as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone are concerned, they have not factored in the provisions part in the books. The amount of money that is required to be put in is going to quite stress their books significantly.

“Besides, the entire space is moving in the direction of 5G. And to have more funds in 5G related network rollout, it is going to be a bigger challenge. As a result, companies like Jio would be relatively better placed in the process. It is not good news for these telcos as far as the Supreme Court ruling is concerned. We will have to see how they mobilise funds in the next three months in which the court has asked them to put in money with the government,” Choksey added.

Other telecom players including GTL Infra, Bharti Infratel and ITI were down between 1-3 per cent. On the other hand, MTNL, Reliance Comm, HFCL were up between 2-5 per cent."

0,2019-11-01,Bharti Infratel,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm has asked telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to reject demands to grant relief to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on payment of statutory fees based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), saying its two rivals have the capacity to meet their financial obligations.

However, the Mukesh Ambani-led telco urged the government to consider “other industry issues of prospective rationalisation of levies and taxes and GST credit separately.”

Jio said in a letter dated October 31 that Prasad should not permit the Cellular Operators Association of India to mix the investment-infusing financial package for the telecom industry with the legitimate licence fee and spectrum usage charge obligations arising out of the past conduct of Airtel and Vodafone Idea.

In its second letter in as many days on the topic, Jio said the tone of a COAI letter to Prasad dated October 29 was “threatening and blackmailing” and “borders on contempt of the recent apex court AGR judgement” directing operators to clear their dues in three months.

“We request the government to reject COAI’s demand for financial relief… all operators should be mandated to deposit the applicable amounts within three months,” Jio said.

It said Airtel and Vodafone Idea have “sufficient financial capacity and enough monetisation possibilities to comfortably pay the government dues”.

Granting any such relief package, which prima facie appears to mitigate perceived financial strains, is likely to raise similar demands from other sectors such as aviation, Jio said.

“There is no constraint of making funds available to pay off their legal obligations,” Jio wrote.

It said both its competitors have stakes in profitable ventures in the country and abroad and have divested assets in profitable tower ventures such as Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel. The operators also have principals with sound financial positions.

The Supreme Court last week upheld the government’s definition of AGR to include revenue from the non-core activities of telcos. Consequently, Vodafone Idea and Airtel may need to cough up over Rs 80,000 crore in licence fees and SUC, with penalties and interest.

COAI has said without relief such as a waiver on payment of penalties and interest, the two telcos could face an unprecedented crisis that could result in a monopoly in the sector already saddled with debt of over Rs 7 lakh crore.

A panel of ministry secretaries has been asked to suggest measures to grant relief to the sector."

44,2019-11-09,Bharti Infratel,"New Delhi: Vodafone Idea Ltd on Friday said Brickwork Ratings has downgraded the firm's rating on non-convertible debentures (NCDs) citing recent court ruling on adjusted gross revenue and extension of timeline with regard to the sale of stake in Indus Tower to Bharti Infratel.

The rating agency has downgraded Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) from 'A+' (with negative outlook) to 'A-' rating, which says ""watch with negative implications"".

""It is hereby informed that Brickwork Ratings has downgraded its rating on non-convertible debentures as per the rating rationale uploaded on its website today (Friday),"" VIL said in a regulatory filing.

Last month, VIL had faced a similar downgrade from Care Rating on its long-term bank facilities and NCDs.

Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom operators may have to pay the government a whopping Rs 1.4 lakh crore following the recent Supreme Court order that sent shock waves through an industry already grappling with billions of dollars in debt and an intense tariff war to retain customers.

The Supreme Court, last month, upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

According to the telecom department's calculations, Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around Rs 42,000 crore after including licence fees and spectrum usage charges, while Vodafone Idea may have to pay about Rs 40,000 crore. Jio may have to pay around Rs 14 crore."

It is going to be a U-shaped recovery for the midcaps. They tend to do well when GDP growth surprises and we will see GDP recovery going forward. As the recovery gets a bit broad-based, we will definitely see midcaps outperforming the largecaps over the next two to three years.”"

51,2019-11-13,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: As benchmark equity indices struggled to get past their immediate resistance levels, dozens of stocks are showing loss of momentum, suggests moving average convergence divergence or MACD.

The momentum indicator formed a bearish crossover on 88 counters on NSE, hinting at possible downsides in the days ahead. Strong trading volumes on many of these counters are lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Tata Power, Equitas Holdings, TV 18 Broadcast, Castrol India, Shriram Transport, Balkrishna Industries, Godrej Properties, The New India Assurance Company, Pidilite Industries, GSFC and PTC India Financial, among others.






The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data also showed bullish trends on 26 counters. They included SCI, Bharti Infratel, HDFC Bank, Amara Raja Batteries, Symphony, Lyka Labs, Star Paper Mills and Asian Hotels (West).



Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

As for Nifty50, the index appears to be respecting its near-term support at 11,850 level, as any selling around this level is being bought into.

“In case the index manages a sustainable trade above 11,932 on Wednesday, the strength may get extended up to 12,034 level. Supports are visible in the 11,850-11,833 range. A breach of the 11,833 level on a closing basis shall accelerate the selling pressure further,” he said. 

The market trend is becoming uncertain, and uncertainties never help traders, said Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities. “Unless Nifty crosses the 12,035 level, traders may remain cautious,” he said.


Understanding MACD
 A close look at the stock chart of Tata Power shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has shown a downward momentum and vice versa. On Monday, the scrip fell 3.70 per cent lower at Rs 57.30 on NSE."

71,2019-11-15,Bharti Infratel,"NE DELHI: A day after it posted a staggering Rs 50,921 crore loss for the September quarter, Vodafone Idea on Friday said it believes the government is aware of the ""tremendous stress"" being faced by telcos and wants a healthy sector with three private and one public operator. In a post-earnings investor call, Vodafone Idea CEO Ravinder Takkar said the company has been engaging ""very positively"" with the government and that its discussions on telecom stress began even before the AGR ruling was pronounced by the Supreme Court. 

 ""In our engagements...the response of the government has been very consistent. They said they want this sector to be healthy, it is a very strategic sector, too important for the country, too important for Digital India vision...Secondly, they have said to us that they want to see three private players and one public sector player in this sector,"" Takkar said. 

 The company believes the Centre is looking at a ""comprehensive solution"" for the sector with an aim to restore the industry's health, he said. 

 ""We hope to hear something from them very soon,"" he added. 

 On a specific question on minimum tariff fixation, Takkar said he did not wish to speculate on how floor price mechanism can be implemented. 

 ""We know it is in the purview of the regulator and government and it can be implemented...We know it has been done in certain other countries in the region, but I don't want to speculate on what they would implement or how they would implement,"" he said. 

 Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) plans to monetise its 11.15 per cent stake in Indus Towers on completion of the Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel merger, and is also exploring options to monetise nearly 160,000 kms of intra-city and inter-city fibre as well as data centre. 

 Akshaya Moondra, chief financial officer of VIL, said the company continues to remain engaged with its financial creditors but asserted that there is no acceleration of payment which has happened. 

 ""From time to time, some banks have requested us if we could pre-pay them any amount...we have declined that. We continue to remain engaged with all our financial creditors but there is no acceleration of payment that has happened,"" he said. 

 On vendor finance, Moondra said the company has strong vendor partners and that ""they are already supporting us through vendor financing route"". 

 Vodafone Idea on Thursday reported a consolidated loss of Rs 50,921 crore -- the highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate -- for the September quarter on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court's order in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case. 

 The Supreme Court, last month, ruled in favour of the government and directed telecom companies, including Vodafone Idea, to pay dues as demanded by the Department of Telecom. 

 Vodafone Idea has said its ability to continue business will depend on relief sought from the government and positive outcome of the legal option it has (filing of a review petition). 

 It said the company, through the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), has made representations to the government to provide relief to the telecom sector. 

 This includes request to not press for the AGR liability payment and grant waivers, not levying spectrum usage charges (SUC) on non-licenced revenue, reduction of licence fee and SUC rates and use of GST credit for payment of government levies. 

 The industry body has requested the government to allow payment to be made in installments after some moratorium, and grant a moratorium of two years for the payment of spectrum dues beyond April 1, 2020 up to March 31, 2022."
70,2019-11-15,Bharti Infratel,"Vodafone Idea does not see any conflict between the government providing adjusted gross revenue-specific relief to the telcos and the Supreme Court order, managing director Ravinder Takkar said.

Providing relief from this (SC) judgement, he said, is “very much in the hands of the government as they are winners of this (AGR) case”, adding that given “the stress and criticality of the sector, Vodafone Idea “does not see any conflict in the government being able to act in the overall interest of the economy and consumers”.

Takkar’s comments came on a Voda Idea earnings call Friday, a day after the beleaguered telco reported an unprecedented net loss of Rs 50,921.9 crore, weighed down by provisions for statutory liabilities following the top court’s recent AGR ruling.

Vodafone Idea, he said, had multiple available legal remedies, in that, it would shortly file a review petition, and, if required, also “a curative petition before a 5-judge Supreme Court bench, which can be different” from the one that delivered the October 24 judgement.

Takkar said the telco is also exploring ways to monetise “its data centre assets and 1,60,000 kms of intra/inter-city fibre to gain financial flexibility” amid the delay in its the Indus-Bharti Infratel merger closure, which has also held up monetisation of Voda Idea’s 11.15% stake in Indus.

The Voda Idea CEO is hopeful that the government may extend AGR-specific relief “on the (quantum) of interest, penalties and interest on penalties as well as the principal amount after adjustment for errors,” adding that “a payment plan spread over a larger period of time would be very helpful”.

Voda Idea’s recent discussions, he said, suggest the government is taking these requests “very seriously,” and is looking at “a comprehensive solution very shortly” for the industry that it views as “strategic and too important” for India. He also expected the panel of secretaries - exploring relief measures for the ailing sector - to come up with positive recommendations shortly. 

The government, Takkar said, wants the telecom sector to be healthy, and is keen on a market comprising three private players and one public sector operator. 

Voda Idea is also hopeful that the government will also help in freeing up a whopping Rs 7,000 crore of blocked GST input credits for the company.

Takkar’s comments came a day after both Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel raised doubts over their ability to continue as going concerns while posting massive losses for the July-September quarter.

Vodafone Idea is also hopeful that the government and the telecom regulator will address the issue of predatory pricing that is causing financial stress, and consider a floor price for voice tariffs for helping the ailing sector.

“Our discussions with the government suggest the regulator may start a review of floor pricing…there are significant opportunities to reduce the predatory pricing position that we have been in for several years, which has impacted not just us (VIL), but the overall industry,” the Voda Idea MD said.

Takkar said Reliance Jio’s recent decision to recover interconnect charges for voice calls to other networks had reduced “the number of port-outs from Vodafone Idea to Jio”.

Vodafone Idea’s leadership said the company’s recently launched Rs 45 prepaid all-rounder tariff pack is seeing decent market traction among 2G device users while its recently launched RedX postpaid plan, priced at Rs 999 and offering 50% higher speeds, has received strong response from high-ARPU customers.

The company expects to conclude its ongoing network integration exercise by March 2020 - having already consolidated 78% of the 681 districts.

Takkar also reiterated that Voda Idea has “no intentions” of exiting any service areas to improve financial health."

Sensex ended the day 70.21 points higher at 40,356, down 300 points from the day’s high. NSE barometer Nifty was up 23.20 points at 11,895. 

“The Supreme Court judgment would smoothen the process of recovery and such type of clarity from lawmakers would help banks do their business (lending and borrowing) more aggressively in the long run. It seems long-term investors and contra investors have taken strong ‘buy’ call on all telecom companies after they made heavy provisions in Q2 for spectrum usage charges and towards licence fees. Technically, the market is consolidating and as long as it does not cross the 12,050 level, it would exhibit mixed trend,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Senior Vice-President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities.

PSU banks also continued their surge as Oriental Bank of Commerce soared 20 per cent. Other public sector banks also followed, rising 2-13 per cent. PSU Bank index was the biggest sectoral gainer on NSE, up 4 per cent. 

BSE flagship Sensex added 185 points to 40,469.70 thanks to gains in select companies. NSE barometer Nifty advanced 56 points to end at 11,940.10.

“Market turned positive due to buoyancy from telecom stocks supported by tariff hike plans. Positive vibes also witnessed in PSU banks having exposure to distressed assets. Gains in pharma, energy and infra stocks pushed markets higher while losses in auto, metals and consumer stocks limited the gain. Fear of downgrade in FY20 earnings due to slow pace in consumption demand and industrial growth may consolidate the market in the near term,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.


Here is a lowdown of the movers and shakers of Tuesday’s session on Dalal Street:


Telecom stocks rallyVodafone Idea soared 34.68 per cent on BSE to Rs 6.02 after it said it will raise tariffs from December 1. The stock has doubled in just three sessions after it reported record losses for the September quarter.

Bharti Airtel also gained 7.36 per cent on BSE to Rs 439.25. The company will also increase tariffs from December 1. The stock was the biggest gainer on 30-share Sensex.

Bharti Infratel followed these two and gained 10.96 per cent to Rs 251.65 on NSE. 


RIL at record highReliance Industries hit its all-time high of Rs 1,514.95 on Tuesday. The scrip closed at Rs 1,509.80. During the day, RIL also crossed the Rs 9.5 lakh crore in market capitalisation, the first Indian company to achieve the feat. 


Diamonds sold!Rana Kapoor sold remaining 0.8 per cent stake in YES Bank, keeping a token 900 shares he once famously said were his “diamonds”. The scrip fell 2.66 per cent to Rs 64.15 on BSE.


BofAML downgrades NBCCShares of state-owned construction company NBCC fell 2.89 per cent to Rs 36.90 after Bank of America Merryl Lynch (BofAML) downgraded the stock and cut target price. BofAML cut ratings on NBCC to ‘underperform’ from ‘buy’. It also reduced the target price to Rs 33 from Rs 47.


SBI Life tanksShares of SBI Life dived 6.33 per cent to Rs 936.25 on BSE after Carlyle Group sold part of its stake in the company via block deals.

Nifty on Tuesday managed to hold Monday’s low and gradually extended its gains towards the 11,960 mark. On daily chart, the index formed a small green-bodied candle with a lower shadow, as we saw buying interest from lower levels.

However, it continued to move in a broader trading band between 11,785 and 12,034 level since past 14 sessions and requires a decisive range breakout on either side to commence the next leg of rally. Till the time Nifty holds above 11,850 level, we maintain a positive stance on the market for an upward movement towards the 12,000 -12,050 zone. On the flipside, support remains intact at 11,850 and then 11,780 levels.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,800 followed by 11,900 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200. Some Put writing was seen at 11,900 and 11,800 levels while Call writers exited some of their short positions at 12,000. Options data suggested a broader trading range between 11,800 and 12,200 levels.

India VIX fell 2.20 per cent to 15.41 level. It needs to hold below 15 level to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty opened on a flat note and managed to hold above previous day’s low. It continued to make higher highs as the day progressed and eventually concluded the session a tad above the 31,200 mark. The banking index continued to outperform the benchmark indices and formed a green-body candle on the daily scale.

Bank Nifty sustained above its crucial hurdle at 31,200 mark; and thus we may see continuation of the ongoing optimism towards 31,500 and then 31,800 levels; while 30,800 and 30,400 levels remain key supports for the index.

Nifty futures closed positive at 11,985 level with a gain of 0.54 per cent. There was long buildup in Tata Elxsi, Bharti Infratel, Canara Bank, Bharti Airtel and Castrol while shorts were seen in CESC , ZEEL, Hero Moto, Muthoot Finance and Torrent Pharma.

Nifty50 opened positive on Wednesday on the back of a gap-up opening in selective index heavyweights. The index extended the gains towards the 12,038 mark. However, it failed to sustain at higher levels and closed a tad below the 12,000 mark. 

The index formed a Doji candle on the daily scale, which indicated indecisiveness at higher levels. But it managed to hold above the previous day’s high throughout the session and formed higher highs and lows for the second consecutive session.

Support for Nifty is now inching higher towards the 11,900 and then 11,850 levels; while the immediate hurdle remains intact in the 12,100 – 12,150 zone.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at strike price 11,900 followed by 11,800, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200. There was some Put writing at 12,000 and 11,900 levels, while marginal Call writing was seen in the 12,100 – 12,200 zone, followed by unwinding of Call options at strike price 11,900. Options data suggested a broader trading range between 11,800 and 12,200 levels.

India VIX fell 1.62 per cent to 15.16 mark. It needs to hold below 15 level to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty managed to hold above 31,200 level throughout the session and formed a Small Green-bodied candle on the daily scale. It continued to trade between 31,200 and 31,500 levels, but ended with a marginal gain of 100 points.

The index has been forming higher highs and lows for past four sessions and till it holds above 31,200 mark, it could extend the gains towards 31,500 and then 31,750 levels, while on the downside supports are seen at 31,000 and then 30,800 levels.

Nifty futures closed positive at 12,014 level with 0.38 per cent gain. Long buildup was seen in Sun Pharma, NCC, RBL Bank, BPCL and Cadila Healthcare while shorts were seen in Bharti Infratel, Siemens, IOC, Oil India and Muthoot Finance.

With a rally of over 10 per cent, Zee Entertainment emerged as the biggest gainer in the Nifty 50 pack. The scrip hogged limelight after reports said 14.52 crore shares of the company changed hands in a block deal on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Larsen & Toubro, IndusInd Bank, HCL Technologies and Adani Ports were also up between 0.80 per cent and 1.50 per cent. On the other hand, Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel, BPCL, Cipla and Britannia were down over 0.80 per cent.

On the other hand, Capital Goods, IT and TECH on the exchange were up between 0.15 per cent and 0.70 per cent.

Data available with NSE suggested that Net-net, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were buyers in the capital market to the tune of Rs 566.52 crore on Wednesday. DIIs were also net buyers to the tune of Rs 183.41 crore, data suggests.

Rajesh Palviya, head-technical and derivatives at Axis Securities said, “The chart pattern suggests that if Nifty crosses and sustains above 12,010 levels it would witness buying which would lead the index towards 12,040-12,100 levels. However, if index breaks below 11,980 levels it would witness selling which would take the index towards 11,950-11,930.” 

Crude oil prices surged more than 2 per cent on Wednesday after a better-than-expected US crude inventories report and as Russia said it would continue its cooperation with OPEC to keep the global oil market balanced.

The US markets ended lower on Wednesday amid reports that so-called phase one trade deal between China and the US may not be completed by the end of 2019. Other Asian peers were also trading in the red as a fresh row between Washington and Beijing over US bills on Hong Kong could complicate their trade negotiation and delay phase one deal that investors had initially hoped to be inked by now.

129,2019-11-22,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI | KOLKATA: Telecom tower companies are exploring changes to their master service and rental agreements with Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to ease the financial pressure on the operators, especially after the Supreme Court ruling on dues based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR).

The tower companies could consider payment holidays for the two telcos for the first three-to-six months on new sites or do away with the lock-in period for new tenancies, industry officials said.

The government approved a two-year moratorium on payment for spectrum won in auctions, giving immediate relief of Rs 42,000 crore to Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm. However, the lack of relief on Rs 89,000 crore of AGR dues for Airtel and Vodafone Idea in the government’s decisions on Wednesday was a big setback, they said.

“Due to M&As in the sector and no relief on AGR, the impact on tower companies persists,” said TR Dua, director general of the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA). “Once the issue surrounding the AGR is clear, we may have further discussions with the operators to revisit the existing contracts, if required.”

A senior official in one of the telcos said that if one operator shuts down, the impact on a tower company’s revenue would be about Rs 10,000 crore annually.

“With the relief package as announced by the finance minister based on the Cabinet approval, the cash flow of operators may improve. However, without any relief on AGR payments, there will certainly be some impact on the tower companies and further investments in infrastructure,” said Dua.

TAIPA represents India’s major tower companies including Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel and American Tower Corp., which count loss-making Vodafone Idea and Airtel as their main clients. Bharti Infratel is owned by Bharti Airtel. Indus Towers is a joint venture between entities of Bharti Group and Vodafone Idea.

Some of the master service agreements (MSA) between tower companies and telcos, which include rentals and exit clauses and are typically valid for 5-10 years, may be reviewed and renegotiated if Vodafone Idea and Airtel don’t get any substantial relief on their AGR dues.

“The chances of any potential reviews happening would be stronger for existing MSAs close to expiry as opposed to those having significant remainder validity periods,” said a senior tower industry executive.

ATC, Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Indus Towers did not respond to ET’s queries, while Bharti Infratel declined to comment.

Some experts said that although Airtel and Vodafone Idea will not reduce their expenses for 4G expansion, payment terms between telcos and tower companies can be revisited.

Each new tenancy typically “comes with a five-year lock-in, as in entailing committed payment. That can be waived or reduced in desperate times,” said Syed Safawi, a telecom sector veteran and ex-CEO of Viom Networks.

Bharti Infratel shares gained 0.3% to Rs 241.80 at the close on the BSE on Thursday, a day after the government cleared the moratorium on spectrum payments. The company’s stock has fallen almost 7% year to date."

The new derivatives series kicked off on a negative note on Friday, as Nifty saw selling pressure due to unfavourable cues from Asian bourses. The benchmark indices started correcting from initial trades and continued to make lower lows in the first half of the session.

However, due to some bounce in the later half, Nifty ended the session a tad above 12,050 and formed a Red body candle on the daily chart.

The index concluded the week with gain of 1.19 per cent and formed a green body candle on weekly chart.

A positive momentum after the formation of three consecutive Doji candles on weekly chart is a positive sign for the market. Thus, till the time Nifty holds above 11980–12000, we maintain our positive stance on the market for an upmove towards 12,250.

On the December monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest was at 12,000 followed by 11,500 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,500 followed by 12,600 strike. Call writing was at 12,100 and 12,300 strike, while marginal Put writing was seen at 11,800 strike. Option data suggests a shift in trading range between 11,900 and 12,300 levels.

India VIX eased 0.66 per cent to 13.89. Till VIX remains below 15 zone, then we may see continuation in the ongoing optimism in coming days.

Bank Nifty started the session on a negative note and corrected in the first half of the session. However, some buying interest was witnessed in the later half and it formed a small red body candle on the daily chart.

Nifty opened on a positive note on Monday on the back of a decent gapup opening in index components like Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel. But, the bulls failed to capitalise on the positive opening and some profit booking emerged, forcing the indices to give up the early gains.

The index remained under pressure throughout the session and trimmed all the intraday gains. Eventually, Nifty concluded the session with a negligible loss and formed a Red Body Candle on the daily chart. However, it continued to sustain well above the breakout level of the Bullish Pennant Pattern on the daily chart. We maintain our positive stance on Nifty for an up-ward move towards 12,250 level. On the flipside, the immediate support is placed in the 12,000 – 11,980 zone.

In December monthly options, maximum Put open interest was at 12,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,500 followed by 12,000 levels. There was Marginal Call writing at strike prices 12,100 and 12,400 while Put writing was seen at 12,000 followed by 12,100 levels. Options data suggested a shift in trading range between 11,900 and 12,300 levels.

India VIX moved up 2.18 per cent to 14.20 level. As long as VIX remains below 15 mark, we may see continuation of the ongoing optimism in the coming days.

Bank Nifty corrected in the first half of the session, but it once again took support around its previous swing highs and rebounded piercingly in the latter half. Eventually, the banking index ended with a loss of 0.23 per cent and formed a Small Red Body candle on the daily scale. Despite the corrective move of last two sessions, the overall trend remained positive and, thus, traders shall use the intraday dips as a buying opportunity.

Until it sustains above the 31,783- 31,660 zone, an up-move towards 32,500 and 32,800 levels cannot be ruled out.

Nifty futures closed flattish at 12,091 level. There was long buildup in Idea, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Escorts, Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel while shorts were seen in YES Bank, Just Dial, BHEL, Sun TV and Equitas.

Nifty50 started Tuesday’s session with marginal gains, but it slipped into the negative territory in no time. Once again, we witnessed selling pressure from the very start. While some buying interest in the later half of the day helped the index pare losses and conclude the session a tad below 12,000 mark.

The index made a lower high for the third consecutive session and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. On the hourly chart, a Head & Shoulder pattern breakdown emerged. However, it hovered around the lower end of a Rising Channel. Momentum oscillator RSI indicated a negative divergence on the daily chart.

It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale, as selling pressure emerged at higher levels. The index remained in consolidation mode in the latter half of the session.

Resistance levels are shifting lower gradually. As long as it holds below 31,900 level, the index could drift towards 31,400 and then 31,200 levels, while the immediate high of 32,157 would be a major hurdle in the coming few days.

NSE Nifty opened with a marginal gain, but started correcting from initial trades and continued to make lower lows as the session progressed. The index breached its crucial support of 11,950 and formed a big red body candle on the daily chart.

Dalal Street witnessed breakdown from Head and Shoulder pattern on the hourly chart, which doesn’t bode well for the bulls. On the weekly scale, Nifty formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern and a sustainable move below 11,888 may lead to a correction towards 11,800 and then 11,700. On the flipside, immediate hurdle is placed at 12,050 and 12,100 levels.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at 12,000 followed by 11,500 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,500 strike. We have seen Call writing at 12,000 followed by 12,100 strike while Put writing was seen at 11,500 followed by 11,800 strike. Option data suggests a shift in lower trading range between 11,700 and 12,100.

India VIX fell down by 4.62 per cent to 13.64 level.

In line with the broader market, Bank Nifty corrected sharply and continued to make lower lows throughout the session. The bank index formed a bearish candle on the daily chart. We witnessed a Dark Cloud Cover pattern on the weekly scale. In the week gone by, it failed to cross penultimate week’s high and breached its crucial support of 31,500 to confirm a Double Top pattern on the hourly chart. Now, till Bank Nifty remains below 31,500–31,600, we may see a corrective move towards its next support for Bank Nifty is at 31,000 and 30,800.

80,2019-12-06,Bharti Infratel,"NEW DELHI: A host of battered stocks have seen sharp rallies from their 52-week lows in recent weeks. Analysts said while some of these stocks have risen on prospects of high risk-reward, others have gained on value buying as investors judged the prevailing concerns as overdone.

Data compiled from corporate database Ace Equity showed 127 of BSE200 stocks have hit their one-year lows this quarter (October-December). Out of them, nearly half have climbed over 20 per cent, 35 have risen over 30 per cent and 16 stocks have rallied 50 per cent within a small timeframe. 

Shares of Vodafone Idea have zoomed 196.55 per cent from their 52-week low of Rs 2.6 hit on November 15. YES Bank has climbed 117 per cent over its 52-week low of Rs 29.10 (hit on October 1). Corporation Bank has rallied 90.44 per cent from its October 15 low. Stocks such as Reliance Power, Coffee Day Enterprises, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Edelweiss Financial Services have gained 87 per cent, 83 per cent, 73 per cent, 68 per cent and 66 per cent, respectively. 

Girish Pai of Nirmal Bang said that the situation has come to a place where it seems Vodafone Idea is going to survive for a few more years. This was against a bankruptcy-like situation earlier, he said. “That is what the stock price indicates,” he told ETNOW. 

Edelweiss Securities says YES Bank looks like a high risk-return potential candidate, as its base case shows the bank is here to stay, braving the known and unknown challenges and a temporary lull in earnings.

In the case of Indiabulls Housing, CLSA has revised its price target to Rs 450 from Rs 350 as the recent clarity in court case pertaining to the company's alleged irregularities in books would provide some relief to the company.

DLF, RBL Bank, UCO Bank, Bharti Infratel are other BSE200 stocks that have rallied 40-65 per cent from their respective 52-week lows. 

In a study, Elara Capital found that only three of the top 10 good performing Nifty stocks of last one month have been consistent performers on a three-month, six-month and year-to-date basis.

The median beta of top 10 performers of 2019 has increased from 1.03 to 1.41, suggesting that the market is shifting toward 'value' and ‘high-beta’ stocks.

Elara Capital says it is a sign of the market broadening from the narrow set of ‘high quality’ performers. It expects the trend to continue among Nifty50 stocks and more broadly across the broader market.

“After hanging on to quality for several months, year-to-date trends have started accommodating turnaround performers. However, the trend over the past month shows that the market is moving toward companies with lower sales growth, higher capital intensity and higher leverage, primarily due to the presence of metals (JSW Steel & Tata Steel) and telecom (Bharti Airtel & Bharti Infratel) among top 10 performers,” it said."

69,2019-12-06,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel’s plans to raise $2 billion (Rs 14,200 crore) via an equity issue as part of a larger $4 billion fund-raising move will strengthen its balance sheet ahead of the January-end deadline to pay its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, but lead to an equity dilution of about 6 per cent for promoters, analysts said.

“Assuming $2 billion is treated as upfront equity, the fund-raise would, at current prices, equate to a dilution of ~6 per cent for now,” said a report by Citi Research.

It highlighted that while promoters are not permitted to participate in a qualified institutional placement of shares, they may still maintain their shareholding level through a private placement. The telco had raised Rs 25,000 crore earlier this year via a rights issue .

Bharti Airtel’s application for permission to increase its foreign shareholding limit to 100 per cent is still pending with the government. Singtel directly and indirectly through Bharti Telecom owns over 35 per cent in Bharti Airtel, while the Mittal family’s effective shareholding is at around 27 per cent.

The brokerage added the new infusion will strengthen balance sheet for future investments in network capacity and spectrum, and position the telco to capture market share from weaker incumbents. However, the report cautions that Airtel’s fund-raising “reflects the uncertainty on monetisation of its Infratel stake”.

Today, the company with 280 million subscribers has 55 per cent stake in Airtel Africa and 53.5 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel which are worth $2.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, based on current market prices.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea’s stocks ended nearly 3 per cent and 6 per cent lower, at Rs 447.20 and Rs 7.31, respectively, on the BSE Thursday, on fears of continuing competitive intensity after Reliance Jio priced its new rates about 25 per cent lower than its rivals.

The AGR dues are a result of a Supreme Court verdict that forced both Airtel and Vodafone Idea to declare that without any relief they doubt their ability to continue as going concerns. Both the telcos are expected to pay at least Rs 89,000 crore to the government by January end.

“The above fund-raising is primarily to take care of the worst outcome, wherein the Supreme Court turns down this request, causing the entire adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of $4.2 billion for Airtel to become payable before January 24, 2020,” said brokerage firm Morgan Stanley in its report.

Brokerage firm Credit Suisse has chalked out the reduction in the telco’s leverage (net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda) from AGR verdict to its status after fund-raise.

“Bharti Airtel’s leverage (net debt to Ebitda) increased to 4.3x as of September 2019 (annualised Ebitda) post inclusion of AGR liabilities. However, with the expected market repair (from announced price hikes and potential price hikes in future), we expect leverage to come to 3.2x by FY21E and 2.7x by FY22E,” said Credit Suisse. It added that the $2 billion equity issuance is likely to help the leverage come down to 2.9x by FY21E and 2.4x by FY22E.

90,2019-12-09,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Bharti Airtel is confident it can grab 35% revenue market share (RMS), up from 32% at present, said analysts, and would stand to make stronger gains at Vodafone Idea’s cost in case there is no relief from the government or court on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues.

Brokerage Goldman Sachs, which hosted Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal as part of its CIO tour, said the top executive expects average revenue per user (ARPU), a key operational parameter, to reach the Rs. 200 levels — a level it recorded before Reliance Jio Infocomm’s entry in 2016 — in the next few quarters. Airtel expects ARPU to reach close to even Rs. 300 over time. At end of July-September, the operator with 280 million subscribers clocked ARPU of Rs. 128.

“Return on capital in Indian telecom remains low and as per the company, ARPUs need to go up for it to improve. Bharti believes this is true even for competition,” Goldman Sachs said in a recent report. “It believes it can get to 35% or more RMS over time, from about 32% at present.”

But the bigger overhang is the AGR dues that telcos are liable to pay after the Supreme Court widened the definition of AGR to include non-core items. Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the worst hit by the order, have filed separate review petitions.

According to Goldman Sachs, Airtel, which has to pay over Rs. 35,500 crore of statutory dues, is hoping for some relief, including waivers on the amount or moratorium/deferment of payment.



The telcos need to pay their dues by end of January. Analysts noted that in the case there is no relief, Vodafone Idea, staring at dues of over Rs. 53,000 crore, is worse off than Airtel.

“Liabilities are large, at $4.8 billion for Airtel and $5 billion for Vodafone Idea, and if the Supreme Court were to dismiss the review petition, causing the entire liabilities to devolve, it would be a negative development for Airtel but even more serious for Vodafone Idea, which may find it difficult to fund these liabilities before January 24, 2020,” said a Morgan Stanley report. “This could potentially lead to further market share consolidation in the industry, strengthening Airtel’s positioning.”

Goldman Sachs said that in the event of reallocation in the industry, Bharti Airtel believes it is well positioned to capture 50% or more of the incremental market share; per company, incremental revenue can come at a very high Ebitda margin. “The company sees low possibility of a new player entering Indian telecom,” the house added.

Vodafone Idea on Friday warned that without any other form of relief, the third-largest telco would have to shut shop. “ If we don’t get relief, it could be the end of the story for us. There is no company that could get that kind of money in three months,” said Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, calling AGR the “big elephant” (in the room) that needed to be addressed urgently.

To improve their financials, all three telcos raised tariffs by 40% or more recently, with Vodafone Idea being the most aggressive. Despite that, the telco is worse off than its rivals, say analysts.

“Despite higher-than-expected tariff hikes, Vodafone Idea’s key challenge is market share loss,” said a CLSA report. “In fact, Vodafone Idea’s market share loss in the first half of FY20, at 5%, had accelerated (to 27%) and was against a 5% loss in FY19. Given Vodafone Idea’s lag in 4G networks versus peers, share loss will likely continue.”

Airtel expects the price hikes to push industry revenue over $50 billion, from $30 billion at present, but didn’t mention a timeline, Goldman Sachs said.

Airtel recently announced plans of raising up to $4 billion capital for AGR payments, but believes that its debt, “although elevated,” is under control. Mittal, at the Goldman Sachs event, also said the merger between tower majors Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel should be completed by end of December."

105,2019-12-11,Bharti Infratel,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Vodafone Idea is said to be in talks to sell its optic fibre business to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and its data centre to the Edelweiss Group as the telco seeks to raise over $2.5 billion from asset sales ahead of a January deadline to pay statutory dues.

“The company is in talks with global asset manager Brookfield to sell its 156,000 km of optic fibre assets and Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are the bankers helping Vodafone negotiate with potential buyers,” a person privy to the discussions told ET. There are other few players, who are also in talks.

For its data centre located in Navi Mumbai, the company is said to be negotiating with the Edelweiss Group, a diversified financial services company.

“Edelweiss may own such assets through one of its alternative investment funds – Edelweiss Yield Plus Fund,” a person aware of the discussions between the two sides told ET.

“Negotiations for the optic fibre network and data centre are currently under way,” said a senior banker familiar with the plans.

Brookfield and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the matter. Bank of America, Edelweiss and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.

The fibre network business is valued at $1.5 billion-$2 billion, while the data centre should fetch $60 million to $100 million, bankers told ET.

Vodafone Idea is staring at paying up over Rs 53,000 crore ($7.5 billion) after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for telcos to include revenue from non-core activities. The telcos have sought a review of the October 24 order, which stated that the dues should be cleared within three months.

“What the company receives from the sale of assets will determine the balance that it may need to raise from the capital markets to pay off the AGR dues and capex needs,” said a person with knowledge of the company’s plans.

Bankers said it would be a challenge to sell the company’s optic fibre assets considering that the sector is burdened with over Rs 7 lakh crore of debt.

“We agree valuation would be a challenge. Given the state of the telecom industry, this isn’t the best time to sell the fibre and this will impact valuation. However, efforts are being made to assess how much money it could fetch,” said an executive involved in the matter.

Vodafone Idea has appointed bankers to assess the incremental funds needed to meet the AGR dues and its capital expenditure plans.

“Separate bankers are working out the quantum for which the company would need to hit the capital markets taking the sale proceeds into account,” a senior company executive told ET, adding that presentations on fund-raising avenues were being made.

Vodafone Idea also plans to monetise it 11.5% stake in the tower entity to be formed through the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, valued at $500 million-$700 million. The deadline for completion of the proposed merger was extended by 60 days to December 24 after it failed to get government approvals on time.

Last week, the government warned all telecom licence holders against delaying payment of AGR-related dues and asked them to clear their doubts by December 13, ET reported in its December 10 edition.

Vodafone Idea reported a record loss of Rs 50,921 crore in the quarter ended September after providing for payment of AGR dues."

124,2019-12-11,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Vodafone Idea is said to be in talks to sell its optic fibre business to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and its data centre to the Edelweiss Group as the telco seeks to raise over $2.5 billion from asset sales ahead of a January deadline to pay statutory dues.

In a clarification to the stock exchange on Wednesday, Vodafone Idea however denied that it was in talks with the two companies.

""The fact that the Company intends to monetize its optic fibre business and data centre was disclosed in the quarterly report sent to the Stock Exchanges on 14 November 2019. We deny that any such negotiations are taking place with Brookfields or Edelweiss,"" the company said.

The stock exchanges had sought a clarification from the carrier whose stock surged nearly 8% intraday, before closing 2% higher at Rs6.69 on the BSE Wednesday.
Vodafone Idea didn't answer ET's detailed queries sent on Tuesday. 

A person directly involved told ET that the telco ""is in talks with global asset manager Brookfield to sell its 156,000 km of optic fibre assets and Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are the bankers helping Vodafone negotiate with potential buyers”. There are a few others players, who are also in talks as well.

For its data centre located in Navi Mumbai, the company is said to be negotiating with the Edelweiss Group, a diversified financial services company, another person said.

“Edelweiss may own such assets through one of its alternative investment funds – Edelweiss Yield Plus Fund,” a person aware of the discussions between the two sides told ET.

“Negotiations for the optic fibre network and data centre are currently under way,” said a senior banker familiar with the plans.

Brookfield and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the matter. Bank of America and Edelweiss did not respond to ET’s queries.

The fibre network business is valued at $1.5 billion-$2 billion, while the data centre should fetch $60 million to $100 million, bankers told ET.

Vodafone Idea is staring at paying up over Rs 53,000 crore ($7.5 billion) after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for telcos to include revenue from non-core activities. The telcos have sought a review of the October 24 order, which stated that the dues should be cleared within three months.

“What the company receives from the sale of assets will determine the balance that it may need to raise from the capital markets to pay off the AGR dues and capex needs,” said a person with knowledge of the company’s plans.

Bankers said it would be a challenge to sell the company’s optic fibre assets considering that the sector is burdened with over Rs 7 lakh crore of debt.

“We agree valuation would be a challenge. Given the state of the telecom industry, this isn’t the best time to sell the fibre and this will impact valuation. However, efforts are being made to assess how much money it could fetch,” said an executive involved in the matter.

Vodafone Idea has appointed bankers to assess the incremental funds needed to meet the AGR dues and its capital expenditure plans.

“Separate bankers are working out the quantum for which the company would need to hit the capital markets taking the sale proceeds into account,” a senior company executive told ET, adding that presentations on fund-raising avenues were being made.

Vodafone Idea also plans to monetise it 11.5% stake in the tower entity to be formed through the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, valued at $500 million-$700 million. The deadline for completion of the proposed merger was extended by 60 days to December 24 after it failed to get government approvals on time.

Last week, the government warned all telecom licence holders against delaying payment of AGR-related dues and asked them to clear their doubts by December 13, ET reported in its December 10 edition.

Vodafone Idea reported a record loss of Rs 50,921 crore in the quarter ended September after providing for payment of AGR dues."

132,2019-12-12,Bharti Infratel,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, did brisk shopping in November, buying select pharma, largecap and midcap IT stocks, besides a few PSUs, FMCG and metal & mining stocks.

Nifty advanced 1.50 per cent during the month.

The fund house also offloaded shares of some of the performing stocks in the largecap space, including ICICI Bank (2.50 crore shares) and Reliance Industries (43.79 lakh) as they hovered around record high levels. The fund sold nearly 25 lakh shares each TCS and SBI and 5 lakh shares in ONGC during the month.

The AMC bought 40 lakh to 1.50 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC, government-owned GAIL India and Coal India and drug major Sun Pharmaceuticals.

Sun Pharma turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore against a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore reported for the same period last financial year.

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other major buys in November included Aurobindo Pharma, REC, NTPC, NHPC, Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel, Lupin, Tata Steel, PNC Infratech, Neyveli Lignite, Infosys and Adani Ports, Delta Corp, Rites, Indian Hotel, J Kumar Infraproject and Persistent Systems, among others.

The fund house added 10 to 42 lakh additional shares of these companies during the month.


Watch | Smallcaps don't necessarily grow faster: Prashant Jain


In his recent interaction with ETMarkets.com, Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC AMC, said the entire market is reasonably valued, except for the consumer pack, which is trading above their long-term averages.

“Profit growth is recovering and the interest rate is low, which are good for valuations. The government has taken some good steps by cutting corporate tax rates, which would drive profit growth and encourage the manufacturing supply chain to be set up in India,” Jain said.

He also though the strategic divestment route for offloading government stake is very positive for PSUs, and this would encourage foreign inflows and lift valuations of public sector companies,” he said.

The fund house also added shares of several IT players during the month, including Tech Mahindra (4.19 lakh shares), Firstsource Solution (3.87 lakh shares), eClerx (0.64 lakh shares), L&T Technology (0.50 lakh shares), HCL Technologies (3,040 shares) and Newgen Software Tech (6,200 shares).

Elsewhere, it bought InterGlobe Aviation (4.84 lakh shares), Mishra Dhatu Nigam (8.15 lakh shares), JSPL (6.53 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (7 lakh shares), Power Grid (6.12 lakh shares), Tata Global Beverages (3.75 lakh shares), Bajaj Electronics (7 lakh shares) and LIC Housing Finance (2.95 lakh shares).

Other largecaps and midcaps HDFC AMC accumulated during the month included JMC Projects (34,600 shares) and Dr Reddy’s Labs (32,102 shares). YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and M&M Financial Services drew interest of the AMC in the financial space.

Last week, there were reports that the AMC was keen on participating in the capital infusion of YES Bank.

“Any business with reasonable quality, a sustainable business model and fair value or below-fair value is a reasonable investment. Smallcaps and midcaps vastly outperformed the largecaps for four years since 2014. That outperformance led to higher valuations. The correction seen in last two years, those excessive valuations have gone. Going forward, as valuations converge, we are not going to see a significant difference in the performance of largecaps, midcaps and smallcaps,” Jain said.

In the broader market, the BSE500 index gained 1.17 per cent last month, while BSE Midcap index rose 1.48 per cent and the Smallcap index 0.02 per cent, suggesting a widening of the market momentum, which had moved only a couple of largecaps till the previous month.

On the sell side, HDFC AMC sold over 5 lakh shares each in BPCL, HPCL, Federal Bank, Punjab National Bank, Voltas, McLeod Russel, Avenue Supermarts, Adani Power, ICICI Prudential, Repco Home and Tata Power, during the month.

It completely exited Ashok Leyland, Biocon, Info Edge, Ircon International, Lemon Tree and SAIL.

138,2019-12-16,Bharti Infratel,"MUMBAI: Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, the Canadian asset management company, will invest Rs 25,215 crore ($3.55 billion) in the telecom tower assets of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries in a deal that will help strengthen the balance sheet of Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Reliance Industrial Investments & Holdings Ltd., a wholly owned unit of Reliance Industries, has entered into binding agreements with Brookfield Infrastructure and its institutional partners, which will invest the amount in units to be issued by the Tower Infrastructure Trust, the Indian oil-to-retail conglomerate said in a notice to the stock exchanges on Monday.

“Closing of the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals, which are expected shortly,” Reliance added.

Reliance said that after the transaction is completed, the Trust will own 100% of the equity share capital of Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd. (RJIPL), the unit that houses the telecom tower assets.

The Trust currently owns 51% of RJIPL, while Reliance Industries holds the remaining 49%. On receiving the funds from Brookfield, the Trust will buy Reliance’s 49% stake, repay Rs 12,000 crore to Jio and clear other financial liabilities of RJIPL. Jio will then transfer Rs 12,000 crore to Reliance against certain financial liabilities owed to the parent company.



On completion of the proposed deal, RJIPL would have debt of Rs 16,000 crore.

“We are pleased to enter into this long and strategic relationship with Brookfield, which is one of the largest and most respected managers of infrastructure assets globally,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries. “This transaction demonstrates the belief of global investors in the potential of India’s digital opportunity.”

RJIPL owns about 130,000 communication towers that form the backbone of Jio’s network and plans to take the total to 175,000, Reliance said. That would top the 163,000 towers owned by rivals Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers together.

Jio had signed up to be the anchor tenant of RJIPL’s towers for 30 years. Like Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea hived off their tower assets to attract investment and ease debt.

The three telcos are trying to strengthen their balance sheets by reducing debt amid a continuing need to invest in 4G networks, besides preparing for the upcoming spectrum auction where 5G airwaves will be up for sale for the first time.

This will be Brookfield’s second investment this year in a venture controlled by Mukesh Ambani. In March, it agreed to buy the lossmaking East-West Pipeline, earlier known as Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure, at an enterprise valuation of Rs 13,000 crore.

Reliance shares fell 1% to Rs 1,566.55 at the close on the BSE."

“Using the current list of constituents, we expect MSCI India’s weight to rise by about 70 bps (basis points) in the semi-annual index review of May 2020, implying passive flows of US $2.5 bn (billion),” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said MSCI India’s weightage in MSCI EM will go up to 9.6 per cent from 8.9 per cent.

Companies have until March 31, 2020, to reduce the FPI limit through an approval of the board of directors and a special resolution passed by shareholders. Such companies will retain the option to increase the FPI limit to a maximum of the foreign sector limit at a later date.

“Once the FPI limit increases, it cannot be reduced. Thus, unless companies pass board and shareholder resolutions, all companies in India will irreversibly have their FPI limit at the sector limit after 31st March 2020,” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said India’s free float market capitalisation rank has been lower compared to its market cap and GDP rank because of high promoter holdings and low foreign investment limits which has constrained active and passive allocations to India from abroad.

Larsen & Toubro, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, Britannia, Tata Steel, Bharti Infratel, Titan, Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra and Divi's Laboratories are among the stocks that are likely to see the most increase in weightage given the subsuming of foreign limits.

Among the public sector stocks in the MSCI India index, NTPC, Power Grid, HPCL, Petronet LNG, Container Corporation and REC could see an increase in weight.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Holdings, United Breweries, Power Finance Corporation, Biocon, Indraprastha Gas, ACC and MRF are the large-cap stocks in the BSE 200 index that could be included from the subsuming of the foreign limits."

156,2019-12-21,Bharti Infratel,"ET Intelligence Group: Sustainable and socially responsible investment is gradually moving into the mainstream, thanks to increasing awareness among companies. The rising clout of fund managers who focus on sustainable investment based on environment, social responsibility and governance (ESG) parameters have acted as a trigger for such investments.

A case in point is a fund manager at one of the largest ESG funds in India who included Hindustan Unilever in his portfolio after learning that it had started producing detergent bars that require less water while rinsing clothes, amid reports of a water crisis in Chennai. ESG-based investing is still in its infancy in India, with just two ESG funds having cumulative assets under management worth under $ 500 million, compared with the global ESG fund size of $30.7 trillion.

The performance of certain stocks show that investors, too, are conscious of their ESG responsibilities. For instance, Coal India has underperformed the benchmark index for the last five years despite growing coal volume and consistent dividend payments.

Consumption stocks are not an exception either. “The widening valuation gap between Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC shows that the former is rewarded for efforts to reduce the carbon footprint,” said a domestic fund manager. After trading at similar valuations five years ago, HUL now commands a 40% premium over ITC.

“Investors interest in companies related to fossil fuels is bound to wane in the long term considering the risk to company valuations,” said Abhay Laijwala, an ESG fund manager at Avendus India.

The risk of funds moving towards cleaner fuels from carbon-intensive fuels may affect the performance of Indian equities, as the weight of energy stocks is over 12% in the benchmark indices.

Also, the company with the largest market capitalisation, Reliance Industries (RIL), has fossil fuel exposure. It has been consistently working on sustainability measures. It has a zero water discharge refinery and uses only desalinated sea water. RIL also has a facility to convert PET water bottles to polyester thread. In FY19, RIL recycled about 2 billion PET bottles.

Similarly, India's largest power producer NTPC has put up its first ultra-supercritical unit in Madhya Pradesh which will consume less coal, thereby lowering emissions.

Investors should, however, not shun fossil fuel and thermal power producers as they are a pivotal part of the existing ecosystem, said Chirag Mehta, the ESG fund manager of Quantum AMC. “The key thing to watch for these companies is their vision and delivery to reduce carbon footprint. If they show intent to cut it, there is no harm in holding them,” he said. Indian cement companies are more efficient than global peers. Shree Cement, for instance, uses only 72 litres of water to produce a tonne of cement, compared with the global average of 300 litres per tonne.

Companies including Mahindra & Mahindra, Havells India, Bharti Infratel, and Ashok Leyland have set up captive solar power projects to reduce carbon footprint. Given the rising awareness about sustainable growth, India Inc is well poised to meet the challenges of a cleaner environment."

164,2019-12-27,Bharti Infratel,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 26.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Reliance Securities has retained hold rating on 
Maruti Suzuki India with a target price of Rs 7,250. The company's BS-VI products would be at most competitive pricing with better technology, said Reliance Securities. Industry demand situation may improve steadily in FY21, while it would bounce back in H2 FY21, said Reliance Securities. BS-VI products would help company to gain further market share in FY21, the brokerage said. The stock ended down 1.2 per cent at Rs 7,240.75 on Thursday.

• Antique Stock Broking has maintained hold rating on 
JSW Steel with a target price of Rs 277. JSW Steel is likely to witness flat steel spreads sequentially in third quarter of FY20 as the decline in steel prices in October 2019 and reset of half yearly automotive contracts at lower levels would impact the quarter, said Antique. Recovery in domestic steel demand in Q4 would enable further price hikes with current domestic steel prices at a discount to landed import parity Chinese prices, said Antique. The stock ended up 1 per cent at Rs 269.30 on Thursday.


• Ambit Capital has initiated coverage on 
Thermax with a buy rating and target price of Rs 1,211. Thermax is no longer a play on domestic private capex cycle with international business now contributing 45 per cent to overall consolidated revenue, said Ambit. Profitability of international subsidiaries is expected to improve as restructuring is nearing completion, the brokerage said. Moderating competitive intensity in big ticket orders and shift in mix towards specialty chemicals would aid margin expansion, said Ambit. The stock ended up 0.35 per cent at Rs 1,054.60 on Thursday.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained reduce rating on 
Bharti Infratel with a fair value of Rs 275. Long stop date pertaining to Bharti Infratel-Indus merger got extended further to February 24, 2020 on account of pending regulatory approvals. Bharti Infratel's near-term growth prognosis remains weak, it said. Higher working capital driven by increasing receivables is an additional pressure point on cash flows, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.2 per cent at Rs 255.80 on Thursday.

• Reliance Securities has maintained buy rating on 
JK Lakshmi Cement with a target price of Rs 465. The company is likely to witness healthy traction ahead mainly on account of new commissioned grinding unit in Odisha, cost synergies and steady pricing environment in Northern markets, it said. With no meaningful capex hereon, the brokerage expects JK Lakshmi cement to generate free cash flow worth Rs 1,000 crore in FY20-FY21. The stock ended flat at Rs 273.60 on Thursday."
